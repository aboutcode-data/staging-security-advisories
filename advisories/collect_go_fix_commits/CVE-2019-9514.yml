  Update golang.org/x/net to v0.0.0-20190813141303-74dc4d7220e7 to import
  the following security fix.

      http2: limit number of control frames in server send queue

      An attacker could cause servers to queue an unlimited number of PING
      ACKs or RST_STREAM frames by soliciting them and not reading them, until
      the program runs out of memory.

      Limit control frames in the queue to a few thousands (matching the limit
      imposed by other vendors) by counting as they enter and exit the scheduler,
      so the protection will work with any WriteScheduler.

      Once the limit is exceeded, close the connection, as we have no way to
      communicate with the peer.
