  5ce8cd16f3859ec5ac4106ad8ec15d6236f4501b:encoding/pem: make Decode complexity linear

  Because Decode scanned the input first for the first BEGIN line, and
  then the first END line, the complexity of Decode is quadratic. If the
  input contained a large number of BEGINs and then a single END right at
  the end of the input, we would find the first BEGIN, and then scan the
  entire input for the END, and fail to parse the block, so move onto the
  next BEGIN, scan the entire input for the END, etc.

  Instead, look for the first END in the input, and then the first BEGIN
  that precedes the found END. We then process the bytes between the BEGIN
  and END, and move onto the bytes after the END for further processing.
  This gives us linear complexity.

  Fixes CVE-2025-61723
  Fixes #75676
