  4d014e723165f28b34458edb4aa9136e0fb4c702:encoding/xml: handle leading, trailing, or double colons in names

  Before this change, <:name> would parse as <name>, which could cause
  issues in applications that rely on the parse-encode cycle to
  round-trip. Similarly, <x name:=""> would parse as expected but then
  have the attribute dropped when serializing because its name was empty.
  Finally, <a:b:c> would parse and get serialized incorrectly. All these
  values are invalid XML, but to minimize the impact of this change, we
  parse them whole into Name.Local.

  This issue was reported by Juho Nurminen of Mattermost as it leads to
  round-trip mismatches. See #43168. It's not being fixed in a security
  release because round-trip stability is not a currently supported
  security property of encoding/xml, and we don't believe these fixes
  would be sufficient to reliably guarantee it in the future.
