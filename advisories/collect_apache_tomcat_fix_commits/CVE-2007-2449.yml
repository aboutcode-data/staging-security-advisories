  bb8f8ab3b2c9fba6f0b27938c7b2951bddbeee37:Fix XSS issues in snoop.jsp. This is CVE-2007-2449. Some of these are harder (impossible?) to exploit than others but doing all of them means there won't be another XSS issue to patch later.
  I also made a similar change for a couple of other JSPs that are in the harder/impossible? to exploit category.
