  - CVE-2020-25218
summary: Grandstream Networks' GRP261x VoIP phone running firmware version 1.0.3.6 (Base) is
  susceptible to an authentication bypass vulnerability in its administrative web interface.
  When combined with CVE-2020-25217, unauthenticated remote code execution as the privileged
  user `root` is possible. We suspect that this was introduced prior to firmware version 1.0.3.6,
  but it was not verified.
