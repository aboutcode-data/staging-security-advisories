  - CVE-2024-38289
summary: Mandiant identified a Boolean-based SQL injection vulnerability in the RHUB TurboMeeting
  web application versions 8.0.4 and earlier. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to
  execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server, potentially allowing them to access
  sensitive data or compromise the server. Exploitation of this vulnerability, along with the
  “Insecure Password Reset Mechanism” and “Command Injection in Certificate Signing Request”
  vulnerabilities, allowed Mandiant to authenticate to the web application as the “admin” user
  and obtain remote command execution as “root”.
