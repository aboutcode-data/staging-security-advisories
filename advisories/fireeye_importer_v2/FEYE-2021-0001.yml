  - CVE-2020-25217
summary: Grandstream Networks' GRP261x VoIP phone running firmware version 1.0.3.6 (Base) is
  susceptible to authenticated command injection as the privileged user `root` in its administrative
  web interface. When combined with CVE-2020-25218, unauthenticated remote code execution is
  possible. We suspect that this was introduced prior to firmware version 1.0.3.6, but it was
  not verified.
