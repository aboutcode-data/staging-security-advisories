  - CVE-2019-19118
  - GHSA-hvmf-r92r-27hr
summary: Django 2.1 before 2.1.15 and 2.2 before 2.2.8 allows unintended model editing. A Django
  model admin displaying inline related models, where the user has view-only permissions to
  a parent model but edit permissions to the inline model, would be presented with an editing
  UI, allowing POST requests, for updating the inline model. Directly editing the view-only
  parent model was not possible, but the parent model's save() method was called, triggering
  potential side effects, and causing pre and post-save signal handlers to be invoked. (To resolve
  this, the Django admin is adjusted to require edit permissions on the parent model in order
  for inline models to be editable.)
