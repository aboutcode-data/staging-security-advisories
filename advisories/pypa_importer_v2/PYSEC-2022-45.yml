  - CVE-2022-21694
  - GHSA-h29c-wcm8-883h
summary: OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share files,
  host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. The website mode of the onionshare
  allows to use a hardened CSP, which will block any scripts and external resources. It is not
  possible to configure this CSP for individual pages and therefore the security enhancement
  cannot be used for websites using javascript or external resources like fonts or images.
