  - CVE-2025-32444
summary: vLLM is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs.
  Versions starting from 0.6.5 and prior to 0.8.5, having vLLM integration with mooncake, are
  vulnerable to remote code execution due to using pickle based serialization over unsecured
  ZeroMQ sockets. The vulnerable sockets were set to listen on all network interfaces, increasing
  the likelihood that an attacker is able to reach the vulnerable ZeroMQ sockets to carry out
  an attack. vLLM instances that do not make use of the mooncake integration are not vulnerable.
  This issue has been patched in version 0.8.5.
