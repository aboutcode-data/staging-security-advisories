  - GHSA-q874-g24w-4q9g
summary: Jupyter Server provides the backend (i.e. the core services, APIs, and REST endpoints)
  for Jupyter web applications like Jupyter Notebook. Prior to version 1.17.1, if notebook server
  is started with a value of `root_dir` that contains the starting user's home directory, then
  the underlying REST API can be used to leak the access token assigned at start time by guessing/brute
  forcing the PID of the jupyter server. While this requires an authenticated user session,
  this URL can be used from a cross-site scripting payload or from a hooked or otherwise compromised
  browser to leak this access token to a malicious third party. This token can be used along
  with the REST API to interact with Jupyter services/notebooks such as modifying or overwriting
  critical files, such as .bashrc or .ssh/authorized_keys, allowing a malicious user to read
  potentially sensitive data and possibly gain control of the impacted system. This issue is
  patched in version 1.17.1.
