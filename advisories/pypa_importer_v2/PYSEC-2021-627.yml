aliases:
  - CVE-2021-41218
  - GHSA-9crf-c6qr-r273
summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the
  shape inference code for `AllToAll` can be made to execute a division by 0. This occurs whenever
  the `split_count` argument is 0. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also
  cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range.
