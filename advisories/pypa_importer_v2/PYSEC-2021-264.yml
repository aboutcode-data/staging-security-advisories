  - CVE-2021-37642
  - GHSA-ch4f-829c-v5pw
summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected
  versions the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.ResourceScatterDiv` is vulnerable to a division
  by 0 error. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/resource_variable_ops.cc#L865)
  uses a common class for all binary operations but fails to treat the division by 0 case separately.
  We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 4aacb30888638da75023e6601149415b39763d76. The fix
  will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1,
  TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported
  range.
