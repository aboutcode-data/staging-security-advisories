aliases:
  - CVE-2021-21419
  - GHSA-9p9m-jm8w-94p2
summary: Eventlet is a concurrent networking library for Python. A websocket peer may exhaust
  memory on Eventlet side by sending very large websocket frames. Malicious peer may exhaust
  memory on Eventlet side by sending highly compressed data frame. A patch in version 0.31.0
  restricts websocket frame to reasonable limits. As a workaround, restricting memory usage
  via OS limits would help against overall machine exhaustion, but there is no workaround to
  protect Eventlet process.
