aliases:
  - CVE-2020-11037
  - GHSA-jjjr-3jcw-f8v6
summary: In Wagtail before versions 2.7.2 and 2.8.2, a potential timing attack exists on pages
  or documents that have been protected with a shared password through Wagtail's "Privacy" controls.
  This password check is performed through a character-by-character string comparison, and so
  an attacker who is able to measure the time taken by this check to a high degree of accuracy
  could potentially use timing differences to gain knowledge of the password. This is understood
  to be feasible on a local network, but not on the public internet. Privacy settings that restrict
  access to pages/documents on a per-user or per-group basis (as opposed to a shared password)
  are unaffected by this vulnerability. This has been patched in 2.7.3, 2.8.2, 2.9.
