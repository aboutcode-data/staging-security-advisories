  - CVE-2021-3447
summary: A flaw was found in several ansible modules, where parameters containing credentials,
  such as secrets, were being logged in plain-text on managed nodes, as well as being made visible
  on the controller node when run in verbose mode. These parameters were not protected by the
  no_log feature. An attacker can take advantage of this information to steal those credentials,
  provided when they have access to the log files containing them. The highest threat from this
  vulnerability is to data confidentiality. This flaw affects Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform
  in versions before 1.2.2 and Ansible Tower in versions before 3.8.2.
