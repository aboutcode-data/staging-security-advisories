  - GHSA-xqfj-cr6q-pc8w
summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. Passing a complex
  argument to `tf.transpose` at the same time as passing `conjugate=True` argument results in
  a crash. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are
  also affected and still in supported range.
