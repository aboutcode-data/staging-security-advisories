  - CVE-2023-0591
summary: ubireader_extract_files is vulnerable to path traversal when run against specifically
  crafted UBIFS files, allowing the attacker to overwrite files outside of the extraction directory
  (provided the process has write access to that file or directory). This is due to the fact
  that a node name (dent_node.name) is considered trusted and joined to the extraction directory
  path during processing, then the node content is written to that joined path. By crafting
  a malicious UBIFS file with node names holding path traversal payloads (e.g. ../../tmp/outside.txt),
  it's possible to force ubi_reader to write outside of the extraction directory. This issue
  affects ubi-reader before 0.8.5.
