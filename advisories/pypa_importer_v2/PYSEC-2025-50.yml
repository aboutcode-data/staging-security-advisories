  - CVE-2025-48887
summary: vLLM, an inference and serving engine for large language models (LLMs), has a Regular
  Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability in the file `vllm/entrypoints/openai/tool_parsers/pythonic_tool_parser.py`
  of versions 0.6.4 up to but excluding 0.9.0. The root cause is the use of a highly complex
  and nested regular expression for tool call detection, which can be exploited by an attacker
  to cause severe performance degradation or make the service unavailable. The pattern contains
  multiple nested quantifiers, optional groups, and inner repetitions which make it vulnerable
  to catastrophic backtracking. Version 0.9.0 contains a patch for the issue.
