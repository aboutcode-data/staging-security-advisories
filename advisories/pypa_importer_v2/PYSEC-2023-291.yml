aliases:
  - CVE-2023-49297
  - GHSA-v5f6-hjmf-9mc5
summary: PyDrive2 is a wrapper library of google-api-python-client that simplifies many common
  Google Drive API V2 tasks. Unsafe YAML deserilization will result in arbitrary code execution.
  A maliciously crafted YAML file can cause arbitrary code execution if PyDrive2 is run in the
  same directory as it, or if it is loaded in via `LoadSettingsFile`. This is a deserilization
  attack that will affect any user who initializes GoogleAuth from this package while a malicious
  yaml file is present in the same directory. This vulnerability does not require the file to
  be directly loaded through the code, only present. This issue has been addressed in commit
  `c57355dc` which is included in release version `1.16.2`. Users are advised to upgrade. There
  are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
