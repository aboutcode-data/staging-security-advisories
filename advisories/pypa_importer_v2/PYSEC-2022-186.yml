aliases:
  - CVE-2021-38296
  - GHSA-9rr6-jpg7-9jg6
summary: Apache Spark supports end-to-end encryption of RPC connections via "spark.authenticate"
  and "spark.network.crypto.enabled". In versions 3.1.2 and earlier, it uses a bespoke mutual
  authentication protocol that allows for full encryption key recovery. After an initial interactive
  attack, this would allow someone to decrypt plaintext traffic offline. Note that this does
  not affect security mechanisms controlled by "spark.authenticate.enableSaslEncryption", "spark.io.encryption.enabled",
  "spark.ssl", "spark.ui.strictTransportSecurity". Update to Apache Spark 3.1.3 or later
