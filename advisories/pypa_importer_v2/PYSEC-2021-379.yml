  - CVE-2021-41132
  - GHSA-g67g-hvc3-xmvf
summary: OMERO.web provides a web based client and plugin infrastructure. In versions prior
  to 5.11.0, a variety of templates do not perform proper sanitization through HTML escaping.
  Due to the lack of sanitization and use of ``jQuery.html()``, there are a whole host of cross-site
  scripting possibilities with specially crafted input to a variety of fields. This issue is
  patched in version 5.11.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.
