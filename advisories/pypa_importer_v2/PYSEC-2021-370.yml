summary: Zope is an open-source web application server. Zope versions prior to versions 4.6.3
  and 5.3 have a remote code execution security issue. In order to be affected, one must use
  Python 3 for one's Zope deployment, run Zope 4 below version 4.6.3 or Zope 5 below version
  5.3, and have the optional `Products.PythonScripts` add-on package installed. By default,
  one must have the admin-level Zope "Manager" role to add or edit Script (Python) objects through
  the web. Only sites that allow untrusted users to add/edit these scripts through the web are
  at risk. Zope releases 4.6.3 and 5.3 are not vulnerable. As a workaround, a site administrator
  can restrict adding/editing Script (Python) objects through the web using the standard Zope
  user/role permission mechanisms. Untrusted users should not be assigned the Zope Manager role
  and adding/editing these scripts through the web should be restricted to trusted users only.
  This is the default configuration in Zope.
