  - CVE-2020-10594
  - GHSA-fpjm-rp2g-3r4c
summary: 'An issue was discovered in drf-jwt 1.15.x before 1.15.1. It allows attackers with
  access to a notionally invalidated token to obtain a new, working token via the refresh endpoint,
  because the blacklist protection mechanism is incompatible with the token-refresh feature.
  NOTE: drf-jwt is a fork of jpadilla/django-rest-framework-jwt, which is unmaintained.'
