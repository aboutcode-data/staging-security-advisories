  - CVE-2024-28179
summary: Jupyter Server Proxy allows users to run arbitrary external processes alongside their
  Jupyter notebook servers and provides authenticated web access. Prior to versions 3.2.3 and
  4.1.1, Jupyter Server Proxy did not check user authentication appropriately when proxying
  websockets, allowing unauthenticated access to anyone who had network access to the Jupyter
  server endpoint. This vulnerability can allow unauthenticated remote access to any websocket
  endpoint set up to be accessible via Jupyter Server Proxy. In many cases, this leads to remote
  unauthenticated arbitrary code execution, due to how affected instances use websockets. The
  websocket endpoints exposed by `jupyter_server` itself is not affected. Projects that do not
  rely on websockets are also not affected. Versions 3.2.3 and 4.1.1 contain a fix for this
  issue.
