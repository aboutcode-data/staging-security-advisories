  - GHSA-ph87-fvjr-v33w
summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker
  can cause a denial of service by exploiting a `CHECK`-failure coming from the implementation
  of `tf.raw_ops.RFFT`. Eigen code operating on an empty matrix can trigger on an assertion
  and will cause program termination. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will
  also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
  2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
