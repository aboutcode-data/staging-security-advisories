  - CVE-2020-15198
  - GHSA-jc87-6vpp-7ff3
summary: In Tensorflow before version 2.3.1, the `SparseCountSparseOutput` implementation does
  not validate that the input arguments form a valid sparse tensor. In particular, there is
  no validation that the `indices` tensor has the same shape as the `values` one. The values
  in these tensors are always accessed in parallel. Thus, a shape mismatch can result in accesses
  outside the bounds of heap allocated buffers. The issue is patched in commit 3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02
  and is released in TensorFlow version 2.3.1.
