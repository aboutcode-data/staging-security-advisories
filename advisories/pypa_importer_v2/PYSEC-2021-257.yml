aliases:
  - CVE-2021-37635
  - GHSA-cgfm-62j4-v4rf
summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected
  versions the implementation of sparse reduction operations in TensorFlow can trigger accesses
  outside of bounds of heap allocated data. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1bc56203f21a5a4995311825ffaba7a670d7747/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_reduce_op.cc#L217-L228)
  fails to validate that each reduction group does not overflow and that each corresponding
  index does not point to outside the bounds of the input tensor. We have patched the issue
  in GitHub commit 87158f43f05f2720a374f3e6d22a7aaa3a33f750. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow
  2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
