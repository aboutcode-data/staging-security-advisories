aliases:
  - CVE-2021-41226
  - GHSA-374m-jm66-3vj8
summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the
  implementation of `SparseBinCount` is vulnerable to a heap OOB access. This is because of
  missing validation between the elements of the `values` argument and the shape of the sparse
  output. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and
  still in supported range.
