  - CVE-2018-7753
  - GHSA-m9mq-p2f9-cfqv
summary: An issue was discovered in Bleach 2.1.x before 2.1.3. Attributes that have URI values
  weren't properly sanitized if the values contained character entities. Using character entities,
  it was possible to construct a URI value with a scheme that was not allowed that would slide
  through unsanitized.
