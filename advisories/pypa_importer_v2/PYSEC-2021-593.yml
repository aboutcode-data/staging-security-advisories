aliases:
  - CVE-2021-37680
  - GHSA-cfpj-3q4c-jhvr
summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected
  versions the implementation of fully connected layers in TFLite is [vulnerable to a division
  by zero error](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/lite/kernels/fully_connected.cc#L226).
  We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 718721986aa137691ee23f03638867151f74935f. The fix
  will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1,
  TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported
  range.
