  - GHSA-x7gm-rfgv-w973
summary: django-filter is a generic system for filtering Django QuerySets based on user selections.
  In django-filter before version 2.4.0, automatically generated `NumberFilter` instances, whose
  value was later converted to an integer, were subject to potential DoS from maliciously input
  using exponential format with sufficiently large exponents. Version 2.4.0+ applies a `MaxValueValidator`
  with a a default `limit_value` of 1e50 to the form field used by `NumberFilter` instances.
  In addition, `NumberFilter` implements the new `get_max_validator()` which should return a
  configured validator instance to customise the limit, or else `None` to disable the additional
  validation. Users may manually apply an equivalent validator if they are not able to upgrade.
