  - GHSA-crch-j389-5f84
summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. A specially
  crafted TFLite model could trigger an OOB write on heap in the TFLite implementation of `ArgMin`/`ArgMax`(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/102b211d892f3abc14f845a72047809b39cc65ab/tensorflow/lite/kernels/arg_min_max.cc#L52-L59).
  If `axis_value` is not a value between 0 and `NumDimensions(input)`, then the condition in
  the `if` is never true, so code writes past the last valid element of `output_dims->data`.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range.
