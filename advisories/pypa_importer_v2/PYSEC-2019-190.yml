  - CVE-2019-9735
summary: An issue was discovered in the iptables firewall module in OpenStack Neutron before
  10.0.8, 11.x before 11.0.7, 12.x before 12.0.6, and 13.x before 13.0.3. By setting a destination
  port in a security group rule along with a protocol that doesn't support that option (for
  example, VRRP), an authenticated user may block further application of security group rules
  for instances from any project/tenant on the compute hosts to which it's applied. (Only deployments
  using the iptables security group driver are affected.)
