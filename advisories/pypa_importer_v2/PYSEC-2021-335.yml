aliases:
  - CVE-2021-32807
  - GHSA-qcx9-j53g-ccgf
summary: The module `AccessControl` defines security policies for Python code used in restricted
  code within Zope applications. Restricted code is any code that resides in Zope's object database,
  such as the contents of `Script (Python)` objects. The policies defined in `AccessControl`
  severely restrict access to Python modules and only exempt a few that are deemed safe, such
  as Python's `string` module. However, full access to the `string` module also allows access
  to the class `Formatter`, which can be overridden and extended within `Script (Python)` in
  a way that provides access to other unsafe Python libraries. Those unsafe Python libraries
  can be used for remote code execution. By default, you need to have the admin-level Zope "Manager"
  role to add or edit `Script (Python)` objects through the web. Only sites that allow untrusted
  users to add/edit these scripts through the web - which would be a very unusual configuration
  to begin with - are at risk. The problem has been fixed in AccessControl 4.3 and 5.2. Only
  AccessControl versions 4 and 5 are vulnerable, and only on Python 3, not Python 2.7. As a
  workaround, a site administrator can restrict adding/editing `Script (Python)` objects through
  the web using the standard Zope user/role permission mechanisms. Untrusted users should not
  be assigned the Zope Manager role and adding/editing these scripts through the web should
  be restricted to trusted users only. This is the default configuration in Zope.
