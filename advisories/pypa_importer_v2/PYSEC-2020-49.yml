  - CVE-2020-22083
summary: '** DISPUTED ** jsonpickle through 1.4.1 allows remote code execution during deserialization
  of a malicious payload through the decode() function. Note: It has been argued that this is
  expected and clearly documented behaviour. pickle is known to be capable of causing arbitrary
  code execution, and must not be used with un-trusted data.'
