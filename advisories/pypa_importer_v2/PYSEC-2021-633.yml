aliases:
  - CVE-2021-41224
  - GHSA-rg3m-hqc5-344v
summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the
  implementation of `SparseFillEmptyRows` can be made to trigger a heap OOB access. This occurs
  whenever the size of `indices` does not match the size of `values`. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2,
  and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
