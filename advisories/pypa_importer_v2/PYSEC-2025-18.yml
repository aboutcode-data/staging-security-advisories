aliases:
  - CVE-2025-1716
  - GHSA-655q-fx9r-782v
summary: picklescan before 0.0.21 does not treat 'pip' as an unsafe global. An attacker could
  craft a malicious model that uses Pickle to pull in a malicious PyPI package (hosted, for
  example, on pypi.org or GitHub) via `pip.main()`. Because pip is not a restricted global,
  the model, when scanned with picklescan, would pass security checks and appear to be safe,
  when it could instead prove to be problematic.
