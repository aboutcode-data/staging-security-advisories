  - CVE-2016-6580
summary: A HTTP/2 implementation built using any version of the Python priority library prior
  to version 1.2.0 could be targeted by a malicious peer by having that peer assign priority
  information for every possible HTTP/2 stream ID. The priority tree would happily continue
  to store the priority information for each stream, and would therefore allocate unbounded
  amounts of memory. Attempting to actually use a tree like this would also cause extremely
  high CPU usage to maintain the tree.
