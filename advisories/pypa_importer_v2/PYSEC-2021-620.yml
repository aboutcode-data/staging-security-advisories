  - GHSA-cvgx-3v3q-m36c
summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the
  shape inference code for `QuantizeV2` can trigger a read outside of bounds of heap allocated
  array. This occurs whenever `axis` is a negative value less than `-1`. In this case, we are
  accessing data before the start of a heap buffer. The code allows `axis` to be an optional
  argument (`s` would contain an `error::NOT_FOUND` error code). Otherwise, it assumes that
  `axis` is a valid index into the dimensions of the `input` tensor. If `axis` is less than
  `-1` then this results in a heap OOB read. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We
  will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, as this version is the only one that
  is also affected.
