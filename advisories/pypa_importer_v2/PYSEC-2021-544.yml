  - GHSA-4hvv-7x94-7vq8
summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The implementation
  of TrySimplify(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/c22d88d6ff33031aa113e48aa3fc9aa74ed79595/tensorflow/core/grappler/optimizers/arithmetic_optimizer.cc#L390-L401)
  has undefined behavior due to dereferencing a null pointer in corner cases that result in
  optimizing a node with no inputs. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also
  cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
  2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
