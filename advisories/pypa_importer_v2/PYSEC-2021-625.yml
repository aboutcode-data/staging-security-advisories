aliases:
  - CVE-2021-41216
  - GHSA-3ff2-r28g-w7h9
summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the
  shape inference function for `Transpose` is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. This occurs
  whenever `perm` contains negative elements. The shape inference function does not validate
  that the indices in `perm` are all valid. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We
  will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4,
  as these are also affected and still in supported range.
