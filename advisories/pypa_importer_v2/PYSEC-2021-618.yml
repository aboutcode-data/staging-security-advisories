aliases:
  - CVE-2021-41209
  - GHSA-6hpv-v2rx-c5g6
summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the
  implementations for convolution operators trigger a division by 0 if passed empty filter tensor
  arguments. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and
  still in supported range.
