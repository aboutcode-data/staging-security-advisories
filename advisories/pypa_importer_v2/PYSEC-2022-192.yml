  - GHSA-3r7g-wrpr-j5g4
summary: 'django-mfa3 is a library that implements multi factor authentication for the django
  web framework. It achieves this by modifying the regular login view. Django however has a
  second login view for its admin area. This second login view was not modified, so the multi
  factor authentication can be bypassed. Users are affected if they have activated both django-mfa3
  (< 0.5.0) and django.contrib.admin and have not taken any other measures to prevent users
  from accessing the admin login view. The issue has been fixed in django-mfa3 0.5.0. It is
  possible to work around the issue by overwriting the admin login route, e.g. by adding the
  following URL definition *before* the admin routes: url(''admin/login/'', lambda request:
  redirect(settings.LOGIN_URL)'
