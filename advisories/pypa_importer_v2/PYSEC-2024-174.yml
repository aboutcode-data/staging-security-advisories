summary: "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Apache StreamPipes during installation\
  \ process of pipeline elements.\nPreviously, StreamPipes allowed users to configure custom\

  \ to an arbitrary address.\nThis issue affects Apache StreamPipes: through 0.93.0.\n\nUsers\
  \ are recommended to upgrade to version 0.95.0, which fixes the issue."
