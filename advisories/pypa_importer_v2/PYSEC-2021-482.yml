  - GHSA-qg48-85hg-mqc5
summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker
  can cause a denial of service via a FPE runtime error in `tf.raw_ops.DenseCountSparseOutput`.
  This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/efff014f3b2d8ef6141da30c806faf141297eca1/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L123-L127)
  computes a divisor value from user data but does not check that the result is 0 before doing
  the division. Since `data` is given by the `values` argument, `num_batch_elements` is 0. The
  fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.4.2, and TensorFlow 2.3.3, as these are also affected.
