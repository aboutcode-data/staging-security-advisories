  - GHSA-xw93-v57j-fcgh
summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker
  can cause a denial of service via a FPE runtime error in `tf.raw_ops.SparseMatMul`. The division
  by 0 occurs deep in Eigen code because the `b` tensor is empty. The fix will be included in
  TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3,
  TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
