  - GHSA-8c89-2vwr-chcq
summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker
  can cause a heap buffer overflow in `QuantizedResizeBilinear` by passing in invalid thresholds
  for the quantization. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/50711818d2e61ccce012591eeb4fdf93a8496726/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_resize_bilinear_op.cc#L705-L706)
  assumes that the 2 arguments are always valid scalars and tries to access the numeric value
  directly. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are
  also affected and still in supported range.
