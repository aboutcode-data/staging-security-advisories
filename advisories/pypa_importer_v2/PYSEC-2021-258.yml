  - CVE-2021-37636
  - GHSA-hp4c-x6r7-6555
summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected
  versions the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.SparseDenseCwiseDiv` is vulnerable to a division
  by 0 error. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1bc56203f21a5a4995311825ffaba7a670d7747/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_dense_binary_op_shared.cc#L56)
  uses a common class for all binary operations but fails to treat the division by 0 case separately.
  We have patched the issue in GitHub commit d9204be9f49520cdaaeb2541d1dc5187b23f31d9. The fix
  will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1,
  TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported
  range.
