aliases:
  - CVE-2023-23940
  - GHSA-626q-v9j4-mcp4
summary: OpenZeppelin Contracts for Cairo is a library for secure smart contract development
  written in Cairo for StarkNet, a decentralized ZK Rollup. `is_valid_eth_signature` is missing
  a call to `finalize_keccak` after calling `verify_eth_signature`. As a result, any contract
  using `is_valid_eth_signature` from the account library (such as the `EthAccount` preset)
  is vulnerable to a malicious sequencer. Specifically, the malicious sequencer would be able
  to bypass signature validation to impersonate an instance of these accounts. The issue has
  been patched in 0.6.1.
