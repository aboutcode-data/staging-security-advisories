aliases:
  - CVE-2016-9015
summary: Versions 1.17 and 1.18 of the Python urllib3 library suffer from a vulnerability that
  can cause them, in certain configurations, to not correctly validate TLS certificates. This
  places users of the library with those configurations at risk of man-in-the-middle and information
  leakage attacks. This vulnerability affects users using versions 1.17 and 1.18 of the urllib3
  library, who are using the optional PyOpenSSL support for TLS instead of the regular standard
  library TLS backend, and who are using OpenSSL 1.1.0 via PyOpenSSL. This is an extremely uncommon
  configuration, so the security impact of this vulnerability is low.
