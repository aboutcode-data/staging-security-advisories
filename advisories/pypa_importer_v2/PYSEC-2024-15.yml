aliases:
  - CVE-2024-23329
  - GHSA-hcvp-2cc7-jrwr
summary: changedetection.io is an open source tool designed to monitor websites for content
  changes. In affected versions the API endpoint `/api/v1/watch/<uuid>/history` can be accessed
  by any unauthorized user. As a result any unauthorized user can check one's watch history.
  However, because unauthorized party first needs to know a watch UUID, and the watch history
  endpoint itself returns only paths to the snapshot on the server, an impact on users' data
  privacy is minimal. This issue has been addressed in version 0.45.13. Users are advised to
  upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
