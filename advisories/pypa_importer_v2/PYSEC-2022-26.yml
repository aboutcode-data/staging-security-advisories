aliases:
  - CVE-2022-23607
  - GHSA-fhpf-pp6p-55qc
summary: treq is an HTTP library inspired by requests but written on top of Twisted's Agents.
  Treq's request methods (`treq.get`, `treq.post`, etc.) and `treq.client.HTTPClient` constructor
  accept cookies as a dictionary. Such cookies are not bound to a single domain, and are therefore
  sent to *every* domain ("supercookies"). This can potentially cause sensitive information
  to leak upon an HTTP redirect to a different domain., e.g. should `https://example.com` redirect
  to `http://cloudstorageprovider.com` the latter will receive the cookie `session`. Treq 2021.1.0
  and later bind cookies given to request methods (`treq.request`, `treq.get`, `HTTPClient.request`,
  `HTTPClient.get`, etc.) to the origin of the *url* parameter. Users are advised to upgrade.
  For users unable to upgrade Instead of passing a dictionary as the *cookies* argument, pass
  a `http.cookiejar.CookieJar` instance with properly domain- and scheme-scoped cookies in it.
