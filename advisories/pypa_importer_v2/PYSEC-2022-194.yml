aliases:
  - CVE-2022-24859
  - GHSA-xcjx-m2pj-8g79
summary: PyPDF2 is an open source python PDF library capable of splitting, merging, cropping,
  and transforming the pages of PDF files. In versions prior to 1.27.5 an attacker who uses
  this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop if the PyPDF2 if the code
  attempts to get the content stream. The reason is that the last while-loop in `ContentStream._readInlineImage`
  only terminates when it finds the `EI` token, but never actually checks if the stream has
  already ended. This issue has been resolved in version `1.27.5`. Users unable to upgrade should
  validate and PDFs prior to iterating over their content stream.
