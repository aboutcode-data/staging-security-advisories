  - GHSA-58c7-px5v-82hh
summary: 'django-registration is a user registration package for Django. The django-registration
  package provides tools for implementing user-account registration flows in the Django web
  framework. In django-registration prior to 3.1.2, the base user-account registration view
  did not properly apply filters to sensitive data, with the result that sensitive data could
  be included in error reports rather than removed automatically by Django. Triggering this
  requires: A site is using django-registration < 3.1.2, The site has detailed error reports
  (such as Django''s emailed error reports to site staff/developers) enabled and a server-side
  error (HTTP 5xx) occurs during an attempt by a user to register an account. Under these conditions,
  recipients of the detailed error report will see all submitted data from the account-registration
  attempt, which may include the user''s proposed credentials (such as a password).'
