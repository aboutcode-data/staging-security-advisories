aliases:
  - CVE-2022-21737
  - GHSA-f2vv-v9cg-qhh7
summary: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `*Bincount`
  operations allows malicious users to cause denial of service by passing in arguments which
  would trigger a `CHECK`-fail. There are several conditions that the input arguments must satisfy.
  Some are not caught during shape inference and others are not caught during kernel implementation.
  This results in `CHECK` failures later when the output tensors get allocated. The fix will
  be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1,
  TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported
  range.
