  - GHSA-gfp2-w5jm-955q
summary: OMERO.web is open source Django-based software for managing microscopy imaging. OMERO.web
  before version 5.9.0 loads various information about the current user such as their id, name
  and the groups they are in, and these are available on the main webclient pages. This represents
  an information exposure vulnerability. Some additional information being loaded is not used
  by the webclient and is being removed in this release. This is fixed in version 5.9.0.
