  - GHSA-jf7h-7m85-w2v2
summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The TFLite code
  for allocating `TFLiteIntArray`s is vulnerable to an integer overflow issue(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/4ceffae632721e52bf3501b736e4fe9d1221cdfa/tensorflow/lite/c/common.c#L24-L27).
  An attacker can craft a model such that the `size` multiplier is so large that the return
  value overflows the `int` datatype and becomes negative. In turn, this results in invalid
  value being given to `malloc`(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/4ceffae632721e52bf3501b736e4fe9d1221cdfa/tensorflow/lite/c/common.c#L47-L52).
  In this case, `ret->size` would dereference an invalid pointer. The fix will be included in
  TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3,
  TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
