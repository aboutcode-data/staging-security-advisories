  - CVE-2023-30536
summary: slim/psr7 is a PSR-7 implementation for use with Slim 4. In versions prior to 1.6.1
  an attacker could sneak in a newline (\n) into both the header names and values. While the
  specification states that \r\n\r\n is used to terminate the header list, many servers in the
  wild will also accept \n\n. An attacker that is able to control the header names that are
  passed to Slilm-Psr7 would be able to intentionally craft invalid messages, possibly causing
  application errors or invalid HTTP requests being sent out with an PSR-18 HTTP client. The
  latter might present a denial of service vector if a remote service’s web application firewall
  bans the application due to the receipt of malformed requests. The issue has been patched
  in version 1.6.1. There are no known workarounds to this issue. Users are advised to upgrade.
