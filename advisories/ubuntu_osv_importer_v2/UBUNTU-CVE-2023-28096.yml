summary: 'OpenSIPS, a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation, has a memory
  leak starting in the 2.3 branch and priot to versions 3.1.8 and 3.2.5. The memory leak was
  detected in the function `parse_mi_request` while performing coverage-guided fuzzing. This
  issue can be reproduced by sending multiple requests of the form `{"jsonrpc": "2.0","method":
  "log_le`. This malformed message was tested against an instance of OpenSIPS via FIFO transport
  layer and was found to increase the memory consumption over time. To abuse this memory leak,
  attackers need to reach the management interface (MI) which typically should only be exposed
  on trusted interfaces. In cases where the MI is exposed to the internet without authentication,
  abuse of this issue will lead to memory exhaustion which may affect the underlying system’s
  availability. No authentication is typically required to reproduce this issue. On the other
  hand, memory leaks may occur in other areas of OpenSIPS where the cJSON library is used for
  parsing JSON objects. The issue has been fixed in versions 3.1.8 and 3.2.5.'
