  - CVE-2024-5569
summary: A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the jaraco/zipp library, affecting
  all versions prior to 3.19.1. The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted
  zip file that leads to an infinite loop. This issue also impacts the zipfile module of CPython,
  as features from the third-party zipp library are later merged into CPython, and the affected
  code is identical in both projects. The infinite loop can be initiated through the use of
  functions affecting the `Path` module in both zipp and zipfile, such as `joinpath`, the overloaded
  division operator, and `iterdir`. Although the infinite loop is not resource exhaustive, it
  prevents the application from responding. The vulnerability was addressed in version 3.19.1
  of jaraco/zipp.
