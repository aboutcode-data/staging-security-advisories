  - CVE-2020-25603
summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There are missing memory barriers when
  accessing/allocating an event channel. Event channels control structures can be accessed lockless
  as long as the port is considered to be valid. Such a sequence is missing an appropriate memory
  barrier (e.g., smp_*mb()) to prevent both the compiler and CPU from re-ordering access. A
  malicious guest may be able to cause a hypervisor crash resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).
  Information leak and privilege escalation cannot be excluded. Systems running all versions
  of Xen are affected. Whether a system is vulnerable will depend on the CPU and compiler used
  to build Xen. For all systems, the presence and the scope of the vulnerability depend on the
  precise re-ordering performed by the compiler used to build Xen. We have not been able to
  survey compilers; consequently we cannot say which compiler(s) might produce vulnerable code
  (with which code generation options). GCC documentation clearly suggests that re-ordering
  is possible. Arm systems will also be vulnerable if the CPU is able to re-order memory access.
  Please consult your CPU vendor. x86 systems are only vulnerable if a compiler performs re-ordering.
