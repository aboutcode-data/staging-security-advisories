  - CVE-2023-49284
summary: fish is a smart and user-friendly command line shell for macOS, Linux, and the rest
  of the family. fish shell uses certain Unicode non-characters internally for marking wildcards
  and expansions. It will incorrectly allow these markers to be read on command substitution
  output, rather than transforming them into a safe internal representation. While this may
  cause unexpected behavior with direct input (for example, echo \UFDD2HOME has the same output
  as echo $HOME), this may become a minor security problem if the output is being fed from an
  external program into a command substitution where this output may not be expected. This design
  flaw was introduced in very early versions of fish, predating the version control system,
  and is thought to be present in every version of fish released in the last 15 years or more,
  although with different characters. Code execution does not appear to be possible, but denial
  of service (through large brace expansion) or information disclosure (such as variable expansion)
  is potentially possible under certain circumstances. fish shell 3.6.2 has been released to
  correct this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
  vulnerability.
