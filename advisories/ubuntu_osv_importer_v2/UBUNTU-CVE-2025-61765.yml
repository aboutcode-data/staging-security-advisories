summary: python-socketio is a Python implementation of the Socket.IO realtime client and server.
  A remote code execution vulnerability in python-socketio versions prior to 5.14.0 allows attackers
  to execute arbitrary Python code through malicious pickle deserialization in multi-server
  deployments on which the attacker previously gained access to the message queue that the servers
  use for internal communications. When Socket.IO servers are configured to use a message queue
  backend such as Redis for inter-server communication, messages sent between the servers are
  encoded using the `pickle` Python module. When a server receives one of these messages through
  the message queue, it assumes it is trusted and immediately deserializes it. The vulnerability
  stems from deserialization of messages using Python's `pickle.loads()` function. Having previously
  obtained access to the message queue, the attacker can send a python-socketio server a crafted
  pickle payload that executes arbitrary code during deserialization via Python's `__reduce__`
  method. This vulnerability only affects deployments with a compromised message queue. The
  attack can lead to the attacker executing random code in the context of, and with the privileges
  of a Socket.IO server process. Single-server systems that do not use a message queue, and
  multi-server systems with a secure message queue are not vulnerable. In addition to making
  sure standard security practices are followed in the deployment of the message queue, users
  of the python-socketio package can upgrade to version 5.14.0 or newer, which remove the `pickle`
  module and use the much safer JSON encoding for inter-server messaging.
