  - CVE-2021-29622
summary: Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system and time series database. In 2.23.0,
  Prometheus changed its default UI to the New ui. To ensure a seamless transition, the URL's
  prefixed by /new redirect to /. Due to a bug in the code, it is possible for an attacker to
  craft an URL that can redirect to any other URL, in the /new endpoint. If a user visits a
  prometheus server with a specially crafted address, they can be redirected to an arbitrary
  URL. The issue was patched in the 2.26.1 and 2.27.1 releases. In 2.28.0, the /new endpoint
  will be removed completely. The workaround is to disable access to /new via a reverse proxy
  in front of Prometheus.
