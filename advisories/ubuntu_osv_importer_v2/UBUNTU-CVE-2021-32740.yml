  - CVE-2021-32740
summary: Addressable is an alternative implementation to the URI implementation that is part
  of Ruby's standard library. An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability exists after
  version 2.3.0 through version 2.7.0. Within the URI template implementation in Addressable,
  a maliciously crafted template may result in uncontrolled resource consumption, leading to
  denial of service when matched against a URI. In typical usage, templates would not normally
  be read from untrusted user input, but nonetheless, no previous security advisory for Addressable
  has cautioned against doing this. Users of the parsing capabilities in Addressable but not
  the URI template capabilities are unaffected. The vulnerability is patched in version 2.8.0.
  As a workaround, only create Template objects from trusted sources that have been validated
  not to produce catastrophic backtracking.
