summary: grant table v2 status pages may remain accessible after de-allocation (take two) Guest
  get permitted access to certain Xen-owned pages of memory. The majority of such pages remain
  allocated / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages,
  however, get de-allocated when a guest switched (back) from v2 to v1. The freeing of such
  pages requires that the hypervisor know where in the guest these pages were mapped. The hypervisor
  tracks only one use within guest space, but racing requests from the guest to insert mappings
  of these pages may result in any of them to become mapped in multiple locations. Upon switching
  back from v2 to v1, the guest would then retain access to a page that was freed and perhaps
  re-used for other purposes. This bug was fortuitously fixed by code cleanup in Xen 4.14, and
  backported to security-supported Xen branches as a prerequisite of the fix for XSA-378.
