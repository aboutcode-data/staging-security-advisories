  - CVE-2024-24821
summary: 'Composer is a dependency Manager for the PHP language. In affected versions several
  files within the local working directory are included during the invocation of Composer and
  in the context of the executing user. As such, under certain conditions arbitrary code execution
  may lead to local privilege escalation, provide lateral user movement or malicious code execution
  when Composer is invoked within a directory with tampered files. All Composer CLI commands
  are affected, including composer.phar''s self-update. The following scenarios are of high
  risk: Composer being run with sudo, Pipelines which may execute Composer on untrusted projects,
  Shared environments with developers who run Composer individually on the same project. This
  vulnerability has been addressed in versions 2.7.0 and 2.2.23. It is advised that the patched
  versions are applied at the earliest convenience. Where not possible, the following should
  be addressed: Remove all sudo composer privileges for all users to mitigate root privilege
  escalation, and avoid running Composer within an untrusted directory, or if needed, verify
  that the contents of `vendor/composer/InstalledVersions.php` and `vendor/composer/installed.php`
  do not include untrusted code.  A reset can also be done on these files by the following:```sh
  rm vendor/composer/installed.php vendor/composer/InstalledVersions.php composer install --no-scripts
  --no-plugins ```'
