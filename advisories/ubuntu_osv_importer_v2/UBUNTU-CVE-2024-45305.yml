  - CVE-2024-45305
summary: gix-path is a crate of the gitoxide project dealing with git paths and their conversions.
  `gix-path` executes `git` to find the path of a configuration file that belongs to the `git`
  installation itself, but mistakenly treats the local repository's configuration as system-wide
  if no higher scoped configuration is found. In rare cases, this causes a less trusted repository
  to be treated as more trusted, or leaks sensitive information from one repository to another,
  such as sending credentials to another repository's remote. In `gix_path::env`, the underlying
  implementation of the `installation_config` and `installation_config_prefix` functions calls
  `git config -l --show-origin` and parses the first line of the output to extract the path
  to the configuration file holding the configuration variable of highest scope. It is believed
  to be very difficult to exploit this vulnerability deliberately, due to the need either to
  anticipate a situation in which higher-scoped configuration variables would be absent, or
  to arrange for this to happen. Although any operating system may be affected, users running
  Apple Git on macOS are much less likely to be affected. This issue has been addressed in release
  version 0.10.10. All users are advised to upgrade.
