  - CVE-2021-43848
summary: h2o is an open source http server. In code prior to the `8c0eca3` commit h2o may attempt
  to access uninitialized memory. When receiving QUIC frames in certain order, HTTP/3 server-side
  implementation of h2o can be misguided to treat uninitialized memory as HTTP/3 frames that
  have been received. When h2o is used as a reverse proxy, an attacker can abuse this vulnerability
  to send internal state of h2o to backend servers controlled by the attacker or third party.
  Also, if there is an HTTP endpoint that reflects the traffic sent from the client, an attacker
  can use that reflector to obtain internal state of h2o. This internal state includes traffic
  of other connections in unencrypted form and TLS session tickets. This vulnerability exists
  in h2o server with HTTP/3 support, between commit 93af138 and d1f0f65. None of the released
  versions of h2o are affected by this vulnerability. There are no known workarounds. Users
  of unreleased versions of h2o using HTTP/3 are advised to upgrade immediately.
