aliases:
  - CVE-2017-7559
summary: In Undertow 2.x before 2.0.0.Alpha2, 1.4.x before 1.4.17.Final, and 1.3.x before 1.3.31.Final,
  it was found that the fix for CVE-2017-2666 was incomplete and invalid characters are still
  allowed in the query string and path parameters. This could be exploited, in conjunction with
  a proxy that also permitted the invalid characters but with a different interpretation, to
  inject data into the HTTP response. By manipulating the HTTP response the attacker could poison
  a web-cache, perform an XSS attack, or obtain sensitive information from requests other than
  their own.
