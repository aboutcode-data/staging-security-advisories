  - CVE-2019-18425
summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing 32-bit PV guest OS users to
  gain guest OS privileges by installing and using descriptors. There is missing descriptor
  table limit checking in x86 PV emulation. When emulating certain PV guest operations, descriptor
  table accesses are performed by the emulating code. Such accesses should respect the guest
  specified limits, unless otherwise guaranteed to fail in such a case. Without this, emulation
  of 32-bit guest user mode calls through call gates would allow guest user mode to install
  and then use descriptors of their choice, as long as the guest kernel did not itself install
  an LDT. (Most OSes don't install any LDT by default). 32-bit PV guest user mode can elevate
  its privileges to that of the guest kernel. Xen versions from at least 3.2 onwards are affected.
  Only 32-bit PV guest user mode can leverage this vulnerability. HVM, PVH, as well as 64-bit
  PV guests cannot leverage this vulnerability. Arm systems are unaffected.
