  - CVE-2025-29786
summary: Expr is an expression language and expression evaluation for Go. Prior to version 1.17.0,
  if the Expr expression parser is given an unbounded input string, it will attempt to compile
  the entire string and generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node for each part of the expression.
  In scenarios where input size isn’t limited, a malicious or inadvertent extremely large expression
  can consume excessive memory as the parser builds a huge AST. This can ultimately lead to*excessive
  memory usage and an Out-Of-Memory (OOM) crash of the process. This issue is relatively uncommon
  and will only manifest when there are no restrictions on the input size, i.e. the expression
  length is allowed to grow arbitrarily large. In typical use cases where inputs are bounded
  or validated, this problem would not occur. The problem has been patched in the latest versions
  of the Expr library. The fix introduces compile-time limits on the number of AST nodes and
  memory usage during parsing, preventing any single expression from exhausting resources. Users
  should upgrade to Expr version 1.17.0 or later, as this release includes the new node budget
  and memory limit safeguards. Upgrading to v1.17.0 ensures that extremely deep or large expressions
  are detected and safely aborted during compilation, avoiding the OOM condition. For users
  who cannot immediately upgrade, the recommended workaround is to impose an input size restriction
  before parsing. In practice, this means validating or limiting the length of expression strings
  that your application will accept. For example, set a maximum allowable number of characters
  (or nodes) for any expression and reject or truncate inputs that exceed this limit. By ensuring
  no unbounded-length expression is ever fed into the parser, one can prevent the parser from
  constructing a pathologically large AST and avoid potential memory exhaustion. In short, pre-validate
  and cap input size as a safeguard in the absence of the patch.
