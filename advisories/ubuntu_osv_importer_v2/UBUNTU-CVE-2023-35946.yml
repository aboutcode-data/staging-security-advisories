  - CVE-2023-35946
summary: Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for multi-language
  development. When Gradle writes a dependency into its dependency cache, it uses the dependency's
  coordinates to compute a file location. With specially crafted dependency coordinates, Gradle
  can be made to write files into an unintended location. The file may be written outside the
  dependency cache or over another file in the dependency cache. This vulnerability could be
  used to poison the dependency cache or overwrite important files elsewhere on the filesystem
  where the Gradle process has write permissions. Exploiting this vulnerability requires an
  attacker to have control over a dependency repository used by the Gradle build or have the
  ability to modify the build's configuration. It is unlikely that this would go unnoticed.
  A fix has been released in Gradle 7.6.2 and 8.2 to protect against this vulnerability. Gradle
  will refuse to cache dependencies that have path traversal elements in their dependency coordinates.
  It is recommended that users upgrade to a patched version. If you are unable to upgrade to
  Gradle 7.6.2 or 8.2, `dependency verification` will make this vulnerability more difficult
  to exploit.
