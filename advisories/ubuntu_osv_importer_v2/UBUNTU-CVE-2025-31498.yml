  - CVE-2025-31498
summary: c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. From 1.32.3 through 1.34.4, there is a
  use-after-free in read_answers() when process_answer() may re-enqueue a query either due to
  a DNS Cookie Failure or when the upstream server does not properly support EDNS, or possibly
  on TCP queries if the remote closed the connection immediately after a response. If there
  was an issue trying to put that new transaction on the wire, it would close the connection
  handle, but read_answers() was still expecting the connection handle to be available to possibly
  dequeue other responses. In theory a remote attacker might be able to trigger this by flooding
  the target with ICMP UNREACHABLE packets if they also control the upstream nameserver and
  can return a result with one of those conditions, this has been untested. Otherwise only a
  local attacker might be able to change system behavior to make send()/write() return a failure
  condition. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.34.5.
