aliases:
  - CVE-2021-20328
summary: Specific versions of the Java driver that support client-side field level encryption
  (CSFLE) fail to perform correct host name verification on the KMS server’s certificate. This
  vulnerability in combination with a privileged network position active MITM attack could result
  in interception of traffic between the Java driver and the KMS service rendering Field Level
  Encryption ineffective. This issue was discovered during internal testing and affects all
  versions of the Java driver that support CSFLE. The Java async, Scala, and reactive streams
  drivers are not impacted. This vulnerability does not impact driver traffic payloads with
  CSFLE-supported key services originating from applications residing inside the AWS, GCP, and
  Azure network fabrics due to compensating controls in these environments. This issue does
  not impact driver workloads that don’t use Field Level Encryption.
