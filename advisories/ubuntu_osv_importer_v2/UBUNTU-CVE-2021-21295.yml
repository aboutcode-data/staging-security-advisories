summary: 'Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework for
  rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. In Netty (io.netty:netty-codec-http2)
  before version 4.1.60.Final there is a vulnerability that enables request smuggling. If a
  Content-Length header is present in the original HTTP/2 request, the field is not validated
  by `Http2MultiplexHandler` as it is propagated up. This is fine as long as the request is
  not proxied through as HTTP/1.1. If the request comes in as an HTTP/2 stream, gets converted
  into the HTTP/1.1 domain objects (`HttpRequest`, `HttpContent`, etc.) via `Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec
  `and then sent up to the child channel''s pipeline and proxied through a remote peer as HTTP/1.1
  this may result in request smuggling. In a proxy case, users may assume the content-length
  is validated somehow, which is not the case. If the request is forwarded to a backend channel
  that is a HTTP/1.1 connection, the Content-Length now has meaning and needs to be checked.
  An attacker can smuggle requests inside the body as it gets downgraded from HTTP/2 to HTTP/1.1.
  For an example attack refer to the linked GitHub Advisory. Users are only affected if all
  of this is true: `HTTP2MultiplexCodec` or `Http2FrameCodec` is used, `Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec`
  is used to convert to HTTP/1.1 objects, and these HTTP/1.1 objects are forwarded to another
  remote peer. This has been patched in 4.1.60.Final As a workaround, the user can do the validation
  by themselves by implementing a custom `ChannelInboundHandler` that is put in the `ChannelPipeline`
  behind `Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec`.'
