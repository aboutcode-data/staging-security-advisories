  - CVE-2020-1967
summary: Server or client applications that call the SSL_check_chain() function during or after
  a TLS 1.3 handshake may crash due to a NULL pointer dereference as a result of incorrect handling
  of the "signature_algorithms_cert" TLS extension. The crash occurs if an invalid or unrecognised
  signature algorithm is received from the peer. This could be exploited by a malicious peer
  in a Denial of Service attack. OpenSSL version 1.1.1d, 1.1.1e, and 1.1.1f are affected by
  this issue. This issue did not affect OpenSSL versions prior to 1.1.1d. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1g
  (Affected 1.1.1d-1.1.1f).
