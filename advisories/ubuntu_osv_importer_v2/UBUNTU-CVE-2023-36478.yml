summary: Eclipse Jetty provides a web server and servlet container. In versions 11.0.0 through
  11.0.15, 10.0.0 through 10.0.15, and 9.0.0 through 9.4.52, an integer overflow in `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize`
  allows for HTTP/2 HPACK header values to exceed their size limit. `MetaDataBuilder.java` determines
  if a header name or value exceeds the size limit, and throws an exception if the limit is
  exceeded. However, when length is very large and huffman is true, the multiplication by 4
  in line 295 will overflow, and length will become negative. `(_size+length)` will now be negative,
  and the check on line 296 will not be triggered. Furthermore, `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize`
  allows for user-entered HPACK header value sizes to be negative, potentially leading to a
  very large buffer allocation later on when the user-entered size is multiplied by 2. This
  means that if a user provides a negative length value (or, more precisely, a length value
  which, when multiplied by the 4/3 fudge factor, is negative), and this length value is a very
  large positive number when multiplied by 2, then the user can cause a very large buffer to
  be allocated on the server. Users of HTTP/2 can be impacted by a remote denial of service
  attack. The issue has been fixed in versions 11.0.16, 10.0.16, and 9.4.53. There are no known
  workarounds.
