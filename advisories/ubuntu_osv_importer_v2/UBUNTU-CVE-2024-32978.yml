summary: Kaminari is a paginator for web app frameworks and object relational mappings. A security
  vulnerability involving insecure file permissions has been identified in the Kaminari pagination
  library for Ruby on Rails, concerning insecure file permissions. This vulnerability is of
  moderate severity due to the potential for unauthorized write access to particular Ruby files
  managed by the library. Such access could lead to the alteration of application behavior or
