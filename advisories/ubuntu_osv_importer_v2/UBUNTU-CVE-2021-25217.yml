summary: 'In ISC DHCP 4.1-ESV-R1 -> 4.1-ESV-R16, ISC DHCP 4.4.0 -> 4.4.2 (Other branches of
  ISC DHCP (i.e., releases in the 4.0.x series or lower and releases in the 4.3.x series) are
  beyond their End-of-Life (EOL) and no longer supported by ISC. From inspection it is clear
  that the defect is also present in releases from those series, but they have not been officially
  tested for the vulnerability), The outcome of encountering the defect while reading a lease
  that will trigger it varies, according to: the component being affected (i.e., dhclient or
  dhcpd) whether the package was built as a 32-bit or 64-bit binary whether the compiler flag
  -fstack-protection-strong was used when compiling In dhclient, ISC has not successfully reproduced
  the error on a 64-bit system. However, on a 32-bit system it is possible to cause dhclient
  to crash when reading an improper lease, which could cause network connectivity problems for
  an affected system due to the absence of a running DHCP client process. In dhcpd, when run
  in DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 mode: if the dhcpd server binary was built for a 32-bit architecture AND
  the -fstack-protection-strong flag was specified to the compiler, dhcpd may exit while parsing
  a lease file containing an objectionable lease, resulting in lack of service to clients. Additionally,
  the offending lease and the lease immediately following it in the lease database may be improperly
  deleted. if the dhcpd server binary was built for a 64-bit architecture OR if the -fstack-protection-strong
  compiler flag was NOT specified, the crash will not occur, but it is possible for the offending
  lease and the lease which immediately followed it to be improperly deleted.'
