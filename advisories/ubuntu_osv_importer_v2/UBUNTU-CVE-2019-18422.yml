  - CVE-2019-18422
summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing ARM guest OS users to cause
  a denial of service or gain privileges by leveraging the erroneous enabling of interrupts.
  Interrupts are unconditionally unmasked in exception handlers. When an exception occurs on
  an ARM system which is handled without changing processor level, some interrupts are unconditionally
  enabled during exception entry. So exceptions which occur when interrupts are masked will
  effectively unmask the interrupts. A malicious guest might contrive to arrange for critical
  Xen code to run with interrupts erroneously enabled. This could lead to data corruption, denial
  of service, or possibly even privilege escalation. However a precise attack technique has
  not been identified.
