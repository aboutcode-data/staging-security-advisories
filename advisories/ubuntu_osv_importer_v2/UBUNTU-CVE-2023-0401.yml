aliases:
  - CVE-2023-0401
summary: A NULL pointer can be dereferenced when signatures are being verified on PKCS7 signed
  or signedAndEnveloped data. In case the hash algorithm used for the signature is known to
  the OpenSSL library but the implementation of the hash algorithm is not available the digest
  initialization will fail. There is a missing check for the return value from the initialization
  function which later leads to invalid usage of the digest API most likely leading to a crash.
  The unavailability of an algorithm can be caused by using FIPS enabled configuration of providers
  or more commonly by not loading the legacy provider. PKCS7 data is processed by the SMIME
  library calls and also by the time stamp (TS) library calls. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL
  does not call these functions however third party applications would be affected if they call
  these functions to verify signatures on untrusted data.
