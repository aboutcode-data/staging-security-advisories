  - CVE-2024-1313
summary: 'It is possible for a user in a different organization from the owner of a snapshot
  to bypass authorization and delete a snapshot by issuing a DELETE request to /api/snapshots/<key>
  using its view key. This functionality is intended to only be available to individuals with
  the permission to write/edit to the snapshot in question, but due to a bug in the authorization
  logic, deletion requests issued by an unprivileged user in a different organization than the
  snapshot owner are treated as authorized. Grafana Labs would like to thank Ravid Mazon and
  Jay Chen of Palo Alto Research for discovering and disclosing this vulnerability. This issue
  affects Grafana: from 9.5.0 before 9.5.18, from 10.0.0 before 10.0.13, from 10.1.0 before
  10.1.9, from 10.2.0 before 10.2.6, from 10.3.0 before 10.3.5.'
