  - CVE-2024-47080
summary: matrix-js-sdk is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript and TypeScript. In matrix-js-sdk
  versions versions 9.11.0 through 34.7.0, the method `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys` is
  vulnerable to interception by malicious homeservers.  The method was introduced by MSC3061)
  and is commonly used to share historical message keys with newly invited users, granting them
  access to past messages in the room. However, it unconditionally sends these "shared" keys
  to all of the invited user's devices, regardless of whether the user's cryptographic identity
  is verified or whether the user's devices are signed by that identity. This allows the attacker
  to potentially inject its own devices to receive sensitive historical keys without proper
  security checks. Note that this only affects clients running the SDK with the legacy crypto
  stack. Clients using the new Rust cryptography stack (i.e. those that call `MatrixClient.initRustCrypto()`
  instead of `MatrixClient.initCrypto()`) are unaffected by this vulnerability, because `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys()`
  raises an exception in such environments. The vulnerability was fixed in matrix-js-sdk 34.8.0
  by removing the vulnerable functionality. As a workaround, remove use of affected functionality
  from clients.
