summary: '** DISPUTED ** This record was originally reported by the oss-fuzz project who failed
  to consider the security context in which JXPath is intended to be used and failed to contact
  the JXPath maintainers prior to requesting the CVE allocation. The CVE was then allocated
  by Google in breach of the CNA rules. After review by the JXPath maintainers, the original
  report was found to be invalid.'
