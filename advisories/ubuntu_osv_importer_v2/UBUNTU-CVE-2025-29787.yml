  - CVE-2025-29787
summary: '`zip` is a zip library for rust which supports reading and writing of simple ZIP files.
  In the archive extraction routine of affected versions of the `zip` crate starting with version
  1.3.0 and prior to version 2.3.0, symbolic links earlier in the archive are allowed to be
  used for later files in the archive without validation of the final canonicalized path, allowing
  maliciously crafted archives to overwrite arbitrary files in the file system when extracted.
  Users who extract untrusted archive files using the following high-level API method may be
  affected and critical files on the system may be overwritten with arbitrary file permissions,
  which can potentially lead to code execution. Version 2.3.0 fixes the issue.'
