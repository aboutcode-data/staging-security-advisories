  - CVE-2022-29187
summary: Git is a distributed revision control system. Git prior to versions 2.37.1, 2.36.2,
  2.35.4, 2.34.4, 2.33.4, 2.32.3, 2.31.4, and 2.30.5, is vulnerable to privilege escalation
  in all platforms. An unsuspecting user could still be affected by the issue reported in CVE-2022-24765,
  for example when navigating as root into a shared tmp directory that is owned by them, but
  where an attacker could create a git repository. Versions 2.37.1, 2.36.2, 2.35.4, 2.34.4,
  2.33.4, 2.32.3, 2.31.4, and 2.30.5 contain a patch for this issue. The simplest way to avoid
  being affected by the exploit described in the example is to avoid running git as root (or
  an Administrator in Windows), and if needed to reduce its use to a minimum. While a generic
  workaround is not possible, a system could be hardened from the exploit described in the example
  by removing any such repository if it exists already and creating one as root to block any
  future attacks.
