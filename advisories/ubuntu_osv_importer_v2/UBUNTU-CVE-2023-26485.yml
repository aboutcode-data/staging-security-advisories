  - CVE-2023-26485
summary: 'cmark-gfm is GitHub''s fork of cmark, a CommonMark parsing and rendering library and
  program in C. A polynomial time complexity issue in cmark-gfm may lead to unbounded resource
  exhaustion and subsequent denial of service. This CVE covers quadratic complexity issues when
  parsing text which leads with either large numbers of `_` characters. This issue has been
  addressed in version 0.29.0.gfm.10. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade
  should validate that their input comes from trusted sources. ### Impact A polynomial time
  complexity issue in cmark-gfm may lead to unbounded resource exhaustion and subsequent denial
  of service. ### Proof of concept ``` $ ~/cmark-gfm$ python3 -c ''pad = "_" * 100000; print(pad
  + "." + pad, end="")'' | time ./build/src/cmark-gfm --to plaintext ``` Increasing the number
  10000 in the above commands causes the running time to increase quadratically. ### Patches
  This vulnerability have been patched in 0.29.0.gfm.10. ### Note on cmark and cmark-gfm XXX:
  TBD [cmark-gfm](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm) is a fork of [cmark](https://github.com/commonmark/cmark)
  that adds the GitHub Flavored Markdown extensions. The two codebases have diverged over time,
  but share a common core. These bugs affect both `cmark` and `cmark-gfm`. ### Credit We would
  like to thank @gravypod for reporting this vulnerability. ### References https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity
