  - CVE-2020-10995
summary: PowerDNS Recursor from 4.1.0 up to and including 4.3.0 does not sufficiently defend
  against amplification attacks. An issue in the DNS protocol has been found that allow malicious
  parties to use recursive DNS services to attack third party authoritative name servers. The
  attack uses a crafted reply by an authoritative name server to amplify the resulting traffic
  between the recursive and other authoritative name servers. Both types of service can suffer
  degraded performance as an effect. This is triggered by random subdomains in the NSDNAME in
  NS records. PowerDNS Recursor 4.1.16, 4.2.2 and 4.3.1 contain a mitigation to limit the impact
  of this DNS protocol issue.
