  - CVE-2023-22456
summary: ViewVC, a browser interface for CVS and Subversion version control repositories, as
  a cross-site scripting vulnerability that affects versions prior to 1.2.2 and 1.1.29. The
  impact of this vulnerability is mitigated by the need for an attacker to have commit privileges
  to a Subversion repository exposed by an otherwise trusted ViewVC instance. The attack vector
  involves files with unsafe names (names that, when embedded into an HTML stream, would cause
  the browser to run unwanted code), which themselves can be challenging to create. Users should
  update to at least version 1.2.2 (if they are using a 1.2.x version of ViewVC) or 1.1.29 (if
  they are using a 1.1.x version). ViewVC 1.0.x is no longer supported, so users of that release
  lineage should implement a workaround. Users can edit their ViewVC EZT view templates to manually
  HTML-escape changed paths during rendering. Locate in your template set's `revision.ezt` file
  references to those changed paths, and wrap them with `[format "html"]` and `[end]`. For most
  users, that means that references to `[changes.path]` will become `[format "html"][changes.path][end]`.
  (This workaround should be reverted after upgrading to a patched version of ViewVC, else changed
  path names will be doubly escaped.)
