  - CVE-2026-26994
summary: uTLS is a fork of crypto/tls, created to customize ClientHello for fingerprinting resistance
  while still using it for the handshake. In versions 1.6.7 and below, uTLS did not implement
  the TLS 1.3 downgrade protection mechanism specified in RFC 8446 Section 4.1.3 when using
  a uTLS ClientHello spec. This allowed an active network adversary to downgrade TLS 1.3 connections
  initiated by a uTLS client to a lower TLS version (e.g., TLS 1.2) by modifying the ClientHello
  message to exclude the SupportedVersions extension, causing the server to respond with a TLS
  1.2 ServerHello (along with a downgrade canary in the ServerHello random field). Because uTLS
  did not check the downgrade canary in the ServerHello random field, clients would accept the
  downgraded connection without detecting the attack. This attack could also be used by an active
  network attacker to fingerprint uTLS connections. This issue has been fixed in version 1.7.0.
