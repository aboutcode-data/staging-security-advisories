  - CVE-2020-15567
summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing Intel guest OS users to gain
  privileges or cause a denial of service because of non-atomic modification of a live EPT PTE.
  When mapping guest EPT (nested paging) tables, Xen would in some circumstances use a series
  of non-atomic bitfield writes. Depending on the compiler version and optimisation flags, Xen
  might expose a dangerous partially written PTE to the hardware, which an attacker might be
  able to race to exploit. A guest administrator or perhaps even an unprivileged guest user
  might be able to cause denial of service, data corruption, or privilege escalation. Only systems
  using Intel CPUs are vulnerable. Systems using AMD CPUs, and Arm systems, are not vulnerable.
  Only systems using nested paging (hap, aka nested paging, aka in this case Intel EPT) are
  vulnerable. Only HVM and PVH guests can exploit the vulnerability. The presence and scope
  of the vulnerability depends on the precise optimisations performed by the compiler used to
  build Xen. If the compiler generates (a) a single 64-bit write, or (b) a series of read-modify-write
  operations in the same order as the source code, the hypervisor is not vulnerable. For example,
  in one test build using GCC 8.3 with normal settings, the compiler generated multiple (unlocked)
  read-modify-write operations in source-code order, which did not constitute a vulnerability.
  We have not been able to survey compilers; consequently we cannot say which compiler(s) might
  produce vulnerable code (with which code-generation options). The source code clearly violates
  the C rules, and thus should be considered vulnerable.
