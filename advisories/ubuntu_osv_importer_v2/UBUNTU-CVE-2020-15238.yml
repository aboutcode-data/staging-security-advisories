  - CVE-2020-15238
summary: Blueman is a GTK+ Bluetooth Manager. In Blueman before 2.1.4, the DhcpClient method
  of the D-Bus interface to blueman-mechanism is prone to an argument injection vulnerability.
  The impact highly depends on the system configuration. If Polkit-1 is disabled and for versions
  lower than 2.0.6, any local user can possibly exploit this. If Polkit-1 is enabled for version
  2.0.6 and later, a possible attacker needs to be allowed to use the `org.blueman.dhcp.client`
  action. That is limited to users in the wheel group in the shipped rules file that do have
  the privileges anyway. On systems with ISC DHCP client (dhclient), attackers can pass arguments
  to `ip link` with the interface name that can e.g. be used to bring down an interface or add
  an arbitrary XDP/BPF program. On systems with dhcpcd and without ISC DHCP client, attackers
  can even run arbitrary scripts by passing `-c/path/to/script` as an interface name. Patches
  are included in 2.1.4 and master that change the DhcpClient D-Bus method(s) to accept BlueZ
  network object paths instead of network interface names. A backport to 2.0(.8) is also available.
  As a workaround, make sure that Polkit-1-support is enabled and limit privileges for the `org.blueman.dhcp.client`
  action to users that are able to run arbitrary commands as root anyway in /usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d/blueman.rules.
