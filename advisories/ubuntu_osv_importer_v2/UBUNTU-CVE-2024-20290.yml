aliases:
  - CVE-2024-20290
summary: A vulnerability in the OLE2 file format parser of ClamAV could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.   This
  vulnerability is due to an incorrect check for end-of-string values during scanning, which
  may result in a heap buffer over-read. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting
  a crafted file containing OLE2 content to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to terminate, resulting
  in a DoS condition on the affected software and consuming available system resources.   For
  a description of this vulnerability, see the ClamAV blog .
