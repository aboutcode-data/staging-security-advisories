  - CVE-2021-29623
summary: Exiv2 is a C++ library and a command-line utility to read, write, delete and modify
  Exif, IPTC, XMP and ICC image metadata. A read of uninitialized memory was found in Exiv2
  versions v0.27.3 and earlier. Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading,
  writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. The read of uninitialized memory
  is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker
  could potentially exploit the vulnerability to leak a few bytes of stack memory, if they can
  trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4.
