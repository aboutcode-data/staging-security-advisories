summary: JupyterHub is software that allows one to create a multi-user server for Jupyter notebooks.
  Prior to versions 4.1.6 and 5.1.0, if a user is granted the `admin:users` scope, they may
  escalate their own privileges by making themselves a full admin user. The impact is relatively
  small in that `admin:users` is already an extremely privileged scope only granted to trusted
  users. In effect, `admin:users` is equivalent to `admin=True`, which is not intended. Note
  that the change here only prevents escalation to the built-in JupyterHub admin role that has
  unrestricted permissions. It does not prevent users with e.g. `groups` permissions from granting
  themselves or other users permissions via group membership, which is intentional. Versions
  4.1.6 and 5.1.0 fix this issue.
