summary: 'Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation contains
  a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications running on PowerPC CPU based platforms
  if the CPU provides vector instructions. Impact summary: If an attacker can influence whether
  the POLY1305 MAC algorithm is used, the application state might be corrupted with various
  application dependent consequences. The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation
  in OpenSSL for PowerPC CPUs restores the contents of vector registers in a different order
  than they are saved. Thus the contents of some of these vector registers are corrupted when
  returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only on newer PowerPC processors supporting
  the PowerISA 2.07 instructions. The consequences of this kind of internal application state
  corruption can be various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not depend
  on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst consequences, where the
  attacker could get complete control of the application process. However unless the compiler
  uses the vector registers for storing pointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would
  be an incorrect result of some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a
  denial of service. The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the CHACHA20-POLY1305
  AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data) algorithm. The most common usage of this
  AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol versions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server
  a malicious client can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used. This implies that TLS server
  applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However we are currently not aware
  of any concrete application that would be affected by this issue therefore we consider this
  a Low severity security issue.'
