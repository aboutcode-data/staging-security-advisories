  - CVE-2024-45405
summary: '`gix-path` is a crate of the `gitoxide` project (an implementation of `git` written
  in Rust) dealing paths and their conversions. Prior to version 0.10.11, `gix-path` runs `git`
  to find the path of a configuration file associated with the `git` installation, but improperly
  resolves paths containing unusual or non-ASCII characters, in rare cases enabling a local
  attacker to inject configuration leading to code execution. Version 0.10.11 contains a patch
  for the issue. In `gix_path::env`, the underlying implementation of the `installation_config`
  and `installation_config_prefix` functions calls `git config -l --show-origin` to find the
  path of a file to treat as belonging to the `git` installation. Affected versions of `gix-path`
  do not pass `-z`/`--null` to cause `git` to report literal paths. Instead, to cover the occasional
  case that `git` outputs a quoted path, they attempt to parse the path by stripping the quotation
  marks. The problem is that, when a path is quoted, it may change in substantial ways beyond
  the concatenation of quotation marks. If not reversed, these changes can result in another
  valid path that is not equivalent to the original. On a single-user system, it is not possible
  to exploit this, unless `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM` and `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` have been set to unusual
  values or Git has been installed in an unusual way. Such a scenario is not expected. Exploitation
  is unlikely even on a multi-user system, though it is plausible in some uncommon configurations
  or use cases. In general, exploitation is more likely to succeed if users are expected to
  install `git` themselves, and are likely to do so in predictable locations; locations where
  `git` is installed, whether due to usernames in their paths or otherwise, contain characters
  that `git` quotes by default in paths, such as non-English letters and accented letters; a
  custom `system`-scope configuration file is specified with the `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM` environment
  variable, and its path is in an unusual location or has strangely named components; or a `system`-scope
  configuration file is absent, empty, or suppressed by means other than `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM`.
  Currently, `gix-path` can treat a `global`-scope configuration file as belonging to the installation
  if no higher scope configuration file is available. This increases the likelihood of exploitation
  even on a system where `git` is installed system-wide in an ordinary way. However, exploitation
  is expected to be very difficult even under any combination of those factors.'
