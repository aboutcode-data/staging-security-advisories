  - CVE-2026-27572
summary: Wasmtime is a runtime for WebAssembly. Prior to versions 24.0.6, 36.0.6, 4.0.04, 41.0.4,
  and 42.0.0, Wasmtime's implementation of the `wasi:http/types.fields` resource is susceptible
  to panics when too many fields are added to the set of headers. Wasmtime's implementation
  in the `wasmtime-wasi-http` crate is backed by a data structure which panics when it reaches
  excessive capacity and this condition was not handled gracefully in Wasmtime. Panicking in
  a WASI implementation is a Denial of Service vector for embedders and is treated as a security
  vulnerability in Wasmtime. Wasmtime 24.0.6, 36.0.6, 40.0.4, 41.0.4, and 42.0.0 patch this
  vulnerability and return a trap to the guest instead of panicking. There are no known workarounds
  at this time. Embedders are encouraged to update to a patched version of Wasmtime.
