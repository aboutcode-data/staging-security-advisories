  - CVE-2026-21725
summary: 'A time-of-create-to-time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability lets recently deleted-then-recreated
  data sources be re-deleted without permission to do so. This requires several very stringent
  conditions to be met: - The attacker must have admin access to the specific datasource prior
  to its first deletion. - Upon deletion, all steps within the attack must happen within the
  next 30 seconds and on the same pod of Grafana. - The attacker must delete the datasource,
  then someone must recreate it. - The new datasource must not have the attacker as an admin.
  - The new datasource must have the same UID as the prior datasource. These are randomised
  by default. - The datasource can now be re-deleted by the attacker. - Once 30 seconds are
  up, the attack is spent and cannot be repeated. - No datasource with any other UID can be
  attacked.'
