summary: minimatch is a minimal matching utility for converting glob expressions into JavaScript
  RegExp objects. Prior to version 10.2.3, 9.0.7, 8.0.6, 7.4.8, 6.2.2, 5.1.8, 4.2.5, and 3.1.3,
  `matchOne()` performs unbounded recursive backtracking when a glob pattern contains multiple
  non-adjacent `**` (GLOBSTAR) segments and the input path does not match. The time complexity
  is O(C(n, k)) -- binomial -- where `n` is the number of path segments and `k` is the number
  of globstars. With k=11 and n=30, a call to the default `minimatch()` API stalls for roughly
  5 seconds. With k=13, it exceeds 15 seconds. No memoization or call budget exists to bound
  this behavior. Any application where an attacker can influence the glob pattern passed to
  `minimatch()` is vulnerable. The realistic attack surface includes build tools and task runners
  that accept user-supplied glob arguments (ESLint, Webpack, Rollup config), multi-tenant systems
  where one tenant configures glob-based rules that run in a shared process, admin or developer
  interfaces that accept ignore-rule or filter configuration as globs, and CI/CD pipelines that
  evaluate user-submitted config files containing glob patterns. An attacker who can place a
  crafted pattern into any of these paths can stall the Node.js event loop for tens of seconds
  per invocation. The pattern is 56 bytes for a 5-second stall and does not require authentication
  in contexts where pattern input is part of the feature. Versions 10.2.3, 9.0.7, 8.0.6, 7.4.8,
  6.2.2, 5.1.8, 4.2.5, and 3.1.3 fix the issue.
