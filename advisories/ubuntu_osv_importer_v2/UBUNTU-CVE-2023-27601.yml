  - CVE-2023-27601
summary: 'OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation. Prior to versions
  3.1.7 and 3.2.4, OpenSIPS crashes when a malformed SDP body is received and is processed by
  the `delete_sdp_line` function in the sipmsgops module. This issue can be reproduced by calling
  the function with an SDP body that does not terminate by a line feed (i.e. `\n`). The vulnerability
  was found while performing black-box fuzzing against an OpenSIPS server running a configuration
  that made use of the functions `codec_delete_except_re` and `codec_delete_re`. The same issue
  was also discovered while performing coverage guided fuzzing on the function `codec_delete_except_re`.
  The crash happens because the function `delete_sdp_line` expects that an SDP line is terminated
  by a line feed (`\n`): By abusing this vulnerability, an attacker is able to crash the server.
  It affects configurations containing functions that rely on the affected code, such as the
  function `codec_delete_except_re`. Due to the sanity check that is performed in the `del_lump`
  function, exploitation of this issue will generate an `abort` in the lumps processing function,
  resulting in a Denial of Service. This issue has been fixed in versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4.'
