summary: 'Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. Incorrect error handling
  for some invalid HTTP priority headers resulted in incomplete clean-up of the failed request
  which created a memory leak. A large number of such requests could trigger an OutOfMemoryException
  resulting in a denial of service. This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 9.0.76 through 9.0.102,
  from 10.1.10 through 10.1.39, from 11.0.0-M2 through 11.0.5. The following versions were EOL
  at the time the CVE was created but are known to be affected: 8.5.90 though 8.5.100. Users
  are recommended to upgrade to version 9.0.104, 10.1.40 or 11.0.6 which fix the issue.'
