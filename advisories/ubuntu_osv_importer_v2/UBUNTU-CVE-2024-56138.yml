  - CVE-2024-56138
summary: notion-go is a collection of libraries for supporting sign and verify OCI artifacts.
  Based on Notary Project specifications. This issue was identified during Quarkslab's audit
  of the timestamp feature. During the timestamp signature generation, the revocation status
  of the certificate(s) used to generate the timestamp signature was not verified. During timestamp
  signature generation, notation-go did not check the revocation status of the certificate chain
  used by the TSA. This oversight creates a vulnerability that could be exploited through a
  Man-in-The-Middle attack. An attacker could potentially use a compromised, intermediate, or
  revoked leaf certificate to generate a malicious countersignature, which would then be accepted
  and stored by `notation`. This could lead to denial of service scenarios, particularly in
  CI/CD environments during signature verification processes because timestamp signature would
  fail due to the presence of a revoked certificate(s) potentially disrupting operations. This
  issue has been addressed in release version 1.3.0-rc.2 and all users are advised to upgrade.
  There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
