  - CVE-2022-21702
summary: 'Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In affected versions
  an attacker could serve HTML content thru the Grafana datasource or plugin proxy and trick
  a user to visit this HTML page using a specially crafted link and execute a Cross-site Scripting
  (XSS) attack. The attacker could either compromise an existing datasource for a specific Grafana
  instance or either set up its own public service and instruct anyone to set it up in their
  Grafana instance. To be impacted, all of the following must be applicable. For the data source
  proxy: A Grafana HTTP-based datasource configured with Server as Access Mode and a URL set,
  the attacker has to be in control of the HTTP server serving the URL of above datasource,
  and a specially crafted link pointing at the attacker controlled data source must be clicked
  on by an authenticated user. For the plugin proxy: A Grafana HTTP-based app plugin configured
  and enabled with a URL set, the attacker has to be in control of the HTTP server serving the
  URL of above app, and a specially crafted link pointing at the attacker controlled plugin
  must be clocked on by an authenticated user. For the backend plugin resource: An attacker
  must be able to navigate an authenticated user to a compromised plugin through a crafted link.
  Users are advised to update to a patched version. There are no known workarounds for this
  vulnerability.'
