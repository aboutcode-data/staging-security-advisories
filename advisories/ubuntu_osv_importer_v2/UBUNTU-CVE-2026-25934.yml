  - CVE-2026-25934
summary: go-git is a highly extensible git implementation library written in pure Go. Prior
  to 5.16.5, a vulnerability was discovered in go-git whereby data integrity values for .pack
  and .idx files were not properly verified. This resulted in go-git potentially consuming corrupted
  files, which would likely result in unexpected errors such as object not found. For context,
  clients fetch packfiles from upstream Git servers. Those files contain a checksum of their
  contents, so that clients can perform integrity checks before consuming it. The pack indexes
  (.idx) are generated locally by go-git, or the git cli, when new .pack files are received
  and processed. The integrity checks for both files were not being verified correctly. This
  vulnerability is fixed in 5.16.5.
