  - CVE-2020-25684
summary: A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. When getting a reply from a forwarded
  query, dnsmasq checks in the forward.c:reply_query() if the reply destination address/port
  is used by the pending forwarded queries. However, it does not use the address/port to retrieve
  the exact forwarded query, substantially reducing the number of attempts an attacker on the
  network would have to perform to forge a reply and get it accepted by dnsmasq. This issue
  contrasts with RFC5452, which specifies a query's attributes that all must be used to match
  a reply. This flaw allows an attacker to perform a DNS Cache Poisoning attack. If chained
  with CVE-2020-25685 or CVE-2020-25686, the attack complexity of a successful attack is reduced.
  The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.
