  - CVE-2026-27830
summary: c3p0, a JDBC Connection pooling library, is vulnerable to attack via maliciously crafted
  Java-serialized objects and `javax.naming.Reference` instances. Several c3p0 `ConnectionPoolDataSource`
  implementations have a property called `userOverridesAsString` which conceptually represents
  a `Map<String,Map<String,String>>`. Prior to v0.12.0, that property was maintained as a hex-encoded
  serialized object. Any attacker able to reset this property, on an existing `ConnectionPoolDataSource`
  or via maliciously crafted serialized objects or `javax.naming.Reference` instances could
  be tailored execute unexpected code on the application's `CLASSPATH`. The danger of this vulnerability
  was strongly magnified by vulnerabilities in c3p0's main dependency, mchange-commons-java.
  This library includes code that mirrors early implementations of JNDI functionality, including
  ungated support for remote `factoryClassLocation` values. Attackers could set c3p0's `userOverridesAsString`
  hex-encoded serialized objects that include objects "indirectly serialized" via JNDI references.
  Deserialization of those objects and dereferencing of the embedded `javax.naming.Reference`
  objects could provoke download and execution of malicious code from a remote `factoryClassLocation`.
  Although hazard presented by c3p0's vulnerabilites are exarcerbated by vulnerabilities in
  mchange-commons-java, use of Java-serialized-object hex as the format for a writable Java-Bean
  property, of objects that may be exposed across JNDI interfaces, represents a serious independent
  fragility. The `userOverridesAsString` property of c3p0 `ConnectionPoolDataSource` classes
  has been reimplemented to use a safe CSV-based format, rather than rely upon potentially dangerous
  Java object deserialization. c3p0-0.12.0+ and above depend upon mchange-commons-java 0.4.0+,
  which gates support for remote `factoryClassLocation` values by configuration parameters that
  default to restrictive values. c3p0 additionally enforces the new mchange-commons-java `com.mchange.v2.naming.nameGuardClassName`
  to prevent injection of unexpected, potentially remote JNDI names. There is no supported workaround
  for versions of c3p0 prior to 0.12.0.
