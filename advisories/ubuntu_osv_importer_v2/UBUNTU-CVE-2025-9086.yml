aliases:
  - CVE-2025-9086
summary: 1. A cookie is set using the `secure` keyword for `https://target`  2. curl is redirected
  to or otherwise made to speak with `http://target` (same    hostname, but using clear text
  HTTP) using the same cookie set  3. The same cookie name is set - but with just a slash as
  path (`path=\"/\",`).    Since this site is not secure, the cookie *should* just be ignored.
  4. A bug in the path comparison logic makes curl read outside a heap buffer    boundary The
  bug either causes a crash or it potentially makes the comparison come to the wrong conclusion
  and lets the clear-text site override the contents of the secure cookie, contrary to expectations
  and depending on the memory contents immediately following the single-byte allocation that
  holds the path. The presumed and correct behavior would be to plainly ignore the second set
  of the cookie since it was already set as secure on a secure host so overriding it on an insecure
  host should not be okay.
