summary: OpenTelemetry-Go Contrib is a collection of third-party packages for OpenTelemetry-Go.
  A handler wrapper out of the box adds labels `http.user_agent` and `http.method` that have
  unbound cardinality. It leads to the server's potential memory exhaustion when many malicious
  requests are sent to it. HTTP header User-Agent or HTTP method for requests can be easily
  set by an attacker to be random and long. The library internally uses `httpconv.ServerRequest`
  that records every value for HTTP `method` and `User-Agent`. In order to be affected, a program
  has to use the `otelhttp.NewHandler` wrapper and not filter any unknown HTTP methods or User
  agents on the level of CDN, LB, previous middleware, etc. Version 0.44.0 fixed this issue
  when the values collected for attribute `http.request.method` were changed to be restricted
  to a set of well-known values and other high cardinality attributes were removed. As a workaround
  to stop being affected, `otelhttp.WithFilter()` can be used, but it requires manual careful
  configuration to not log certain requests entirely. For convenience and safe usage of this
  library, it should by default mark with the label `unknown` non-standard HTTP methods and
  User agents to show that such requests were made but do not increase cardinality. In case
  someone wants to stay with the current behavior, library API should allow to enable it.
