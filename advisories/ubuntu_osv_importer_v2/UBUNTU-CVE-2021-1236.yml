  - CVE-2021-1236
summary: Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the Snort application detection
  engine that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the configured policies
  on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the detection algorithm. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets that would flow through an affected
  system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the configured policies and
  deliver a malicious payload to the protected network.
