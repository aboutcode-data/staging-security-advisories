summary: 'The gh cli is GitHub’s official command line tool. A security vulnerability has been
  identified in the GitHub CLI that could leak authentication tokens when cloning repositories
  containing `git` submodules hosted outside of GitHub.com and ghe.com. This vulnerability stems
  from several `gh` commands used to clone a repository with submodules from a non-GitHub host
  including `gh repo clone`, `gh repo fork`, and `gh pr checkout`. These GitHub CLI commands
  invoke git with instructions to retrieve authentication tokens using the `credential.helper`
  configuration variable for any host encountered. Prior to version `2.63.0`, hosts other than
  GitHub.com and ghe.com are treated as GitHub Enterprise Server hosts and have tokens sourced
  from the following environment variables before falling back to host-specific tokens stored
  within system-specific secured storage: 1. `GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN`, 2. `GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN`
  and 3. `GITHUB_TOKEN` when the `CODESPACES` environment variable is set. The result being
  `git` sending authentication tokens when cloning submodules. In version `2.63.0`, these GitHub
  CLI commands will limit the hosts for which `gh` acts as a credential helper to source authentication
  tokens. Additionally, `GITHUB_TOKEN` will only be used for GitHub.com and ghe.com. Users are
  advised to upgrade. Additionally users are advised to revoke authentication tokens used with
  the GitHub CLI and to review their personal security log and any relevant audit logs for actions
  associated with their account or enterprise'
