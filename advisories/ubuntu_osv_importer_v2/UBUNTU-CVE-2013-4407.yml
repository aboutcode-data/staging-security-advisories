aliases:
  - CVE-2013-4407
summary: HTTP::Body::Multipart in the HTTP-Body module for Perl (1.07 through 1.22, before 1.23)
  uses the part of the uploaded file's name after the first "." character as the suffix of a
  temporary file, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct attacks by leveraging
  subsequent behavior that may assume the suffix is well-formed.
