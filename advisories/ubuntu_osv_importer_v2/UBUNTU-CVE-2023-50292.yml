  - CVE-2023-50292
summary: 'Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed
  Code Resources vulnerability in Apache Solr. This issue affects Apache Solr: from 8.10.0 through
  8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.3.0. The Schema Designer was introduced to allow users to more
  easily configure and test new Schemas and configSets. However, when the feature was created,
  the "trust" (authentication) of these configSets was not considered. External library loading
  is only available to configSets that are "trusted" (created by authenticated users), thus
  non-authenticated users are unable to perform Remote Code Execution. Since the Schema Designer
  loaded configSets without taking their "trust" into account, configSets that were created
  by unauthenticated users were allowed to load external libraries when used in the Schema Designer.
  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.3.0, which fixes the issue.'
