  - CVE-2020-29484
summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. When a Xenstore watch fires, the xenstore
  client that registered the watch will receive a Xenstore message containing the path of the
  modified Xenstore entry that triggered the watch, and the tag that was specified when registering
  the watch. Any communication with xenstored is done via Xenstore messages, consisting of a
  message header and the payload. The payload length is limited to 4096 bytes. Any request to
  xenstored resulting in a response with a payload longer than 4096 bytes will result in an
  error. When registering a watch, the payload length limit applies to the combined length of
  the watched path and the specified tag. Because watches for a specific path are also triggered
  for all nodes below that path, the payload of a watch event message can be longer than the
  payload needed to register the watch. A malicious guest that registers a watch using a very
  large tag (i.e., with a registration operation payload length close to the 4096 byte limit)
  can cause the generation of watch events with a payload length larger than 4096 bytes, by
  writing to Xenstore entries below the watched path. This will result in an error condition
  in xenstored. This error can result in a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a crash of xenstored.
  A malicious guest administrator can cause xenstored to crash, leading to a denial of service.
  Following a xenstored crash, domains may continue to run, but management operations will be
  impossible. Only C xenstored is affected, oxenstored is not affected.
