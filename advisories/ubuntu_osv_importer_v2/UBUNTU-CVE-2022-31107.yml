  - CVE-2022-31107
summary: Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In versions 5.3
  until 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10, it is possible for a malicious user who has authorization
  to log into a Grafana instance via a configured OAuth IdP which provides a login name to take
  over the account of another user in that Grafana instance. This can occur when the malicious
  user is authorized to log in to Grafana via OAuth, the malicious user's external user id is
  not already associated with an account in Grafana, the malicious user's email address is not
  already associated with an account in Grafana, and the malicious user knows the Grafana username
  of the target user. If these conditions are met, the malicious user can set their username
  in the OAuth provider to that of the target user, then go through the OAuth flow to log in
  to Grafana. Due to the way that external and internal user accounts are linked together during
  login, if the conditions above are all met then the malicious user will be able to log in
  to the target user's Grafana account. Versions 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10 contain a
  patch for this issue. As a workaround, concerned users can disable OAuth login to their Grafana
  instance, or ensure that all users authorized to log in via OAuth have a corresponding user
  account in Grafana linked to their email address.
