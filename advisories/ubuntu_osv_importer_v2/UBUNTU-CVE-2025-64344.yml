  - CVE-2025-64344
summary: Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open Information
  Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. Prior to versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2, working
  with large buffers in Lua scripts can lead to a stack overflow. Users of Lua rules and output
  scripts may be affected when working with large buffers. This includes a rule passing a large
  buffer to a Lua script. This issue has been patched in versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2. A workaround
  for this issue involves disabling Lua rules and output scripts, or making sure limits, such
  as stream.depth.reassembly and HTTP response body limits (response-body-limit), are set to
  less than half the stack size.
