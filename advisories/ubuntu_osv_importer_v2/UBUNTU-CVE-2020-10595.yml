  - CVE-2020-10595
summary: pam-krb5 before 4.9 has a buffer overflow that might cause remote code execution in
  situations involving supplemental prompting by a Kerberos library. It may overflow a buffer
  provided by the underlying Kerberos library by a single '\0' byte if an attacker responds
  to a prompt with an answer of a carefully chosen length. The effect may range from heap corruption
  to stack corruption depending on the structure of the underlying Kerberos library, with unknown
  effects but possibly including code execution. This code path is not used for normal authentication,
  but only when the Kerberos library does supplemental prompting, such as with PKINIT or when
  using the non-standard no_prompt PAM configuration option.
