  - CVE-2022-24714
summary: Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework and command-line
  interface. Installations of Icinga 2 with the IDO writer enabled are affected. If you use
  service custom variables in role restrictions, and you regularly decommission service objects,
  users with said roles may still have access to a collection of content. Note that this only
  applies if a role has implicitly permitted access to hosts, due to permitted access to at
  least one of their services. If access to a host is permitted by other means, no sensible
  information has been disclosed to unauthorized users. This issue has been resolved in versions
  2.8.6, 2.9.6 and 2.10 of Icinga Web 2.
