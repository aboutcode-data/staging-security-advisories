summary: PHP-IMAP is a wrapper for common IMAP communication without the need to have the php-imap
  module installed / enabled. Prior to version 5.3.0, an unsanitized attachment filename allows
  any unauthenticated user to leverage a directory traversal vulnerability, which results in
  a remote code execution vulnerability. Every application that stores attachments with `Attachment::save()`
  without providing a `$filename` or passing unsanitized user input is affected by this attack.
  An attacker can send an email with a malicious attachment to the inbox, which gets crawled
  with `webklex/php-imap` or `webklex/laravel-imap`. Prerequisite for the vulnerability is that
  the script stores the attachments without providing a `$filename`, or providing an unsanitized
  `$filename`, in `src/Attachment::save(string $path, string $filename = null)`. In this case,
  where no `$filename` gets passed into the `Attachment::save()` method, the package would use
  a series of unsanitized and insecure input values from the mail as fallback. Even if a developer
  passes a `$filename` into the `Attachment::save()` method, e.g. by passing the name or filename
  of the mail attachment itself (from email headers), the input values never get sanitized by
  the package. There is also no restriction about the file extension (e.g. ".php") or the contents
  of a file. This allows an attacker to upload malicious code of any type and content at any
  location where the underlying user has write permissions. The attacker can also overwrite
  existing files and inject malicious code into files that, e.g. get executed by the system
  via cron or requests. Version 5.3.0 contains a patch for this issue.
