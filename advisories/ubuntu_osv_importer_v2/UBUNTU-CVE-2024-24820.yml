  - CVE-2024-24820
summary: Icinga Director is a tool designed to make Icinga 2 configuration handling easy. Not
  any of Icinga Director's configuration forms used to manipulate the monitoring environment
  are protected against cross site request forgery (CSRF). It enables attackers to perform changes
  in the monitoring environment managed by Icinga Director without the awareness of the victim.
  Users of the map module in version 1.x, should immediately upgrade to v2.0. The mentioned
  XSS vulnerabilities in Icinga Web are already fixed as well and upgrades to the most recent
  release of the 2.9, 2.10 or 2.11 branch must be performed if not done yet. Any later major
  release is also suitable. Icinga Director will receive minor updates to the 1.8, 1.9, 1.10
  and 1.11 branches to remedy this issue. Upgrade immediately to a patched release. If that
  is not feasible, disable the director module for the time being.
