  - CVE-2012-2657
summary: 'Buffer overflow in the SQLDriverConnect function in unixODBC 2.0.10, 2.3.1, and earlier
  allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) via a long string in the FILEDSN option.
  NOTE: this issue might not be a vulnerability, since the ability to set this option typically
  implies that the attacker already has legitimate access to cause a DoS or execute code, and
  therefore the issue would not cross privilege boundaries. There may be limited attack scenarios
  if isql command-line options are exposed to an attacker, although it seems likely that other,
  more serious issues would also be exposed, and this issue might not cross privilege boundaries
  in that context.'
