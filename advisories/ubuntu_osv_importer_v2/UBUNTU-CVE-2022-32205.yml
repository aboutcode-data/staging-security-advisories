  - CVE-2022-32205
summary: A malicious server can serve excessive amounts of `Set-Cookie:` headers in a HTTP response
  to curl and curl < 7.84.0 stores all of them. A sufficiently large amount of (big) cookies
  make subsequent HTTP requests to this, or other servers to which the cookies match, create
  requests that become larger than the threshold that curl uses internally to avoid sending
  crazy large requests (1048576 bytes) and instead returns an error.This denial state might
  remain for as long as the same cookies are kept, match and haven't expired. Due to cookie
  matching rules, a server on `foo.example.com` can set cookies that also would match for `bar.example.com`,
  making it it possible for a "sister server" to effectively cause a denial of service for a
  sibling site on the same second level domain using this method.
