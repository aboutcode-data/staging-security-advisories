summary: PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C language
  implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In version
  2.10 and earlier, PJSIP transport can be reused if they have the same IP address + port +
  protocol. However, this is insufficient for secure transport since it lacks remote hostname
  authentication. Suppose we have created a TLS connection to `sip.foo.com`, which has an IP
  address `100.1.1.1`. If we want to create a TLS connection to another hostname, say `sip.bar.com`,
  which has the same IP address, then it will reuse that existing connection, even though `100.1.1.1`
  does not have certificate to authenticate as `sip.bar.com`. The vulnerability allows for an
  insecure interaction without user awareness. It affects users who need access to connections
  to different destinations that translate to the same address, and allows man-in-the-middle
  attack if attacker can route a connection to another destination such as in the case of DNS
  spoofing.
