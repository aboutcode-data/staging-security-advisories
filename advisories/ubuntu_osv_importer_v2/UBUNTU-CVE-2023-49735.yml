aliases:
  - CVE-2023-49735
summary: '** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** The value set as the DefaultLocaleResolver.LOCALE_KEY
  attribute on the session was not validated while resolving XML definition files, leading to
  possible path traversal and eventually SSRF/XXE when passing user-controlled data to this
  key. Passing user-controlled data to this key may be relatively common, as it was also used
  like that to set the language in the ''tiles-test'' application shipped with Tiles. This issue
  affects Apache Tiles from version 2 onwards. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products
  that are no longer supported by the maintainer.'
