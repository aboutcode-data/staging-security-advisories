summary: '** DISPUTED ** JFreeChart v1.5.4 was discovered to be vulnerable to ArrayIndexOutOfBounds
  via the ''setSeriesNeedle(int index, int type)'' method. NOTE: this is disputed by multiple
  third parties who believe there was not reasonable evidence to determine the existence of
  a vulnerability. The submission may have been based on a tool that is not sufficiently robust
  for vulnerability identification.'
