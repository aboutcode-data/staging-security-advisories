  - CVE-2023-40743
summary: '** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** When integrating Apache Axis 1.x in an application,
  it may not have been obvious that looking up a service through "ServiceFactory.getService"
  allows potentially dangerous lookup mechanisms such as LDAP. When passing untrusted input
  to this API method, this could expose the application to DoS, SSRF and even attacks leading
  to RCE. As Axis 1 has been EOL we recommend you migrate to a different SOAP engine, such as
  Apache Axis 2/Java. As a workaround, you may review your code to verify no untrusted or unsanitized
  input is passed to "ServiceFactory.getService", or by applying the patch from https://github.com/apache/axis-axis1-java/commit/7e66753427466590d6def0125e448d2791723210
  . The Apache Axis project does not expect to create an Axis 1.x release fixing this problem,
  though contributors that would like to work towards this are welcome.'
