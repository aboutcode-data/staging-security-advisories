summary: Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by the Matrix.org
  Foundation. When users update their passwords, the new credentials may be briefly held in
  the server database. While this doesn't grant the server any added capabilities—it already
  learns the users' passwords as part of the authentication process—it does disrupt the expectation
  that passwords won't be stored in the database. As a result, these passwords could inadvertently
  be captured in database backups for a longer duration. These temporarily stored passwords
  are automatically erased after a 48-hour window. This issue has been addressed in version
  1.93.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
