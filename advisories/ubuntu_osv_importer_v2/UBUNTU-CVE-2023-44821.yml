summary: '** DISPUTED ** Gifsicle through 1.94, if deployed in a way that allows untrusted input
  to affect Gif_Realloc calls, might allow a denial of service (memory consumption). NOTE: this
  has been disputed by multiple parties because the Gifsicle code is not commonly used for unattended
  operation in which new input arrives for a long-running process, does not ship with functionality
  to link it into another application as a library, and does not have realistic use cases in
  which an adversary controls the entire command line.'
