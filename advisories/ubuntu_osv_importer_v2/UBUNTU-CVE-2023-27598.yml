  - CVE-2023-27598
summary: OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation. Prior to versions
  3.1.7 and 3.2.4, sending a malformed `Via` header to OpenSIPS triggers a segmentation fault
  when the function `calc_tag_suffix` is called. A specially crafted `Via` header, which is
  deemed correct by the parser, will pass uninitialized strings to the function `MD5StringArray`
  which leads to the crash. Abuse of this vulnerability leads to Denial of Service due to a
  crash. Since the uninitialized string points to memory location `0x0`, no further exploitation
  appears to be possible. No special network privileges are required to perform this attack,
  as long as the OpenSIPS configuration makes use of functions such as `sl_send_reply` or `sl_gen_totag`
  that trigger the vulnerable code. This issue has been fixed in versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4.
