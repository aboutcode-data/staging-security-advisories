summary: 'Waitress is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3. When using Waitress
  versions 2.1.0 and prior behind a proxy that does not properly validate the incoming HTTP
  request matches the RFC7230 standard, Waitress and the frontend proxy may disagree on where
  one request starts and where it ends. This would allow requests to be smuggled via the front-end
  proxy to waitress and later behavior. There are two classes of vulnerability that may lead
  to request smuggling that are addressed by this advisory: The use of Python''s `int()` to
  parse strings into integers, leading to `+10` to be parsed as `10`, or `0x01` to be parsed
  as `1`, where as the standard specifies that the string should contain only digits or hex
  digits; and Waitress does not support chunk extensions, however it was discarding them without
  validating that they did not contain illegal characters. This vulnerability has been patched
  in Waitress 2.1.1. A workaround is available. When deploying a proxy in front of waitress,
  turning on any and all functionality to make sure that the request matches the RFC7230 standard.
  Certain proxy servers may not have this functionality though and users are encouraged to upgrade
  to the latest version of waitress instead.'
