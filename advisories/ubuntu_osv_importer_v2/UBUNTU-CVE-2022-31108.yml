  - CVE-2022-31108
summary: Mermaid is a JavaScript based diagramming and charting tool that uses Markdown-inspired
  text definitions and a renderer to create and modify complex diagrams. An attacker is able
  to inject arbitrary `CSS` into the generated graph allowing them to change the styling of
  elements outside of the generated graph, and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information
  by using specially crafted `CSS` selectors. The following example shows how an attacker can
  exfiltrate the contents of an input field by bruteforcing the `value` attribute one character
  at a time. Whenever there is an actual match, an `http` request will be made by the browser
  in order to "load" a background image that will let an attacker know what's the value of the
  character. This issue may lead to `Information Disclosure` via CSS selectors and functions
  able to generate HTTP requests. This also allows an attacker to change the document in ways
  which may lead a user to perform unintended actions, such as clicking on a link, etc. This
  issue has been resolved in version 9.1.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade
  should ensure that user input is adequately escaped before embedding it in CSS blocks.
