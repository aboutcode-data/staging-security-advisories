summary: 'Git for Windows is a fork of Git containing Windows-specific patches. This vulnerability
  affects users working on multi-user machines, where untrusted parties have write access to
  the same hard disk. Those untrusted parties could create the folder `C:\.git`, which would
  be picked up by Git operations run supposedly outside a repository while searching for a Git
  directory. Git would then respect any config in said Git directory. Git Bash users who set
  `GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE` are vulnerable as well. Users who installed posh-gitare vulnerable
  simply by starting a PowerShell. Users of IDEs such as Visual Studio are vulnerable: simply
  creating a new project would already read and respect the config specified in `C:\.git\config`.
  Users of the Microsoft fork of Git are vulnerable simply by starting a Git Bash. The problem
  has been patched in Git for Windows v2.35.2. Users unable to upgrade may create the folder
  `.git` on all drives where Git commands are run, and remove read/write access from those folders
  as a workaround. Alternatively, define or extend `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` to cover the _parent_
  directory of the user profile, e.g. `C:\Users` if the user profile is located in `C:\Users\my-user-name`.'
