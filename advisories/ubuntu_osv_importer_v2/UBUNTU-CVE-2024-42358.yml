  - CVE-2024-42358
summary: PDFio is a simple C library for reading and writing PDF files. There is a denial of
  service (DOS) vulnerability in the TTF parser. Maliciously crafted TTF files can cause the
  program to utilize 100% of the Memory and enter an infinite loop. This can also lead to a
  heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability. An infinite loop occurs in the read_camp function by nGroups
  value. The ttf.h library is vulnerable. A value called nGroups is extracted from the file,
  and by changing that value, you can cause the program to utilize 100% of the Memory and enter
  an infinite loop. If the value of nGroups in the file is small, an infinite loop will not
  occur. This library, whether used as a standalone binary or as part of another application,
  is vulnerable to DOS attacks when parsing certain types of files. Automated systems, including
  web servers that use this code to convert PDF submissions into plaintext, can be DOSed if
  an attacker uploads a malicious TTF file. This issue has been addressed in release version
  1.3.1. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
