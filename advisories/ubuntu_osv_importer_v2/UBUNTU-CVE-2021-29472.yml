  - CVE-2021-29472
summary: Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. URLs for Mercurial repositories in the root
  composer.json and package source download URLs are not sanitized correctly. Specifically crafted
  URL values allow code to be executed in the HgDriver if hg/Mercurial is installed on the system.
  The impact to Composer users directly is limited as the composer.json file is typically under
  their own control and source download URLs can only be supplied by third party Composer repositories
  they explicitly trust to download and execute source code from, e.g. Composer plugins. The
  main impact is to services passing user input to Composer, including Packagist.org and Private
  Packagist. This allowed users to trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability has been
  patched on Packagist.org and Private Packagist within 12h of receiving the initial vulnerability
  report and based on a review of logs, to the best of our knowledge, was not abused by anyone.
  Other services/tools using VcsRepository/VcsDriver or derivatives may also be vulnerable and
  should upgrade their composer/composer dependency immediately. Versions 1.10.22 and 2.0.13
  include patches for this issue.
