aliases:
  - CVE-2023-6245
summary: 'The Candid library causes a Denial of Service while parsing a specially crafted payload
  with ''empty'' data type. For example,  if the payload is `record { * ; empty }` and the canister
  interface expects `record { * }` then the Rust candid decoder treats empty as an extra field
  required by the type.  The problem with the type empty is that the candid Rust library wrongly
  categorizes empty as a recoverable error when skipping the field and thus causing an infinite
  decoding loop. Canisters using affected versions of candid  are exposed to denial of service
  by causing the decoding to run indefinitely until the canister traps due to reaching maximum
  instruction limit per execution round. Repeated exposure to the payload will result in degraded
  performance of the canister. Note: Canisters written in Motoko are unaffected.'
