  - CVE-2025-27091
summary: 'OpenH264 is a free license codec library which supports H.264 encoding and decoding.
  A vulnerability in the decoding functions of OpenH264 codec library could allow a remote,
  unauthenticated attacker to trigger a heap overflow. This vulnerability is due to a race condition
  between a Sequence Parameter Set (SPS) memory allocation and a subsequent non Instantaneous
  Decoder Refresh (non-IDR) Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) unit memory usage. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious bitstream and tricking a victim user into
  processing an arbitrary video containing the malicious bistream. An exploit could allow the
  attacker to cause an unexpected crash in the victim''s user decoding client and, possibly,
  perform arbitrary commands on the victim''s host by abusing the heap overflow. This vulnerability
  affects OpenH264 2.5.0 and earlier releases. Both Scalable Video Coding (SVC) mode and Advanced
  Video Coding (AVC) mode are affected by this vulnerability. OpenH264 software releases 2.6.0
  and later contained the fix for this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade. There are
  no known workarounds for this vulnerability. ### For more information If you have any questions
