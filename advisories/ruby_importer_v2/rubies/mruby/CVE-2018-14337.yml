summary: |
  Signed integer overflow in mrb_str_format
  The CHECK macro in mrbgems/mruby-sprintf/src/sprintf.c in mruby
  1.4.1 contains a signed integer overflow, possibly leading to
  out-of-bounds memory access because the mrb_str_resize function
  in string.c does not check for a negative length.
