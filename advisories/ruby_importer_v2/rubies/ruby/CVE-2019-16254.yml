summary: |
  HTTP response splitting in WEBrick (Additional fix)
  If a program using WEBrick inserts untrusted input into the response header,
  an attacker can exploit it to insert a newline character to split a header,
  and inject malicious content to deceive clients.

  This is the same issue as CVE-2017-17742. The previous fix was incomplete,
  which addressed the CRLF vector, but did not address an isolated CR or an
  isolated LF.
