summary: |
  Private Ruby OpenSSL RSA key generation is always "1"
  The OpenSSL extension of Ruby (Git trunk) versions after
  2011-09-01 up to 2011-11-03 always generated an exponent value
  of '1' to be used for private RSA key generation. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to bypass or corrupt integrity
  of services, depending on strong private RSA keys generation
  mechanism.

  - "The fix was introduced via SVN revision 33633, resolving
    the faulty random exponent generation."
  - "fix was integrated into the Ruby 1.9.3 series"
