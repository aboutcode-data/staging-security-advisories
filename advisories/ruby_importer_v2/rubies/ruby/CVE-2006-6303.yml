summary: |
  Another DoS Vulnerability in CGI Library
  The read_multipart function in cgi.rb in Ruby before 1.8.5-p2 does
  not properly detect boundaries in MIME multipart content, which
  allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite
  loop) via crafted HTTP requests, a different issue than CVE-2006-5467.
