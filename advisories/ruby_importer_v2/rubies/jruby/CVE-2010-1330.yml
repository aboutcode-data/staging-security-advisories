  CVE-2010-1330 jruby: XSS in the regular expression engine when processing invalid UTF-8 byte sequences
  The regular expression engine in JRuby before 1.4.1, when $KCODE is set
  to 'u', does not properly handle characters immediately after a UTF-8 character,
  which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via
  a crafted string.
