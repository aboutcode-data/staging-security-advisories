summary: |
  Rubinius MurmurHash3 Implementation Hash Collision Remote DoS
  Rubinius contains a flaw related to the MurmurHash3 implementation that may
  allow a remote denial of service. The issue is triggered when hash values
  are computed without having the ability to cause hash collisions restricted.
  When sending specially crafted input to an application maintaining a hash
  table, a context-dependent attacker can cause a consumption of CPU resources.
  This will result in a loss of availability for the program.
