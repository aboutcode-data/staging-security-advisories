  SpawningKit exploits
  During the spawning of a malicious Passenger-managed application, SpawningKit
  in Phusion Passenger 5.3.x before 5.3.2 allows such applications to replace
  key files or directories in the spawning communication directory with
  symlinks. This then could result in arbitrary reads and writes, which in turn
  can result in information disclosure and privilege escalation.
