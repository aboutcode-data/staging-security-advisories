  Insecure Permissions in Phusion Passenger
  "An Insecure Permissions vulnerability in SpawningKit in Phusion Passenger
  5.3.x before 5.3.2 causes information disclosure in the following situation: given
  a Passenger-spawned application process that reports that it listens on a certain
  Unix domain socket, if any of the parent directories of said socket are writable
  by a normal user that is not the application''s user, then that non-application
  user can swap that directory with something else, resulting in traffic being redirected
  to a non-application user''s process through an alternative Unix domain socket."
