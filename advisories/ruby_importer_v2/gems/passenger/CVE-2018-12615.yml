summary: |
  Phusion Passenger incorrect permission assignment
  An issue was discovered in switchGroup() in agent/ExecHelper/ExecHelperMain.cpp
  in Phusion Passenger before 5.3.2. The set of groups (gidset) is not set correctly,
  leaving it up to randomness (i.e., uninitialized memory) which supplementary groups
  are actually being set while lowering privileges.
