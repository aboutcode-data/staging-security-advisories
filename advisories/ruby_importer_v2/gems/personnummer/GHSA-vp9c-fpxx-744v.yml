summary: |
  Validation bypass vulnerability
  # Impact
  This vulnerability impacts users who rely on the last four digits of personnummer to
  be a _real_ personnummer.

  # Workaround
  The issue arises from the regular expression allowing the first three digits in the
  last four digits of the personnummer to be 000, which is invalid. To mitigate this
  without upgrading, a check on the last four digits can be made to make sure it's
  not 000x.
