summary: |
  HTML injection/XSS in Sanitize
  When Sanitize gem is used in combination with libxml2 >= 2.9.2,
  a specially crafted HTML fragment can cause libxml2 to generate
  improperly escaped output, allowing non-whitelisted attributes to be
  used on whitelisted elements.

  This can allow HTML and JavaScript injection, which could result in XSS
  if Sanitize's output is served to browsers.
