summary: |
  Devise Gem for Ruby Unauthorized Access Using Remember Me Cookie
  Devise version before 3.5.4 uses cookies to implement a "Remember me"
  functionality. However, it generates the same cookie for all devices. If an
  attacker manages to steal a remember me cookie and the user does not change
  the password frequently, the cookie can be used to gain access to the
  application indefinitely.
