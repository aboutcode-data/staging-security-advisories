summary: |
  REXML denial of service vulnerability
  ### Impact

  The REXML gem before 3.3.6 has a DoS vulnerability when it parses an
  XML that has many deep elements that have same local name attributes.

  If you need to parse untrusted XMLs with tree parser API like
  `REXML::Document.new`, you may be impacted to this vulnerability.
  If you use other parser APIs such as stream parser API and SAX2
  parser API, this vulnerability is not affected.

  This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2024-43398.
  We strongly recommend upgrading the REXML gem.

  ### Patches

  The REXML gem 3.3.6 or later include the patch to fix the
  vulnerability.

  ### Workarounds

  Don't parse untrusted XMLs with tree parser API.

  ## Affected versions

  REXML gem 3.3.5 or prior
