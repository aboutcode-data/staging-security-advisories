  - GHSA-356j-hg45-x525
summary: |
  Potential CSV export data leak
  ### Impact

  In ActiveAdmin versions prior to 2.12.0, a concurrency issue was
  found that could allow a malicious actor to be able to access
  potentially private data that belongs to another user.

  The bug affects the functionality to export data as CSV files, and
  was caused by a variable holding the collection to be exported being
  shared across threads and not properly synchronized.

  The attacker would need access to the same ActiveAdmin application
  as the victim, and could exploit the issue by timing their request
  immediately before when they know someone else will request a CSV
  (e.g. via phishing) or request CSVs frequently and hope someone
  else makes a concurrent request.

  ### Patches

  Versions 2.12.0 and above fixed the problem by completely
  removing the shared state.
