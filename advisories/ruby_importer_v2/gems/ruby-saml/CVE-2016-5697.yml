  - CVE-2016-5697
  - GHSA-36p7-xjw8-h6f2
summary: |
  ruby-saml prior to version 1.3.0 is vulnerable to an XML signature wrapping attack
  in the specific scenario where there was a signature that referenced at the same time
  2 elements (but past the scheme validator process since 1 of the element was inside
  the encrypted assertion).

  ruby-saml users must update to 1.3.0, which implements 3 extra validations to
  mitigate this kind of attack.
