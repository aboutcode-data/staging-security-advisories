  Regression in JWT Signature Validation
  ### Overview
  Versions after and including `2.3.0` are improperly validating the JWT token signature when
  using the `JWTValidator.verify` method.  Improper validation of the JWT token signature when
  not using the default Authorization Code Flow can allow an attacker to bypass authentication
  and authorization.

  ### Am I affected?
  You are affected by this vulnerability if all of the following conditions apply:

  - You are using `omniauth-auth0`.
  - You are using `JWTValidator.verify` method directly OR you are not authenticating using the
    SDK’s default Authorization Code Flow.

  ### How to fix that?
  Upgrade to version `2.4.1`.

  ### Will this update impact my users?
  The fix provided in this version will not affect your users.
