summary: |
  Possible timing attack in derivation_endpoint
  ### Impact

  When using the `derivation_endpoint` plugin, it's possible for the attacker to use a timing attack
  to guess the signature of the derivation URL.

  ### Patches

  The problem has been fixed by comparing sent and calculated signature in constant time, using
  `Rack::Utils.secure_compare`. Users using the `derivation_endpoint` plugin are urged to upgrade
  to Shrine 3.3.0 or greater.

  ### Workarounds

  Users of older Shrine versions can apply the following monkey-patch after loading the `derivation_endpoint` plugin:

  ```rb
  class Shrine
    class UrlSigner
      def verify_signature(string, signature)
        if signature.nil?
          fail InvalidSignature, "missing \"signature\" param"
        elsif !Rack::Utils.secure_compare(signature, generate_signature(string))
          fail InvalidSignature, "provided signature does not match the calculated signature"
        end
      end
    end
  end
  ```
