summary: |
  Dependency Confusion in Bundler with Implicit Private Dependencies
  Bundler 1.16.0 through 2.2.9 and 2.2.11 through 2.2.17 sometimes chooses a
  dependency source based on the highest gem version number, which means that a
  rogue gem found at a public source may be chosen, even if the intended choice
  was a private gem that is a dependency of another private gem that is
  explicitly depended on by the application.
