summary: |
  Allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code into your application via any secondary Gem source declared in your Gemfile
  Bundler 1.x might allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary Ruby
  code into an application by leveraging a Gem name collision on a
  secondary source.

  Please note that this vulnerability only applies for Ruby
  projects using Bundler < 2.0 with Gemfiles having 2 or more
  "source" lines.

  In other words, if the user's Gemfile does not use multiple
  sources, this vulnerability can be ignored.
