summary: |
  RCE vulnerability with .rdoc_options in RDoc
  An issue was discovered in RDoc 6.3.3 through 6.6.2, as distributed in Ruby
  3.x through 3.3.0.

  When parsing `.rdoc_options` (used for configuration in RDoc) as a YAML file,
  object injection and resultant remote code execution are possible because
  there are no restrictions on the classes that can be restored.

  When loading the documentation cache, object injection and resultant remote
  code execution are also possible if there were a crafted cache.

  We recommend to update the RDoc gem to version 6.6.3.1 or later. In order to
  ensure compatibility with bundled version in older Ruby series, you may
  update as follows instead:

  * For Ruby 3.0 users: Update to `rdoc` 6.3.4.1
  * For Ruby 3.1 users: Update to `rdoc` 6.4.1.1
  * For Ruby 3.2 users: Update to `rdoc` 6.5.1.1

  You can use `gem update rdoc` to update it. If you are using bundler, please
  add `gem "rdoc", ">= 6.6.3.1"` to your `Gemfile`.

  Note: 6.3.4, 6.4.1, 6.5.1 and 6.6.3 have a incorrect fix. We recommend to
  upgrade 6.3.4.1, 6.4.1.1, 6.5.1.1 and 6.6.3.1 instead of them.
