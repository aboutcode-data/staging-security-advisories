summary: |
  Cross-site Scripting (XSS) possible with maliciously formed HTML attribute names and values in Phlex
  There is a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that
  can be exploited via maliciously crafted user data. This was due
  to improper case-sensitivity in the code that was meant to prevent
  these attacks.

  ### Impact

  If you render an `<a>` tag with an `href` attribute set to a
  user-provided link, that link could potentially execute JavaScript
  when clicked by another user.

  ```ruby
  a(href: user_profile) { "Profile" }
  ```

  If you splat user-provided attributes when rendering any HTML or
  SVG tag, malicious event attributes could be included in the output,
  executing JavaScript when the events are triggered by another user.

  ```ruby
  h1(**JSON.parse(user_attributes))
  ```

  ### Patches

  Patches are [available on RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex)
  for all `1.x` minor versions. The patched versions are:

  - [1.9.1](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.9.1)
  - [1.8.2](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.8.2)
  - [1.7.1](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.7.1)
  - [1.6.2](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.6.2)
  - [1.5.2](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.5.2)
  - [1.4.1](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.4.1)
  - [1.3.3](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.3.3)
  - [1.2.2](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.2.2)
  - [1.1.1](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.1.1)
  - [1.0.1](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.0.1)

  If you are on `main`, it has been patched since
  [`aa50c60`](https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/commit/aa50c604cdee1d0ce7ef068a4c66cbd5d43f96a1)

  ### Workarounds

  Configuring a [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy)
  that does not allow [`unsafe-inline`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy#unsafe-inline)
  would effectively prevent this vulnerability from being exploited.

  ### References

  In addition to upgrading to a patched version of Phlex, we strongly
  recommend configuring a Content Security Policy header that does not
  allow `unsafe-inline`. Here’s how you can configure a Content Security
  Policy header in Rails.
