summary: |
  Phlex vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) via maliciously formed HTML attribute names and values
  There is a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that
  can be exploited via maliciously crafted user data.

  The reason these issues were not detected before is the escapes were
  working as designed. However, their design didn't take into account
  just how recklessly permissive browser are when it comes to executing
  unsafe JavaScript via HTML attributes.

  ### Impact

  If you render an `<a>` tag with an `href` attribute set to an
  user-provided link, that link could potentially execute JavaScript
  when clicked by another user.

  ```ruby
  a(href: user_profile) { "Profile" }
  ```

  If you splat user-provided attributes when rendering any HTML or SVG
  tag, malicious event attributes could be included in the output,
  executing JavaScript when the events are triggered by another user.

  ```ruby
  h1(**JSON.parse(user_attributes))
  ```

  ### Patches

  Patches are [available on RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex)
  for all minor versions released in the last year.

  - [1.10.2](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.10.2)
  - [1.9.3](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.9.3)

  If you are on `main`, it has been patched since
  [`da8f943`](https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/commit/da8f94342a84cff9d78c98bcc3b3604ee2e577d2)

  ### Workarounds

  Configuring a [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy)
  that does not allow [`unsafe-inline`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy#unsafe-inline)
  would effectively prevent this vulnerability from being exploited.

  ### References

  In addition to upgrading to a patched version of Phlex, we strongly
  recommend configuring a Content Security Policy header that does
  not allow `unsafe-inline`. Here’s how you can configure a Content
  Security Policy header in Rails.
