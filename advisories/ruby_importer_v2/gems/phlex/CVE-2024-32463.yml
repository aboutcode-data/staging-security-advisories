summary: |
  Cross-site Scripting (XSS) possible due to improper sanitisation of `href` attributes on `<a>` tags
  ### Summary

  There is a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited via maliciously crafted user data.

  Our filter to detect and prevent the use of the `javascript:` URL scheme in the `href` attribute of an `<a>` tag could be bypassed with tab `\t` or newline `\n` characters between the characters of the protocol, e.g. `java\tscript:`.

  ### Impact

  If you render an `<a>` tag with an `href` attribute set to a user-provided link, that link could potentially execute JavaScript when clicked by another user.

  ```ruby
  a(href: user_profile) { "Profile" }
  ```

  ### Mitigation

  The best way to mitigate this vulnerability is to update to one of the following versions:

  - [1.10.1](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.10.1)
  - [1.9.2](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.9.2)
  - [1.8.3](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.8.3)
  - [1.7.2](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.7.2)
  - [1.6.3](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.6.3)
  - [1.5.3](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.5.3)
  - [1.4.2](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.4.2)

  ### Workarounds

  Configuring a [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) that does not allow [`unsafe-inline`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy#unsafe-inline) would effectively prevent this vulnerability from being exploited.
