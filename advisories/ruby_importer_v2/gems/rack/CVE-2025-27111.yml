summary: |
  Escape Sequence Injection vulnerability in Rack lead to Possible Log Injection
  ## Summary

  `Rack::Sendfile` can be exploited by crafting input that
  includes newline characters to manipulate log entries.

  ## Details

  The `Rack::Sendfile` middleware logs unsanitized header values from
  the `X-Sendfile-Type` header. An attacker can exploit this by
  injecting escape sequences (such as newline characters) into the
  header, resulting in log injection.

  ## Impact

  This vulnerability can distort log files, obscure
  attack traces, and complicate security auditing.

  ## Mitigation

  - Update to the latest version of Rack, or
  - Remove usage of `Rack::Sendfile`.
