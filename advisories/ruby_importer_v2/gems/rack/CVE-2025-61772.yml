summary: |
  Rack's multipart parser buffers unbounded per-part headers, enabling DoS (memory exhaustion)
  ## Summary

  `Rack::Multipart::Parser` can accumulate unbounded data when a
  multipart part’s header block never terminates with the required
  blank line (`CRLFCRLF`). The parser keeps appending incoming bytes
  to memory without a size cap, allowing a remote attacker to exhaust
  memory and cause a denial of service (DoS).

  ## Details

  While reading multipart headers, the parser waits for `CRLFCRLF` using:

  ```ruby
  @sbuf.scan_until(/(.*?\r
  )\r
  /m)
  ```

  If the terminator never appears, it continues appending data
  (`@sbuf.concat(content)`) indefinitely. There is no limit on
  accumulated header bytes, so a single malformed part can consume
  memory proportional to the request body size.

  ## Impact

  Attackers can send incomplete multipart headers to trigger high memory
  use, leading to process termination (OOM) or severe slowdown. The
  effect scales with request size limits and concurrency. All
  applications handling multipart uploads may be affected.

  ## Mitigation

  * Upgrade to a patched Rack version that caps per-part header size
    (e.g., 64 KiB).

  * Until then, restrict maximum request sizes at the proxy or web
    server layer (e.g., Nginx `client_max_body_size`).
