summary: |
  Directory traversal in Rack::Directory app bundled with Rack
  There was a possible directory traversal vulnerability in the Rack::Directory app
  that is bundled with Rack.

  Versions Affected:  rack < 2.2.0
  Not affected:       Applications that do not use Rack::Directory.
  Fixed Versions:     2.1.3, >= 2.2.0

  Impact
  ------

  If certain directories exist in a director that is managed by
  `Rack::Directory`, an attacker could, using this vulnerability, read the
  contents of files on the server that were outside of the root specified in the
  Rack::Directory initializer.

  Workarounds
  -----------

  Until such time as the patch is applied or their Rack version is upgraded,
  we recommend that developers do not use Rack::Directory in their
  applications.
