  Denial of Service Vulnerability in Rack Content-Type Parsing
  There is a possible denial of service vulnerability in the content type
  parsing component of Rack. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE
  identifier CVE-2024-25126.

  Versions Affected: >= 0.4 Not affected: < 0.4 Fixed Versions: 3.0.9.1, 2.2.8.1

  # Impact

  Carefully crafted content type headers can cause Rack’s media type parser to
  take much longer than expected, leading to a possible denial of service
  vulnerability.

  Impacted code will use Rack’s media type parser to parse content type headers.
  This code will look like below:

  ```
  request.media_type

  ## OR
  request.media_type_params

  ## OR
  Rack::MediaType.type(content_type)
  ```

  Some frameworks (including Rails) call this code internally, so upgrading is
  recommended!

  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
  workarounds immediately.

  # Releases

  The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.

  # Workarounds

  There are no feasible workarounds for this issue.
