  ReDoS Vulnerability in Rack::Multipart handle_mime_head
  ### Summary

  There is a denial of service vulnerability in the
  Content-Disposition parsing component of Rack. This is very
  similar to the previous security issue CVE-2022-44571.

  ### Details

  Carefully crafted input can cause Content-Disposition header
  parsing in Rack to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly
  resulting in a denial of service attack vector. This header is
  used typically used in multipart parsing. Any applications that
  parse multipart posts using Rack (virtually all Rails applications)
  are impacted.
