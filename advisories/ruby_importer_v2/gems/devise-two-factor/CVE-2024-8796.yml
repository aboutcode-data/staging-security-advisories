  Devise-Two-Factor Authentication Uses Insufficient Default OTP Shared Secret Length
  ### Summary
  Under the default configuration, Devise-Two-Factor version
  >= 2.2.0 & < 6.0.0 generate TOTP shared secrets that are 120 bits
  instead of the 128-bit minimum defined by
  [RFC 4226](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4226).
  Using a shared secret shorter than the minimum to generate a
  multi-factor authentication code could make it easier for an
  attacker to guess the shared secret and generate valid TOTP codes.

  ### Remediation
  Devise-Two-Factor should be upgraded to version v6.0.0 as soon
  as possible. After upgrading, the length of shared secrets and
  TOTP URLs generated by the library will increase since the new
  shared secrets will be longer.

  If upgrading is not possible, you can override the default
  `otp_secret_length` attribute in the model when configuring
  `two_factor_authenticable` and set it to a value of at least
  26 to ensure newly generated shared secrets are at least
  128-bits long.

  After upgrading or implementing the workaround, applications
  using Devise-Two-Factor may wish to migrate users to the new
  OTP length to provide increased protection for those accounts.
  Turning off OTP for users by setting `otp_required_for_login`
  to false is not recommended since it would leave accounts
  unprotected. However, you may wish to implement application
  logic that checks the length of a user's shared secret and
  prompts users to re-enroll in OTP.

  ### Background
  Devise-Two-Factor uses [ROTP](https://github.com/mdp/rotp) to
  generate shared secrets for TOTP. In ROTP < 5.0.0, the first
  argument to the "ROTP::Base32#random_base32" function represented
  the number of bytes to read from SecureRandom which were then
  returned as a base32-encoded string. In ROTP 5.1.0, this function
  was changed so that the first argument now represents the length
  of the base32-encoded string returned by the function instead
  of the number of bytes to read from SecureRandom resulting in
  a shorter key being generated for the same input value.
