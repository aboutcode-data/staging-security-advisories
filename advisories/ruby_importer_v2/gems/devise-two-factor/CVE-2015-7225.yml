  - GHSA-x489-jjwm-52g7
summary: |
  devise-two-factor 1.1.0 and earlier vulnerable to replay attacks
  A OTP replay vulnerability in devise-two-factor 1.1.0 and earlier allows local
  attackers to shoulder-surf a user's TOTP verification code and use it to
  login after the user has authenticated.

  By not "burning" a previously used TOTP, devise-two-factor allows a narrow
  window of opportunity (aka the timestep period) where an attacker can re-use a
  verification code.

  Should an attacker possess a given user's authentication
  credentials, this flaw effectively defeats two-factor authentication for the
  duration of the timestep.
