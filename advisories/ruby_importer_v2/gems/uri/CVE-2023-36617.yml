  security fix for a ReDoS vulnerability. This vulnerability has
  been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2023-36617.

  Details

  A ReDoS issue was discovered in the URI component through 0.12.1
  for Ruby. The URI parser mishandles invalid URLs that have specific
  characters. There is an increase in execution time for parsing
  strings to URI objects with rfc2396_parser.rb and rfc3986_parser.rb.

  The uri gem version 0.12.1 and all versions prior 0.12.1 are
  vulnerable for this vulnerability.

  Recommended action

  We recommend to update the uri gem to 0.12.2.
  In order to ensure compatibility with bundled version in older
  Ruby series, you may update as follows instead:

  * For Ruby 3.0: Update to uri 0.10.3
  * For Ruby 3.1 and 3.2: Update to uri 0.12.2
    You can use gem update uri to update it. If you are using bundler,
    please add gem "uri", ">= 0.12.2" (or other version mentioned
    above) to your Gemfile.

  * Affected versions: uri gem 0.12.1 or before
