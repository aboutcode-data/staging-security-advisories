summary: |
  Remote code execution in Dragonfly
  An argument injection vulnerability in the Dragonfly gem before 1.4.0
  for Ruby allows remote attackers to read and write to arbitrary files via a crafted
  URL when the verify_url option is disabled. This may lead to code execution. The
  problem occurs because the generate and process features mishandle use of the ImageMagick
  convert utility.
