summary: |
  Uncontrolled Recursion in Loofah
  ## Summary

  Loofah `>= 2.2.0, < 2.19.1` uses recursion for sanitizing `CDATA` sections, making it susceptible to stack exhaustion and raising a `SystemStackError` exception.  This may lead to a denial of service through CPU resource consumption.

  ## Mitigation

  Upgrade to Loofah `>= 2.19.1`.

  Users who are unable to upgrade may be able to mitigate this vulnerability by limiting the length of the strings that are sanitized.
