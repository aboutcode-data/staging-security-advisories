summary: |
  Ember.js XSS Vulnerability With {{view "select"}} Options
  In general, Ember.js escapes or strips any user-supplied content before
  inserting it in strings that will be sent to innerHTML.  However, a
  change made to the implementation of the select view means that any
  user-supplied data bound to an option's label will not be escaped
  correctly.

  In applications that use Ember's select view and pass user-supplied
  content to the label, a specially-crafted payload could execute
  arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the current domain ("XSS").

  All users running an affected release and binding user-supplied data to
  the select options should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds
  immediately.
