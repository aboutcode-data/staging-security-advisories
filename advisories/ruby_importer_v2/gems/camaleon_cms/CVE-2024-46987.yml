summary: |
  Camaleon CMS vulnerable to arbitrary path traversal (GHSL-2024-183)
  A path traversal vulnerability accessible via MediaController's
  download_private_file method allows authenticated users to download
  any file on the web server Camaleon CMS is running on (depending
  on the file permissions).

  In the [download_private_file] method:

  ```ruby
  def download_private_file
    cama_uploader.enable_private_mode!

    file = cama_uploader.fetch_file("private/#{params[:file]}")

    send_file file, disposition: 'inline'
  end
  ```

  [download_private_file]: https://github.com/owen2345/camaleon-cms/blob/feccb96e542319ed608acd3a16fa5d92f13ede67/app/controllers/camaleon_cms/admin/media_controller.rb#L28

  The file parameter is passed to the [fetch_file] method of the
  CamaleonCmsLocalUploader class (when files are uploaded locally):

  ```ruby
  def fetch_file(file_name)
    raise ActionController::RoutingError, 'File not found' unless file_exists?(file_name)

    file_name
  end
  ```

  [fetch_file]: https://github.com/owen2345/camaleon-cms/blob/feccb96e542319ed608acd3a16fa5d92f13ede67/app/uploaders/camaleon_cms_local_uploader.rb#L27

  If the file exists it's passed back to the download_private_file method
  where the file is sent to the user via [send_file].

  [send_file]: https://github.com/owen2345/camaleon-cms/blob/feccb96e542319ed608acd3a16fa5d92f13ede67/app/controllers/camaleon_cms/admin/media_controller.rb#L33-L34

  ## Proof of concept

  An authenticated user can download the /etc/passwd file by visiting an URL such as:

      https://<camaleon-host>/admin/media/download_private_file?file=../../../../../../etc/passwd

  ## Impact

  This issue may lead to Information Disclosure.

  ## Remediation

  Normalize file paths constructed from untrusted user input before using
  them and check that the resulting path is inside the targeted directory.
  Additionally, do not allow character sequences such as `..` in untrusted
  input that is used to build paths.
