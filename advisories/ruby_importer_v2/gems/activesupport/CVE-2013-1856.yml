summary: |
  XML Parsing Vulnerability affecting JRuby users
  The ActiveSupport XML parsing functionality supports multiple
  pluggable backends. One backend supported for JRuby users is
  ActiveSupport::XmlMini_JDOM which makes use of the
  javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder class. In some JVM configurations
  the default settings of that class can allow an attacker to construct
  XML which, when parsed, will contain the contents of arbitrary URLs
  including files from the application server. They may also allow for
  various denial of service attacks. Action Pack
