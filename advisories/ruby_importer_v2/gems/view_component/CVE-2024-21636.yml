  - GHSA-wf2x-8w6j-qw37
summary: |
  view_component Cross-site Scripting vulnerability
  ### Impact
  _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_

  This is an XSS vulnerability that has the potential to impact
  anyone rendering a component directly from a controller with the
  view_component gem. Note that only components that define a
  [`#call` method](https://viewcomponent.org/guide/templates.html#call)
  (i.e. instead of using a sidecar template) are affected. The return
  value of the `#call` method is not sanitized and can include
  user-defined content.

  In addition, the return value of the
  [`#output_postamble` method](https://viewcomponent.org/api.html#output_postamble--string)
  is not sanitized, which can also lead to XSS issues.

  ### Patches
  _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_

  Versions 3.9.0 has been released and fully mitigates both the
  `#call` and the `#output_postamble` vulnerabilities.

  ### Workarounds
  _Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability
  without upgrading?_

  Sanitize the return value of `#call`, eg:

  ```ruby
  class MyComponent < ApplicationComponent
    def call
      html_escape("<div>#{user_input}</div>")
    end
  end
  ```
