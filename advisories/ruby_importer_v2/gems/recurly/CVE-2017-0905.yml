summary: |
  SSRF vulnerability in Recurly gem's Resource#find.
  If you are using the #find method on any of the classes that are derived from
  the Resource class and you are passing user input into that method, a
  malicious user can force the http client to reach out to a server under their
  control. This can lead to leakage of your private API key.

  Because of the severity of impact, we are recommending that all users upgrade
  to a patched version. We have provided a non-breaking patch for every 2.X
  version of the client.
