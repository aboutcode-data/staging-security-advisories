summary: |
  Prototype Pollution in lodash
  Versions of `lodash` before 4.17.12 are vulnerable to Prototype
  Pollution.  The function `defaultsDeep` allows a malicious user
  to modify the prototype of `Object` via
  `{constructor: {prototype: {...}}}` causing the addition or
  modification of an existing property that will exist on all objects.

  ## Recommendation

  Update to version 4.17.12 or later.
