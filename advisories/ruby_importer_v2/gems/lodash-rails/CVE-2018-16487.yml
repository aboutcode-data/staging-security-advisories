summary: |
  Prototype Pollution in lodash
  Versions of `lodash` before 4.17.11 are vulnerable to
  prototype pollution.

  The vulnerable functions are 'defaultsDeep', 'merge', and
  'mergeWith' which allow a malicious user to modify the
  prototype of `Object` via `{constructor: {prototype:
  {...}}}` causing the addition or modification of an existing
  property that will exist on all objects.

  ## Recommendation

  Update to version 4.17.11 or later.
