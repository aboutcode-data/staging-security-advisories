summary: |
  Prototype Pollution in lodash
  Versions of lodash prior to 4.17.19 are vulnerable to Prototype
  Pollution. The functions `pick`, `set`, `setWith`, `update`,
  `updateWith`, and `zipObjectDeep` allow a malicious user to
  modify the prototype of Object if the property identifiers are
  user-supplied. Being affected by this issue requires manipulating
  objects based on user-provided property values or arrays.

  This vulnerability causes the addition or modification of an
  existing property that will exist on all objects and may lead to
  Denial of Service or Code Execution under specific circumstances.
