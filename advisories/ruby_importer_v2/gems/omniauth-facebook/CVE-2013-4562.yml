summary: |
  omniauth-facebook Gem for Ruby Unspecified CSRF
  omniauth-facebook Gem for Ruby contains a flaw as HTTP requests do not
  require multiple steps, explicit confirmation, or a unique token when
  performing certain sensitive actions. By tricking a user into following
  a specially crafted link, a context-dependent attacker can perform a
  Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF / XSRF) attack causing the victim to
  perform an unspecified action.
