summary: |
  Paperclip Gem for Ruby vulnerable to content type spoofing
  There is an issue where if an HTML file is uploaded with a .html
  extension, but the content type is listed as being `image/jpeg`, this
  will bypass a validation checking for images. But it will also pass the
  spoof check, because a file named .html and containing actual HTML
  passes the spoof check.
