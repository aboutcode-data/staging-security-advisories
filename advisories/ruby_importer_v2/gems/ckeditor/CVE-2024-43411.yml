summary: |
  CKEditor4 low-risk cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability linked to potential domain takeover
  ### Affected Packages

  The issue impacts only editor instances with enabled [version notifications](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-versionCheck).

  Please note that this feature is disabled by default in all CKEditor 4 LTS versions. Therefore, if you use CKEditor 4 LTS, it is highly unlikely that you are affected by this vulnerability. If you are unsure, please [contact us](mailto:security@cksource.com).

  ### Impact

  A theoretical vulnerability has been identified in CKEditor 4.22 (and above). In a highly unlikely scenario where an attacker gains control over the https://cke4.ckeditor.com domain, they could potentially execute an attack on CKEditor 4 instances. Although the vulnerability is purely hypothetical, we have addressed it in CKEditor 4.25.0-lts to ensure compliance with security best practices.

  ### Patches

  The issue has been recognized and patched. The fix is available in version 4.25.0-lts.
