summary: |
  Smashing Cross-site Scripting vulnerability
  Smashing 1.3.4 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS). A URL for
  a widget can be crafted and used to execute JavaScript on the victim's computer.
  The JavaScript code can then steal data available in the session/cookies depending
  on the user environment (e.g. if re-using internal URL's for deploying, or cookies
  that are very permissive) private information may be retrieved by the attacker.
