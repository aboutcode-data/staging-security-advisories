summary: |
  Installing a malicious gem may lead to arbitrary code execution
  An issue was discovered in RubyGems 2.6 and later through 3.0.2. A crafted
  gem with a multi-line name is not handled correctly. Therefore, an attacker
  could inject arbitrary code to the stub line of gemspec, which is eval-ed by
  code in ensure_loadable_spec during the preinstall check.
