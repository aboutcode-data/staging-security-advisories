summary: |
  Sort order SQL injection via `direction` parameter in administrate
  In Administrate (rubygem) before version 0.13.0, when sorting by attributes
  on a dashboard, the direction parameter was not validated before being
  interpolated into the SQL query.

  This could present a SQL injection if the attacker were able to modify the
  direction parameter and bypass ActiveRecord SQL protections.

  Whilst this does have a high-impact, to exploit this you need access to the
  Administrate dashboards, which should generally be behind authentication.
