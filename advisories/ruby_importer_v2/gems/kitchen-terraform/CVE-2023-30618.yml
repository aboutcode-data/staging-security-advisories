summary: |
  Sensitive Terraform Output Values Printed At Info Logging Level In Kitchen-Terraform
  Summary
    Kitchen-Terraform v7.0.0 introduced a regression which caused all
    Terraform output values, including sensitive values, to be printed
    at the `info` logging level during the `kitchen converge` action.
    Prior to v7.0.0, the output values were printed at the `debug` level
    to avoid writing sensitive values to the terminal by default.

  ### Original Report
    @brettcurtis:
      Hopefully, I'm not doing something stupid here, but I'm seeing
      sensitive outputs printed in the kitchen output. You can check
      this action for an example: https://github.com/osinfra-io/terraform-google-project/actions/runs/4700065515/jobs/8334277309#step:5:215

      It's not really a sensitive value just used it as an example.
