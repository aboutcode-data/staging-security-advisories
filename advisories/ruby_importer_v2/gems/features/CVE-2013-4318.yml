summary: |
  Features Gem for Ruby /tmp/out.html Local XSS
  Features Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that allows a local cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attack. This flaw exists because the application does not validate
  certain input upon submission to /tmp/out.html. This may allow an attacker to create
  a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary script code in a user's
  browser within the trust relationship between their browser and the server.
