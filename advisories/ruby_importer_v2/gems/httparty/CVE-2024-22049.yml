summary: |
  httparty has multipart/form-data request tampering vulnerability
  HTTP multipart/form-data request tampering vulnerability in httparty < 0.20.0,
  due to lack of proper escaping of double quotes within the filename attribute
  of the Content-Disposition header. If the Content-Disposition header is set to
  "form-data" and contains the "filename" attribute, and the "filename"
  attribute contains a double quote followed by additional attributes, then
  those attributes will be parsed as Content-Disposition attributes and will
  override the Content-Disposition header's previous attributes.

      Content-Disposition: form-data; name="avatar"; filename="overwrite_name_field_and_extension.sh"; name="foo"; dummy=".txt"
