summary: |
  Google Sign-In for Rails allowed redirects to malformed URLs
  ### Summary

  It is possible to craft a malformed URL that passes the "same origin"
  check, resulting in the user being redirected to another origin.

  ### Details

  The google_sign_in gem persists an optional URL for redirection after
  authentication. If this URL is malformed, it's possible for the user
  to be redirected to another origin after authentication, possibly
  resulting in exposure of authentication information such as the token.

  Normally the value of this URL is only written and read by the library.
  If applications are configured to store session information in a
  database, there is no known vector to exploit this vulnerability.
  However, applications may be configured to store this information
  in a session cookie, in which case it may be chained with a session
  cookie attack to inject a crafted URL.

  ### Impact

  Rails applications configured to store the `flash` information in
  a session cookie may be vulnerable, if this can be chained with an
  attack that allows injection of arbitrary data into the session cookie.

  ### Workarounds

  If you are unable to upgrade this library, then you may mitigate
  the chained attack by explicitly setting `SameSite=Lax` or
  `SameSite=Strict` on the application session cookie.
