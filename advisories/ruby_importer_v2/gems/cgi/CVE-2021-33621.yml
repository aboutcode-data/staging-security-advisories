summary: |
  HTTP response splitting in CGI
  cgi.rb in Ruby through 2.6.x, through 3.0x, and through 3.1.x allows HTTP
  header injection. If a CGI application using the CGI library inserts
  untrusted input into the HTTP response header, an attacker can exploit it to
  insert a newline character to split a header, and inject malicious content to
  deceive clients.
