  - GHSA-4vf4-qmvg-mh7h
summary: |
  Cookie Prefix Spoofing in CGI::Cookie.parse
  The old versions of `CGI::Cookie.parse` applied URL decoding to cookie names.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to spoof security prefixes in
  cookie names, which may be able to trick a vulnerable application.

  By this fix, `CGI::Cookie.parse` no longer decodes cookie names. Note that
  this is an incompatibility if cookie names that you are using include
  non-alphanumeric characters that are URL-encoded.

  This is the same issue of CVE-2020-8184.

  If you are using Ruby 2.7 or 3.0:

  * Please update the cgi gem to version 0.3.1, 0.2,1, and 0.1,1 or later. You
    can use `gem update cgi` to update it. If you are using bundler, please add
    `gem "cgi", ">= 0.3.1"`` to your `Gemfile`.
  * Alternatively, please update Ruby to 2.7.5 or 3.0.3.

  If you are using Ruby 2.6:

  * Please update Ruby to 2.6.9. You cannot use `gem update cgi` for Ruby 2.6 or
    prior.
