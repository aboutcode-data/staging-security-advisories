summary: |
  Path Traversal in Sprockets
  Specially crafted requests can be used to access files that exist on
  the filesystem that is outside an application's root directory, when the
  Sprockets server is used in production.

  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately.

  Workaround:
  In Rails applications, work around this issue, set `config.assets.compile = false` and
  `config.public_file_server.enabled = true` in an initializer and precompile the assets.

   This work around will not be possible in all hosting environments and upgrading is advised.
