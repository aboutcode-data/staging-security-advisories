  - GHSA-9gj3-hwp5-pmwc
summary: |
  XSS in the `altField` option of the Datepicker widget in jquery-ui
  ### Impact
  Accepting the value of the `altField` option of the Datepicker
  widget from untrusted sources may execute untrusted code. For
  example, initializing the datepicker in the following way:
  ```js
  $("#datepicker").datepicker( {
    altField: "<img onerror='doEvilThing()' src='/404' >",
  } );
  ```
  will call the `doEvilThing` function.

  ### Patches
  The issue is fixed in jQuery UI 1.13.0. Any string value passed to
  the `altField` option is now treated as a CSS selector.

  ### Workarounds

  A workaround is to not accept the value of the `altField` option
  from untrusted sources.
