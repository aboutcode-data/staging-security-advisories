  Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity in rails-html-sanitizer
  ## Summary

  Certain configurations of rails-html-sanitizer `< 1.4.4` use an inefficient regular expression that is susceptible to excessive backtracking when attempting to sanitize certain SVG attributes. This may lead to a denial of service through CPU resource consumption.

  ## Mitigation

  Upgrade to rails-html-sanitizer `>= 1.4.4`.
