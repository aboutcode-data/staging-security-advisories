summary: |
  There is a possible XSS vulnerability in rails-html-sanitizer.  The gem allows
  non-whitelisted attributes to be present in sanitized output when input with
  specially-crafted HTML fragments, and these attributes can lead to an XSS attack
  on target applications.

  This issue is similar to CVE-2018-8048 in Loofah.
