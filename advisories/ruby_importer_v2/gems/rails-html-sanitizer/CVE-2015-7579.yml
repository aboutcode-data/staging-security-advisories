summary: |
  XSS vulnerability in rails-html-sanitizer
  There is a XSS vulnerability in `Rails::Html::FullSanitizer` used by Action View's `strip_tags`.
  This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2015-7579.

  Versions Affected:  1.0.2
  Not affected:       1.0.0, 1.0.1
  Fixed Versions:     1.0.3

  Impact
  ------
  Due to the way that `Rails::Html::FullSanitizer` is implemented, if an attacker
  passes an already escaped HTML entity to the input of Action View's `strip_tags`
  these entities will be unescaped what may cause a XSS attack if used in combination
  with `raw` or `html_safe`.

  For example:

      strip_tags("&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS')&lt;/script&gt;")

  Would generate:

      <script>alert('XSS')</script>

  After the fix it will generate:

      &lt;script&gt;alert('XSS')&lt;/script&gt;

  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
  workarounds immediately.

  Releases
  --------
  The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.

  Workarounds
  -----------
  If you can't upgrade, please use the following monkey patch in an initializer
  that is loaded before your application:

  ```
  $ cat config/initializers/strip_tags_fix.rb
  class ActionView::Base
    def strip_tags(html)
      self.class.full_sanitizer.sanitize(html)
    end
  end
  ```
