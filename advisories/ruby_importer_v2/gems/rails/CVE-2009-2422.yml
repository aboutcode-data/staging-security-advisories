summary: |
  High Security Vulnerability with authenticate_with_http_digest of Rails
  The example code for the digest authentication functionality
  (http_authentication.rb) in Ruby on Rails before 2.3.3 defines
  an authenticate_or_request_with_http_digest block that returns
  nil instead of false when the user does not exist, which allows
  context-dependent attackers to bypass authentication for
  applications that are derived from this example by sending an
  invalid username without a password.
