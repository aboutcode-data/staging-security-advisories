aliases:
  - CVE-2007-6077
  - GHSA-p4c6-77gc-694x
summary: |
  Moderate severity vulnerability that affects rails
  The session fixation protection mechanism in cgi_process.rb in
  Rails 1.2.4, as used in Ruby on Rails, removes the :cookie_only
  attribute from the DEFAULT_SESSION_OPTIONS constant, which
  effectively causes cookie_only to be applied only to the first
  instantiation of CgiRequest, which allows remote attackers to
  conduct session fixation attacks.

  NOTE: this is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-5380.
