summary: |
  Nokogiri gem, via libxml, is affected by DoS vulnerabilities
  The version of libxml2 packaged with Nokogiri contains a
  vulnerability. Nokogiri has mitigated these issue by upgrading to
  libxml 2.9.5.

  Wei Lei discovered that libxml2 incorrecty handled certain parameter
  entities. An attacker could use this issue with specially constructed XML
  data to cause libxml2 to consume resources, leading to a denial of service.
