summary: |
  Nokogiri gem contains a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in libxml2
  Nokogiri version 1.6.7.2 has been released, pulling in several upstream
  patches to the vendored libxml2 to address the following CVE:

  CVE-2015-7499
  CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0 (MEDIUM)

  Heap-based buffer overflow in the xmlGROW function in parser.c
  in libxml2 before 2.9.3 allows context-dependent attackers to
  obtain sensitive process memory information via unspecified
  vectors.

  libxml2 could be made to crash if it opened a specially crafted
  file. It was discovered that libxml2 incorrectly handled certain
  malformed documents. If a user or automated system were tricked
  into opening a specially crafted document, an attacker could
  possibly cause libxml2 to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
