summary: |
  Nokogiri gem, via libxml, is affected by DoS and RCE vulnerabilities
  The version of libxml2 packaged with Nokogiri contains several
  vulnerabilities. Nokogiri has mitigated these issues by upgrading to
  libxml 2.9.5.

  It was discovered that a type confusion error existed in libxml2. An
  attacker could use this to specially construct XML data that
  could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary
  code. (CVE-2017-0663)

  It was discovered that libxml2 did not properly validate parsed entity
  references. An attacker could use this to specially construct XML
  data that could expose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-7375)

  It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in libxml2 when
  handling HTTP redirects. An attacker could use this to specially
  construct XML data that could cause a denial of service or possibly
  execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-7376)

  Marcel Böhme and Van-Thuan Pham discovered a buffer overflow in
  libxml2 when handling elements. An attacker could use this to specially
  construct XML data that could cause a denial of service or possibly
  execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-9047)

  Marcel Böhme and Van-Thuan Pham discovered a buffer overread
  in libxml2 when handling elements. An attacker could use this
  to specially construct XML data that could cause a denial of
  service. (CVE-2017-9048)

  Marcel Böhme and Van-Thuan Pham discovered multiple buffer overreads
  in libxml2 when handling parameter-entity references. An attacker
  could use these to specially construct XML data that could cause a
  denial of service. (CVE-2017-9049, CVE-2017-9050)
