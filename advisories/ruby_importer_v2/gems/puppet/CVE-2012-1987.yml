summary: |
  Puppet Denial of Service and Arbitrary File Write
  A vulnerability in Puppet 2.6.x before 2.6.15 and 2.7.x before 2.7.13,
  and Puppet Enterprise (PE) Users 1.0, 1.1, 1.2.x, 2.0.x, and 2.5.x before 2.5.1
  allows remote authenticated users with agent SSL keys to **(1)** cause a denial
  of service (memory consumption) via a REST request to a stream that triggers a thread
  block, as demonstrated using CVE-2012-1986 and `/dev/random`; or **(2)** cause a
  denial of service (filesystem consumption) via crafted REST requests that use "a
  marshaled form of a `Puppet::FileBucket::File object`" to write to arbitrary file
  locations.
