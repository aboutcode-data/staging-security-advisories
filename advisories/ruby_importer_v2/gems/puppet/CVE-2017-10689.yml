summary: |
  Tarball permission preservation in puppet
  When installing a module using the system tar, the PMT will filter filesystem
  permissions to a sane value. This may just be based on the user's umask.

  When using minitar, files are unpacked with whatever permissions are in the
  tarball. This is potentially unsafe, as tarballs can be easily created with
  weird permissions.
