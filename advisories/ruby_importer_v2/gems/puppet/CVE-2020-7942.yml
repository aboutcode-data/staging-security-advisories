summary: |
  Improper Certificate Validation in Puppet
  Previously, Puppet operated on a model that a node with a valid certificate
  was entitled to all information in the system and that a compromised certificate
  allowed access to everything in the infrastructure. When a node's catalog falls
  back to the `default` node, the catalog can be retrieved for a different node by
  modifying facts for the Puppet run. This issue can be mitigated by setting
  `strict_hostname_checking = true` in `puppet.conf` on your Puppet master. Puppet
  6.13.0 changes the default behavior for strict_hostname_checking from false to
  true. It is recommended that Puppet Open Source and Puppet Enterprise users that
  are not upgrading still set `strict_hostname_checking` to `true` to ensure secure
  behavior.
