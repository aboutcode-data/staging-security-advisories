summary: |
  Password Pusher rate limiter can be bypassed by forging proxy headers
  ### Impact

  Password Pusher comes with a configurable rate limiter.
  In versions prior to [v1.49.0], the rate limiter could be bypassed by forging
  proxy headers allowing bad actors to send unlimited traffic to the site
  potentially causing a denial of service.

  ### Patches

  In [v1.49.0], a fix was implemented to only authorize proxies on local IPs which
  resolves this issue.

  If you are running a remote proxy, please see
  [this documentation](https://docs.pwpush.com/docs/proxies/#trusted-proxies)
  on how to authorize the IP address of your remote proxy.

  ### Workarounds

  It is highly suggested to upgrade to at least [v1.49.0] to mitigate this risk.

  If for some reason you cannot immediately upgrade, the alternative
  is that you can add rules to your proxy and/or firewall to not
  accept external proxy headers such as `X-Forwarded-*` from clients.

  ### References

  The new settings are [configurable to authorize remote proxies][1].
