aliases:
  - CVE-2025-45765
  - GHSA-6ch4-944p-wf7j
summary: |
  ruby-jwt < v3.0.0.beta1 was discovered to contain weak encryption.

  NOTE: the Supplier's perspective is "keysize is not something
  that is enforced by this library. Currently more recent versions
  of OpenSSL are enforcing some key sizes and those restrictions
  apply to the users of this gem also."

  ## BACKGROUND

  We found that the HMAC and RSA key lengths used in your JSON Web
  Signature (JWS) implementation do not meet recommended security
  standards (RFC 75180NIST SP800-1170RFC 2437).

  According to CWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength), using keys
  that are too short can lead to serious vulnerabilities and
  potential attacks.
