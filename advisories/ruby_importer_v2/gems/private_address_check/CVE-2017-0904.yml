summary: |
  private_address_check Ruby Gem Resolv.getaddresses Server-Side Request Forgery
  The private_address_check ruby gem before 0.4.0 is vulnerable to a bypass due to use of Ruby's
  Resolv.getaddresses method, which is OS-dependent and should not be relied upon for security
  measures, such as when used to blacklist private network addresses to prevent server-side
  request forgery.
