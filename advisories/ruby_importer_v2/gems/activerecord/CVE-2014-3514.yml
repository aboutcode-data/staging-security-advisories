summary: |
  Data Injection Vulnerability in Active Record
  The create_with functionality in Active Record was implemented incorrectly
  and completely bypasses the strong parameters protection. Applications which pass
  user-controlled values to create_with could allow attackers to set arbitrary attributes
  on models.
