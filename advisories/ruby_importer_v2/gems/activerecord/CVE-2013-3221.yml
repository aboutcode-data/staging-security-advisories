  - GHSA-f57c-hx33-hvh8
summary: |
  Data-type injection vulnerability
  The Active Record component in Ruby on Rails 2.3.x, 3.0.x, 3.1.x,
  and 3.2.x does not ensure that the declared data type of a database
  column is used during comparisons of input values to stored values
  in that column, which makes it easier for remote attackers to
  conduct data-type injection attacks against Ruby on Rails applications
  via a crafted value, as demonstrated by unintended interaction
  between the "typed XML" feature and a MySQL database.

  ## RELEASE INFO
  - Phrack writeup says that 'couple of days after the advisory the
    issue was "fixed" in Rails 3.2.12 as by the following commit' 921a296.
    But "Indeed the vector is completely fixed as of Rails 4.2 almost
    two years after the original advisory."
