summary: |
  CVE-2014-3483 rubygem-activerecord: SQL injection vulnerability in 'range' quoting
  SQL injection vulnerability in activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/postgresql/quoting.rb
  in the PostgreSQL adapter for Active Record in Ruby on Rails 4.x before 4.0.7 and
  4.1.x before 4.1.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands by
  leveraging improper range quoting. It was discovered that Active Record did not
  properly quote values of the range type attributes when using the PostgreSQL database
  adapter. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to conduct an SQL injection
  attack against applications using Active Record.
