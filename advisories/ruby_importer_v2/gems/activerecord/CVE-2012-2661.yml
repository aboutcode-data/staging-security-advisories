summary: |
  CVE-2012-2661 rubygem-activerecord: SQL injection when processing nested query paramaters
  The Active Record component in Ruby on Rails 3.0.x before 3.0.13, 3.1.x
  before 3.1.5, and 3.2.x before 3.2.4 does not properly implement the passing of
  request data to a where method in an ActiveRecord class, which allows remote attackers
  to conduct certain SQL injection attacks via nested query parameters that leverage
  unintended recursion, a related issue to CVE-2012-2695.
