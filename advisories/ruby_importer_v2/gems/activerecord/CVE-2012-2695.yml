summary: |
  SQL Injection Vulnerability in Ruby on Rails
  The Active Record component in Ruby on Rails before 3.0.14, 3.1.x
  before 3.1.6, and 3.2.x before 3.2.6 does not properly implement
  the passing of request data to a where method in an ActiveRecord
  class, which allows remote attackers to conduct certain SQL
  injection attacks via nested query parameters that leverage
  improper handling of nested hashes, a related issue to CVE-2012-2661.
