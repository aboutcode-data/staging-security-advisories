summary: |
  CVE-2013-0155 rubygem-actionpack, rubygem-activerecord: Unsafe Query Generation Risk in Ruby on Rails
  Ruby on Rails 3.0.x before 3.0.19, 3.1.x before 3.1.10, and 3.2.x before
  3.2.11 does not properly consider differences in parameter handling between the
  Active Record component and the JSON implementation, which allows remote attackers
  to bypass intended database-query restrictions and perform NULL checks or trigger
  missing WHERE clauses via a crafted request, as demonstrated by certain "[nil]"
  values, a related issue to CVE-2012-2660 and CVE-2012-2694.
