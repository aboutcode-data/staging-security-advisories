summary: |
  Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts in Sorcery
  ### Impact
  Brute force vulnerability when using password authentication via Sorcery.
  The brute force protection submodule will prevent a brute force attack for
  the defined lockout period, but once expired protection will not be re-enabled
  until a user or malicious actor logs in successfully. This does not affect users
  that do not use the built-in brute force protection submodule, nor users that use
  permanent account lockout.

  ### Patches
  Patched as of version `0.15.0`.

  ### Workarounds
  Currently no workarounds, other than monkey patching the authenticate method
  provided by Sorcery or upgrading to version `0.15.0`.
