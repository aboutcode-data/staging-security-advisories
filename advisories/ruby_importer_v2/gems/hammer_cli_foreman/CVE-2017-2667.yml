summary: |
  hammer_cli_foreman Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability
  Hammer CLI, a CLI utility for Foreman, before version 0.10.0, did not
  explicitly set the verify_ssl flag for apipie-bindings that disable it by default.
  As a result the server certificates are not checked and connections are prone to
  man-in-the-middle attacks.
