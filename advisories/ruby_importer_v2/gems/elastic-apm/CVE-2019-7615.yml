summary: |
  Elastic APM agent for Ruby vulnerable to Improper Certificate Validation
  A TLS certificate validation flaw was found in Elastic APM agent for
  Ruby versions before 2.9.0. When specifying a trusted server CA certificate via
  the `server_ca_cert` setting, the Ruby agent would not properly verify the certificate
  returned by the APM server. This could result in a man in the middle style attack
  against the Ruby agent.
