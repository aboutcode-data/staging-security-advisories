summary: |
  protobuf-java has a potential Denial of Service issue
  ## Summary
  A potential Denial of Service issue in `protobuf-java` core and lite was
  discovered in the parsing procedure for binary and text format data.
  Input streams containing multiple instances of non-repeated [embedded
  messages](http://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#embedded)
  with repeated or unknown fields causes objects to be converted back-n-forth
  between mutable and immutable forms, resulting in potentially long garbage
  collection pauses.

  Reporter: [OSS Fuzz](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=48771)

  Affected versions: This issue affects both the Java full and lite Protobuf
  runtimes, as well as Protobuf for Kotlin and JRuby, which themselves use the
  Java Protobuf runtime.
