summary: |
  GitLab Grit Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in the app/contexts/search_context.rb
  script. The issue is triggered when input passed via the code search box is not
  properly sanitized, which allows strings to be evaluated by the Bourne shell. This
  may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
