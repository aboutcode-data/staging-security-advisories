summary: |
  HashiCorp Vagrant has code injection vulnerability through default synced folders
  An authenticated virtual machine escape vulnerability exists in
  HashiCorp Vagrant versions 2.4.6 and below when using the default
  synced folder configuration. By design, Vagrant automatically mounts
  the host system’s project directory into the guest VM under /vagrant
  (or C:\vagrant on Windows). This includes the Vagrantfile configuration
  file, which is a Ruby script evaluated by the host every time a vagrant
  command is executed in the project directory. If a low-privileged
  attacker obtains shell access to the guest VM, they can append
  arbitrary Ruby code to the mounted Vagrantfile. When a user on the
  host later runs any vagrant command, the injected code is executed
  on the host with that user’s privileges.

  While this shared-folder behavior is well-documented by Vagrant, the
  security implications of Vagrantfile execution from guest-writable
  storage are not explicitly addressed. This effectively enables
  guest-to-host code execution in multi-tenant or adversarial VM scenarios.
