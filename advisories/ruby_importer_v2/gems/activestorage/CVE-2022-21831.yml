summary: |
  Possible code injection vulnerability in Rails / Active Storage
  There is a possible code injection vulnerability in the Active Storage module
  of Rails. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier
  CVE-2022-21831.

  Versions Affected:  >= 5.2.0
  Not affected:       < 5.2.0
  Fixed Versions:     7.0.2.3, 6.1.4.7, 6.0.4.7, 5.2.6.3

  Impact
  ------
  There is a possible code injection vulnerability in the Active Storage module
  of Rails.  This vulnerability impacts applications that use Active Storage
  with the image_processing processing in addition to the mini_magick back end
  for image_processing.

  Vulnerable code will look something similar to this:

  ```ruby
  <%= image_tag blob.variant(params[:t] => params[:v]) %>
  ```

  Where the transformation method or its arguments are untrusted arbitrary
  input.

  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
  workarounds immediately.

  Workarounds
  -----------
  To work around this issue, applications should implement a strict allow-list
  on accepted transformation methods or arguments.  Additionally, a strict image
  magick security policy will help mitigate this issue.
