summary: |
  Possible Sensitive Session Information Leak in Active Storage
  There is a possible sensitive session information leak in Active Storage.
  By default, Active Storage sends a `Set-Cookie` header along with the user’s
  session cookie when serving blobs. It also sets `Cache-Control` to public.
  Certain proxies may cache the `Set-Cookie`, leading to an information leak.

  This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2024-26144.

  Versions Affected: >= 5.2.0, < 7.1.0

  Not affected: < 5.2.0, >= 7.1.0

  Fixed Versions: 7.0.8.1, 6.1.7.7

  # Impact

  A proxy which chooses to caches this request can cause users to share
  sessions. This may include a user receiving an attacker’s session or vice
  versa.

  This was patched in 7.1.0 but not previously identified as a security
  vulnerability.

  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
  workarounds immediately.

  # Releases

  The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.

  # Workarounds

  Upgrade to Rails 7.1.X, or configure caching proxies not to cache the
  `Set-Cookie` headers.
