summary: |
  Reflective XSS Vulnerability in twitter-bootstrap-rails
  The twitter-bootstrap-rails Gem for Rails contains a flaw that enables a
  reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. This flaw exists because the
  bootstrap_flash helper method does not validate input when handling flash
  messages before returning it to users. This may allow a context-dependent
  attacker to create a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary
  script code in a user's browser session within the trust relationship between
  their browser and the server.
