  AlchemyCMS - Authenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) via eval injection in ResourcesHelper
  ### Summary

  A vulnerability was discovered during a manual security audit
  of the AlchemyCMS source code. The application uses the Ruby
  `eval()` function to dynamically execute a string provided by the
  `resource_handler.engine_name` attribute in
  `Alchemy::ResourcesHelper#resource_url_proxy`.

  ### Details

  The vulnerability exists in `app/helpers/alchemy/resources_helper.rb`
  at line 28. The code explicitly bypasses security linting with
  `# rubocop:disable Security/Eval`, indicating that the use of a
  dangerous function was known but not properly mitigated.

  Since `engine_name` is sourced from module definitions that can be
  influenced by administrative configurations, it allows an authenticated
  attacker to escape the Ruby sandbox and execute arbitrary system
  commands on the host OS.

  But, for this attack to be possible local file access to the alchemy
  project or the source on a remote server is necessary in order to
  manipulate the module config file, though.
