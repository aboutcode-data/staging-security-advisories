summary: |
  HTTP Request Smuggling in Agoo
  agoo through 2.12.3 allows request smuggling attacks where agoo is used
  as a backend and a frontend proxy also being vulnerable. It is possible to conduct
  HTTP request smuggling attacks by sending the Content-Length header twice. Furthermore,
  invalid Transfer Encoding headers were found to be parsed as valid which could be
  leveraged for TE:CL smuggling attacks.
