  - GHSA-q58g-455p-8vw9
summary: |
  Race condition when using persistent connections
  There was a race condition around persistent connections, where a connection
  which is interrupted (such as by a timeout) would leave data on the socket.
  Subsequent requests would then read this data, returning content from the
  previous response. The race condition window appears to be short, and it
  would be difficult to purposefully exploit this.

  Users can workaround the problem by disabling persistent connections, though
  this may cause performance implications.
