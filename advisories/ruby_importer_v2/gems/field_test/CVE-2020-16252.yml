  CSRF Vulnerability with Non-Session Based Authentication
  The Field Test dashboard is vulnerable to CSRF with non-session based authentication methods.

  ## Impact
  The Field Test dashboard is vulnerable to CSRF with non-session based authentication methods,
  like basic authentication. Session-based authentication methods (like Devise's default
  authentication) are not affected.

  A CSRF attack works by getting an authorized user to visit a malicious website and then
  performing requests on behalf of the user. In this instance, a single endpoint is affected,
  which allows for changing the variant assigned to a user.
