  - CVE-2020-11023
  - GHSA-jpcq-cgw6-v4j6
summary: |
  Potential XSS vulnerability in jQuery
  ## Impact

  Passing HTML containing `<option>` elements from untrusted sources - even after
  sanitizing them - to one of jQuery's DOM manipulation methods (i.e. `.html()`,
  `.append()`, and others) may execute untrusted code.

  ## Workarounds

  To workaround this issue without upgrading, use DOMPurify with its
  `SAFE_FOR_JQUERY` option to sanitize the HTML string before passing it to a
  jQuery method.
