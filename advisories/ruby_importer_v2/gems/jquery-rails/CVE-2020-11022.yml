aliases:
  - CVE-2020-11022
  - GHSA-gxr4-xjj5-5px2
summary: |
  Potential XSS vulnerability in jQuery
  ### Impact
  Passing HTML from untrusted sources - even after sanitizing it - to
  one of jQuery's DOM manipulation methods (i.e. `.html()`, `.append()`,
  and others) may execute untrusted code.

  ### Patches
  This problem is patched in jQuery 3.5.0.

  ### Workarounds
  To workaround the issue without upgrading, adding the following to
  your code:
  ```js
  jQuery.htmlPrefilter = function( html ) {
    return html;
  };
  ```
  You need to use at least jQuery 1.12/2.2 or newer to be able to
  apply this workaround.
