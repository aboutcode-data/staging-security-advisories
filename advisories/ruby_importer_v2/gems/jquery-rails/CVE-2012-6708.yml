summary: |
  Cross-Site Scripting in jquery
  Affected versions of `jquery` are vulnerable to cross-site scripting.
  This occurs because the main `jquery` function uses a regular expression
  to differentiate between HTML and selectors, but does not properly anchor
  the regular expression. The result is that `jquery` may interpret HTML
  as selectors when given certain inputs, allowing for client side code
  execution.

  ## Proof of Concept
  $("#log").html(
      $("element[attribute='<img src=\"x\" onerror=\"alert(1)\" />']").html()
  );
