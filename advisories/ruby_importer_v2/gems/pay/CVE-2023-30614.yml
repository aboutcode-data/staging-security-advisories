summary: |
  Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS) in Pay
  Impact
    A payments info page of Pay is susceptible to reflected Cross-site
    scripting. An attacker could create a working URL that renders a
    javascript link to a user on a Rails application that integrates
    Pay. This URL could be distributed via email to specifically target
    certain individuals. If the targeted application contains a
    functionality to submit user-generated content (such as comments)
    the attacker could even distribute the URL using that functionality.
  Patches
    This has been patched in version 6.3.2 and above.
    Pay will now sanitize the `back` parameter and only permit relative paths.
