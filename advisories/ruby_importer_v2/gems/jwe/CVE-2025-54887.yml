aliases:
  - CVE-2025-54887
  - GHSA-c7p4-hx26-pr73
summary: |
  JWE is missing AES-GCM authentication tag validation in encrypted JWE
  ### Overview

  The authentication tag of encrypted JWEs can be brute forced,
  which may result in loss of confidentiality for those JWEs and
  provide ways to craft arbitrary JWEs.

  ### Impact

  - JWEs can be modified to decrypt to an arbitrary value
  - JWEs can be decrypted by observing parsing differences
  - The GCM internal
    [GHASH key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode)
    can be recovered

  ### Am I Affected?

  You are affected by this vulnerability even if you do not
  use an `AES-GCM` encryption algorithm for your JWEs.

  ### Patches

  The version 1.1.1 fixes the issue by adding the tag length check for the `AES-GCM` algorithm.

  **Important:** As the [GHASH key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode)
  could have leaked, you must rotate the encryption keys after
  upgrading to version 1.1.1.
