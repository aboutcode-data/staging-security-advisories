summary: |
  jruby-openssl Gem for JRuby fails to do proper certificate validation
  A security problem involving peer certificate verification was found where
  failed verification silently did nothing, making affected applications
  vulnerable to attackers. Attackers could lead a client application to believe
  that a secure connection to a rogue SSL server is legitimate. Attackers could
  also penetrate client-validated SSL server applications with a dummy
  certificate.
