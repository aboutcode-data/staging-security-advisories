summary: |
  fluentd vulnerable to remote code execution due to insecure deserialization (in non-default configuration)
  ### Impact
  A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in non-default configurations of
  Fluentd allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code via
  specially crafted JSON payloads.

  Fluentd setups are only affected if the environment variable
  `FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE` is explicitly set to `object`.

  Please note: The option FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE was introduced in Fluentd
  version 1.13.2. Earlier versions of Fluentd are not affected by this
  vulnerability.

  ### Patches
  v1.15.3

  ### Workarounds
  Do not use `FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE=object`.
