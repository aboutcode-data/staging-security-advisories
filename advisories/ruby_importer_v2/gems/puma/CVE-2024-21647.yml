summary: |
  Puma HTTP Request/Response Smuggling vulnerability
  ### Impact
  Prior to versions 6.4.2 and 5.6.8, puma exhibited incorrect
  behavior when parsing chunked transfer encoding bodies in a
  way that allowed HTTP request smuggling.

  Fixed versions limit the size of chunk extensions. Without this
  limit, an attacker could cause unbounded resource (CPU, network
  bandwidth) consumption.

  ### Patches

  The vulnerability has been fixed in 6.4.2 and 5.6.8.

  ### Workarounds

  No known workarounds.
