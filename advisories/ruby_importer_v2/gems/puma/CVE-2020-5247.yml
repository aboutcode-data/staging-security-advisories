summary: |
  HTTP Response Splitting vulnerability in puma
  If an application using Puma allows untrusted input in a response header,
  an attacker can use newline characters (i.e. CR, LF) to end the header and
  inject malicious content, such as additional headers or an entirely new
  response body. This vulnerability is known as HTTP Response Splitting.

  While not an attack in itself, response splitting is a vector for several
  other attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS).
