summary: |
  avo vulnerable to Stored XSS (Cross Site Scripting) in html content based fields
  ### Summary

  Some avo fields are vulnerable to XSS when rendering html based content.

  ### Details
  During the analysis of the web application, a rendered field was
  discovered that did not filter JS / HTML tags in a safe way and can
  be abused to execute js code on a client side. The trix field uses
  the trix editor in the backend to edit rich text data which basically
  operates with html tags. To display the stored data in a rendered view,
  the HasHTMLAttributes concern is used. This can be exploited by an
  attacker to store javascript code in any trix field by intercepting
  the request and modifying the post data, as the trix editor does not
  allow adding custom html or js tags on the frontend.

  ### Impact

  Unlike non-persistent XSS, persistent XSS does not require a social
  engineering phase. Victims of this attack do not need to be tricked
  into clicking a link or something like that. However, by exploiting
  such a vulnerability on this particular target, attackers may be able
  to gain access to accounts that require special protection, such as
  administrators of the web service, which is what Avo is primarily
  intended to be used for.

  ### Recommendation

  The content of a field that contains html code should be sanitized
  using the according rails helper which uses a whitelist of known-safe
  tags and attributes. Also this security consideration should be
  applied to the “as_html” attribute as well because it may contain
  user controlled input as well.
