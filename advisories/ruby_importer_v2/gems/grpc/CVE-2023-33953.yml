summary: |
  Excessive Iteration in gRPC
  gRPC contains a vulnerability that allows hpack table accounting
  errors could lead to unwanted disconnects between clients and
  servers in exceptional cases/ Three vectors were found that allow
  the following DOS attacks:

  - Unbounded memory buffering in the HPACK parser
  - Unbounded CPU consumption in the HPACK parser

  The unbounded CPU consumption is down to a copy that occurred
  per-input-block in the parser, and because that could be unbounded
  due to the memory copy bug we end up with an O(n^2) parsing loop,
  with n selected by the client.

  The unbounded memory buffering bugs:

  - The header size limit check was behind the string reading code,
    so we needed to first buffer up to a 4 gigabyte string before
    rejecting it as longer than 8 or 16kb.

  - HPACK varints have an encoding quirk whereby an infinite number
    of 0’s can be added at the start of an integer. gRPC’s hpack
    parser needed to read all of them before concluding a parse.

  - gRPC’s metadata overflow check was performed per frame, so that
    the following sequence of frames could cause infinite buffering:
    HEADERS: containing a: 1 CONTINUATION: containing a: 2 CONTINUATION:
    containing a: 3 etc…
