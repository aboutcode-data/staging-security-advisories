summary: |
  Connection confusion in gRPC
  When gRPC HTTP2 stack raised a header size exceeded error, it
  skipped parsing the rest of the HPACK frame. This caused any HPACK
  table mutations to also be skipped, resulting in a desynchronization
  of HPACK tables between sender and receiver. If leveraged, say,
  between a proxy and a backend, this could lead to requests from the
  proxy being interpreted as containing headers from different
  proxy clients
  - leading to an information leak that can be used for privilege
    escalation or data exfiltration. We recommend upgrading beyond
    the commit contained in  https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/32309
