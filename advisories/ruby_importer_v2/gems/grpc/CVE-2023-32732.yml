summary: |
  gRPC connection termination issue
  gRPC contains a vulnerability whereby a client can cause a
  termination of connection between a HTTP2 proxy and a gRPC server:
  a base64 encoding error for `-bin` suffixed headers will result in
  a disconnection by the gRPC server, but is typically allowed by
  HTTP2 proxies. We recommend upgrading beyond the commit in
  https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/32309.
