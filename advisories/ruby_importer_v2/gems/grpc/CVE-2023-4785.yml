summary: |
  Denial of Service Vulnerability in gRPC TCP Server (Posix-compatible platforms)
  Lack of error handling in the TCP server in Google's gRPC starting
  version 1.23 on posix-compatible platforms (ex. Linux) allows an
  attacker to cause a denial of service by initiating a significant
  number of connections with the server.

  Note that gRPC C++ Python, and Ruby are affected, but
  gRPC Java and Go are NOT affected.
