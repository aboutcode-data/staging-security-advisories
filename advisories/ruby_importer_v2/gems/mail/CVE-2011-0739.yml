summary: |
  Mail Gem for Ruby lib/mail/network/delivery_methods/sendmail.rb Email From: Address Arbitrary Shell Command Injection
  Mail Gem for Ruby contains a flaw related to the failure to properly sanitise
  input passed from an email from address in the 'deliver()' function in
  'lib/mail/network/delivery_methods/sendmail.rb' before being used as a
  command line argument. This may allow a remote attacker to inject arbitrary
  shell commands.
