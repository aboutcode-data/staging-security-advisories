summary: |
  Possible ReDoS vulnerability in HTTP Token authentication in Action Controller
  There is a possible ReDoS vulnerability in Action Controller's
  HTTP Token authentication. This vulnerability has been assigned
  the CVE identifier CVE-2024-47887.

  ## Impact

  For applications using HTTP Token authentication via
  `authenticate_or_request_with_http_token` or similar, a carefully
  crafted header may cause header parsing to take an unexpected amount
  of time, possibly resulting in a DoS vulnerability. All users running
  an affected release should either upgrade or apply the relevant
  patch immediately.

  Ruby 3.2 has mitigations for this problem, so Rails applications
  using Ruby 3.2 or newer are unaffected. Rails 8.0.0.beta1 depends
  on Ruby 3.2 or greater so is unaffected.

  ## Releases

  The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.

  ## Workarounds

  Users on Ruby 3.2 are unaffected by this issue.
