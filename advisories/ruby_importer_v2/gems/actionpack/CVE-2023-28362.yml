summary: |
  Possible XSS via User Supplied Values to redirect_to
  The redirect_to method in Rails allows provided values to contain characters
  which are not legal in an HTTP header value. This results in the potential for
  downstream services which enforce RFC compliance on HTTP response headers to
  remove the assigned Location header. This vulnerability has been assigned the
  CVE identifier CVE-2023-28362.

  Versions Affected: All. Not affected: None Fixed Versions: 7.0.5.1, 6.1.7.4

  # Impact

  This introduces the potential for a Cross-site-scripting (XSS) payload to be
  delivered on the now static redirection page. Note that this both requires
  user interaction and for a Rails app to be configured to allow redirects to
  external hosts (defaults to false in Rails >= 7.0.x).

  # Releases

  The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.

  # Workarounds

  Avoid providing user supplied URLs with arbitrary schemes to the redirect_to
  method.
