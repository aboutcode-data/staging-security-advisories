summary: |
  Possible Content Security Policy bypass in Action Dispatch
  There is a possible Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
  in the `content_security_policy` helper in Action Pack.

  ## Impact

  Applications which set Content-Security-Policy (CSP) headers
  dynamically from untrusted user input may be vulnerable to
  carefully crafted inputs being able to inject new directives
  into the CSP. This could lead to a bypass of the CSP and its
  protection against XSS and other attacks.

  ## Releases

  The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.

  ## Workarounds

  Applications can avoid setting CSP headers dynamically from
  untrusted input, or can validate/sanitize that input.
