summary: |
  Filter Problems on Case-Insensitive Filesystems in rails/actionpack
  actionpack/lib/action_view/template/resolver.rb in Ruby on Rails 3.0.x
  before 3.0.4, when a case-insensitive filesystem is used, does not
  properly implement filters associated with the list of available
  templates, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access
  restrictions via an action name that uses an unintended case for
  alphabetic characters.
