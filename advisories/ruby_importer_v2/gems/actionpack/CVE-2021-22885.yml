  Possible Information Disclosure / Unintended Method Execution in Action Pack
  There is a possible information disclosure / unintended method execution
  vulnerability in Action Pack which has been assigned the CVE identifier
  CVE-2021-22885.

  Versions Affected:  >= 2.0.0.
  Not affected:       < 2.0.0.
  Fixed Versions:     6.1.3.2, 6.0.3.7, 5.2.4.6, 5.2.6

  Impact
  ------
  There is a possible information disclosure / unintended method execution
  vulnerability in Action Pack when using the `redirect_to` or `polymorphic_url`
  helper with untrusted user input.

  Vulnerable code will look like this:

  ```
  redirect_to(params[:some_param])
  ```

  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
  workarounds immediately.

  Workarounds
  -----------
  To work around this problem, it is recommended to use an allow list for valid
  parameters passed from the user.  For example:

  ```
  private def check(param)
    case param
    when "valid"
      param
    else
      "/"
    end
  end

  def index
    redirect_to(check(params[:some_param]))
  end
  ```

  Or force the user input to be cast to a string like this:

  ```
  def index
    redirect_to(params[:some_param].to_s)
  end
  ```
