summary: |
  activerecord-session_store Timing Attack
  The `activerecord-session_store` (aka Active Record Session Store) component
  through 1.1.3 for Ruby on Rails does not use a constant-time approach when delivering
  information about whether a guessed session ID is valid. Consequently, remote attackers
  can leverage timing discrepancies to achieve a correct guess in a relatively short
  amount of time. This is a related issue to CVE-2019-16782.

  ## Recommendation
  Users should upgrade to `activerecord-session_store` version 2.0.0 or later.
