summary: |
  CSRF vulnerability in rails_admin
  The rails_admin gem is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.
  Due to a bug, non-GET methods were not validating CSRF tokens and, as a result,
  an attacker could hypothetically gain access to the application administrative
  endpoints exposed by the gem.
