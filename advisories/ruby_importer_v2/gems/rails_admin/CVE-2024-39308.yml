summary: |
  RailsAdmin Cross-site Scripting vulnerability in the list view
  ### Impact
  RailsAdmin list view has the XSS vulnerability, caused by
  improperly-escaped HTML title attribute. The issue was originally
  reported in https://github.com/railsadminteam/rails_admin/issues/3686.

  ### Patches
  Upgrade to [3.1.3](https://rubygems.org/gems/rails_admin/versions/3.1.3)
  or [2.3.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/rails_admin/versions/2.3.0).

  ### Workarounds
  1. Copy the index view (located under the path
     `app/views/rails_admin/main/index.html.erb`) from the RailsAdmin
     version you use, and place it into your application by using
     the same path.

  2. Open the view file by an editor, and remove `strip_tags` from
     the title attribute (as shown in GHSA advisory below).

  **Note:** The view file created by this needs to be removed after
  upgrading RailsAdmin afterwards, unless this old view continue to
  be used. Only do this if you can't upgrade RailsAdmin now for a reason.
