summary: |
  Malicious URL drafting attack against iodines static file server may allow path traversal
  ### Impact

  A path traversal vulnerability was detected in iodine's static
  file service. This vulnerability effects any application running
  iodine's static file server on an effected iodine version.

  Malicious URL drafting may cause the static file server to attempt
  a response containing data from files that shouldn't be normally
  accessible from the public folder.

  ### Patches

  The vulnerability was patched in version 0.7.34. Please upgrade
  to the latest version.

  ### Workarounds

  A possible workaround would be to disable the static file service
  and it's `X-Sendfile` support, sending static files using nginx
  or a source code solution (sending the data dynamically).

  However, it would be better to upgrade iodine to the latest
  version, as it also contains non-security related fixes.
