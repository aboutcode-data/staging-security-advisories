aliases: []
summary: A flaw in Node.js's permission model allows a file's access and modification timestamps
  to be changed via `futimes()` even when the process has only read permissions. Unlike `utimes()`,
  `futimes()` does not apply the expected write-permission checks, which means file metadata
  can be modified in read-only directories. This behavior could be used to alter timestamps
  in ways that obscure activity, reducing the reliability of logs. This vulnerability affects
  users of the permission model on Node.js v20,  v22,  v24, and v25.
