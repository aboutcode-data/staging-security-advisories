aliases: []
summary: The Custom Searchable Data Entry System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthenticated
  database wiping in versions up to, and including 1.7.1, due to a missing capability check
  and lack of sufficient validation on the ghazale_sds_delete_entries_table_row() function.
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to completely wipe database tables such
  as wp_users.
