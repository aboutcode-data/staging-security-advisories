aliases: []
summary: The Insert Headers and Footers Code – HT Script plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the ajax_dismiss
  function in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.2. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update option values to 1/true on the
  WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update an option that would create an error on the
  site and deny access to legitimate users or be used to set some values to true, such as registration.
