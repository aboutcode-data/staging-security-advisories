aliases: []
summary: snowflake-connector-net, the Snowflake Connector for .NET, is vulnerable to command
  injection prior to version 2.0.18 via SSO URL authentication. In order to exploit the potential
  for command injection, an attacker would need to be successful in (1) establishing a malicious
  resource and (2) redirecting users to utilize the resource. The attacker could set up a malicious,
  publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker
  then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the user’s local
  machine would render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution. This attack
  scenario can be mitigated through URL whitelisting as well as common anti-phishing resources.
  Version 2.0.18 fixes this issue.
