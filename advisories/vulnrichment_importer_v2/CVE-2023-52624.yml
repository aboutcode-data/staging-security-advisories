  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/amd/display: Wake DMCUB before executing GPINT commands

  [Why]
  DMCUB can be in idle when we attempt to interface with the HW through
  the GPINT mailbox resulting in a system hang.

  [How]
  Add dc_wake_and_execute_gpint() to wrap the wake, execute, sleep
  sequence.

  If the GPINT executes successfully then DMCUB will be put back into
  sleep after the optional response is returned.

  It functions similar to the inbox command interface.
