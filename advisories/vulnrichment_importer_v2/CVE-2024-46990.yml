aliases: []
summary: Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When
  relying on blocking access to localhost using the default `0.0.0.0` filter a user may bypass
  this block by using other registered loopback devices (like `127.0.0.2` - `127.127.127.127`).
  This issue has been addressed in release versions 10.13.3 and 11.1.0. Users are advised to
  upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may block this bypass by manually adding the `127.0.0.0/8`
  CIDR range which will block access to any `127.X.X.X` ip instead of just `127.0.0.1`.
