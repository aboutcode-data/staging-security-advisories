aliases: []
summary: Karmada Dashboard is a general-purpose, web-based control panel for Karmada which is
  a multi-cluster management project. Prior to version 0.2.0, there is an authentication bypass
  vulnerability in the Karmada Dashboard API. The backend API endpoints (e.g., /api/v1/secret,
  /api/v1/service) did not enforce authentication, allowing unauthenticated users to access
  sensitive cluster information such as Secrets and Services directly. Although the web UI required
  a valid JWT for access, the API itself remained exposed to direct requests without any authentication
  checks. Any user or entity with network access to the Karmada Dashboard service could exploit
  this vulnerability to retrieve sensitive data.
