aliases: []
summary: 'Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane.
  Starting in version 1.14.0 and prior to versions 1.14.16 and 1.15.10, a policy rule denying
  a prefix that is broader than `/32` may be ignored if there is a policy rule referencing a
  more narrow prefix (`CIDRSet` or `toFQDN`) and this narrower policy rule specifies either
  `enableDefaultDeny: false` or `- toEntities: all`. Note that a rule specifying `toEntities:
  world` or `toEntities: 0.0.0.0/0` is insufficient, it must be to entity `all`.This issue has
  been patched in Cilium v1.14.16 and v1.15.10. As this issue only affects policies using `enableDefaultDeny:
  false` or that set `toEntities` to `all`, some workarounds are available. For users with policies
  using `enableDefaultDeny: false`, remove this configuration option and explicitly define any
  allow rules required. For users with egress policies that explicitly specify `toEntities:
  all`, use `toEntities: world`.'
