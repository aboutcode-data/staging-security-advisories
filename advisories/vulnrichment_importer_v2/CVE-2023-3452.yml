aliases: []
summary: The Canto plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion in versions up
  to, and including, 3.0.4 via the 'wp_abspath' parameter. This allows unauthenticated attackers
  to include and execute arbitrary remote code on the server, provided that allow_url_include
  is enabled. Local File Inclusion is also possible, albeit less useful because it requires
  that the attacker be able to upload a malicious php file via FTP or some other means into
  a directory readable by the web server.
