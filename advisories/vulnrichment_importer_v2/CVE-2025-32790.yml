aliases: []
summary: Dify is an open-source LLM app development platform. In versions 0.6.8 and prior, a
  vulnerability was identified in the DIFY AI where normal users are improperly granted permissions
  to export APP DSL. The feature in '/export' should only allow administrator users to export
  DSL. A workaround for this vulnerability involves updating the access control mechanisms to
  enforce stricter user role permissions and implementing role-based access controls (RBAC)
  to ensure that only users with admin privileges can export the APP DSL. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 0.6.13.
