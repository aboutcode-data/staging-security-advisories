aliases: []
summary: Nextcloud server is a self hosted home cloud product. In affected versions the `OC\Files\Node\Folder::getFullPath()`
  function was validating and normalizing the string in the wrong order. The function is used
  in the `newFile()` and `newFolder()` items, which may allow to creation of paths outside of
  ones own space and overwriting data from other users with crafted paths. This issue has been
  addressed in versions 25.0.2, 24.0.8, and 23.0.12. Users are advised to upgrade. There are
  no known workarounds for this issue.
