aliases: []
summary: Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. Authenticated users can use string
  matching commands (like `SCAN` or `KEYS`) with a specially crafted pattern to trigger a denial-of-service
  attack on Redis, causing it to hang and consume 100% CPU time. The problem is fixed in Redis
  versions 6.0.18, 6.2.11, 7.0.9.
