aliases: []
summary: picklescan before 0.0.23 fails to detect malicious pickle files inside PyTorch model
  archives when certain ZIP file flag bits are modified. By flipping specific bits in the ZIP
  file headers, an attacker can embed malicious pickle files that remain undetected by PickleScan
  while still being successfully loaded by PyTorch's torch.load(). This can lead to arbitrary
  code execution when loading a compromised model.
