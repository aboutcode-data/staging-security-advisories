aliases: []
summary: A parsing issue similar to CVE-2022-3171, but with Message-Type Extensions in protobuf-java
  core and lite versions prior to 3.21.7, 3.20.3, 3.19.6 and 3.16.3 can lead to a denial of
  service attack. Inputs containing multiple instances of non-repeated embedded messages with
  repeated or unknown fields causes objects to be converted back-n-forth between mutable and
  immutable forms, resulting in potentially long garbage collection pauses. We recommend updating
  to the versions mentioned above.
