aliases: []
summary: The Miniorange OTP Verification with Firebase plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 3.6.0. This is due to missing validation
  on the token being supplied during the otp login through the plugin. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator,
  if they know the phone number associated with that user.
