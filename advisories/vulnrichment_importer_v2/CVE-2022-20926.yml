aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the web management interface of the Cisco Firepower Management\
  \ Center (FMC) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary\
  \ commands on the underlying operating system.\r\n\r The vulnerability is due to insufficient\
  \ validation of user-supplied parameters for certain API endpoints. An attacker could exploit\
  \ this vulnerability by sending crafted input to an affected API endpoint. A successful exploit\
  \ could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device with low system privileges.\
  \ To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid credentials for\
  \ a user with Device permissions: by default, only Administrators, Security Approvers and\
  \ Network Admins user accounts have these permissions."
