summary: The king_IE plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG
  File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.0 due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level
  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses the SVG file.
