aliases: []
summary: DBLTek GoIP devices (models GoIP 1, 4, 8, 16, and 32) contain an undocumented vendor
  backdoor in the Telnet administrative interface that allows remote authentication as an undocumented
  user via a proprietary challenge–response scheme which is fundamentally flawed. Because the
  challenge response can be computed from the challenge itself, a remote attacker can authenticate
  without knowledge of a secret and obtain a root shell on the device. This can lead to persistent
  remote code execution, full device compromise, and arbitrary control of the device and any
  managed services. The firmware used within these devices was updated in December 2016 to make
  this vulnerability more complex to exploit. However, it is unknown if DBLTek has taken steps
  to fully mitigate.
