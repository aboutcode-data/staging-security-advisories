aliases: []
summary: Using the TIOCLINUX ioctl request, a malicious snap could inject contents into the
  input of the controlling terminal which could allow it to cause arbitrary commands to be executed
  outside of the snap sandbox after the snap exits. Graphical terminal emulators like xterm,
  gnome-terminal and others are not affected - this can only be exploited when snaps are run
  on a virtual console.
