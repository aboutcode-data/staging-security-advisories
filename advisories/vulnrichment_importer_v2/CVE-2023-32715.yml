datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2023/32xxx/CVE-2023-32715.json
aliases: []
summary: In the Splunk App for Lookup File Editing versions below 4.0.1, a user can insert potentially
  malicious JavaScript code into the app, which causes that code to run on the user’s machine.
  The app itself does not contain the potentially malicious JavaScript code. The vulnerability
  requires the attacker to phish the victim by tricking them into initiating a request within
  their browser, and requires additional user interaction to trigger. The attacker cannot exploit
  the vulnerability at will.
