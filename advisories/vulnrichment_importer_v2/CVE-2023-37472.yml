aliases: []
summary: Knowage is an open source suite for business analytics. The application often use user
  supplied data to create HQL queries without prior sanitization. An attacker can create specially
  crafted HQL queries that will break subsequent SQL queries generated by the Hibernate engine.
  The endpoint `_/knowage/restful-services/2.0/documents/listDocument_` calls the `_countBIObjects_`
  method of the `_BIObjectDAOHibImpl_` object with the user supplied `_label_` parameter without
  prior sanitization. This can lead to SQL injection in the backing database. Other injections
  have been identified in the application as well. An authenticated attacker with low privileges
  could leverage this vulnerability in order to retrieve sensitive information from the database,
  such as account credentials or business information. This issue has been addressed in version
  8.1.8. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
