aliases: []
summary: H2O.ai H2O through 3.46.0.4 allows attackers to arbitrarily set the JDBC URL, leading
  to deserialization attacks, file reads, and command execution. Exploitation can occur when
  an attacker has access to post to the ImportSQLTable URI with a JSON document containing a
  connection_url property with any typical JDBC Connection URL attack payload such as one that
  uses queryInterceptors.
