  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  bpf: Avoid splat in pskb_pull_reason

  syzkaller builds (CONFIG_DEBUG_NET=y) frequently trigger a debug
  hint in pskb_may_pull.

  We'd like to retain this debug check because it might hint at integer
  overflows and other issues (kernel code should pull headers, not huge
  value).

  In bpf case, this splat isn't interesting at all: such (nonsensical)
  bpf programs are typically generated by a fuzzer anyway.

  Do what Eric suggested and suppress such warning.

  For CONFIG_DEBUG_NET=n we don't need the extra check because
  pskb_may_pull will do the right thing: return an error without the
  WARN() backtrace.
