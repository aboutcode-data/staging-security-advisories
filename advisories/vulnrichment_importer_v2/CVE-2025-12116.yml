summary: The Drift theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the
  post title in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.0 due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level

  accesses an injected page.
