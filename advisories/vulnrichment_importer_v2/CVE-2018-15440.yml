aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine
  (ISE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attack against a user of the web interface of an affected system. The vulnerability
  is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data that is written to log files and
  displayed in certain web pages of the web-based management interface of an affected device.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user of the interface to click
  a specific link or view an affected log file. The injected script code may be executed in
  the context of the web-based management interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive
  browser-based information.
