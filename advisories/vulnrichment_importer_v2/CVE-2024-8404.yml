aliases: []
summary: "An arbitrary file deletion vulnerability exists in PaperCut NG/MF, specifically affecting\
  \ Windows servers with Web Print enabled. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must\
  \ first obtain local login access to the Windows Server hosting PaperCut NG/MF and be capable\
  \ of executing low-privilege code directly on the server via the web-print-hot-folder. \n\n\
  Important: In most installations, this risk is mitigated by the default Windows Server configuration,\
  \ which restricts local login access to Administrators only. However, this vulnerability could\
  \ pose a risk to customers who allow non-administrative users to log into the local console\
  \ of the Windows environment hosting the PaperCut NG/MF application server.\n\nUpdate:\n\n\
  This CVE has been updated in May 2025 to update the fixed version and fix process. Please\
  \ refer to the May 2025 Security Bulletin.\n\nNote: \n\nThis CVE has been split from CVE-2024-3037."
