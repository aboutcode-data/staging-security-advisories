summary: "A vulnerability in the Device Analytics action frame processing of Cisco Wireless\
  \ Access Point (AP) Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to inject wireless\
  \ 802.11 action frames with arbitrary information.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to insufficient\
  \ verification checks of incoming 802.11 action frames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by sending 802.11 Device Analytics action frames with arbitrary parameters. A successful\
  \ exploit could allow the attacker to inject Device Analytics action frames with arbitrary\
  \ information, which could modify the Device Analytics data of valid wireless clients that\
  \ are connected to the same wireless controller."
