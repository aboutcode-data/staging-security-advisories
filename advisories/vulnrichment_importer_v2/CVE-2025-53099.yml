aliases: []
summary: Sentry is a developer-first error tracking and performance monitoring tool. Prior to
  version 25.5.0, an attacker with a malicious OAuth application registered with Sentry can
  take advantage of a race condition and improper handling of authorization code within Sentry
  to maintain persistence to a user's account. With a specially timed requests and redirect
  flows, an attacker could generate multiple authorization codes that could be used to exchange
  for access and refresh tokens. This was possible even after de-authorizing the particular
  application. This issue has been patched in version 25.5.0. Self-hosted Sentry users should
  upgrade to version 25.5.0 or higher. Sentry SaaS users do not need to take any action.
