aliases: []
summary: |
  There exists a vulnerability in Quick Share/Nearby, where an attacker can force a victim to stay connected to a temporary hotspot created for the sharing. As part of the sequence of packets in a Quick Share connection over Bluetooth, the attacker forces the victim to connect to the attacker’s WiFi network and then sends an OfflineFrame that crashes Quick Share.
  This makes the Wifi connection to the attacker’s network last, instead of returning to the old network when the Quick Share session completes, allowing the attacker to be a MiTM. We recommend upgrading to version 1.0.1724.0 of Quick Share or above
