aliases: []
summary: KubeEdge is built upon Kubernetes and extends native containerized application orchestration
  and device management to hosts at the Edge. In affected versions a malicious message can crash
  CloudCore by triggering a nil-pointer dereference in the UDS Server. Since the UDS Server
  only communicates with the CSI Driver on the cloud side, the attack is limited to the local
  host network. As such, an attacker would already need to be an authenticated user of the Cloud.
  Additionally it will be affected only when users turn on the unixsocket switch in the config
  file cloudcore.yaml. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.0, 1.10.1, and 1.9.3. Users
  should update to these versions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should sisable
  the unixsocket switch of CloudHub in the config file cloudcore.yaml.
