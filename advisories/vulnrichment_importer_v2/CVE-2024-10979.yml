aliases: []
summary: Incorrect control of environment variables in PostgreSQL PL/Perl allows an unprivileged
  database user to change sensitive process environment variables (e.g. PATH).  That often suffices
  to enable arbitrary code execution, even if the attacker lacks a database server operating
  system user.  Versions before PostgreSQL 17.1, 16.5, 15.9, 14.14, 13.17, and 12.21 are affected.
