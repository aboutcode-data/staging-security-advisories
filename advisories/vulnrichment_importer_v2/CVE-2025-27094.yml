aliases: []
summary: Tuleap is an open-source suite designed to improve software development management
  and collaboration. A malicious user with access to a tracker could force-reset certain field
  configurations, leading to potential information loss. The display time attribute for the
  date field, the size attribute for the multiselectbox field, the default value, number of
  rows, and columns attributes for the text field, and the default value, size, and max characters
  attributes for the string field configurations are lost when added as criteria in a saved
  report. Additionally, in Tuleap Community Edition versions 16.4.99.1739806825 to 16.4.99.1739877910,
  this issue could be exploited to prevent access to tracker data by triggering a crash. This
  vulnerability has been fixed in Tuleap Community Edition 16.4.99.1739877910 and Tuleap Enterprise
  Edition 16.3-9 and 16.4-4.
