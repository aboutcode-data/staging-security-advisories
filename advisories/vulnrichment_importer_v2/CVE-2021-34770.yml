summary: A vulnerability in the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP)
  protocol processing of Cisco IOS XE Software for Cisco Catalyst 9000 Family Wireless Controllers
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with administrative
  privileges or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability
  is due to a logic error that occurs during the validation of CAPWAP packets. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted CAPWAP packet to an affected device. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges
  or cause the affected device to crash and reload, resulting in a DoS condition.
