  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  binder: make sure fd closes complete

  During BC_FREE_BUFFER processing, the BINDER_TYPE_FDA object
  cleanup may close 1 or more fds. The close operations are
  completed using the task work mechanism -- which means the thread
  needs to return to userspace or the file object may never be
  dereferenced -- which can lead to hung processes.

  Force the binder thread back to userspace if an fd is closed during
  BC_FREE_BUFFER handling.
