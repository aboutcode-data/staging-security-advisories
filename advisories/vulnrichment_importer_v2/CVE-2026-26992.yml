aliases: []
summary: LibreNMS is an auto-discovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP based network monitoring tool. In versions
  26.1.1 and below, the port group name is not sanitized, allowing attackers with admin privileges
  to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. When a user adds a port group, an HTTP
  POST request is sent to the Request-URI "/port-groups". The name of the newly created port
  group is stored in the value of the name parameter. After the port group is created, the entry
  is displayed along with relevant buttons such as Edit and Delete. This issue has been fixed
  in version 26.2.0.
