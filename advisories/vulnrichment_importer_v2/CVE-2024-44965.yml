  x86/mm: Fix pti_clone_pgtable() alignment assumption

  Guenter reported dodgy crashes on an i386-nosmp build using GCC-11
  that had the form of endless traps until entry stack exhaust and then
  #DF from the stack guard.

  It turned out that pti_clone_pgtable() had alignment assumptions on
  the start address, notably it hard assumes start is PMD aligned. This
  is true on x86_64, but very much not true on i386.

  These assumptions can cause the end condition to malfunction, leading
  to a 'short' clone. Guess what happens when the user mapping has a
  short copy of the entry text?

  Use the correct increment form for addr to avoid alignment
  assumptions.
