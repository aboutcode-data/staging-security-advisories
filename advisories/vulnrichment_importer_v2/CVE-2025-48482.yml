summary: FreeScout is a free self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. Prior to version 1.8.180,
  there is a mass assignment vulnerability. The Customer object is updated using the fill()
  method, which processes fields such as channel and channel_id. However, the fill() method
  is called with all client-provided data, including unexpected values for channel and channel_id,
  leading to a mass assignment vulnerability. This issue has been patched in version 1.8.180.
