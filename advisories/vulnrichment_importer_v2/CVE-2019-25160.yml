  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  netlabel: fix out-of-bounds memory accesses

  There are two array out-of-bounds memory accesses, one in
  cipso_v4_map_lvl_valid(), the other in netlbl_bitmap_walk().  Both
  errors are embarassingly simple, and the fixes are straightforward.

  As a FYI for anyone backporting this patch to kernels prior to v4.8,
  you'll want to apply the netlbl_bitmap_walk() patch to
  cipso_v4_bitmap_walk() as netlbl_bitmap_walk() doesn't exist before
  Linux v4.8.
