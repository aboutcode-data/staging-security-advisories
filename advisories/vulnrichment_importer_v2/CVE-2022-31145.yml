aliases: []
summary: FlyteAdmin is the control plane for Flyte responsible for managing entities and administering
  workflow executions. In versions 1.1.30 and prior, authenticated users using an external identity
  provider can continue to use Access Tokens and ID Tokens even after they expire. Users who
  use FlyteAdmin as the OAuth2 Authorization Server are unaffected by this issue. A patch is
  available on the `master` branch of the repository. As a workaround, rotating signing keys
  immediately will invalidate all open sessions and force all users to attempt to obtain new
  tokens. Those who use this workaround should continue to rotate keys until FlyteAdmin has
  been upgraded and hide FlyteAdmin deployment ingress URL from the internet.
