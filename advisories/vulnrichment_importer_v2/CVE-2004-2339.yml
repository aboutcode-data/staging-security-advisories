aliases: []
summary: 'Microsoft Windows 2000, XP, and possibly 2003 allows local users with the SeDebugPrivilege
  privilege to execute arbitrary code as kernel and read or write kernel memory via the NtSystemDebugControl
  function, which does not verify its pointer arguments.  Note: this issue has been disputed,
  since Administrator privileges are typically required to exploit this issue, thus privilege
  boundaries are not crossed'
