aliases: []
summary: Improper permission enforcement in Checkmk versions 2.4.0 before 2.4.0p21, 2.3.0 before
  2.3.0p43, and 2.2.0 (EOL) allows users with the "Use WATO" permission to access the "Analyze
  configuration" page by directly navigating to its URL, bypassing the intended "Access analyze
  configuration" permission check. If these users also have the "Make changes, perform actions"
  permission, they can perform unauthorized actions such as disabling checks or acknowledging
  results.
