aliases: []
summary: In the Eclipse OMR port library component since release 0.2.0, an API function to return
  the textual names of all supported processor features was not accounting for the separator
  inserted between processor features. If the output buffer supplied to this function was incorrectly
  sized, failing to account for the separator when determining when a write to the buffer was
  safe could lead to a buffer overflow. This issue is fixed in Eclipse OMR version 0.8.0.
