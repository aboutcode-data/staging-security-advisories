aliases: []
summary: Advantech WISE-DeviceOn Server versions prior to 5.4 contain a hard-coded cryptographic
  key vulnerability. The product uses a static HS512 HMAC secret for signing EIRMMToken JWTs
  across all installations. The server accepts forged JWTs that need only contain a valid email
  claim, allowing a remote unauthenticated attacker to generate arbitrary tokens and impersonate
  any DeviceOn account, including the root super admin. Successful exploitation permits full
  administrative control of the DeviceOn instance and can be leveraged to execute code on managed
  agents through DeviceOn’s remote management features.
