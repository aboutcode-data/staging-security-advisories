aliases: []
summary: 'Arvados is an open source platform for managing, processing, and sharing genomic and
  other large scientific and biomedical data. A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in
  the Arvados Workbench allows authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code via specially
  crafted JSON payloads. This exists in all versions up to 2.4.1 and is fixed in 2.4.2. This
  vulnerability is specific to the Ruby on Rails Workbench application (“Workbench 1”). We do
  not believe any other Arvados components, including the TypesScript browser-based Workbench
  application (“Workbench 2”) or API Server, are vulnerable to this attack. For versions of
  Arvados earlier than 2.4.2: remove the Ruby-based "Workbench 1" app ("apt-get remove arvados-workbench")
  from your installation as a workaround.'
