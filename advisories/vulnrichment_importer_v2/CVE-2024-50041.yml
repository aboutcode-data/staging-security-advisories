summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ni40e: Fix macvlan\
  \ leak by synchronizing access to mac_filter_hash\n\nThis patch addresses a macvlan leak issue\
  \ in the i40e driver caused by\nconcurrent access to vsi->mac_filter_hash. The leak occurs\
  \ when multiple\nthreads attempt to modify the mac_filter_hash simultaneously, leading to\n\
  inconsistent state and potential memory leaks.\n\nTo fix this, we now wrap the calls to i40e_del_mac_filter()\
  \ and zeroing\nvf->default_lan_addr.addr with spin_lock/unlock_bh(&vsi->mac_filter_hash_lock),\n\
  ensuring atomic operations and preventing concurrent access.\n\nAdditionally, we add lockdep_assert_held(&vsi->mac_filter_hash_lock)\
  \ in\ni40e_add_mac_filter() to help catch similar issues in the future.\n\nReproduction steps:\n\
  1. Spawn VFs and configure port vlan on them.\n2. Trigger concurrent macvlan operations (e.g.,\
  \ adding and deleting\n\tportvlan and/or mac filters).\n3. Observe the potential memory leak\
  \ and inconsistent state in the\n\tmac_filter_hash.\n\nThis synchronization ensures the integrity\
  \ of the mac_filter_hash and prevents\nthe described leak."
