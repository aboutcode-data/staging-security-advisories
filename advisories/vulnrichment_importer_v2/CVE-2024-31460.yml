aliases: []
summary: Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework. Prior to version
  1.2.27, some of the data stored in `automation_tree_rules.php` is not thoroughly checked and
  is used to concatenate the SQL statement in `create_all_header_nodes()`  function from `lib/api_automation.php`
  , finally resulting in SQL injection. Using SQL based secondary injection technology, attackers
  can modify the contents of the Cacti database, and based on the modified content, it may be
  possible to achieve further impact, such as arbitrary file reading, and even remote code execution
  through arbitrary file writing. Version 1.2.27 contains a patch for the issue.
