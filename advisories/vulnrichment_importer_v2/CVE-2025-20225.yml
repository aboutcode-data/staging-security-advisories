aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) feature of Cisco IOS\
  \ Software, IOS XE Software, Secure Firewall Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software, and\
  \ Secure Firewall Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker\
  \ to trigger a memory leak, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r This vulnerability\
  \ is due to a lack of proper processing of IKEv2 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by sending crafted IKEv2 packets to an affected device. In the case of Cisco IOS and IOS\
  \ XE Software, a successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload\
  \ unexpectedly. In the case of Cisco ASA and FTD Software, a successful exploit could allow\
  \ the attacker to partially exhaust system memory, causing system instability such as being\
  \ unable to establish new IKEv2 VPN sessions. A manual reboot of the device is required to\
  \ recover from this condition."
