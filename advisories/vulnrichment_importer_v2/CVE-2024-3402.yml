aliases: []
summary: A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability existed in version (20240121) of
  gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt due to inadequate sanitization and validation of model output data.
  Despite user-input validation efforts, the application fails to properly sanitize or validate
  the output from the model, allowing for the injection and execution of malicious JavaScript
  code within the context of a user's browser. This vulnerability can lead to the execution
  of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers, potentially resulting
  in the hijacking of victims' browsers.
