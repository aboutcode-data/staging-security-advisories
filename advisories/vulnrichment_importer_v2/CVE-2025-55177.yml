aliases: []
summary: Incomplete authorization of linked device synchronization messages in WhatsApp for
  iOS prior to v2.25.21.73, WhatsApp Business for iOS v2.25.21.78, and WhatsApp for Mac v2.25.21.78
  could have allowed an unrelated user to trigger processing of content from an arbitrary URL
  on a target’s device. We assess that this vulnerability, in combination with an OS-level vulnerability
  on Apple platforms (CVE-2025-43300), may have been exploited in a sophisticated attack against
  specific targeted users.
