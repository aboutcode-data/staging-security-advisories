aliases: []
summary: The backup restore function does not properly validate unexpected or unrecognized tags
  within the backup file. When such a crafted file is restored, the injected tag is interpreted
  by a shell, allowing execution of arbitrary commands with root privileges. Successful exploitation
  allows the attacker to gain root-level command execution, compromising confidentiality, integrity
  and availability.
