summary: The My Tickets – Accessible Event Ticketing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege
  Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.16. This is due to the mt_save_profile()
  function not appropriately restricting access to unauthorized users to update roles. This
  makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to
  update their role to that of an administrator.
