aliases: []
summary: The Simple:Press Forum plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  via the 's' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 6.10.11 due to insufficient input
  sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
  inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into
  performing an action such as clicking on a link.
