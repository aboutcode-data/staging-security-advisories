aliases: []
summary: ZoneMinder is a free, open source Closed-circuit television software application for
  Linux which supports IP, USB and Analog cameras. Versions prior to 1.36.33 and 1.37.33 contain
  SQL Injection via malicious jason web token. The Username field of the JWT token was trusted
  when performing an SQL query to load the user.  If an attacker could determine the HASH key
  used by ZoneMinder, they could generate a malicious JWT token and use it to execute arbitrary
  SQL. This issue is fixed in versions 1.36.33 and 1.37.33.
