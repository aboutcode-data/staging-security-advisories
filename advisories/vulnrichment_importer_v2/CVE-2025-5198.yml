summary: A flaw was found in Stackrox, where it is vulnerable to Cross-site scripting (XSS)
  if the script code is included in a small subset of table cells. The only known potential

  to a secured cluster. This object can be used by a user with access to the cluster or through
  a compromised third-party product.
