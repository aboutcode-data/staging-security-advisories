aliases: []
summary: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. The visibility of posts typed `whisper`
  is controlled via the `whispers_allowed_groups` site setting. Only users that belong to groups
  specified in the site setting are allowed to view posts typed `whisper`. However, it has been
  discovered that users of versions prior to 3.4.6 on the `stable` branch and prior to 3.5.0.beta8-dev
  on the `tests-passed` branch can continue to see their own whispers even after losing visibility
  of posts typed `whisper`. This issue is patched in versions 3.4.6 and 3.5.0.beta8-dev. No
  known workarounds are available.
