datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2025/14xxx/CVE-2025-14177.json
aliases: []
summary: In PHP versions:8.1.* before 8.1.34, 8.2.* before 8.2.30, 8.3.* before 8.3.29, 8.4.*
  before 8.4.16, 8.5.* before 8.5.1, the getimagesize() function may leak uninitialized heap
  memory into the APPn segments (e.g., APP1) when reading images in multi-chunk mode (such as
  via php://filter). This occurs due to a bug in php_read_stream_all_chunks() that overwrites
  the buffer without advancing the pointer, leaving tail bytes uninitialized. This may lead
  to information disclosure of sensitive heap data and affect the confidentiality of the target
  server.
