  remote attacker to bypass API authorization checks and use the API to perform privileged actions
  on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks for requests
  that are sent to the REST API of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a malicious request to an affected device via the REST API. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to selectively bypass authorization checks for the REST API of the
  affected software and use the API to perform privileged actions on an affected device. Cisco
