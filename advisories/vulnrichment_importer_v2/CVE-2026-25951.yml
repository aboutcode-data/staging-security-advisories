aliases: []
summary: FUXA is a web-based Process Visualization (SCADA/HMI/Dashboard) software. Prior to
  1.2.11, there is a flaw in the path sanitization logic allows an authenticated attacker with
  administrative privileges to bypass directory traversal protections. By using nested traversal
  sequences (e.g., ....//), an attacker can write arbitrary files to the server filesystem,
  including sensitive directories like runtime/scripts. This leads to Remote Code Execution
  (RCE) when the server reloads the malicious scripts. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.2.11.
