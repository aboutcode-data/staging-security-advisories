aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the protocol handlers of Cisco Webex App could allow an unauthenticated,\
  \ remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information.\r\n\r This vulnerability exists\
  \ because the affected application does not safely handle file protocol handlers. An attacker\
  \ could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a link that is designed\
  \ to cause the application to send requests. If the attacker can observe transmitted traffic\
  \ in a privileged network position, a successful exploit could allow the attacker to capture\
  \ sensitive information, including credential information, from the requests."
