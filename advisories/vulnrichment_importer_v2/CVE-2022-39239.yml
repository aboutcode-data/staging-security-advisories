aliases: []
summary: netlify-ipx is an on-Demand image optimization for Netlify using ipx. In versions prior
  to 1.2.3, an attacker can bypass the source image domain allowlist by sending specially crafted
  headers, causing the handler to load and return arbitrary images. Because the response is
  cached globally, this image will then be served to visitors without requiring those headers
  to be set. XSS can be achieved by requesting a malicious SVG with embedded scripts, which
  would then be served from the site domain. Note that this does not apply to images loaded
  in `<img>` tags, as scripts do not execute in this context. The image URL can be set in the
  header independently of the request URL, meaning any site images that have not previously
  been cached can have their cache poisoned. This problem has been fixed in version 1.2.3. As
  a workaround, cached content can be cleared by re-deploying the site.
