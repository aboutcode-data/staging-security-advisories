aliases: []
summary: An arbitrary code execution vulnerability in Rockwell Automation Arena Simulation could
  let a malicious user insert unauthorized code into the software. This is done by writing beyond
  the designated memory area, which causes an access violation. Once inside, the threat actor
  can run harmful code on the system. This affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability
  of the product. To trigger this, the user would unwittingly need to open a malicious file
  shared by the threat actor.
