aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the certificate validation of Cisco&nbsp;Expressway-C and Cisco&nbsp;TelePresence\
  \ VCS could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive\
  \ data.&nbsp;&nbsp;The vulnerability is due to a lack of validation of the SSL server certificate\
  \ that an affected device receives when it establishes a connection to a Cisco&nbsp;Unified\
  \ Communications Manager device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a man-in-the-middle\
  \ technique to intercept the traffic between the devices, and then using a self-signed certificate\
  \ to impersonate the endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view the intercepted\
  \ traffic in clear text or alter the contents of the traffic.\r\nNote: Cisco&nbsp;Expressway-E\
  \ is not affected by this vulnerability.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address\
  \ this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
