aliases: []
summary: A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was discovered in the
  huggingface/transformers repository, specifically in version 4.49.0. The vulnerability is
  due to inefficient regular expression complexity in the `SETTING_RE` variable within the `transformers/commands/chat.py`
  file. The regex contains repetition groups and non-optimized quantifiers, leading to exponential
  backtracking when processing 'almost matching' payloads. This can degrade application performance
  and potentially result in a denial-of-service (DoS) when handling specially crafted input
  strings. The issue is fixed in version 4.51.0.
