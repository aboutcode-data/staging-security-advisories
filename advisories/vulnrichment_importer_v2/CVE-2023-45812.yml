summary: 'The Apollo Router is a configurable, high-performance graph router written in Rust
  to run a federated supergraph that uses Apollo Federation. Affected versions are subject to
  a Denial-of-Service (DoS) type vulnerability which causes the Router to panic and terminate
  when a multi-part response is sent. When users send queries to the router that uses the `@defer`
  or Subscriptions, the Router will panic. To be vulnerable, users of Router must have a coprocessor
  with `coprocessor.supergraph.response` configured in their `router.yaml` and also to support
  either `@defer` or Subscriptions. Apollo Router version 1.33.0 has a fix for this vulnerability
  which was introduced in PR #4014. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should
  avoid using the coprocessor supergraph response or disable defer and subscriptions support
  and continue to use the coprocessor supergraph response.'
