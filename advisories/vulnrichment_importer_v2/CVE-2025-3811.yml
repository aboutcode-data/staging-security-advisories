aliases: []
summary: The WPBookit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account
  takeover in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2. This is due to the plugin not properly
  validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like email through the edit_newdata_customer_callback()
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's
  email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user's password
  and gain access to their account.
