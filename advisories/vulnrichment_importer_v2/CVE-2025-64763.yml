aliases: []
summary: Envoy is a high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. In 1.33.12, 1.34.10, 1.35.6,
  1.36.2, and earlier, when Envoy is configured in TCP proxy mode to handle CONNECT requests,
  it accepts client data before issuing a 2xx response and forwards that data to the upstream
  TCP connection. If a forwarding proxy upstream from Envoy then responds with a non-2xx status,
  this can cause a de-synchronized CONNECT tunnel state. By default Envoy continues to allow
  early CONNECT data to avoid disrupting existing deployments. The envoy.reloadable_features.reject_early_connect_data
  runtime flag can be set to reject CONNECT requests that send data before a 2xx response when
  intermediaries upstream from Envoy may reject establishment of a CONNECT tunnel.
