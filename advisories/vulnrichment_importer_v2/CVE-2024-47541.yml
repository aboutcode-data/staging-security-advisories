aliases: []
summary: GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An OOB-write
  vulnerability has been identified in the gst_ssa_parse_remove_override_codes function of the
  gstssaparse.c file. This function is responsible for parsing and removing SSA (SubStation
  Alpha) style override codes, which are enclosed in curly brackets ({}). The issue arises when
  a closing curly bracket "}" appears before an opening curly bracket "{" in the input string.
  In this case, memmove() incorrectly duplicates a substring. With each successive loop iteration,
  the size passed to memmove() becomes progressively larger (strlen(end+1)), leading to a write
  beyond the allocated memory bounds. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.
