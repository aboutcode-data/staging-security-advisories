aliases: []
summary: The Uncanny Groups for LearnDash plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
  in all versions up to, and including, 6.1.0.1. This is due to the plugin not properly restricting
  what users a group leader can edit. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
  group leader-level access and above, to change admin account email addresses which can subsequently
  lead to admin account access.
