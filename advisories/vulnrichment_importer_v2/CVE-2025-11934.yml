aliases: []
summary: Improper input validation in the TLS 1.3 CertificateVerify signature algorithm negotiation
  in wolfSSL 5.8.2 and earlier on multiple platforms allows for downgrading the signature algorithm
  used. For example when a client sends ECDSA P521 as the supported signature algorithm the
  server previously could respond as ECDSA P256 being the accepted signature algorithm and the
  connection would continue with using ECDSA P256, if the client supports ECDSA P256.
