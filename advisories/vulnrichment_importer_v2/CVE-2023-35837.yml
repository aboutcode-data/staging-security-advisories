aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in SolaX Pocket WiFi 3 through 3.001.02. Authentication for
  web interface is completed via an unauthenticated WiFi AP. The administrative password for
  the web interface has a default password, equal to the registration ID of the device. This
  same registration ID is used as the WiFi SSID name. No routine is in place to force a change
  to this password on first use or bring its default state to the attention of the user. Once
  authenticated, an attacker can reconfigure the device or upload new firmware, both of which
  can lead to Denial of Service, code execution, or Escalation of Privileges.
