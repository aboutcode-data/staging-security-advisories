  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  firmware: cs_dsp: Prevent buffer overrun when processing V2 alg headers

  Check that all fields of a V2 algorithm header fit into the available
  firmware data buffer.

  The wmfw V2 format introduced variable-length strings in the algorithm
  block header. This means the overall header length is variable, and the
  position of most fields varies depending on the length of the string
  fields. Each field must be checked to ensure that it does not overflow
  the firmware data buffer.

  As this ia bugfix patch, the fixes avoid making any significant change to
  the existing code. This makes it easier to review and less likely to
  introduce new bugs.
