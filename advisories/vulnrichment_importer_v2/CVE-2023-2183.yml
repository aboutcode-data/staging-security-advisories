aliases: []
summary: "Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. \n\nThe option\
  \ to send a test alert is not available from the user panel UI for users having the Viewer\
  \ role. It is still possible for a user with the Viewer role to send a test alert using the\
  \ API as the API does not check access to this function.\n\nThis might enable malicious users\
  \ to abuse the functionality by sending multiple alert messages to e-mail and Slack, spamming\
  \ users, prepare Phishing attack or block SMTP server.\n\nUsers may upgrade to version 9.5.3,\
  \ 9.4.12, 9.3.15, 9.2.19 and 8.5.26 to receive a fix."
