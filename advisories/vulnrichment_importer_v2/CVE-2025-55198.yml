aliases: []
summary: Helm is a package manager for Charts for Kubernetes. Prior to version 3.18.5, when
  parsing Chart.yaml and index.yaml files, an improper validation of type error can lead to
  a panic. This issue has been resolved in Helm 3.18.5. A workaround involves ensuring YAML
  files are formatted as Helm expects prior to processing them with Helm.
