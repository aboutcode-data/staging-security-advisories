aliases: []
summary: Vulnerability in the PMB platform that allows an attacker to persist temporary files
  on the server, affecting versions 4.0.10 and above. This vulnerability exists in the file
  upload functionality on the ‘/pmb/authorities/import/iimport_authorities’ endpoint. When a
  file is uploaded via this resource, the server will create a temporary file that will be deleted
  after the client sends a POST request to ‘/pmb/authorities/import/iimport_authorities’. This
  workflow is automated by the web client, however an attacker can trap and launch the second
  POST request to prevent the temporary file from being deleted.
