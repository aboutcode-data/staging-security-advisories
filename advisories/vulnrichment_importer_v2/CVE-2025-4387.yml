  upload vulnerability due to missing file type validation in the wcap_add_to_cart_popup_upload_files
  function in all versions up to, and including, 9.16.0. This makes it possible for an authenticated
  attacker, with subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected

  configuration.
