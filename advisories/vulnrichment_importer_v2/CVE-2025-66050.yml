summary: |
  Vivotek IP7137 camera with firmware version 0200a by default dos not require to provide any password when logging in as an administrator. While it is possible to set up such a password, a user is not informed about such a need.
  The vendor has not replied to the CNA. Possibly all firmware versions are affected. Since the product has met End-Of-Life phase, a fix is not expected to be released.
