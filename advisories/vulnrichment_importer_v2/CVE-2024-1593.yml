aliases: []
summary: A path traversal vulnerability exists in the mlflow/mlflow repository due to improper
  handling of URL parameters. By smuggling path traversal sequences using the ';' character
  in URLs, attackers can manipulate the 'params' portion of the URL to gain unauthorized access
  to files or directories. This vulnerability allows for arbitrary data smuggling into the 'params'
  part of the URL, enabling attacks similar to those described in previous reports but utilizing
  the ';' character for parameter smuggling. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized
  information disclosure or server compromise.
