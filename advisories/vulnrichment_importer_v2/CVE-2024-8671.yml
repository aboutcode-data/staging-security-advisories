aliases: []
summary: The WooEvents - Calendar and Event Booking plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
  file overwrite due to insufficient file path validation in the inc/barcode.php file in all
  versions up to, and including, 4.1.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to overwrite arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution
  when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
