summary: OpenEXR provides the specification and reference implementation of the EXR file format,
  an image storage format for the motion picture industry. In versions 3.3.2 through 3.3.0,
  there is a heap-based buffer overflow during a write operation when decompressing ZIPS-packed
  deep scan-line EXR files with a maliciously forged chunk header. This is fixed in version
  3.3.3.
