aliases: []
summary: In mintplex-labs/anything-llm versions up to and including 1.5.3, an issue was discovered
  where the password hash of a user is returned in the response after login (`POST /api/request-token`)
  and after account creations (`POST /api/admin/users/new`). This exposure occurs because the
  entire User object, including the bcrypt password hash, is included in the response sent to
  the frontend. This practice could potentially lead to sensitive information exposure despite
  the use of bcrypt, a strong hashing algorithm. It is recommended not to expose any clues about
  passwords to the frontend.
