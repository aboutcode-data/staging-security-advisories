aliases: []
summary: Horilla is a free and open source Human Resource Management System (HRMS). Prior to
  version 1.4.0, improper sanitization across the application allows XSS via uploaded SVG (and
  via allowed <embed>), which can be chained to execute JavaScript whenever users view impacted
  content (e.g., announcements). This can result in admin account takeover. This issue has been
  patched in version 1.4.0.
