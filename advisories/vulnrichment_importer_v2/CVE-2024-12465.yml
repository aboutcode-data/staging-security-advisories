aliases: []
summary: The Property Hive Stamp Duty Calculator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
  Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'stamp_duty_calculator_scotland' shortcode in all versions
  up to, and including, 1.0.22 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on
  user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses an injected page.
