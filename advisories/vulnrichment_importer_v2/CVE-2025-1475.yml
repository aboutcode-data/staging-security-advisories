aliases: []
summary: The WPCOM Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all
  versions up to, and including, 1.7.5. This is due to insufficient verification on the 'user_phone'
  parameter when logging in. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in
  as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if SMS login is enabled.
