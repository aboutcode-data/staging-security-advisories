summary: "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer vulnerability\
  \ was discovered in Apache NuttX RTOS apps/exapmles/xmlrpc application. In this example application\
  \ device stats structure that stored remotely provided parameters had hardcoded buffer size\
  \ which could lead to buffer overflow. Structure members buffers were updated to valid size\
  \ of CONFIG_XMLRPC_STRINGSIZE+1.\n\nThis issue affects Apache NuttX RTOS users that may have\
  \ used or base their code on example application as presented in releases from 6.22 before\
  \ 12.9.0.\n\nUsers of XMLRPC in Apache NuttX RTOS are advised to review their code \nfor this\
  \ pattern and update buffer sizes as presented in the version of \nthe example in release\
  \ 12.9.0."
