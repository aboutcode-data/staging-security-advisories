aliases: []
summary: |
  body-parser 2.2.0 is vulnerable to denial of service due to inefficient handling of URL-encoded bodies with very large numbers of parameters. An attacker can send payloads containing thousands of parameters within the default 100KB request size limit, causing elevated CPU and memory usage. This can lead to service slowdown or partial outages under sustained malicious traffic.
  This issue is addressed in version 2.2.1.
