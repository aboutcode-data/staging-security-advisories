aliases: []
summary: In the `manim` plugin of binary-husky/gpt_academic, versions prior to the fix, a vulnerability
  exists due to improper handling of user-provided prompts. The root cause is the execution
  of untrusted code generated by the LLM without a proper sandbox. This allows an attacker to
  perform remote code execution (RCE) on the app backend server by injecting malicious code
  through the prompt.
