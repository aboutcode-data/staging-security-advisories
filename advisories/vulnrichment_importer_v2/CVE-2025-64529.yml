aliases: []
summary: SpiceDB is an open source database system for creating and managing security-critical
  application permissions. In versions prior to 1.45.2, users who use the exclusion operator
  somewhere in their authorization schema; have configured their SpiceDB server such that `--write-relationships-max-updates-per-call`
  is bigger than 6500; and issue calls to WriteRelationships with a large enough number of updates
  that cause the payload to be bigger than what their datastore allows; will receive a successful
  response from their `WriteRelationships` call, when in reality that call failed, and receive
  incorrect permission check results, if those relationships had to be read to resolve the relation
  involving the exclusion. Version 1.45.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, set
  `--write-relationships-max-updates-per-call` to `1000`.
