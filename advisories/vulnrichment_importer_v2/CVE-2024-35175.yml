aliases: []
summary: sshpiper is a reverse proxy for sshd. Starting in version 1.0.50 and prior to version
  1.3.0, the way the proxy protocol listener is implemented in sshpiper can allow an attacker
  to forge their connecting address. Commit 2ddd69876a1e1119059debc59fe869cb4e754430 added the
  proxy protocol listener as the only listener in sshpiper, with no option to toggle this functionality
  off. This means that any connection that sshpiper is directly (or in some cases indirectly)
  exposed to can use proxy protocol to forge its source address. Any users of sshpiper who need
  logs from it for whitelisting/rate limiting/security investigations could have them become
  much less useful if an attacker is sending a spoofed source address. Version 1.3.0 contains
  a patch for the issue.
