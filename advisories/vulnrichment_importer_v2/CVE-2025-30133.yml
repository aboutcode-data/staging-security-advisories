aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered on IROAD Dashcam FX2 devices. Bypass of Device Pairing/Registration
  can occur. It requires device registration via the "IROAD X View" app for authentication,
  but its HTTP server lacks this restriction. Once connected to the dashcam's Wi-Fi network
  via the default password ("qwertyuiop"), an attacker can directly access the HTTP server at
  http://192.168.10.1 without undergoing the pairing process. Additionally, no alert is triggered
  on the device when an attacker connects, making this intrusion completely silent.
