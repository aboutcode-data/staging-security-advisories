summary: The Quick View for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure
  in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.17 via the 'wqv_popup_content' AJAX endpoint due
  to insufficient restrictions on which products can be included. This makes it possible for
  unauthenticated attackers to extract data from private products that they should not have
  access to.
