aliases: []
summary: Caddy is an extensible server platform that uses TLS by default. Prior to version 2.11.1,
  Caddy's HTTP `host` request matcher is documented as case-insensitive, but when configured
  with a large host list (>100 entries) it becomes case-sensitive due to an optimized matching
  path. An attacker can bypass host-based routing and any access controls attached to that route
  by changing the casing of the `Host` header. Version 2.11.1 contains a fix for the issue.
