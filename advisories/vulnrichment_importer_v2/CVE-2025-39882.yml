  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/mediatek: fix potential OF node use-after-free

  The for_each_child_of_node() helper drops the reference it takes to each
  node as it iterates over children and an explicit of_node_put() is only
  needed when exiting the loop early.

  Drop the recently introduced bogus additional reference count decrement
  at each iteration that could potentially lead to a use-after-free.
