summary: "ACE vulnerability in configuration file processing  by QOS.CH logback-core up to and\
  \ including version 1.5.24 in Java applications, allows an attacker to instantiate classes\
  \ already present on the class path by compromising an existing logback configuration file.\n\
  \n\n\n\nThe instantiation of a potentially malicious Java class requires that said class is\
  \ present on the user's class-path. In addition, the attacker must  have write access to a\
  \ \nconfiguration file. However, after successful instantiation, the instance is very likely\
  \ to be discarded with no further ado."
