aliases: []
summary: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. In versions prior to 3.5.4, 2025.11.2,
  2025.12.1, and 2026.1.0, moderators can convert some personal messages to public topics when
  they shouldn't have access. This issue is patched in versions 3.5.4, 2025.11.2, 2025.12.1,
  and 2026.1.0. As a workaround, site admin can temporarily revoke the moderation role from
  untrusted moderators or remove the moderator group from the "personal message enabled groups"
  site setting until the Discourse instance has been upgraded to a version that has been patched.
