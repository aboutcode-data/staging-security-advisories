summary: The Spam protection, Anti-Spam, FireWall by CleanTalk plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to unauthorized Arbitrary Plugin Installation due to an missing empty value check on the 'api_key'
  value in the 'perform' function in all versions up to, and including, 6.44. This makes it

  be leveraged to achieve remote code execution if another vulnerable plugin is installed and
  activated.
