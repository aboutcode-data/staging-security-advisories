summary: Shopware is an open commerce platform based on the Symfony php Framework and the Vue
  javascript framework. In affected versions guest sessions are shared between customers when
  HTTP cache is enabled. This can lead to inconsistent experiences for guest users. Setups with
  Varnish are not affected by this issue. This issue has been resolved in version 6.4.8.2. Users
  unable to upgrade should disable the HTTP Cache.
