aliases: []
summary: 'The web management console of CheckMK Enterprise Edition (versions 1.5.0 to 2.0.0p9)
  does not properly sanitise the uploading of ".mkp" files, which are Extension Packages, making
  remote code execution possible. Successful exploitation requires access to the web management
  interface, either with valid credentials or with a hijacked session of a user with administrator
  role. NOTE: the vendor states that this is the intended behavior: admins are supposed to be
  able to execute code in this manner'
