aliases: []
summary: 'A Use After Free vulnerability in the kernel of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved
  allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). In a
  Non Stop Routing (NSR) scenario, an unexpected kernel restart might be observed if "bgp auto-discovery"
  is enabled and if there is a BGP neighbor flap of auto-discovery sessions for any reason.
  This is a race condition which is outside of an attackers direct control and it depends on
  system internal timing whether this issue occurs. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos
  OS Evolved: 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-EVO; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R2-EVO; 22.1 versions
  prior to 22.1R2-EVO; 22.2 versions prior to 22.2R1-S1-EVO, 22.2R2-EVO.'
