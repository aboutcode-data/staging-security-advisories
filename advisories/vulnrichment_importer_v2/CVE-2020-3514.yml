aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the multi-instance feature of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD)
  Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to escape the container for their Cisco
  FTD instance and execute commands with root privileges in the host namespace. The attacker
  must have valid credentials on the device.The vulnerability exists because a configuration
  file that is used at container startup has insufficient protections. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by modifying a specific container configuration file on the underlying
  file system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands with root privileges
  within the host namespace. This could allow the attacker to impact other running Cisco FTD
  instances or the host Cisco FXOS device.
