  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  wifi: ath12k: fix possible out-of-bound read in ath12k_htt_pull_ppdu_stats()

  len is extracted from HTT message and could be an unexpected value in
  case errors happen, so add validation before using to avoid possible
  out-of-bound read in the following message iteration and parsing.

  The same issue also applies to ppdu_info->ppdu_stats.common.num_users,
  so validate it before using too.

  These are found during code review.

  Compile test only.
