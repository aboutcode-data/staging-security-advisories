aliases: []
summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. In multilingual wikis, translations can
  be edited by any user who has edit right, circumventing the rights that are normally required
  for authoring translations (script right for user-scope translations, wiki admin for translations
  on the wiki). Starting in version 4.3-milestone-2 and prior to versions 4.10.20, 15.5.4, and
  15.10-rc-1, this can be exploited for remote code execution if the translation value is not
  properly escaped where it is used. This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.20, 15.5.4 and 15.10RC1.
  As a workaround, one may restrict edit rights on documents that contain translations.
