aliases: []
summary: Ollama 0.11.5-rc0 through current version 0.13.5 contain a null pointer dereference
  vulnerability in the multi-modal model image processing functionality. When processing base64-encoded
  image data via the /api/chat endpoint, the application fails to validate that the decoded
  data represents valid media before passing it to the mtmd_helper_bitmap_init_from_buf function.
  This function can return NULL for malformed input, but the code does not check this return
  value before dereferencing the pointer in subsequent operations. A remote attacker can exploit
  this by sending specially crafted base64 image data that decodes to invalid media, causing
  a segmentation fault and crashing the runner process. This results in a denial of service
  condition where the model becomes unavailable to all users until the service is restarted.
