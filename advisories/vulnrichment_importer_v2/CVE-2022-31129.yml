aliases: []
summary: moment is a JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting
  dates. Affected versions of moment were found to use an inefficient parsing algorithm. Specifically
  using string-to-date parsing in moment (more specifically rfc2822 parsing, which is tried
  by default) has quadratic (N^2) complexity on specific inputs. Users may notice a noticeable
  slowdown is observed with inputs above 10k characters. Users who pass user-provided strings
  without sanity length checks to moment constructor are vulnerable to (Re)DoS attacks. The
  problem is patched in 2.29.4, the patch can be applied to all affected versions with minimal
  tweaking. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should consider limiting date
  lengths accepted from user input.
