aliases: []
summary: The Gutenberg Blocks with AI by Kadence WP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing
  Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.1. This is due to a missing capability
  check in the `process_image_data_ajax_callback()` function which handles the `kadence_import_process_image_data`
  AJAX action. The function's authorization check via `verify_ajax_call()` only validates `edit_posts`
  capability but fails to check for the `upload_files` capability. This makes it possible for
  authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to upload arbitrary images
  from remote URLs to the WordPress Media Library, bypassing the standard WordPress capability
  restriction that prevents Contributors from uploading files.
