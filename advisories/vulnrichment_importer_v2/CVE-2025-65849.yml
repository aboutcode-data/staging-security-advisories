aliases: []
summary: 'A cryptanalytic break in Altcha Proof-of-Work obfuscation mode version 0.8.0 and later
  allows for remote visitors to recover the Proof-of-Work nonce in constant time via mathematical
  deduction. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because the product''s objective is "to
  discourage automated scraping / bots, not guarantee resistance to determined attackers." The
  documentation states “the goal is not to provide a secure cryptographic algorithm but to use
  a proof-of-work mechanism that allows any capable device to decrypt the hidden data.”'
