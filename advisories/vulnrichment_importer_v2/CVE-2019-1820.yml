summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure
  and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network (EPN) Manager software could allow an authenticated,
  remote attacker to download and view files within the application that should be restricted.
  This vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input in HTTP request
  parameters that describe filenames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using
  directory traversal techniques to submit a path to a desired file location. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to view application files that may contain sensitive information.
