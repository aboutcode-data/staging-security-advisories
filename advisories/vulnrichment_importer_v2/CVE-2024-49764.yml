summary: LibreNMS is an open-source, PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network monitoring system. A Stored
  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Capture Debug Information" page allows authenticated
  users to inject arbitrary JavaScript through the "hostname" parameter when creating a new
  device. This vulnerability results in the execution of malicious code when the "Capture Debug
  Information" page is visited, redirecting the user and sending non-httponly cookies to an
  attacker-controlled domain. This vulnerability is fixed in 24.10.0.
