summary: Before Beetl v3.15.12, the rendering template has a server-side template injection
  (SSTI) vulnerability. When the incoming template is controllable, it will be filtered by the
  DefaultNativeSecurityManager blacklist. Because blacklist filtering is not strict, the blacklist
  can be bypassed, leading to arbitrary code execution.
