aliases: []
summary: 'Components of the YoSmart YoLink ecosystem through 2025-10-02 leverage unencrypted
  MQTT to communicate over the internet. An attacker with the ability to monitor network traffic
  could therefore obtain sensitive information or tamper with the traffic to control affected
  devices. This affects YoLink Hub 0382, YoLink Mobile Application 1.40.41, and YoLink MQTT
  Broker. NOTE: The vendor states that the vulnerability described (related to insecure transmission)
  only impacts the legacy mobile application logic, not the Hub hardware or firmware. The Hub
  functions solely as a pass-through (transparent gateway) for LoRa wireless data and does not
  inspect or process the application layer data.'
