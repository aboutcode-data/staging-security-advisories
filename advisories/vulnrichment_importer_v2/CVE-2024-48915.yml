aliases: []
summary: Agent Dart is an agent library built for Internet Computer for Dart and Flutter apps.
  Prior to version 1.0.0-dev.29, certificate verification in `lib/agent/certificate.dart` does
  not occur properly. During the delegation verification in the `_checkDelegation` function,
  the canister_ranges aren't verified. The impact of not checking the canister_ranges is that
  a subnet can sign canister responses in behalf of another subnet. The certificate’s timestamp,
  i.e /time path, is also not verified, meaning that the certificate effectively has no expiration
  time. Version 1.0.0-dev.29 implements appropriate certificate verification.
