aliases: []
summary: Minio is a Multi-Cloud Object Storage framework. All users on Windows prior to version
  RELEASE.2023-03-20T20-16-18Z are impacted. MinIO fails to filter the `\` character, which
  allows for arbitrary object placement across buckets. As a result, a user with low privileges,
  such as an access key, service account, or STS credential, which only has permission to `PutObject`
  in a specific bucket, can create an admin user. This issue is patched in RELEASE.2023-03-20T20-16-18Z.
  There are no known workarounds.
