  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ALSA: control: Avoid WARN() for symlink errors

  Using WARN() for showing the error of symlink creations don't give
  more information than telling that something goes wrong, since the
  usual code path is a lregister callback from each control element
  creation.  More badly, the use of WARN() rather confuses fuzzer as if
  it were serious issues.

  This patch downgrades the warning messages to use the normal dev_err()
  instead of WARN().  For making it clearer, add the function name to
  the prefix, too.
