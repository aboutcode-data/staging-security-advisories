aliases: []
summary: onion-site-template is a complete, scalable tor hidden service self-hosting sample.
  Versions which include commit 3196bd89 contain a baked-in tor image if the secrets were copied
  from an existing onion domain. A website could be compromised if a user shared the baked-in
  image, or if someone were able to acquire access to the user's device outside of a containerized
  environment. This is fixed by commit bc9ba0fd.
