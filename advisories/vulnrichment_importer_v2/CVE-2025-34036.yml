aliases: []
summary: An OS command injection vulnerability exists in white-labeled DVRs manufactured by
  TVT, affecting a custom HTTP service called "Cross Web Server" that listens on TCP ports 81
  and 82. The web interface fails to sanitize input in the URI path passed to the language extraction
  functionality. When the server processes a request to /language/[lang]/index.html, it uses
  the [lang] input unsafely in a tar extraction command without proper escaping. This allows
  an unauthenticated remote attacker to inject shell commands and achieve arbitrary command
  execution as root. Exploitation evidence was observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2025-02-06
  UTC.
