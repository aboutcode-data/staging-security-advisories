aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management
  Center (FMC) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface. The vulnerability
  is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious code in certain sections
  of the interface that are visible to other users. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based
  information. An attacker would need valid administrator credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
