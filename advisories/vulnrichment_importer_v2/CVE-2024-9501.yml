aliases: []
summary: The Wp Social Login and Register Social Counter plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.7. This is due to insufficient
  verification on the user being returned by the social login token. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator,
  if they have access to the email and the user does not have an already-existing account for
  the service returning the token.
