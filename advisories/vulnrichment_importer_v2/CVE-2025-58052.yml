aliases: []
summary: Galette is a membership management web application for non profit organizations. Starting
  in version 0.9.6 and prior to version 1.2.0, attackers with group manager role can bypass
  intended restrictions allowing unauthorized access and changes despite role-based controls.
  Since it requires privileged access initially, exploitation is restricted to malicious insiders
  or compromised group managers accounts. Version 1.2.0 fixes the issue.
