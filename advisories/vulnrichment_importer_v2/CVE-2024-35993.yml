summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: turn folio_test_hugetlb\
  \ into a PageType\n\nThe current folio_test_hugetlb() can be fooled by a concurrent folio\
  \ split\ninto returning true for a folio which has never belonged to hugetlbfs. \nThis can't\
  \ happen if the caller holds a refcount on it, but we have a few\nplaces (memory-failure,\
  \ compaction, procfs) which do not and should not\ntake a speculative reference.\n\nSince\
  \ hugetlb pages do not use individual page mapcounts (they are always\nfully mapped and use\
  \ the entire_mapcount field to record the number of\nmappings), the PageType field is available\
  \ now that page_mapcount()\nignores the value in this field.\n\nIn compaction and with CONFIG_DEBUG_VM\
  \ enabled, the current implementation\ncan result in an oops, as reported by Luis. This happens\
  \ since 9c5ccf2db04b\n(\"mm: remove HUGETLB_PAGE_DTOR\") effectively added some VM_BUG_ON()\
  \ checks\nin the PageHuge() testing path.\n\n[willy@infradead.org: update vmcoreinfo]"
