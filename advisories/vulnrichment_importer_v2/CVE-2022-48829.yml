  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  NFSD: Fix NFSv3 SETATTR/CREATE's handling of large file sizes

  iattr::ia_size is a loff_t, so these NFSv3 procedures must be
  careful to deal with incoming client size values that are larger
  than s64_max without corrupting the value.

  Silently capping the value results in storing a different value
  than the client passed in which is unexpected behavior, so remove
  the min_t() check in decode_sattr3().

  Note that RFC 1813 permits only the WRITE procedure to return
  NFS3ERR_FBIG. We believe that NFSv3 reference implementations
  also return NFS3ERR_FBIG when ia_size is too large.
