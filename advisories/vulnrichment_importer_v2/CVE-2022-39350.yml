aliases: []
summary: '@dependencytrack/frontend is a Single Page Application (SPA) used in Dependency-Track,
  an open source Component Analysis platform that allows organizations to identify and reduce
  risk in the software supply chain. Due to the common practice of providing vulnerability details
  in markdown format, the Dependency-Track frontend renders them using the JavaScript library
  Showdown. Showdown does not have any XSS countermeasures built in, and versions before 4.6.1
  of the Dependency-Track frontend did not encode or sanitize Showdown''s output. This made
  it possible for arbitrary JavaScript included in vulnerability details via HTML attributes
  to be executed in context of the frontend. Actors with the `VULNERABILITY_MANAGEMENT` permission
  can exploit this weakness by creating or editing a custom vulnerability and providing XSS
  payloads in any of the following fields: Description, Details, Recommendation, or References.
  The payload will be executed for users with the `VIEW_PORTFOLIO` permission when browsing
  to the modified vulnerability''s page. Alternatively, malicious JavaScript could be introduced
  via any of the vulnerability databases mirrored by Dependency-Track. However, this attack
  vector is highly unlikely, and the maintainers of Dependency-Track are not aware of any occurrence
  of this happening. Note that the `Vulnerability Details` element of the `Audit Vulnerabilities`
  tab in the project view is not affected. The issue has been fixed in frontend version 4.6.1.'
