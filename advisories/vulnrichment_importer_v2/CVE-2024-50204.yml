  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  fs: don't try and remove empty rbtree node

  When copying a namespace we won't have added the new copy into the
  namespace rbtree until after the copy succeeded. Calling free_mnt_ns()
  will try to remove the copy from the rbtree which is invalid. Simply
  free the namespace skeleton directly.
