aliases: []
summary: OpenCTI is an open-source cyber threat intelligence platform. Before 6.3.0, general
  users can access information that can only be accessed by users with access privileges to
  admin and support information (SETTINGS_SUPPORT). This is due to inadequate access control
  for support information (http://<opencti_domain>/storage/get/support/UUID/UUID.zip), and that
  the UUID is available to general users using an attached query (logs query). This vulnerability
  is fixed in 6.3.0.
