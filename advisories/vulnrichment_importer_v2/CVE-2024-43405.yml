aliases: []
summary: Nuclei is a vulnerability scanner powered by YAML based templates. Starting in version
  3.0.0 and prior to version 3.3.2, a vulnerability in Nuclei's template signature verification
  system could allow an attacker to bypass the signature check and possibly execute malicious
  code via custom code template. The vulnerability is present in the template signature verification
  process, specifically in the `signer` package. The vulnerability stems from a discrepancy
  between how the signature verification process and the YAML parser handle newline characters,
  combined with the way multiple signatures are processed. This allows an attacker to inject
  malicious content into a template while maintaining a valid signature for the benign part
  of the template. CLI users are affected if they execute custom code templates from unverified
  sources. This includes templates authored by third parties or obtained from unverified repositories.
  SDK Users are affected if they are developers integrating Nuclei into their platforms, particularly
  if they permit the execution of custom code templates by end-users. The vulnerability is addressed
  in Nuclei v3.3.2. Users are strongly recommended to update to this version to mitigate the
  security risk. As an interim measure, users should refrain from using custom templates if
  unable to upgrade immediately. Only trusted, verified templates should be executed. Those
  who are unable to upgrade Nuclei should disable running custom code templates as a workaround.
