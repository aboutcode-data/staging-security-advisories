  scsi: storvsc: Fix swiotlb bounce buffer leak in confidential VM

  storvsc_queuecommand() maps the scatter/gather list using scsi_dma_map(),
  which in a confidential VM allocates swiotlb bounce buffers. If the I/O
  submission fails in storvsc_do_io(), the I/O is typically retried by higher
  level code, but the bounce buffer memory is never freed.  The mostly like
  cause of I/O submission failure is a full VMBus channel ring buffer, which
  is not uncommon under high I/O loads.  Eventually enough bounce buffer
  memory leaks that the confidential VM can't do any I/O. The same problem
  can arise in a non-confidential VM with kernel boot parameter
  swiotlb=force.

  Fix this by doing scsi_dma_unmap() in the case of an I/O submission
  error, which frees the bounce buffer memory.
