aliases: []
summary: 'Copier is a library and CLI app for rendering project templates. Prior to version
  9.11.2, Copier suggests that it''s safe to generate a project from a safe template, i.e. one
  that doesn''t use unsafe features like custom Jinja extensions which would require passing
  the `--UNSAFE,--trust` flag. As it turns out, a safe template can currently include arbitrary
  files/directories outside the local template clone location by using symlinks along with `_preserve_symlinks:
  false` (which is Copier''s default setting). Version 9.11.2 patches the issue.'
