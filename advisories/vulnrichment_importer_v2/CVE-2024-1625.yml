aliases: []
summary: An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary
  application version 0.3.0, allowing unauthorized deletion of any organization's project. The
  vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint,
  where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the
  requesting user's organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to
  any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target project's ID. This issue
  affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route.
