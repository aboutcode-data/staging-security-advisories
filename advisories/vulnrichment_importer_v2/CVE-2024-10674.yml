summary: The Th Shop Mania theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized arbitrary plugin
  installation due to a missing capability check on the th_shop_mania_install_and_activate_callback()
  function in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.9. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to install arbitrary plugins which can
  be leveraged to exploit other vulnerabilities and achieve remote code execution and privilege
  escalation.
