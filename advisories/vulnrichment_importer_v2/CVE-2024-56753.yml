  drm/amdgpu/gfx9: Add Cleaner Shader Deinitialization in gfx_v9_0 Module

  This commit addresses an omission in the previous patch related to the
  cleaner shader support for GFX9 hardware. Specifically, it adds the
  necessary deinitialization code for the cleaner shader in the
  gfx_v9_0_sw_fini function.

  The added line amdgpu_gfx_cleaner_shader_sw_fini(adev); ensures that any
  allocated resources for the cleaner shader are freed correctly, avoiding
  potential memory leaks and ensuring that the GPU state is clean for the
  next initialization sequence.
