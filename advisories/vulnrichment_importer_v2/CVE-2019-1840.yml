aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the DHCPv6 input packet processor of Cisco Prime Network Registrar
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to restart the server and cause a denial of
  service (DoS) condition on the affected system. The vulnerability is due to incomplete user-supplied
  input validation when a custom extension attempts to change a DHCPv6 packet received by the
  application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed DHCPv6 packets
  to the application. An exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a restart of the service
  which, if exploited repeatedly, might lead to a DoS condition. This vulnerability can only
  be exploited if the administrator of the server has previously installed custom extensions
  that attempt to modify the packet details before the packet has been processed. Note: Although
  the CVSS score matches a High SIR, this has been lowered to Medium because this condition
  will only affect an application that has customer-developed extensions that will attempt to
  modify packet parameters before the packet has been completely sanitized. If packet modification
  in a custom extension happens after the packet has been sanitized, the application will not
  be affected by this vulnerability. Software versions prior to 8.3(7) and 9.1(2) are affected.'
