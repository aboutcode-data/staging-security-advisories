aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) implementation of Cisco Adaptive
  Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could
  allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the reload of an affected device, resulting
  in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper memory protection
  mechanisms while processing certain OSPF packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a series of malformed OSPF packets in a short period of time to an affected device.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device, resulting
  in a DoS condition for client traffic that is traversing the device.
