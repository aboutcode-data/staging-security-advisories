aliases: []
summary: ethereum is a common ethereum structs for Rust. Prior to ethereum crate v0.18.0, signature
  malleability (according to EIP-2) was only checked for "legacy" transactions, but not for
  EIP-2930, EIP-1559 and EIP-7702 transactions. This is a specification deviation. The signature
  malleability itself is not a security issue and not as high of a risk if the ethereum crate
  is used on a single-implementation blockchain. This issue has been patched in version v0.18.0.
  A workaround for this issue involves manually checking transaction malleability outside of
  the crate, however upgrading is recommended.
