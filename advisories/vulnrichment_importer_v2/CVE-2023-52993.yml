  x86/i8259: Mark legacy PIC interrupts with IRQ_LEVEL

  Baoquan reported that after triggering a crash the subsequent crash-kernel
  fails to boot about half of the time. It triggers a NULL pointer
  dereference in the periodic tick code.

  This happens because the legacy timer interrupt (IRQ0) is resent in
  software which happens in soft interrupt (tasklet) context. In this context
  get_irq_regs() returns NULL which leads to the NULL pointer dereference.

  The reason for the resend is a spurious APIC interrupt on the IRQ0 vector
  which is captured and leads to a resend when the legacy timer interrupt is
  enabled. This is wrong because the legacy PIC interrupts are level
  triggered and therefore should never be resent in software, but nothing
  ever sets the IRQ_LEVEL flag on those interrupts, so the core code does not
  know about their trigger type.

  Ensure that IRQ_LEVEL is set when the legacy PCI interrupts are set up.
