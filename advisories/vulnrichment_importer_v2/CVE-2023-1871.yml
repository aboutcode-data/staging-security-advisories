aliases: []
summary: The YourChannel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in
  versions up to, and including, 1.2.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the deleteLang function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset
  the plugin's quick language translation settings via a forged request granted they can trick
  a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
