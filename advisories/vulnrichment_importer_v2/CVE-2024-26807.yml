summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBoth cadence-quadspi\
  \ ->runtime_suspend() and ->runtime_resume()\nimplementations start with:\n\n\tstruct cqspi_st\
  \ *cqspi = dev_get_drvdata(dev);\n\tstruct spi_controller *host = dev_get_drvdata(dev);\n\n\
  This obviously cannot be correct, unless \"struct cqspi_st\" is the\nfirst member of \" struct\
  \ spi_controller\", or the other way around, but\nit is not the case. \"struct spi_controller\"\
  \ is allocated by\ndevm_spi_alloc_host(), which allocates an extra amount of memory for\n\
  private data, used to store \"struct cqspi_st\".\n\nThe ->probe() function of the cadence-quadspi\
  \ driver then sets the\ndevice drvdata to store the address of the \"struct cqspi_st\"\nstructure.\
  \ Therefore:\n\n\tstruct cqspi_st *cqspi = dev_get_drvdata(dev);\n\nis correct, but:\n\n\t\
  struct spi_controller *host = dev_get_drvdata(dev);\n\nis not, as it makes \"host\" point\
  \ not to a \"struct spi_controller\" but\nto the same \"struct cqspi_st\" structure as above.\n\
  \nThis obviously leads to bad things (memory corruption, kernel crashes)\ndirectly during\
  \ ->probe(), as ->probe() enables the device using PM\nruntime, leading the ->runtime_resume()\
  \ hook being called, which in\nturns calls spi_controller_resume() with the wrong pointer.\n\
  \nThis has at least been reported [0] to cause a kernel crash, but the\nexact behavior will\
  \ depend on the memory contents.\n\n[0] https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240226121803.5a7r5wkpbbowcxgx@dhruva/\n\
  \nThis issue potentially affects all platforms that are currently using\nthe cadence-quadspi\
  \ driver."
