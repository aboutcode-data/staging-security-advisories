  nbd: fix uaf in nbd_open

  Commit 4af5f2e03013 ("nbd: use blk_mq_alloc_disk and
  blk_cleanup_disk") cleans up disk by blk_cleanup_disk() and it won't set
  disk->private_data as NULL as before. UAF may be triggered in nbd_open()
  if someone tries to open nbd device right after nbd_put() since nbd has
  been free in nbd_dev_remove().

  Fix this by implementing ->free_disk and free private data in it.
