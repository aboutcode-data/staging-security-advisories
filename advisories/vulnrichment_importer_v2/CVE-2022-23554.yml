aliases: []
summary: Alpine is a scaffolding library in Java. Alpine prior to version 1.10.4 allows Authentication
  Filter bypass. The AuthenticationFilter relies on the request URI to evaluate if the user
  is accessing the swagger endpoint. By accessing a URL with a path such as /api/foo;%2fapi%2fswagger
  the contains condition will hold and will return from the authentication filter without aborting
  the request. Note that the principal object will not be assigned and therefore the issue wont
  allow user impersonation. This issue has been fixed in version 1.10.4. There are no known
  workarounds.
