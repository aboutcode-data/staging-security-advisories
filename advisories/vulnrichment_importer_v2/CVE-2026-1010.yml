summary: |
  A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Altium Workflow Engine due to missing server-side input sanitization in workflow form submission APIs. A regular authenticated user can inject arbitrary JavaScript into workflow data.

  When an administrator views the affected workflow, the injected payload executes in the administrator’s browser context, allowing privilege escalation, including creation of new administrator accounts, session token theft, and execution of administrative actions.
