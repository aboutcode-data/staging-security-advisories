aliases: []
summary: Contao is an open source content management system. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior
  to version 4.13.40 and 5.3.4, it is possible to inject insert tags in frontend forms if the
  output is structured in a very specific way. Contao versions 4.13.40 and 5.3.4 have a patch
  for this issue. As a workaround, do not output user data from frontend forms next to each
  other, always separate them by at least one character.
