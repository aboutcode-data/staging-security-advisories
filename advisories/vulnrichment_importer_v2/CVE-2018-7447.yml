aliases: []
summary: 'mojoPortal through 2.6.0.0 is prone to multiple persistent cross-site scripting vulnerabilities
  because it fails to sanitize user-supplied input. The ''Title'' and ''Subtitle'' fields of
  the ''Blog'' page are vulnerable. NOTE: The software maintainer disputes this as a vulnerability
  because the fields claimed to be vulnerable to XSS are only available to administrators who
  are supposed to have access to add scripts'
