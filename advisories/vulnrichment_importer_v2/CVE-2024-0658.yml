aliases: []
summary: The Insert PHP Code Snippet plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the user's name when accessing the insert-php-code-snippet-manage page in all
  versions up to, and including, 1.3.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject
  arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
  This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been
  disabled.
