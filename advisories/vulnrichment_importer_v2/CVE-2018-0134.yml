aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the RADIUS authentication module of Cisco Policy Suite could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to determine whether a subscriber username is valid. The
  vulnerability occurs because the Cisco Policy Suite RADIUS server component returns different
  authentication failure messages based on the validity of usernames. An attacker could use
  these messages to determine whether a valid subscriber username has been identified. The attacker
  could use this information in subsequent attacks against the system. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg47830.'
