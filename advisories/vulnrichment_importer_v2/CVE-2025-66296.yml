aliases: []
summary: Grav is a file-based Web platform. Prior to 1.8.0-beta.27, a privilege escalation vulnerability
  exists in Grav’s Admin plugin due to the absence of username uniqueness validation when creating
  users. A user with the create user permission can create a new account using the same username
  as an existing administrator account, set a new password/email, and then log in as that administrator.
  This effectively allows privilege escalation from limited user-manager permissions to full
  administrator access. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.8.0-beta.27.
