aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability has been identified in the OPC.Testclient utility, which is included
  in Rexroth IndraWorks. All versions prior to 15V24 are affected. This flaw allows an attacker
  to execute arbitrary code on the user's system by parsing a manipulated file containing malicious
  serialized data. Exploitation requires user interaction, specifically opening a specially
  crafted file, which then causes the application to deserialize the malicious data, enabling
  Remote Code Execution (RCE). This can lead to a complete compromise of the system running
  the OPC.Testclient.
