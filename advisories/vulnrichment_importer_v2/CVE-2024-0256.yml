aliases: []
summary: The Starbox plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the
  Profile Display Name and Social Settings in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.8 due to
  insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
  that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
