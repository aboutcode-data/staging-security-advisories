aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the session identification management functionality of the web-based
  management interface for Cisco Meeting Server could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker
  to hijack a valid user session identifier, aka Session Fixation. The vulnerability exists
  because the affected application does not assign a new session identifier to a user session
  when a user authenticates to the application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by using a hijacked session identifier to connect to the application through the web-based
  management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to hijack an authenticated
  user''s browser session. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvi23787.'
