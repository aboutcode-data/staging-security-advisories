aliases: []
summary: Notepad++ is a free and open-source source code editor. In versions 8.8.1 and prior,
  a privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the Notepad++ v8.8.1 installer that allows
  unprivileged users to gain SYSTEM-level privileges through insecure executable search paths.
  An attacker could use social engineering or clickjacking to trick users into downloading both
  the legitimate installer and a malicious executable to the same directory (typically Downloads
  folder - which is known as Vulnerable directory). Upon running the installer, the attack executes
  automatically with SYSTEM privileges. This issue has been fixed and will be released in version
  8.8.2.
