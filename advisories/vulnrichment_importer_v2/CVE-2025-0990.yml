aliases: []
summary: The I Am Gloria plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.1.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the iamgloria23_gloria_settings_page function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to reset the tenant ID via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
