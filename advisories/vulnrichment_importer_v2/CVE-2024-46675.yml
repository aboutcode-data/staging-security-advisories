  usb: dwc3: core: Prevent USB core invalid event buffer address access

  This commit addresses an issue where the USB core could access an
  invalid event buffer address during runtime suspend, potentially causing
  SMMU faults and other memory issues in Exynos platforms. The problem
  arises from the following sequence.
          1. In dwc3_gadget_suspend, there is a chance of a timeout when
          moving the USB core to the halt state after clearing the
          run/stop bit by software.
          2. In dwc3_core_exit, the event buffer is cleared regardless of
          the USB core's status, which may lead to an SMMU faults and
          other memory issues. if the USB core tries to access the event
          buffer address.

  To prevent this hardware quirk on Exynos platforms, this commit ensures
  that the event buffer address is not cleared by software  when the USB
  core is active during runtime suspend by checking its status before
  clearing the buffer address.
