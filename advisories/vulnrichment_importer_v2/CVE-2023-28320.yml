aliases: []
summary: A denial of service vulnerability exists in curl <v8.1.0 in the way libcurl provides
  several different backends for resolving host names, selected at build time. If it is built
  to use the synchronous resolver, it allows name resolves to time-out slow operations using
  `alarm()` and `siglongjmp()`. When doing this, libcurl used a global buffer that was not mutex
  protected and a multi-threaded application might therefore crash or otherwise misbehave.
