aliases: []
summary: 'Amazon Fire OS 7 before 7.6.6.9 and 8 before 8.1.0.3 allows Fire TV applications to
  establish local ADB (Android Debug Bridge) connections. NOTE: some third parties dispute whether
  this has security relevance, because an ADB connection is only possible after the (non-default)
  ADB Debugging option is enabled, and after the initiator of that specific connection attempt
  has been approved via a full-screen prompt.'
