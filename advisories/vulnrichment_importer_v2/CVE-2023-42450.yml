summary: Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on ActivityPub. Starting
  in version 4.2.0-beta1 and prior to version 4.2.0-rc2, by crafting specific input, attackers
  can inject arbitrary data into HTTP requests issued by Mastodon. This can be used to perform
  confused deputy attacks if the server configuration includes `ALLOWED_PRIVATE_ADDRESSES` to
  allow access to local exploitable services. Version 4.2.0-rc2 has a patch for the issue.
