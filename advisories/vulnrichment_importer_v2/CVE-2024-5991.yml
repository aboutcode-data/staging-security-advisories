aliases: []
summary: 'In function MatchDomainName(), input param str is treated as a NULL terminated string
  despite being user provided and unchecked. Specifically, the function X509_check_host() takes
  in a pointer and length to check against, with no requirements that it be NULL terminated.
  If a caller was attempting to do a name check on a non-NULL terminated buffer, the code would
  read beyond the bounds of the input array until it found a NULL terminator.This issue affects
  wolfSSL: through 5.7.0.'
