aliases: []
summary: Metabase is an open source data analytics platform. Affected versions are subject to
  Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor. Sandboxed users shouldn't be able
  to view data about other Metabase users anywhere in the Metabase application. However, when
  a sandbox user views the settings for a dashboard subscription, and another user has added
  users to that subscription, the sandboxed user is able to view the list of recipients for
  that subscription. This issue is patched in versions 0.43.7.1, 1.43.7.1, 0.44.6.1, 1.44.6.1,
  0.45.2.1, and 1.45.2.1. There are no workarounds.
