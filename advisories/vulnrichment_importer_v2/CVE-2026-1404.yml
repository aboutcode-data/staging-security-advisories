summary: The Ultimate Member – User Profile, Registration, Login, Member Directory, Content
  Restriction & Membership Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
  Scripting via the filter parameters (e.g., 'filter_first_name') in all versions up to, and
  including, 2.11.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
  possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute
  if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
