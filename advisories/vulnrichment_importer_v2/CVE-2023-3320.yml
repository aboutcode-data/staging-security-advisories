aliases: []
summary: The WP Sticky Social  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to missing nonce validation in the ~/admin/views/admin.php
  file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings
  and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
