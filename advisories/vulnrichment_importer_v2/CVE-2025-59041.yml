aliases: []
summary: Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. At startup, Claude Code executed a command templated
  in with `git config user.email`. Prior to version 1.0.105, a maliciously configured user email
  in git could be used to trigger arbitrary code execution before a user accepted the workspace
  trust dialog. Users on standard Claude Code auto-update will have received this fix automatically.
  Users performing manual updates are advised to update to version 1.0.105 or the latest version.
