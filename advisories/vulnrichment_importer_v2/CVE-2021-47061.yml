  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  KVM: Destroy I/O bus devices on unregister failure _after_ sync'ing SRCU

  If allocating a new instance of an I/O bus fails when unregistering a
  device, wait to destroy the device until after all readers are guaranteed
  to see the new null bus.  Destroying devices before the bus is nullified
  could lead to use-after-free since readers expect the devices on their
  reference of the bus to remain valid.
