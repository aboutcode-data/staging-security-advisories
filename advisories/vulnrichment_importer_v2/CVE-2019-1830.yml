aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Locally Significant Certificate (LSC) management for the Cisco Wireless
  LAN Controller (WLC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to
  unexpectedly restart, which causes a denial of service (DoS) condition. The attacker would
  need to have valid administrator credentials. The vulnerability is due to incorrect input
  validation of the HTTP URL used to establish a connection to the LSC Certificate Authority
  (CA). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the targeted device
  and configuring a LSC certificate. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition
  due to an unexpected restart of the device.
