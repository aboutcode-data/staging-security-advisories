aliases: []
summary: The Icons Font Loader plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
  due to missing file type validation in the upload function in all versions up to, and including,
  1.1.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access
  and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code
  execution possible.
