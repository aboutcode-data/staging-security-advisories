aliases: []
summary: A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in SeedDMS 6.0.29. A user
  or rogue admin with the "Add Category" permission can inject a malicious XSS payload into
  the category name field. When a document is subsequently associated with this category, the
  payload is stored on the server and rendered without proper sanitization or output encoding.
  This results in the XSS payload executing in the browser of any user who views the document.
