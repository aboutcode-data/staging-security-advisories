summary: 'Multiple Xiongmai NVR devices, including MBD6304T V4.02.R11.00000117.10001.131900.00000
  and NBD6808T-PL V4.02.R11.C7431119.12001.130000.00000, allow an unauthenticated and remote
  user to exploit a stack-based buffer overflow and crash the web server, resulting in a system
  reboot. An unauthenticated and remote attacker can execute arbitrary code by sending a crafted
  HTTP request that triggers the overflow condition via a long URI passed to a sprintf call.
  NOTE: this is different than CVE-2018-10088, but this may overlap CVE-2017-16725.'
