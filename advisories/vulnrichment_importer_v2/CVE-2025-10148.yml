summary: |
  curl's websocket code did not update the 32 bit mask pattern for each new
   outgoing frame as the specification says. Instead it used a fixed mask that
  persisted and was used throughout the entire connection.

  A predictable mask pattern allows for a malicious server to induce traffic
  between the two communicating parties that could be interpreted by an involved
  proxy (configured or transparent) as genuine, real, HTTP traffic with content
  and thereby poison its cache. That cached poisoned content could then be
  served to all users of that proxy.
