aliases: []
summary: The Gotham Block Extra Light plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.0 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that
  will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations
  and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
