summary: |
  A vulnerability (CVE-2025-21172) exists in msdia140.dll due to integer overflow and heap-based overflow.

   Per CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow, a heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().‍

   Per CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound, is when a product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This occurs when an integer value is incremented to a value that is too large to store in the associated representation. When this occurs, the value may become a very small or negative number.

   NOTE: This CVE affects only End Of Life (EOL) software components. The vendor, Microsoft, has indicated there will be no future updates nor support provided upon inquiry.
