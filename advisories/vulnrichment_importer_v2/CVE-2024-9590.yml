aliases: []
summary: The Category and Taxonomy Meta Fields plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
  Cross-Site Scripting via the image meta field value in the 'wpaft_add_meta_textinput' function
  in versions up to, and including, 1.0.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
  escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with
  editor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute
  whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and
  installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
