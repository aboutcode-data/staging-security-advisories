aliases: []
summary: Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications,
  and databases. Coolify versions prior to and including v4.0.0-beta.420.8 have an information
  disclosure vulnerability in the `/api/v1/teams/{team_id}/members` and `/api/v1/teams/current/members`
  API endpoints allows authenticated team members to access a highly sensitive `email_change_code`
  from other users on the same team. This code is intended for a single-use email change verification
  and should be kept secret. Its exposure could enable a malicious actor to perform an unauthorized
  email address change on behalf of the victim. As of time of publication, no known patched
  versions exist.
