aliases: []
summary: LibreNMS is an open-source, PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network monitoring system. Versions
  prior to 24.4.0 are vulnerable to SQL injection. The `order` parameter is obtained from `$request`.
  After performing a string check, the value is directly incorporated into an SQL statement
  and concatenated, resulting in a SQL injection vulnerability. An attacker may extract a whole
  database this way. Version 24.4.0 fixes the issue.
