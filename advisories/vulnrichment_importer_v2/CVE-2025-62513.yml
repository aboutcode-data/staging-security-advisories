aliases: []
summary: OpenBao is an open source identity-based secrets management system. In versions 2.2.0
  to 2.4.1, OpenBao's audit log experienced a regression wherein raw HTTP bodies used by few
  endpoints were not correctly redacted (HMAC'd). This impacts those using the ACME functionality
  of PKI, resulting in short-lived ACME verification challenge codes being leaked in the audit
  logs. Additionally, this impacts those using the OIDC issuer functionality of the identity
  subsystem, auth and token response codes along with claims could be leaked in the audit logs.
  ACME verification codes are not usable after verification or challenge expiry so are of limited
  long-term use. This issue has been patched in OpenBao 2.4.2.
