aliases: []
summary: era-compiler-solidity is the ZKsync compiler for Solidity.  The problem occurred during
  instruction selection in the `DAGCombine` phase while visiting the XOR operation. The issue
  arises when attempting to fold the expression `!(x cc y)` into `(x !cc y)`. To perform this
  transformation, the second operand of XOR should be a constant representing the true value.
  However, it was incorrectly assumed that -1 represents the true value, when in fact, 1 is
  the correct representation, so this transformation for this case should be skipped. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 1.4.1.
