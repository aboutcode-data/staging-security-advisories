aliases: []
summary: PolarLearn is a free and open-source learning program. Prior to version 0-PRERELEASE-15,
  the vote API route (`POST /api/v1/forum/vote`) trusts the JSON body’s `direction` value without
  runtime validation. TypeScript types are not enforced at runtime, so an attacker can send
  arbitrary strings (e.g., `"x"`) as `direction`. Downstream (`VoteServer`) treats any non-`"up"`
  and non-`null` value as a downvote and persists the invalid value in `votes_data`. This can
  be exploited to bypass intended business logic. Version 0-PRERELEASE-15 fixes the vulnerability.
