aliases: []
summary: An issue was found in Apache Airflow versions 1.10.10 and below. A remote code/command
  injection vulnerability was discovered in one of the example DAGs shipped with Airflow which
  would allow any authenticated user to run arbitrary commands as the user running airflow worker/scheduler
  (depending on the executor in use). If you already have examples disabled by setting load_examples=False
  in the config then you are not vulnerable.
