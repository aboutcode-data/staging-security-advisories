aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business
  RV016, RV042, RV042G, RV082, RV320, and RV325 Routers could allow an authenticated, remote
  attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause an affected device to restart unexpectedly. These
  vulnerabilities are due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management
  interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests
  to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
  code as the root user on the underlying operating system or cause the device to reload, resulting
  in a denial of service (DoS) condition. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would
  need to have valid administrator credentials on the affected device.
