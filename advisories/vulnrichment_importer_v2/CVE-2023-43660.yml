aliases: []
summary: 'Warpgate is a smart SSH, HTTPS and MySQL bastion host for Linux that doesn''t need
  special client apps. The SSH key verification for a user can be bypassed by sending an SSH
  key offer without a signature. This allows bypassing authentication under following conditions:
  1. The attacker knows the username and a valid target name 2. The attacked knows the user''s
  public key and 3. Only SSH public key authentication is required for the user account. This
  issue has been addressed in version 0.8.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
  workarounds for this vulnerability.'
