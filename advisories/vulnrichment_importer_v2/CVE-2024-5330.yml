aliases: []
summary: The Breakdance plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via
  the breakdance_css_file_paths_cache parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.2
  due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
  that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
