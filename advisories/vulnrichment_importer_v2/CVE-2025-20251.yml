aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the Remote Access SSL VPN service for Cisco Secure Firewall Adaptive\
  \ Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense (FTD) Software\
  \ could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to create or delete arbitrary files on the\
  \ underlying operating system. If critical system files are manipulated, new Remote Access\
  \ SSL VPN sessions could be denied and existing sessions could be dropped, causing a denial\
  \ of service (DoS) condition. An exploited device requires a manual reboot to recover.\r\n\
  \r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation when processing HTTP requests.\
  \ An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected\
  \ device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to create or delete files on the underlying\
  \ operating system, which could cause the Remote Access SSL VPN service to become unresponsive.\r\
  \nTo exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be authenticated as a VPN user of the affected\
  \ device."
