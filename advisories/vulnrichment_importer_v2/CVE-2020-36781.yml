  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  i2c: imx: fix reference leak when pm_runtime_get_sync fails

  In i2c_imx_xfer() and i2c_imx_remove(), the pm reference count
  is not expected to be incremented on return.

  However, pm_runtime_get_sync will increment pm reference count
  even failed. Forgetting to putting operation will result in a
  reference leak here.

  Replace it with pm_runtime_resume_and_get to keep usage
  counter balanced.
