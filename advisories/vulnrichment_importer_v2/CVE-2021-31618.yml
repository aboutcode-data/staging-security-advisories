aliases: []
summary: Apache HTTP Server protocol handler for the HTTP/2 protocol checks received request
  headers against the size limitations as configured for the server and used for the HTTP/1
  protocol as well. On violation of these restrictions and HTTP response is sent to the client
  with a status code indicating why the request was rejected. This rejection response was not
  fully initialised in the HTTP/2 protocol handler if the offending header was the very first
  one received or appeared in a a footer. This led to a NULL pointer dereference on initialised
  memory, crashing reliably the child process. Since such a triggering HTTP/2 request is easy
  to craft and submit, this can be exploited to DoS the server. This issue affected mod_http2
  1.15.17 and Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.47 only. Apache HTTP Server 2.4.47 was never released.
