aliases: []
summary: The Blog-in-Blog plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in versions
  up to, and including, 1.1.1 via a shortcode attribute. This allows editor-level, and above,
  attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of
  any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive
  data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded
  and included.
