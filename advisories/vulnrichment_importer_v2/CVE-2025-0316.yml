aliases: []
summary: The WP Directorybox Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass
  in versions up to, and including, 2.5. This is due to incorrect authentication in the 'wp_dp_enquiry_agent_contact_form_submit_callback'
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user
  on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the username.
