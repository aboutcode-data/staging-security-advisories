aliases: []
summary: October is a Content Management System (CMS) and web platform. A vulnerability in versions
  prior to 3.7.5 affects authenticated administrators with sites that have the `media.clean_vectors`
  configuration enabled. This configuration will sanitize SVG files uploaded using the media
  manager. This vulnerability allows an authenticated user to bypass this protection by uploading
  it with a permitted extension (for example, .jpg or .png) and later modifying it to the .svg
  extension. This vulnerability assumes a trusted user will attack another trusted user and
  cannot be actively exploited without access to the administration panel and interaction from
  the other user. This issue has been patched in v3.7.5.
