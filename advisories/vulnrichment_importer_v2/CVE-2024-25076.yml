summary: An issue was discovered on Renesas SmartBond DA14691, DA14695, DA14697, and DA14699
  devices. The bootrom function responsible for validating the Flash Product Header directly
  uses a user-controllable size value (Length of Flash Config Section) to control a read from
  the QSPI device into a fixed sized buffer, resulting in a buffer overflow and execution of
  arbitrary code.
