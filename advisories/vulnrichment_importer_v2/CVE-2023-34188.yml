aliases: []
summary: The HTTP server in Mongoose before 7.10 accepts requests containing negative Content-Length
  headers. By sending a single attack payload over TCP, an attacker can cause an infinite loop
  in which the server continuously reparses that payload, and does not respond to any other
  requests.
