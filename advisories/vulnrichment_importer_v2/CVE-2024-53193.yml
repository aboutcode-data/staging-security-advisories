summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nclk: clk-loongson2:\
  \ Fix memory corruption bug in struct loongson2_clk_provider\n\nSome heap space is allocated\
  \ for the flexible structure `struct\nclk_hw_onecell_data` and its flexible-array member `hws`\
  \ through\nthe composite structure `struct loongson2_clk_provider` in function\n`loongson2_clk_probe()`,\
  \ as shown below:\n\n289         struct loongson2_clk_provider *clp;\n\t...\n296         for\
  \ (p = data; p->name; p++)\n297                 clks_num++;\n298\n299         clp = devm_kzalloc(dev,\
  \ struct_size(clp, clk_data.hws, clks_num),\n300                            GFP_KERNEL);\n\
  \nThen some data is written into the flexible array:\n\n350                 clp->clk_data.hws[p->id]\
  \ = hw;\n\nThis corrupts `clk_lock`, which is the spinlock variable immediately\nfollowing\
  \ the `clk_data` member in `struct loongson2_clk_provider`:\n\nstruct loongson2_clk_provider\
  \ {\n\tvoid __iomem *base;\n\tstruct device *dev;\n\tstruct clk_hw_onecell_data clk_data;\n\
  \tspinlock_t clk_lock;\t/* protect access to DIV registers */\n};\n\nThe problem is that the\
  \ flexible structure is currently placed in the\nmiddle of `struct loongson2_clk_provider`\
  \ instead of at the end.\n\nFix this by moving `struct clk_hw_onecell_data clk_data;` to the\
  \ end of\n`struct loongson2_clk_provider`. Also, add a code comment to help\nprevent this\
  \ from happening again in case new members are added to the\nstructure in the future.\n\n\
  This change also fixes the following -Wflex-array-member-not-at-end\nwarning:\n\ndrivers/clk/clk-loongson2.c:32:36:\
  \ warning: structure containing a flexible array member is not at the end of another structure\
  \ [-Wflex-array-member-not-at-end]"
