aliases: []
summary: The Pedalo Connector plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in
  versions up to, and including, 2.0.5. This is due to insufficient restriction on the 'login_admin_user'
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log to the first user, who
  is usually the administrator, or if it does not exist, then to the first administrator.
