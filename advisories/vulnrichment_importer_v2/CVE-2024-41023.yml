  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  sched/deadline: Fix task_struct reference leak

  During the execution of the following stress test with linux-rt:

  stress-ng --cyclic 30 --timeout 30 --minimize --quiet

  kmemleak frequently reported a memory leak concerning the task_struct:

  unreferenced object 0xffff8881305b8000 (size 16136):

  The issue occurs in start_dl_timer(), which increments the task_struct
  reference count and sets a timer. The timer callback, dl_task_timer,
  is supposed to decrement the reference count upon expiration. However,
  if enqueue_task_dl() is called before the timer expires and cancels it,
  the reference count is not decremented, leading to the leak.

  This patch fixes the reference leak by ensuring the task_struct
  reference count is properly decremented when the timer is canceled.
