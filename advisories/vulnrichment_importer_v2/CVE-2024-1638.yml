aliases: []
summary: 'The documentation specifies that the BT_GATT_PERM_READ_LESC and BT_GATT_PERM_WRITE_LESC
  defines for a Bluetooth characteristic: Attribute read/write permission with LE Secure Connection
  encryption. If set, requires that LE Secure Connections is used for read/write access, however
  this is only true when it is combined with other permissions, namely BT_GATT_PERM_READ_ENCRYPT/BT_GATT_PERM_READ_AUTHEN
  (for read) or BT_GATT_PERM_WRITE_ENCRYPT/BT_GATT_PERM_WRITE_AUTHEN (for write), if these additional
  permissions are not set (even in secure connections only mode) then the stack does not perform
  any permission checks on these characteristics and they can be freely written/read.'
