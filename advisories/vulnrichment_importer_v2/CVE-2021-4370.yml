aliases: []
summary: The uListing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass as most actions
  and endpoints are accessible to unauthenticated users, lack security nonces, and data is seldom
  validated. This issue exists in versions up to, and including, 1.6.6. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to conduct numerous administrative actions, including those
  less critical than the explicitly outlined ones in our detection.
