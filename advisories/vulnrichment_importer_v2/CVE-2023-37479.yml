aliases: []
summary: Open Enclave is a hardware-agnostic open source library for developing applications
  that utilize Hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments, also known as Enclaves. There
  are two issues that are mitigated in version 0.19.3. First, Open Enclave SDK does not properly
  sanitize the `MXCSR` register on enclave entry. This makes applications vulnerable to MXCSR
  Configuration Dependent Timing (MCDT) attacks, where incorrect `MXCSR` values can impact instruction
  retirement by at most one cycle, depending on the (secret) data operand value. Please find
  more details in the guidance from Intel in the references. Second, Open Enclave SDK does not
  sanitize x86's alignment check flag `RFLAGS.AC` on enclave entry. This opens up the possibility
  for a side-channel attacker to be notified for every unaligned memory access performed by
  the enclave. The issue has been addressed in version 0.19.3 and the current master branch.
  Users will need to recompile their applications against the patched libraries to be protected
  from this vulnerability. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
