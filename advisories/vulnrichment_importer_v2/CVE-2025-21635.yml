  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  rds: sysctl: rds_tcp_{rcv,snd}buf: avoid using current->nsproxy

  As mentioned in a previous commit of this series, using the 'net'
  structure via 'current' is not recommended for different reasons:

  - Inconsistency: getting info from the reader's/writer's netns vs only
    from the opener's netns.

  - current->nsproxy can be NULL in some cases, resulting in an 'Oops'
    (null-ptr-deref), e.g. when the current task is exiting, as spotted by
    syzbot [1] using acct(2).

  The per-netns structure can be obtained from the table->data using
  container_of(), then the 'net' one can be retrieved from the listen
  socket (if available).
