summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ext4: use memtostr_pad() for s_volume_name

  As with the other strings in struct ext4_super_block, s_volume_name is
  not NUL terminated. The other strings were marked in commit 072ebb3bffe6
  ("ext4: add nonstring annotations to ext4.h"). Using strscpy() isn't
  the right replacement for strncpy(); it should use memtostr_pad()
  instead.
