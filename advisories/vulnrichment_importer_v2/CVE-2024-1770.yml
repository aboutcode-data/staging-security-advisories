aliases: []
summary: The Meta Tag Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in
  all versions up to, and including, 3.0.2 via deserialization of untrusted input in the get_post_data
  function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access or higher,
  to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is
  present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the
  attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
