aliases: []
summary: Flask-AppBuilder is an application development framework built on top of Flask python
  framework. In versions prior to 4.1.3 an authenticated Admin user could query other users
  by their salted and hashed passwords strings. These filters could be made by using partial
  hashed password strings. The response would not include the hashed passwords, but an attacker
  could infer partial password hashes and their respective users. This issue has been fixed
  in version 4.1.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
