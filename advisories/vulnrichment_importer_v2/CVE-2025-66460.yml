aliases: []
summary: Lookyloo is a web interface that allows users to capture a website page and then display
  a tree of domains that call each other. Prior to 1.35.3, Lookyloo passed improperly escaped
  values to cells rendered in datatables using the orthogonal-data feature. It is definitely
  exploitable from the popup view, but it is most probably also exploitable in many other places.
  This vulnerability is fixed in 1.35.3.
