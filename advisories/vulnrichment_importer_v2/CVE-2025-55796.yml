aliases: []
summary: The openml/openml.org web application version v2.0.20241110 uses predictable MD5-based
  tokens for critical user workflows such as signup confirmation, password resets, email confirmation
  resends, and email change confirmation. These tokens are generated by hashing the current
  timestamp formatted as "%d %H:%M:%S" without incorporating any user-specific data or cryptographic
  randomness. This predictability allows remote attackers to brute-force valid tokens within
  a small time window, enabling unauthorized account confirmation, password resets, and email
  change approvals, potentially leading to account takeover.
