aliases: []
summary: The Beaver Builder – WordPress Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
  access and modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'duplicate_wpml_layout'
  function in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.4.1. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary posts with the content
  of other existing posts, potentially exposing private and password-protected content and deleting
  any content that is not saved in revisions or backups. Posts must have been created with Beaver
  Builder to be copied or updated.
