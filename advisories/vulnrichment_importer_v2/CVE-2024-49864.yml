  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  rxrpc: Fix a race between socket set up and I/O thread creation

  In rxrpc_open_socket(), it sets up the socket and then sets up the I/O
  thread that will handle it.  This is a problem, however, as there's a gap
  between the two phases in which a packet may come into rxrpc_encap_rcv()
  from the UDP packet but we oops when trying to wake the not-yet created I/O
  thread.

  As a quick fix, just make rxrpc_encap_rcv() discard the packet if there's
  no I/O thread yet.

  A better, but more intrusive fix would perhaps be to rearrange things such
  that the socket creation is done by the I/O thread.
