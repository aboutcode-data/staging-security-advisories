aliases: []
summary: Runtipi is a Docker-based, personal homeserver orchestrator that facilitates multiple
  services on a single server. Versions 3.7.0 and above allow an authenticated user to execute
  arbitrary system commands on the host server by injecting shell metacharacters into backup
  filenames. The BackupManager fails to sanitize the filenames of uploaded backups. The system
  persists user-uploaded files directly to the host filesystem using the raw originalname provided
  in the request. This allows an attacker to stage a file containing shell metacharacters (e.g.,
  $(id).tar.gz) at a predictable path, which is later referenced during the restore process.
  The successful storage of the file is what allows the subsequent restore command to reference
  and execute it. This issue has been fixed in version 4.7.0.
