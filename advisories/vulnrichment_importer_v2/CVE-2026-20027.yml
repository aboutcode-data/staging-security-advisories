aliases: []
summary: "Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the processing of DCE/RPC\
  \ requests that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the Snort 3 Detection\
  \ Engine to leak sensitive information or to restart, resulting in an interruption of packet\
  \ inspection.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to an error in buffer handling logic when processing\
  \ DCE/RPC requests, which can result in a buffer out-of-bounds read. An attacker could exploit\
  \ this vulnerability by sending a large number of DCE/RPC requests through an established\
  \ connection that is inspected by Snort 3. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to\
  \ obtain sensitive information in the Snort 3 data stream."
