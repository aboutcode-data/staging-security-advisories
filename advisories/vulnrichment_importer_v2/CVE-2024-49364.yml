aliases: []
summary: tiny-secp256k1 is a tiny secp256k1 native/JS wrapper. Prior to version 1.1.7, a private
  key can be extracted on signing a malicious JSON-stringifiable object, when global Buffer
  is the buffer package. This affects only environments where require('buffer') is the NPM buffer
  package. The Buffer.isBuffer check can be bypassed, resulting in k reuse for different messages,
  leading to private key extraction over a single invalid message (and a second one for which
  any message/signature could be taken, e.g. previously known valid one). This issue has been
  patched in version 1.1.7.
