aliases: []
summary: Nextcloud Calendar is a calendar app for Nextcloud. Prior to 6.0.3, the Calendar app
  generates participant tokens for meeting proposals using a hash function, allowing an attacker
  to compute valid participant tokens, which allowed them to request details and submit dates
  in meeting proposals. The tokens are not purely random generated. This vulnerability is fixed
  in 6.0.3.
