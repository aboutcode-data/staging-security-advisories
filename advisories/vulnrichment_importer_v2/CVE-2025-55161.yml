aliases: []
summary: Stirling-PDF is a locally hosted web application that performs various operations on
  PDF files. Prior to version 1.1.0, when using the /api/v1/convert/markdown/pdf endpoint to
  convert Markdown to PDF, the backend calls a third-party tool to process it and includes a
  sanitizer for security sanitization which can be bypassed and result in SSRF. This issue has
  been patched in version 1.1.0.
