  binfmt_flat: Fix corruption when not offsetting data start

  Commit 04d82a6d0881 ("binfmt_flat: allow not offsetting data start")
  introduced a RISC-V specific variant of the FLAT format which does
  not allocate any space for the (obsolete) array of shared library
  pointers. However, it did not disable the code which initializes the
  array, resulting in the corruption of sizeof(long) bytes before the DATA
  segment, generally the end of the TEXT segment.

  Introduce MAX_SHARED_LIBS_UPDATE which depends on the state of
  CONFIG_BINFMT_FLAT_NO_DATA_START_OFFSET to guard the initialization of
  the shared library pointer region so that it will only be initialized
  if space is reserved for it.
