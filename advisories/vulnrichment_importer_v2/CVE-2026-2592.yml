aliases: []
summary: The Zarinpal Gateway for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Improper
  Access Control to Payment Status Update in all versions up to and including 5.0.16. This is
  due to the payment callback handler 'Return_from_ZarinPal_Gateway' failing to validate that
  the authority token provided in the callback URL belongs to the specific order being marked
  as paid. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to potentially mark orders as
  paid without proper payment by reusing a valid authority token from a different transaction
  of the same amount.
