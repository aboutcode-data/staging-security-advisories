aliases: []
summary: Frappe Learning is a learning system that helps users structure their content. In versions
  prior to 2.38.0, the system did stored the attachments uploaded by the students in their assignments
  as public files. This issue potentially exposed student-uploaded files to the public. Anyone
  with the file URL could access these files without authentication. The issue has been fixed
  in version 2.38.0 by ensuring all student-uploaded assignment attachments are stored as private
  files by default.
