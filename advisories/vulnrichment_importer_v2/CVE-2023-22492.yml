aliases: []
summary: ZITADEL is a combination of Auth0 and Keycloak. RefreshTokens is an OAuth 2.0 feature
  that allows applications to retrieve new access tokens and refresh the user's session without
  the need for interacting with a UI. RefreshTokens were not invalidated when a user was locked
  or deactivated. The deactivated or locked user was able to obtain a valid access token only
  through a refresh token grant. When the locked or deactivated user’s session was already terminated
  (“logged out”) then it was not possible to create a new session. Renewal of access token through
  a refresh token grant is limited to the configured amount of time (RefreshTokenExpiration).
  As a workaround, ensure the RefreshTokenExpiration in the OIDC settings of your instance is
  set according to your security requirements. This issue has been patched in versions 2.17.3
  and 2.16.4.
