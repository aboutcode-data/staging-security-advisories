aliases: []
summary: Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich
  command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When reading
  a config value, Git strips any trailing carriage return and line feed (CRLF). When writing
  a config entry, values with a trailing CR are not quoted, causing the CR to be lost when the
  config is later read. When initializing a submodule, if the submodule path contains a trailing
  CR, the altered path is read resulting in the submodule being checked out to an incorrect
  location. If a symlink exists that points the altered path to the submodule hooks directory,
  and the submodule contains an executable post-checkout hook, the script may be unintentionally
  executed after checkout. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4,
  v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1.
