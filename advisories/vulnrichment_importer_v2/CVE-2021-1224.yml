aliases: []
summary: Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability with TCP Fast Open (TFO) when
  used in conjunction with the Snort detection engine that could allow an unauthenticated, remote
  attacker to bypass a configured file policy for HTTP. The vulnerability is due to incorrect
  detection of the HTTP payload if it is contained at least partially within the TFO connection
  handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TFO packets with
  an HTTP payload through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to bypass configured file policy for HTTP packets and deliver a malicious payload.
