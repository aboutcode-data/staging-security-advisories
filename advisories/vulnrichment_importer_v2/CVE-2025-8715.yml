aliases: []
summary: Improper neutralization of newlines in pg_dump in PostgreSQL allows a user of the origin
  server to inject arbitrary code for restore-time execution as the client operating system
  account running psql to restore the dump, via psql meta-commands inside a purpose-crafted
  object name.  The same attacks can achieve SQL injection as a superuser of the restore target
  server.  pg_dumpall, pg_restore, and pg_upgrade are also affected.  Versions before PostgreSQL
  17.6, 16.10, 15.14, 14.19, and 13.22 are affected.  Versions before 11.20 are unaffected.  CVE-2012-0868
  had fixed this class of problem, but version 11.20 reintroduced it.
