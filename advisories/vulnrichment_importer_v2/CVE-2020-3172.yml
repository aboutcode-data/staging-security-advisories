aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol feature of Cisco FXOS Software and
  Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary
  code as root or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability
  exists because of insufficiently validated Cisco Discovery Protocol packet headers. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to a
  Layer 2-adjacent affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a
  buffer overflow that could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as root or cause a
  DoS condition on the affected device. Note: Cisco Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol.
  To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected
  device (Layer 2 adjacent). Note: This vulnerability is different from the following Cisco
  FXOS and NX-OS Software Cisco Discovery Protocol vulnerabilities that Cisco announced on Feb.
  5, 2020: Cisco FXOS, IOS XR, and NX-OS Software Cisco Discovery Protocol Denial of Service
  Vulnerability and Cisco NX-OS Software Cisco Discovery Protocol Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.'
