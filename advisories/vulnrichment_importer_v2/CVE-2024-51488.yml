aliases: []
summary: Ampache is a web based audio/video streaming application and file manager. The current
  implementation of token parsing does not adequately validate CSRF tokens when users delete
  messages. This vulnerability could be exploited to forge CSRF attacks, allowing an attacker
  to delete messages to any user, including administrators, if they interact with a malicious
  request. This issue has been addressed in version 7.0.1 and all users are advised to upgrade.
  There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
