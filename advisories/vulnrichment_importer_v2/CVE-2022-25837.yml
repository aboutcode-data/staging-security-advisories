aliases: []
summary: Bluetooth® Pairing in Bluetooth Core Specification v1.0B through v5.3 may permit an
  unauthenticated MITM to acquire credentials with two pairing devices via adjacent access when
  at least one device supports BR/EDR Secure Connections pairing and the other BR/EDR Legacy
  PIN code pairing if the MITM negotiates BR/EDR Secure Simple Pairing in Secure Connections
  mode using the Passkey association model with the pairing Initiator and BR/EDR Legacy PIN
  code pairing with the pairing Responder and brute forces the Passkey entered by the user into
  the Responder as a 6-digit PIN code. The MITM attacker can use the identified PIN code value
  as the Passkey value to complete authentication with the Initiator via Bluetooth pairing method
  confusion.
