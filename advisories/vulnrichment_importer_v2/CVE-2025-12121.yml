aliases: []
summary: Lite XL versions 2.1.8 and prior contain a vulnerability in the system.exec function,
  which allowed arbitrary command execution through unsanitized shell command construction.
  This function was used in project directory launching (core.lua), drag-and-drop file handling
  (rootview.lua), and the “open in system” command in the treeview plugin (treeview.lua). If
  an attacker could influence input to system.exec, they might execute arbitrary commands with
  the privileges of the Lite XL process.
