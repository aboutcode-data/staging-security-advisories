aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the rate limiter for Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) traffic
  of Cisco NX-OS Software for Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to cause BFD traffic to be dropped on an affected device. This vulnerability
  is due to a logic error in the BFD rate limiter functionality. An attacker could exploit this
  vulnerability by sending a crafted stream of traffic through the device. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to cause BFD traffic to be dropped, resulting in BFD session flaps.
  BFD session flaps can cause route instability and dropped traffic, resulting in a denial of
  service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability applies to both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.
