aliases: []
summary: The AdRotate Banner Manager – The only ad manager you'll need plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file extension sanitization in the
  adrotate_insert_media() function in all versions up to, and including, 5.13.2. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to upload
  arbitrary files with double extensions on the affected site's server which may make remote
  code execution possible. This is only exploitable on select instances where the configuration
  will execute the first extension present.
