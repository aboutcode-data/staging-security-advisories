summary: '7-Zip through 21.07 on Windows allows privilege escalation and command execution when
  a file with the .7z extension is dragged to the Help>Contents area. This is caused by misconfiguration
  of 7z.dll and a heap overflow. The command runs in a child process under the 7zFM.exe process.
  NOTE: multiple third parties have reported that no privilege escalation can occur'
