aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in filesystem usage management for Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM)
  Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to exhaust filesystem resources, resulting
  in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to
  the insufficient management of available filesystem resources. An attacker could exploit this
  vulnerability by uploading files to the device and exhausting available filesystem resources.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause database errors and cause the device
  to become unresponsive to web-based management. Manual intervention is required to free filesystem
  resources and return the device to an operational state.
