aliases: []
summary: 'LLVM 15.0.0 has a NULL pointer dereference in the parseOneMetadata() function via
  a crafted pdflatex.fmt file (or perhaps a crafted .o file) to llvm-lto. NOTE: this is disputed
  because the relationship between pdflatex.fmt and any LLVM language front end is not explained,
  and because a crash of the llvm-lto application should be categorized as a usability problem.'
