aliases: []
summary: The WP Human Resource Management plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation
  due to missing authorization in the ajax_insert_employee() and update_empoyee() functions
  in versions 2.0.0 through 2.2.17. The AJAX handler reads the client-supplied $_POST['role']
  and, after basic cleaning via hrm_clean(), passes it directly to wp_insert_user() and later
  to $user->set_role() without verifying that the current user is allowed to assign that role.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Employee-level access and above,
  to elevate their privileges to administrator.
