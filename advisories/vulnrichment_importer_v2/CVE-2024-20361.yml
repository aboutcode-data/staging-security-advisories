aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Object Groups for Access Control Lists (ACLs) feature of Cisco
  Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to bypass configured access controls on managed devices that are running Cisco Firepower Threat
  Defense (FTD) Software. This vulnerability is due to the incorrect deployment of the Object
  Groups for ACLs feature from Cisco FMC Software to managed FTD devices in high-availability
  setups. After an affected device is rebooted following Object Groups for ACLs deployment,
  an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic through the affected device.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured access controls and successfully
  send traffic to devices that are expected to be protected by the affected device.
