aliases: []
summary: 5ire is a cross-platform desktop artificial intelligence assistant and model context
  protocol client. Prior to version 0.15.3, an unsafe option parsing vulnerability in the ECharts
  Markdown plugin allows any user able to submit ECharts code blocks to execute arbitrary JavaScript
  code in the renderer context. This can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in environments
  where privileged APIs (such as Electron’s electron.mcp) are exposed, resulting in full compromise
  of the host system. Version 0.15.3 patches the issue.
