aliases: []
summary: 'An issue found in ProcessWire 3.0.210 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code and
  install a reverse shell via the download_zip_url parameter when installing a new module. NOTE:
  this is disputed because exploitation requires that the attacker is able to enter requests
  as an admin; however, a ProcessWire admin is intentionally allowed to install any module that
  contains any arbitrary code.'
