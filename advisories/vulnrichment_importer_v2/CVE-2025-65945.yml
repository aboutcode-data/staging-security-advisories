aliases: []
summary: auth0/node-jws is a JSON Web Signature implementation for Node.js. In versions 3.2.2
  and earlier and version 4.0.0, auth0/node-jws has an improper signature verification vulnerability
  when using the HS256 algorithm under specific conditions. Applications are affected when they
  use the jws.createVerify() function for HMAC algorithms and use user-provided data from the
  JSON Web Signature protected header or payload in HMAC secret lookup routines, which can allow
  attackers to bypass signature verification. This issue has been patched in versions 3.2.3
  and 4.0.1.
