aliases: []
summary: btcd before 0.24.0 does not correctly implement the consensus rules outlined in BIP
  68 and BIP 112, making it susceptible to consensus failures. Specifically, it uses the transaction
  version as a signed integer when it is supposed to be treated as unsigned. There can be a
  chain split and loss of funds.
