aliases: []
summary: Streamlit, software for turning data scripts into web applications, had a cross-site
  scripting (XSS) vulnerability in versions 0.63.0 through 0.80.0. Users of hosted Streamlit
  app(s) were vulnerable to a reflected XSS vulnerability. An attacker could craft a malicious
  URL with Javascript payloads to a Streamlit app. The attacker could then trick the user into
  visiting the malicious URL and, if successful, the server would render the malicious javascript
  payload as-is, leading to XSS. Version 0.81.0 contains a patch for this vulnerability.
