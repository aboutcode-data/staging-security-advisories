summary: "A vulnerability in the IKEv1 fragmentation code of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS\
  \ XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a heap underflow, resulting\
  \ in an affected device reloading.\r\n\r This vulnerability exists because crafted, fragmented\
  \ IKEv1 packets are not properly reassembled. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by sending crafted UDP packets to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the\
  \ attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS)\
  \ condition.\r\n\r Note: Only traffic that is directed to the affected system can be used\
  \ to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.."
