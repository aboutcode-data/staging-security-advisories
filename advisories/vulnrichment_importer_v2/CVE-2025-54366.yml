aliases: []
summary: FreeScout is a lightweight free open source help desk and shared inbox built with PHP
  (Laravel framework). In versions 1.8.185 and below, there is a critical deserialization vulnerability
  in the /conversation/ajax endpoint that allows authenticated users with knowledge of the APP_KEY
  to achieve remote code execution. The vulnerability occurs when the application processes
  the attachments_all and attachments POST parameters through the insecure Helper::decrypt()
  function, which performs unsafe deserialization of user-controlled data without proper validation.
  This flaw enables attackers to create arbitrary objects and manipulate their properties, leading
  to complete compromise of the web application. This is fixed in version 1.8.186.
