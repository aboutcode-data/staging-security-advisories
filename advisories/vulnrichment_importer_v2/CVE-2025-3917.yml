aliases: []
summary: The 百度站长SEO合集(支持百度/神马/Bing/头条推送) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
  uploads due to missing file type validation in the download_remote_image_to_media_library
  function in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code
  execution possible.
