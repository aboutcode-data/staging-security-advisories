  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  virtio: packed: fix unmap leak for indirect desc table

  When use_dma_api and premapped are true, then the do_unmap is false.

  Because the do_unmap is false, vring_unmap_extra_packed is not called by
  detach_buf_packed.

    if (unlikely(vq->do_unmap)) {
                  curr = id;
                  for (i = 0; i < state->num; i++) {
                          vring_unmap_extra_packed(vq,
                                                   &vq->packed.desc_extra[curr]);
                          curr = vq->packed.desc_extra[curr].next;
                  }
    }

  So the indirect desc table is not unmapped. This causes the unmap leak.

  So here, we check vq->use_dma_api instead. Synchronously, dma info is
  updated based on use_dma_api judgment

  This bug does not occur, because no driver use the premapped with
  indirect.
