aliases: []
summary: Squid is a caching proxy for the Web. In Squid versions prior to 7.2, a failure to
  redact HTTP authentication credentials in error handling allows information disclosure. The
  vulnerability allows a script to bypass browser security protections and learn the credentials
  a trusted client uses to authenticate. This potentially allows a remote client to identify
  security tokens or credentials used internally by a web application using Squid for backend
  load balancing. These attacks do not require Squid to be configured with HTTP authentication.
  The vulnerability is fixed in version 7.2. As a workaround, disable debug information in administrator
  mailto links generated by Squid by configuring squid.conf with email_err_data off.
