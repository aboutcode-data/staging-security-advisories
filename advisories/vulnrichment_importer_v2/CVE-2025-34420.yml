aliases: []
summary: MailEnable versions prior to 10.54 contain an unsafe DLL loading vulnerability that
  can lead to local arbitrary code execution. The MailEnable administrative executable attempts
  to load MEAIAM.DLL from its installation directory without sufficient integrity validation
  or a secure search order. A local attacker with write access to that directory can plant a
  malicious MEAIAM.DLL, which is then loaded on execution, resulting in attacker-controlled
  code running with the privileges of the process.
