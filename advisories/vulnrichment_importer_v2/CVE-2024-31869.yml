aliases: []
summary: Airflow versions 2.7.0 through 2.8.4 have a vulnerability that allows an authenticated
  user to see sensitive provider configuration via the "configuration" UI page when "non-sensitive-only"
  was set as "webserver.expose_config" configuration (The celery provider is the only community
  provider currently that has sensitive configurations). You should migrate to Airflow 2.9 or
  change your "expose_config" configuration to False as a workaround. This is similar, but different
  to  CVE-2023-46288 https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9qqg-mh7c-chfq  which concerned API,
  not UI configuration page.
