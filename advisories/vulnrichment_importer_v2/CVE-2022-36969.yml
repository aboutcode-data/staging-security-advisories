datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2022/36xxx/CVE-2022-36969.json
aliases: []
summary: This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected
  installations of AVEVA Edge 2020 SP2 Patch 0(4201.2111.1802.0000). User interaction is required
  to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious
  file. The specific flaw exists within the LoadImportedLibraries method. Due to the improper
  restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references, a crafted document specifying a URI causes
  the XML parser to access the URI and embed the contents back into the XML document for further
  processing. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose information in the context
  of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-17394.
