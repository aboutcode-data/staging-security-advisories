aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the multicast DNS (mDNS) gateway feature of Cisco Aironet Series
  Access Points Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial
  of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient
  input validation of incoming mDNS traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
  sending a crafted mDNS packet to an affected device through a wireless network that is configured
  in FlexConnect local switching mode or through a wired network on a configured mDNS VLAN.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the access point (AP) to reboot, resulting
  in a DoS condition.
