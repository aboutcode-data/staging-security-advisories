aliases: []
summary: The Metform Elementor Contact Form Builder for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary
  File Upload due to insufficient file type validation in versions up to, and including, 3.2.4.
  This allows unauthenticated visitors to perform a "double extension" attack and upload files
  containing a malicious extension but ending with a benign extension, which may make remote
  code execution possible in some configurations.
