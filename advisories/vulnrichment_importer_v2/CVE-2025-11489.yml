  environment. The attack''s complexity is rated as high. It is stated that the exploitability
  is difficult. The exploit has been disclosed publicly and may be used. The vendor explains:
  "Our restriction features are designed as guardrails for LLMs to help them stay closer to
  what users want, rather than hardened security boundaries. (...) For users where security
  is a top priority, we continue to recommend using Desktop Commander with Docker, which provides
  actual isolation. (...) We''ll keep this issue open for future consideration if we receive
  more user demand for improved restrictions." This vulnerability only affects products that
  are no longer supported by the maintainer.'
