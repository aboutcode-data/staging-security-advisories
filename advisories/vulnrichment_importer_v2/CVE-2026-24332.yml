aliases: []
summary: 'Discord through 2026-01-16 allows gathering information about whether a user''s client
  state is Invisible (and not actually offline) because the response to a WebSocket API request
  includes the user in the presences array (with "status": "offline"), whereas offline users
  are omitted from the presences array. This is arguably inconsistent with the UI description
  of Invisible as "You will appear offline."'
