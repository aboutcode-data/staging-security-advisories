  nvme: apple: fix device reference counting

  Drivers must call nvme_uninit_ctrl after a successful nvme_init_ctrl.
  Split the allocation side out to make the error handling boundary easier
  to navigate. The apple driver had been doing this wrong, leaking the
  controller device memory on a tagset failure.
