aliases: []
summary: |
  An issue was discovered in 6.0 before 6.0.2, 5.2 before 5.2.11, and 4.2 before 4.2.28.
  `FilteredRelation` is subject to SQL injection in column aliases via control characters, using a suitably crafted dictionary, with dictionary expansion, as the `**kwargs` passed to `QuerySet` methods `annotate()`, `aggregate()`, `extra()`, `values()`, `values_list()`, and `alias()`.
  Earlier, unsupported Django series (such as 5.0.x, 4.1.x, and 3.2.x) were not evaluated and may also be affected.
  Django would like to thank Solomon Kebede for reporting this issue.
