aliases: []
summary: 'Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for IoT devices. Because
  of insufficient validation of IPv6 neighbor discovery options in Contiki-NG, attackers can
  send neighbor solicitation packets that trigger an out-of-bounds read. The problem exists
  in the module os/net/ipv6/uip-nd6.c, where memory read operations from the main packet buffer,
  <code>uip_buf</code>, are not checked if they go out of bounds. In particular, this problem
  can occur when attempting to read the 2-byte option header and the Source Link-Layer Address
  Option (SLLAO). This attack requires ipv6 be enabled for the network. The problem has been
  patched in the develop branch of Contiki-NG. The upcoming 4.8 release of Contiki-NG will include
  the patch.Users unable to upgrade may apply the patch in Contiki-NG PR #1654.'
