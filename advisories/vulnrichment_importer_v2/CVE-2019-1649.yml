aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the logic that handles access control to one of the hardware components
  in Cisco''s proprietary Secure Boot implementation could allow an authenticated, local attacker
  to write a modified firmware image to the component. This vulnerability affects multiple Cisco
  products that support hardware-based Secure Boot functionality. The vulnerability is due to
  an improper check on the area of code that manages on-premise updates to a Field Programmable
  Gate Array (FPGA) part of the Secure Boot hardware implementation. An attacker with elevated
  privileges and access to the underlying operating system that is running on the affected device
  could exploit this vulnerability by writing a modified firmware image to the FPGA. A successful
  exploit could either cause the device to become unusable (and require a hardware replacement)
  or allow tampering with the Secure Boot verification process, which under some circumstances
  may allow the attacker to install and boot a malicious software image. An attacker will need
  to fulfill all the following conditions to attempt to exploit this vulnerability: Have privileged
  administrative access to the device. Be able to access the underlying operating system running
  on the device; this can be achieved either by using a supported, documented mechanism or by
  exploiting another vulnerability that would provide an attacker with such access. Develop
  or have access to a platform-specific exploit. An attacker attempting to exploit this vulnerability
  across multiple affected platforms would need to research each one of those platforms and
  then develop a platform-specific exploit. Although the research process could be reused across
  different platforms, an exploit developed for a given hardware platform is unlikely to work
  on a different hardware platform.'
