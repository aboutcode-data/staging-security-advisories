  bpf: Fix verifier assumptions about socket->sk

  The verifier assumes that 'sk' field in 'struct socket' is valid
  and non-NULL when 'socket' pointer itself is trusted and non-NULL.
  That may not be the case when socket was just created and
  passed to LSM socket_accept hook.
  Fix this verifier assumption and adjust tests.
