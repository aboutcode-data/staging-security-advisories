aliases: []
summary: The Duplicator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to information exposure in all versions
  up to, and including, 1.5.9. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to obtain
  the full path to instances, which they may be able to use in combination with other vulnerabilities
  or to simplify reconnaissance work. On its own, this information is of very limited use.
