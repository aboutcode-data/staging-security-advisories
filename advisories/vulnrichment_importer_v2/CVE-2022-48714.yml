  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  bpf: Use VM_MAP instead of VM_ALLOC for ringbuf

  After commit 2fd3fb0be1d1 ("kasan, vmalloc: unpoison VM_ALLOC pages
  after mapping"), non-VM_ALLOC mappings will be marked as accessible
  in __get_vm_area_node() when KASAN is enabled. But now the flag for
  ringbuf area is VM_ALLOC, so KASAN will complain out-of-bound access
  after vmap() returns. Because the ringbuf area is created by mapping
  allocated pages, so use VM_MAP instead.

  After the change, info in /proc/vmallocinfo also changes from
    [start]-[end]   24576 ringbuf_map_alloc+0x171/0x290 vmalloc user
  to
    [start]-[end]   24576 ringbuf_map_alloc+0x171/0x290 vmap user
