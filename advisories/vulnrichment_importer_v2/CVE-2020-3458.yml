aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the secure boot process of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance
  (ASA) Software and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software for the Firepower 1000 Series and
  Firepower 2100 Series Appliances could allow an authenticated, local attacker to bypass the
  secure boot mechanism. The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient protections of the secure
  boot process. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by injecting code into specific
  files that are then referenced during the device boot process. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to break the chain of trust and inject code into the boot process of the
  device, which would be executed at each boot and maintain persistence across reboots.
