aliases: []
summary: "PKCE was implemented in the OAuth implementation in workers-oauth-provider that is\
  \ part of  MCP framework https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-mcp . However, it was found\
  \ that an attacker could cause the check to be skipped.\n\n\nFixed in:\n\n \n\n https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/27\
  \ https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/27 \n\n\nImpact: \n\nPKCE is a\
  \ defense-in-depth mechanism against certain kinds of attacks and was an optional extension\
  \ in OAuth 2.0 which became required in the OAuth 2.1 draft. (Note that the MCP specification\
  \ requires OAuth 2.1.). This bug completely bypasses PKCE protection."
