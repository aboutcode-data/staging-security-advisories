aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in the OpenShift Lightspeed Service, which is vulnerable to unauthenticated
  API request flooding. Repeated queries to non-existent endpoints inflate metrics storage and
  processing, consuming excessive resources. This issue can lead to monitoring system degradation,
  increased disk usage, and potential service unavailability. Since the issue does not require
  authentication, an external attacker can exhaust CPU, RAM, and disk space, impacting both
  application and cluster stability.
