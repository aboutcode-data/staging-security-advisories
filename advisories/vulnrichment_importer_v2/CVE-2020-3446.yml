aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Cisco Virtual Wide Area Application Services (vWAAS) with Cisco
  Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS)-bundled images for Cisco ENCS 5400-W Series
  and CSP 5000-W Series appliances could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to log into
  the NFVIS CLI of an affected device by using accounts that have a default, static password.
  The vulnerability exists because the affected software has user accounts with default, static
  passwords. An attacker with access to the NFVIS CLI of an affected device could exploit this
  vulnerability by logging into the CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access
  the NFVIS CLI with administrator privileges.
