aliases: []
summary: Apollo Server is an open-source, spec-compliant GraphQL server that's compatible with
  any GraphQL client, including Apollo Client. In versions from 2.0.0 to 3.13.0, 4.2.0 to before
  4.13.0, and 5.0.0 to before 5.4.0, the default configuration of startStandaloneServer from
  @apollo/server/standalone is vulnerable to denial of service (DoS) attacks through specially
  crafted request bodies with exotic character set encodings. This issue does not affect users
  that use @apollo/server as a dependency for integration packages, like @as-integrations/express5
  or @as-integrations/next, only direct usage of startStandaloneServer.
