aliases: []
summary: soroban-fixed-point-math is a fixed-point math library for Soroban smart contacts.
  In versions 1.3.0 and 1.4.0, the `mulDiv(x, y, z)` function incorrectly handled cases where
  both the intermediate product $x * y$ and the divisor $z$ were negative. The logic assumed
  that if the intermediate product was negative, the final result must also be negative, neglecting
  the sign of $z$. This resulted in rounding being applied in the wrong direction for cases
  where both $x * y$ and $z$ were negative. The functions most at risk are `fixed_div_floor`
  and `fixed_div_ceil`, as they often use non-constant numbers as the divisor $z$ in `mulDiv`.  This
  error is present in all signed `FixedPoint` and `SorobanFixedPoint` implementations, including
  `i64`, `i128`, and `I256`. Versions 1.3.1 and 1.4.1 contain a patch. No known workarounds
  for this issue are available.
