aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the function that performs IPv4 and IPv6 Network Address Translation\
  \ (NAT) DNS inspection for Cisco Secure Firewall Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software\
  \ and Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated,\
  \ remote attacker to cause the device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service\
  \ (DoS) condition.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to an infinite loop condition that\
  \ occurs when a Cisco Secure ASA or Cisco Secure FTD device processes DNS packets with DNS\
  \ inspection enabled and the device is configured for NAT44, NAT64, or NAT46. An attacker\
  \ could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted DNS packets that match a static NAT\
  \ rule with DNS inspection enabled through an affected device. A successful exploit could\
  \ allow the attacker to create an infinite loop and cause the device to reload, resulting\
  \ in a DoS condition."
