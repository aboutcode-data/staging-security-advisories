  wifi: ath12k: fix possible out-of-bound write in ath12k_wmi_ext_hal_reg_caps()

  reg_cap.phy_id is extracted from WMI event and could be an unexpected value
  in case some errors happen. As a result out-of-bound write may occur to
  soc->hal_reg_cap. Fix it by validating reg_cap.phy_id before using it.

  This is found during code review.

  Compile tested only.
