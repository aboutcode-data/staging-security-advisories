aliases: []
summary: pdfminer.six before 20251230 contains an insecure deserialization vulnerability in
  the CMap loading mechanism. The library uses Python pickle to deserialize CMap cache files
  without validation. An attacker with the ability to place a malicious pickle file in a location
  accessible to the application can trigger arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation
  when the file is loaded by a trusted process. This is caused by an incomplete patch to CVE-2025-64512.
