aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software
  could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to consume excessive system memory and cause
  a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to inefficient
  memory management. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number
  of crafted HTTP requests to the affected web-based management interface. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to exhaust system memory, which could cause the system to stop processing
  new connections and could result in a DoS condition.
