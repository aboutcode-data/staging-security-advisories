aliases: []
summary: Feathersjs is a framework for creating web APIs and real-time applications with TypeScript
  or JavaScript. Versions 5.0.39 and below the redirect query parameter is appended to the base
  origin without validation, allowing attackers to steal access tokens via URL authority injection.
  This leads to full account takeover, as the attacker obtains the victim's access token and
  can impersonate them. The application constructs the final redirect URL by concatenating the
  base origin with the user-supplied redirect parameter. This is exploitable when the origins
  array is configured and origin values do not end with /. An attacker can supply @attacker.com
  as the redirect value results in https://target.com@attacker.com#access_token=..., where the
  browser interprets attacker.com as the host, leading to full account takeover. This issue
  has been fixed in version 5.0.40.
