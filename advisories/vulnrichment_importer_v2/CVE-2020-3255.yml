aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the packet processing functionality of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense
  (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service
  (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to inefficient memory management.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of IPv4 or IPv6 traffic
  through an affected device. This traffic would need to match a configured block action in
  an access control policy. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a memory exhaustion
  condition on the affected device, which would result in a DoS for traffic transiting the device,
  as well as sluggish performance of the management interface. Once the flood is stopped, performance
  should return to previous states.
