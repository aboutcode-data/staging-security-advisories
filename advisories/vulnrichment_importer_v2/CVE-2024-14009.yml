aliases: []
summary: Nagios XI versions prior to 2024R1.0.1 contain a privilege escalation vulnerability
  in the System Profile component. The System Profile feature is an administrative diagnostic/configuration
  capability. Due to improper access controls and unsafe handling of exported/imported profile
  data and operations, an authenticated administrator could exploit this vulnerability to execute
  actions on the underlying XI host outside the application's security scope. Successful exploitation
  may allow an administrator to obtain root privileges on the XI server.
