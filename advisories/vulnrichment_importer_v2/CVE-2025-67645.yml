aliases: []
summary: OpenEMR is a free and open source electronic health records and medical practice management
  application. Versions prior to 7.0.4 have a broken access control in the Profile Edit endpoint.
  An authenticated normal user can modify the request parameters (pubpid / pid) to reference
  another user’s record; the server accepts the modified IDs and applies the changes to that
  other user’s profile. This allows one user to alter another user’s profile data (name, contact
  info, etc.), and could enable account takeover. Version 7.0.4 fixes the issue.
