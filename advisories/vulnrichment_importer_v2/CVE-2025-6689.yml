summary: The FL3R Accessibility Suite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the plugin's fl3raccessibilitysuite shortcode in all versions up to, and including,

  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page.
