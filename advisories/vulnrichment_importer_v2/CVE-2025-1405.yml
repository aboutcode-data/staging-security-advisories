summary: The Product Catalog Simple plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the plugin's show_products shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.11

  makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to
  inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page.
