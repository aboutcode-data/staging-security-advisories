aliases: []
summary: 'The Widget Options – The #1 WordPress Widget & Block Control Plugin plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.7 via the
  display logic functionality that extends several page builders. This is due to the plugin
  allowing users to supply input that will be passed through eval() without any filtering or
  capability checks. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
  access and above, to execute code on the server. Special note: We suggested the vendor implement
  an allowlist of functions and limit the ability to execute commands to just administrators,
  however, they did not take our advice. We are considering this patched, however, we believe
  it could still be further hardened and there may be residual risk with how the issue is currently
  patched.'
