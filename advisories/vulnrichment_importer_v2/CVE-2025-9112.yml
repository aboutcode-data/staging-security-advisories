aliases: []
summary: The Doccure theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to incorrect
  file type validation in the 'doccure_temp_file_uploader' function in all versions up to, and
  including, 1.4.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level
  and above permissions, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make
  remote code execution possible.
