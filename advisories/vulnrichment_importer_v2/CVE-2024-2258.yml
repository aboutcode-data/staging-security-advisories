aliases: []
summary: The Form Maker by 10Web – Mobile-Friendly Drag & Drop Contact Form Builder plugin for
  WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via a user's display name autofilled
  into forms in all versions up to, and including, 1.15.24 due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level
  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses an injected page.
