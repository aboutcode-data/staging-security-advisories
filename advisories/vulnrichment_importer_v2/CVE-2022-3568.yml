aliases: []
summary: The ImageMagick Engine plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted
  input via the 'cli_path' parameter in versions up to, and including 1.7.5. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated users to call files using a PHAR wrapper, granted they can trick a site
  administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link, that will deserialize
  and call arbitrary PHP Objects that can be used to perform a variety of malicious actions
  granted a POP chain is also present. It also requires that the attacker is successful in uploading
  a file with the serialized payload.
