aliases: []
summary: Nextcloud Server is the file server software for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity
  platform. Nextcloud Server prior to 24.0.8 and 23.0.12 and Nextcloud Enterprise server prior
  to 24.0.8 and 23.0.12 are vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF). Attackers can
  leverage enclosed alphanumeric payloads to bypass IP filters and gain SSRF, which would allow
  an attacker to read crucial metadata if the server is hosted on the AWS platform. Nextcloud
  Server 24.0.8 and 23.0.2 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server 24.0.8 and 23.0.12 contain a patch
  for this issue. No known workarounds are available.
