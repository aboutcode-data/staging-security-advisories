aliases: []
summary: |
  Infinix devices contain a pre-loaded "com.transsion.agingfunction" application, that exposes an unsecured broadcast receiver. An attacker can communicate with the receiver and force the device to perform a factory reset without any Android system permissions. 

  After multiple attempts to contact the vendor we did not receive any answer. We suppose this issue affects all Infinix Mobile devices.
