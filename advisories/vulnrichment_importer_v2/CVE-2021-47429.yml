  powerpc/64s: Fix unrecoverable MCE calling async handler from NMI

  The machine check handler is not considered NMI on 64s. The early
  handler is the true NMI handler, and then it schedules the
  machine_check_exception handler to run when interrupts are enabled.

  This works fine except the case of an unrecoverable MCE, where the true
  NMI is taken when MSR[RI] is clear, it can not recover, so it calls
  machine_check_exception directly so something might be done about it.

  Calling an async handler from NMI context can result in irq state and
  other things getting corrupted. This can also trigger the BUG at
    arch/powerpc/include/asm/interrupt.h:168
    BUG_ON(!arch_irq_disabled_regs(regs) && !(regs->msr & MSR_EE));

  Fix this by making an _async version of the handler which is called
  in the normal case, and a NMI version that is called for unrecoverable
  interrupts.
