aliases: []
summary: |
  The `PaperCutNG Mobility Print` version 1.0.3512 application allows an

  unauthenticated attacker to perform a CSRF attack on an instance

  administrator to configure the clients host (in the "configure printer

  discovery" section). This is possible because the application has no

  protections against CSRF attacks, like Anti-CSRF tokens, header origin

  validation, samesite cookies, etc.
