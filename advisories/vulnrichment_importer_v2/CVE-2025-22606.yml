summary: Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications,
  and databases. In version 4.0.0-beta.358 and possibly earlier versions, when creating or updating
  a "project," it is possible to inject arbitrary shell commands by altering the project name.
  If a name includes unescaped characters, such as single quotes (`'`), it breaks out of the
  intended command structure, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the host system.
  This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the host server, which
  could result in full system compromise; create, modify, or delete sensitive system files;
  and escalate privileges depending on the permissions of the executed process. Attackers with
  access to project management features could exploit this flaw to gain unauthorized control
  over the host environment. Version 4.0.0-beta.359 fixes this issue.
