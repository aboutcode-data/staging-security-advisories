aliases: []
summary: The seffaflik thru 0.0.9 is vulnerable to symlink attacks due to incorrect default
  permissions given to the .kimlik file and .seffaflik file, which is created with mode 0777
  and 0775 respectively, exposing secrets to other local users. Additionally, the .kimlik file
  is written without symlink checks, allowing local attackers to overwrite arbitrary files.
  This can result in information disclosure and denial of service.
