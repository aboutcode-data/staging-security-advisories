aliases: []
summary: Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting
  in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, the exact Directus version number is incorrectly
  being used as OpenAPI Spec version this means that it is being exposed by the `/server/specs/oas`
  endpoint without authentication. With the exact version information a malicious attacker can
  look for known vulnerabilities in Directus core or any of its shipped dependencies in that
  specific running version. Version 11.9.0 fixes the issue.
