aliases: []
summary: An authenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in Lucee’s administrative
  interface due to insecure design in the scheduled task functionality. An administrator with
  access to /lucee/admin/web.cfm can configure a scheduled job to retrieve a remote .cfm file
  from an attacker-controlled server, which is written to the Lucee webroot and executed with
  the privileges of the Lucee service account. Because Lucee does not enforce integrity checks,
  path restrictions, or execution controls for scheduled task fetches, this feature can be abused
  to achieve arbitrary code execution. This issue is distinct from CVE-2024-55354.
