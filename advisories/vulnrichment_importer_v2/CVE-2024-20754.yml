aliases: []
summary: Lightroom Desktop versions 7.1.2 and earlier are affected by an Untrusted Search Path
  vulnerability that could result in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current
  user. If the application uses a search path to locate critical resources such as programs,
  then an attacker could modify that search path to point to a malicious program, which the
  targeted application would then execute. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction
  in that a victim must open a malicious file.
