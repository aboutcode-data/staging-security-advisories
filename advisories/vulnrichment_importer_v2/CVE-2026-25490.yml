summary: Craft Commerce is an ecommerce platform for Craft CMS. In versions from 4.0.0-RC1 to
  4.10.0 and from 5.0.0 to 5.5.1, a stored XSS vulnerability in Craft Commerce allows attackers
  to execute malicious JavaScript in an administrator’s browser. This occurs because the 'Address
  Line 1' field in Inventory Locations is not properly sanitized before being displayed in the
  admin panel. This issue has been patched in versions 4.10.1 and 5.5.2.
