aliases: []
summary: n8n is a workflow automation platform. Prior to version 1.99.1, an authorization vulnerability
  was discovered in the /rest/executions/:id/stop endpoint of n8n. An authenticated user can
  stop workflow executions that they do not own or that have not been shared with them, leading
  to potential business disruption. This issue has been patched in version 1.99.1. A workaround
  involves restricting access to the /rest/executions/:id/stop endpoint via reverse proxy or
  API gateway.
