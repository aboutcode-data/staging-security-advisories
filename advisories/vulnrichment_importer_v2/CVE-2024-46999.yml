aliases: []
summary: Zitadel is an open source identity management platform. ZITADEL's user grants deactivation
  mechanism did not work correctly. Deactivated user grants were still provided in token, which
  could lead to unauthorized access to applications and resources. Additionally, the management
  and auth API always returned the state as active or did not provide any information about
  the state. Versions 2.62.1, 2.61.1, 2.60.2, 2.59.3, 2.58.5, 2.57.5, 2.56.6, 2.55.8, and 2.54.10
  have been released which address this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to
  upgrade may explicitly remove the user grants to make sure the user does not get access anymore.
