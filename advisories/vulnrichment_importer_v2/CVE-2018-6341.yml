summary: React applications which rendered to HTML using the ReactDOMServer API were not escaping
  user-supplied attribute names at render-time. That lack of escaping could lead to a cross-site
  scripting vulnerability. This issue affected minor releases 16.0.x, 16.1.x, 16.2.x, 16.3.x,
  and 16.4.x. It was fixed in 16.0.1, 16.1.2, 16.2.1, 16.3.3, and 16.4.2.
