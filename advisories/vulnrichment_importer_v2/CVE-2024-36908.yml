  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  blk-iocost: do not WARN if iocg was already offlined

  In iocg_pay_debt(), warn is triggered if 'active_list' is empty, which
  is intended to confirm iocg is active when it has debt. However, warn
  can be triggered during a blkcg or disk removal, if iocg_waitq_timer_fn()
  is run at that time:

    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 2344971 at block/blk-iocost.c:1402 iocg_pay_debt+0x14c/0x190
    Call trace:
    iocg_pay_debt+0x14c/0x190
    iocg_kick_waitq+0x438/0x4c0
    iocg_waitq_timer_fn+0xd8/0x130
    __run_hrtimer+0x144/0x45c
    __hrtimer_run_queues+0x16c/0x244
    hrtimer_interrupt+0x2cc/0x7b0

  The warn in this situation is meaningless. Since this iocg is being
  removed, the state of the 'active_list' is irrelevant, and 'waitq_timer'
  is canceled after removing 'active_list' in ioc_pd_free(), which ensures
  iocg is freed after iocg_waitq_timer_fn() returns.

  Therefore, add the check if iocg was already offlined to avoid warn
  when removing a blkcg or disk.
