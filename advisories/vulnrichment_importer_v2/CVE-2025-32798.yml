aliases: []
summary: Conda-build contains commands and tools to build conda packages. Prior to version 25.4.0,
  the conda-build recipe processing logic has been found to be vulnerable to arbitrary code
  execution due to unsafe evaluation of recipe selectors. Currently, conda-build uses the eval
  function to process embedded selectors in meta.yaml files. This approach evaluates user-defined
  expressions without proper sanitization, which allows arbitrary code to be executed during
  the build process. As a result, the integrity of the build environment is compromised, and
  unauthorized commands or file operations may be performed. The vulnerability stems from the
  inherent risk of using eval() on untrusted input in a context intended to control dynamic
  build configurations. By directly interpreting selector expressions, conda-build creates a
  potential execution pathway for malicious code, violating security assumptions. This issue
  has been patched in version 25.4.0.
