aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the GRand Unified Bootloader (GRUB) for Cisco IOS XR Software could
  allow an unauthenticated attacker with physical access to the device to view sensitive files
  on the console using the GRUB bootloader command line. This vulnerability is due to the inclusion
  of unnecessary commands within the GRUB environment that allow sensitive files to be viewed.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by being connected to the console port of the
  Cisco IOS XR device when the device is power-cycled. A successful exploit could allow the
  attacker to view sensitive files that could be used to conduct additional attacks against
  the device.
