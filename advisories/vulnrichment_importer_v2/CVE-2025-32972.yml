aliases: []
summary: XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions starting from 6.1-milestone-1 to before
  15.10.12, from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.4.3, and from 16.5.0-rc-1 to before 16.8.0-rc-1, the
  script API of the LESS compiler in XWiki is incorrectly checking for rights when calling the
  cache cleaning API, making it possible to clean the cache without having programming right.
  The only impact of this is a slowdown in XWiki execution as the caches are re-filled. As this
  vulnerability requires script right to exploit, and script right already allows unlimited
  execution of scripts, the additional impact due to this vulnerability is low. This issue has
  been patched in versions 15.10.12, 16.4.3, and 16.8.0-rc-1.
