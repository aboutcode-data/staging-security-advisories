summary: |
  An Improper Handling of Undefined Values vulnerability in the periodic packet management daemon (PPMD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series(except MPC10, MPC11 and LC9600) allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

  When a malformed CFM packet is received, it leads to an FPC crash. Continued receipt of these packets causes a sustained denial of service. This vulnerability occurs only when CFM has been configured on the interface.

  This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS:
