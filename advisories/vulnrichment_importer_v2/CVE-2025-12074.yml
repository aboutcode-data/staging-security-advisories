summary: The Context Blog theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions
  up to, and including, 1.2.5 via the 'context_blog_modal_popup' due to insufficient restrictions
  on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract
  data from password protected, private, or draft posts that they should not have access to.
