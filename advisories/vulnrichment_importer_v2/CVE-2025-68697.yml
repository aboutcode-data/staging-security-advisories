aliases: []
summary: 'n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. Prior to version 2.0.0, in self-hosted
  n8n instances where the Code node runs in legacy (non-task-runner) JavaScript execution mode,
  authenticated users with workflow editing access can invoke internal helper functions from
  within the Code node. This allows a workflow editor to perform actions on the n8n host with
  the same privileges as the n8n process, including: reading files from the host filesystem
  (subject to any file-access restrictions configured on the instance and OS/container permissions),
  and writing files to the host filesystem (subject to the same restrictions). This issue has
  been patched in version 2.0.0. Workarounds for this issue involve limiting file operations
  by setting N8N_RESTRICT_FILE_ACCESS_TO to a dedicated directory (e.g., ~/.n8n-files) and ensure
  it contains no sensitive data, keeping N8N_BLOCK_FILE_ACCESS_TO_N8N_FILES=true (default) to
  block access to .n8n and user-defined config files, and disabling high-risk nodes (including
  the Code node) using NODES_EXCLUDE if workflow editors are not fully trusted.'
