aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager,
  Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (SME), Cisco Unified Communications
  Manager IM and Presence (Unified CM IM&amp;P) Service, and Cisco Unity Connection could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack
  on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections by the affected
  software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a targeted user to click
  a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send arbitrary requests
  that could change the password of a targeted user. An attacker could then take unauthorized
  actions on behalf of the targeted user.
