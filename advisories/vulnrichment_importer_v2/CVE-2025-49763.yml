aliases: []
summary: |
  ESI plugin does not have the limit for maximum inclusion depth, and that allows excessive memory consumption if malicious instructions are inserted.

  Users can use a new setting for the plugin (--max-inclusion-depth) to limit it.
  This issue affects Apache Traffic Server: from 10.0.0 through 10.0.5, from 9.0.0 through 9.2.10.

  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.2.11 or 10.0.6,  which fixes the issue.
