aliases: []
summary: 'In IQrouter through 3.3.1, remote attackers can control the device (restart network,
  reboot, upgrade, reset) because of Incorrect Access Control. Note: The vendor claims that
  this vulnerability can only occur on a brand-new network that, after initiating the forced
  initial configuration (which has a required step for setting a secure password on the system),
  makes this CVE invalid. This vulnerability is “true for any unconfigured release of OpenWRT,
  and true of many other new Linux distros prior to being configured for the first time”'
