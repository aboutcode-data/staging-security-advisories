summary: Instead of typical session tokens or cookies, it is verified on a per-request basis
  if the originating IP address has once successfully logged in. As soon as an authentication
  request from a certain source IP is successful, the IP address is handled as authenticated.
  No other session information is stored. Therefore, it is possible to spoof the IP address
  of a logged-in user to gain access to the Access Manager web interface.
