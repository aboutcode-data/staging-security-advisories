aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the TLS 1.3 implementation for a specific cipher for Cisco Secure\
  \ Firewall Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense\
  \ (FTD) Software for Cisco Firepower 3100 and 4200 Series devices could allow an authenticated,\
  \ remote attacker to consume resources that are associated with incoming TLS 1.3 connections,\
  \ which eventually could cause the device to stop accepting any new SSL/TLS or VPN requests.\r\
  \n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to the implementation of the TLS 1.3 Cipher TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256.\
  \ An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of TLS 1.3 connections\
  \ with the specific TLS 1.3 Cipher TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256. A successful exploit could\
  \ allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition where no new incoming encrypted\
  \ connections are accepted. The device must be reloaded to clear this condition.\r\nNote:\
  \ These incoming TLS 1.3 connections include both data traffic and user-management traffic.\
  \ After the device is in the vulnerable state, no new encrypted connections can be accepted."
