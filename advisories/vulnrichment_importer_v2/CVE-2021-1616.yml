aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the H.323 application level gateway (ALG) used by the Network Address
  Translation (NAT) feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote
  attacker to bypass the ALG. This vulnerability is due to insufficient data validation of traffic
  that is traversing the ALG. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted
  traffic to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the
  ALG and open connections that should not be allowed to a remote device located behind the
  ALG. Note: This vulnerability has been publicly discussed as NAT Slipstreaming.'
