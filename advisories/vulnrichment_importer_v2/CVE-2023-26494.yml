aliases: []
summary: lorawan-stack is an open source LoRaWAN network server. Prior to version 3.24.1, an
  open redirect exists on the login page of the lorawan stack server, allowing an attacker to
  supply a user controlled redirect upon sign in. This issue may allows malicious actors to
  phish users, as users assume they were redirected to the homepage on login. Version 3.24.1
  contains a fix.
