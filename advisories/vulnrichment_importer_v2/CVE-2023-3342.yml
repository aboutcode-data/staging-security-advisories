aliases: []
summary: The User Registration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
  due to a hardcoded encryption key and missing file type validation on the 'ur_upload_profile_pic'
  function in versions up to, and including, 3.0.2. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers with subscriber-level capabilities or above to upload arbitrary files on the affected
  site's server which may make remote code execution possible. This was partially patched in
  version 3.0.2 and fully patched in version 3.0.2.1.
