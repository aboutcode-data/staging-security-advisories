aliases: []
summary: Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. A cross-site scripting
  (XSS) vulnerability exists in versions prior to 0.12.0-beta of the Audiobookshelf mobile application
  that allows arbitrary JavaScript execution through malicious library metadata. Attackers with
  library modification privileges (or control over a malicious podcast RSS feed) can execute
  code in victim users' WebViews, potentially leading to session hijacking, data exfiltration,
  and unauthorized access to native device APIs. audiobookshelf-app version 0.12.0-beta fixes
  the issue.
