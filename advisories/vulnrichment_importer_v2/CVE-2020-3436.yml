aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web services interface of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance
  (ASA) and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote
  attacker to upload arbitrary-sized files to specific folders on an affected device, which
  could lead to an unexpected device reload. The vulnerability exists because the affected software
  does not efficiently handle the writing of large files to specific folders on the local file
  system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading files to those specific
  folders. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to write a file that triggers a watchdog
  timeout, which would cause the device to unexpectedly reload, causing a denial of service
  (DoS) condition.
