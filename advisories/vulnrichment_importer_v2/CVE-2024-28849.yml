aliases: []
summary: follow-redirects is an open source, drop-in replacement for Node's `http` and `https`
  modules that automatically follows redirects. In affected versions follow-redirects only clears
  authorization header during cross-domain redirect, but keep the proxy-authentication header
  which contains credentials too. This vulnerability may lead to credentials leak, but has been
  addressed in version 1.15.6. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
  for this vulnerability.
