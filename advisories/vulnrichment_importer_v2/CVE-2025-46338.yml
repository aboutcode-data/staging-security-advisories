aliases: []
summary: Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Prior to version 2.21.0,
  an improper input handling vulnerability in the `/api/upload` endpoint allows an attacker
  to perform a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack by submitting malicious payloads
  in the `libraryId` field. The unsanitized input is reflected in the server’s error message,
  enabling arbitrary JavaScript execution in a victim's browser. This issue has been patched
  in version 2.21.0.
