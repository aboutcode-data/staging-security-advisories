  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  userfaultfd: change src_folio after ensuring it's unpinned in UFFDIO_MOVE

  Commit d7a08838ab74 ("mm: userfaultfd: fix unexpected change to src_folio
  when UFFDIO_MOVE fails") moved the src_folio->{mapping, index} changing to
  after clearing the page-table and ensuring that it's not pinned.  This
  avoids failure of swapout+migration and possibly memory corruption.

  However, the commit missed fixing it in the huge-page case.
