aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the `lollms_generation_events.py` component of parisneo/lollms version
  5.9.0 allows unauthenticated access to sensitive Socket.IO events. The `add_events` function
  registers event handlers such as `generate_text`, `cancel_generation`, `generate_msg`, and
  `generate_msg_from` without implementing authentication or authorization checks. This allows
  unauthenticated clients to execute resource-intensive or state-altering operations, leading
  to potential denial of service, state corruption, and race conditions. Additionally, the use
  of global flags (`lollmsElfServer.busy`, `lollmsElfServer.cancel_gen`) for state management
  in a multi-client environment introduces further vulnerabilities, enabling one client's actions
  to affect the server's state and other clients' operations. The lack of proper access control
  and reliance on insecure global state management significantly impacts the availability and
  integrity of the service.
