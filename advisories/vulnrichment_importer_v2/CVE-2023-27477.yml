aliases: []
summary: wasmtime is a fast and secure runtime for WebAssembly. Wasmtime's code generation backend,
  Cranelift, has a bug on x86_64 platforms for the WebAssembly `i8x16.select` instruction which
  will produce the wrong results when the same operand is provided to the instruction and some
  of the selected indices are greater than 16. There is an off-by-one error in the calculation
  of the mask to the `pshufb` instruction which causes incorrect results to be returned if lanes
  are selected from the second vector. This codegen bug has been fixed in Wasmtiem 6.0.1, 5.0.1,
  and 4.0.1. Users are recommended to upgrade to these updated versions. If upgrading is not
  an option for you at this time, you can avoid this miscompilation by disabling the Wasm simd
  proposal. Additionally the bug is only present on x86_64 hosts. Other platforms such as AArch64
  and s390x are not affected.
