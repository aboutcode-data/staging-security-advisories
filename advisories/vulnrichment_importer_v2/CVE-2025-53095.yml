aliases: []
summary: Sunshine is a self-hosted game stream host for Moonlight. Prior to version 2025.628.4510,
  the web UI of Sunshine lacks protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
  This vulnerability allows an attacker to craft a malicious web page that, when visited by
  an authenticated user, can trigger unintended actions within the Sunshine application on behalf
  of that user. Specifically, since the application does OS command execution by design, this
  issue can be exploited to abuse the "Command Preparations" feature, enabling an attacker to
  inject arbitrary commands that will be executed with Administrator privileges when an application
  is launched. This issue has been patched in version 2025.628.4510.
