aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the update service of Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App for Windows
  could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands as a privileged
  user. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied parameters. An
  attacker could exploit this vulnerability by invoking the update service command with a crafted
  argument. An exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands with SYSTEM user privileges.
  While the CVSS Attack Vector metric denotes the requirement for an attacker to have local
  access, administrators should be aware that in Active Directory deployments, the vulnerability
  could be exploited remotely by leveraging the operating system remote management tools.
