aliases: []
summary: OpenText Documentum Content Server before 23.2 has a flaw that allows for privilege
  escalation from a non-privileged Documentum user to root. The software comes prepackaged with
  a root owned SUID binary dm_secure_writer. The binary has security controls in place preventing
  creation of a file in a non-owned directory, or as the root user. However, these controls
  can be carefully bypassed to allow for an arbitrary file write as root.
