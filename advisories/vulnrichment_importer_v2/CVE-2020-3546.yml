aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco AsyncOS software for
  Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access
  sensitive information on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation
  of requests that are sent to the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the interface of an affected device. A
  successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain the IP addresses that are configured
  on the internal interfaces of the affected device. There is a workaround that addresses this
  vulnerability.
