aliases: []
summary: mailgen is a Node.js package that generates responsive HTML e-mails for sending transactional
  mail. Mailgen versions through 2.0.31 contain an HTML injection vulnerability in plaintext
  emails generated with the generatePlaintext method when user generated content is supplied.
  The plaintext generation code attempts to strip HTML tags using a regular expression and then
  decodes HTML entities, but tags that include certain Unicode line separator characters are
  not matched and removed. These encoded tags are later decoded into valid HTML content, allowing
  unexpected HTML to remain in output intended to be plaintext. Projects are affected if they
  call Mailgen.generatePlaintext with untrusted input and then render or otherwise process the
  returned string in a context where HTML is interpreted. This can lead to execution of attacker
  supplied script in the victim’s browser. Version 2.0.32 fixes the issue.
