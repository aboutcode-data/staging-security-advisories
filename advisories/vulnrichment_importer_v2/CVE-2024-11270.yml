summary: The WordPress Webinar Plugin – WebinarPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
  file creation due to a missing capability check on the 'sync-import-imgs' function and missing
  file type validation in all versions up to, and including, 1.33.24. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to create arbitrary files
  that can lead to remote code execution.
