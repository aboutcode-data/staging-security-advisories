  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: mdio: fix unbalanced fwnode reference count in mdio_device_release()

  There is warning report about of_node refcount leak
  while probing mdio device:

  OF: ERROR: memory leak, expected refcount 1 instead of 2,
  of_node_get()/of_node_put() unbalanced - destroy cset entry:
  attach overlay node /spi/soc@0/mdio@710700c0/ethernet@4

  In of_mdiobus_register_device(), we increase fwnode refcount
  by fwnode_handle_get() before associating the of_node with
  mdio device, but it has never been decreased in normal path.
  Since that, in mdio_device_release(), it needs to call
  fwnode_handle_put() in addition instead of calling kfree()
  directly.

  After above, just calling mdio_device_free() in the error handle
  path of of_mdiobus_register_device() is enough to keep the
  refcount balanced.
