aliases: []
summary: 'An attacker sending a single malformed IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee) frame makes the TRÅDFRI
  bulb blink, and if they replay (i.e. resend) the same frame multiple times, the bulb performs
  a factory reset. This causes the bulb to lose configuration information about the Zigbee network
  and current brightness level. After this attack, all lights are on with full brightness, and
  a user cannot control the bulbs with either the IKEA Home Smart app or the TRÅDFRI remote
  control. The malformed Zigbee frame is an unauthenticated broadcast message, which means all
  vulnerable devices within radio range are affected. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 7.1 vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H'
