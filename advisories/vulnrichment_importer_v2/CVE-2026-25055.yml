aliases: []
summary: n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. Prior to versions 1.123.12 and
  2.4.0, when workflows process uploaded files and transfer them to remote servers via the SSH
  node without validating their metadata the vulnerability can lead to files being written to
  unintended locations on those remote systems potentially leading to remote code execution
  on those systems. As a prerequisites an unauthenticated attacker needs knowledge of such workflows
  existing and the endpoints for file uploads need to be unauthenticated. This issue has been
  patched in versions 1.123.12 and 2.4.0.
