aliases: []
summary: vantage6 is an open source framework built to enable, manage and deploy privacy enhancing
  technologies like Federated Learning and Multi-Party Computation. Much like GHSA-45gq-q4xh-cp53,
  it is possible to find which usernames exist in vantage6 by calling the API routes `/recover/lost`
  and `/2fa/lost`. These routes send emails to users if they have lost their password or MFA
  token. This issue has been addressed in commit `aecfd6d0e` and is expected to ship in subsequent
  releases. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as a new release is available. There are no
  known workarounds for this vulnerability.
