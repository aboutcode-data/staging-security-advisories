summary: The Short URL plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions
  up to, and including, 1.6.8. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the configuration_page
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add and import redirects,
  including comments containing cross-site scripting as detailed in CVE-2023-1602, granted they
  can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
