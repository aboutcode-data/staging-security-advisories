aliases: []
summary: Piccolo is an ORM and query builder which supports asyncio. In versions 0.120.0 and
  prior, the implementation of `BaseUser.login` leaks enough information to a malicious user
  such that they would be able to successfully generate a list of valid users on the platform.
  As Piccolo on its own does not also enforce strong passwords, these lists of valid accounts
  are likely to be used in a password spray attack with the outcome being attempted takeover
  of user accounts on the platform. The impact of this vulnerability is minor as it requires
  chaining with other attack vectors in order to gain more then simply a list of valid users
  on the underlying platform. The likelihood of this vulnerability is possible as it requires
  minimal skills to pull off, especially given the underlying login functionality for Piccolo
  based sites is open source. This issue has been patched in version 0.121.0.
