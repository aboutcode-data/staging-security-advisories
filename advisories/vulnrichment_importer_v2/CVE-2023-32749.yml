aliases: []
summary: Pydio Cells allows users by default to create so-called external users in order to
  share files with them. By modifying the HTTP request sent when creating such an external user,
  it is possible to assign the new user arbitrary roles. By assigning all roles to a newly created
  user, access to all cells and non-personal workspaces is granted.
