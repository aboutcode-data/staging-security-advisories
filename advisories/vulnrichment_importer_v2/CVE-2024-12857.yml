aliases: []
summary: The AdForest theme for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions
  up to, and including, 5.1.8. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a user's identity
  prior to logging them in as that user. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to authenticate as any user as long as they have configured OTP login by phone number.
