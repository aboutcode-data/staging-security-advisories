aliases: []
summary: 'In wolfSSL before 5.5.1, malicious clients can cause a buffer overflow during a TLS
  1.3 handshake. This occurs when an attacker supposedly resumes a previous TLS session. During
  the resumption Client Hello a Hello Retry Request must be triggered. Both Client Hellos are
  required to contain a list of duplicate cipher suites to trigger the buffer overflow. In total,
  two Client Hellos have to be sent: one in the resumed session, and a second one as a response
  to a Hello Retry Request message.'
