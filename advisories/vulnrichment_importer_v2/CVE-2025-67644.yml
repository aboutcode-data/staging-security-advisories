aliases: []
summary: LangGraph SQLite Checkpoint is an implementation of LangGraph CheckpointSaver that
  uses SQLite DB (both sync and async, via aiosqlite). Versions 3.0.0 and below are vulnerable
  to SQL injection through the checkpoint implementation. Checkpoint allows attackers to manipulate
  SQL queries through metadata filter keys, affecting applications that accept untrusted metadata
  filter keys (not just filter values) in checkpoint search operations. The _metadata_predicate()
  function constructs SQL queries by interpolating filter keys directly into f-strings without
  validation. This issue is fixed in version 3.0.1.
