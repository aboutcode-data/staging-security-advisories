aliases: []
summary: PrivateBin is an online pastebin where the server has zero knowledge of pasted data.
  Starting in version 1.7.7 and prior to version 2.0.3, an unauthenticated Local File Inclusion
  exists in the template-switching feature. If `templateselection` is enabled in the configuration,
  the server trusts the `template` cookie and includes the referenced PHP file. An attacker
  can read sensitive data or, if they manage to drop a PHP file elsewhere, gain remote code
  execution. The constructed path of the template file is checked for existence, then included.
  For PrivateBin project files this does not leak any secrets due to data files being created
  with PHP code that prevents execution, but if a configuration file without that line got created
  or the visitor figures out the relative path to a PHP script that directly performs an action
  without appropriate privilege checking, those might execute or leak information. The issue
  has been patched in version 2.0.3. As a workaround, set `templateselection = false` (which
  is the default) in `cfg/conf.php` or remove it entirely
