aliases: []
summary: Tauri is a framework for building binaries for all major desktop platforms. Due to
  missing canonicalization when `readDir` is called recursively, it was possible to display
  directory listings outside of the defined `fs` scope. This required a crafted symbolic link
  or junction folder inside an allowed path of the `fs` scope. No arbitrary file content could
  be leaked. The issue has been resolved in version 1.0.6 and the implementation now properly
  checks if the requested (sub) directory is a symbolic link outside of the defined `scope`.
  Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable the `readDir` endpoint
  in the `allowlist` inside the `tauri.conf.json`.
