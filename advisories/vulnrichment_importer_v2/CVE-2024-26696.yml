  nilfs2: fix hang in nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers()

  Syzbot reported a hang issue in migrate_pages_batch() called by mbind()
  and nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() called in the log writer of nilfs2.

  While migrate_pages_batch() locks a folio and waits for the writeback to
  complete, the log writer thread that should bring the writeback to
  completion picks up the folio being written back in
  nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() that it calls for subsequent log
  creation and was trying to lock the folio.  Thus causing a deadlock.

  In the first place, it is unexpected that folios/pages in the middle of
  writeback will be updated and become dirty.  Nilfs2 adds a checksum to
  verify the validity of the log being written and uses it for recovery at
  mount, so data changes during writeback are suppressed.  Since this is
  broken, an unclean shutdown could potentially cause recovery to fail.

  Investigation revealed that the root cause is that the wait for writeback
  completion in nilfs_page_mkwrite() is conditional, and if the backing
  device does not require stable writes, data may be modified without
  waiting.

  Fix these issues by making nilfs_page_mkwrite() wait for writeback to
  finish regardless of the stable write requirement of the backing device.
