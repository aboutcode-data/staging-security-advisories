  scsi: pm8001: Fix use-after-free for aborted SSP/STP sas_task

  Currently a use-after-free may occur if a sas_task is aborted by the upper
  layer before we handle the I/O completion in mpi_ssp_completion() or
  mpi_sata_completion().

  In this case, the following are the two steps in handling those I/O
  completions:

   - Call complete() to inform the upper layer handler of completion of
     the I/O.

   - Release driver resources associated with the sas_task in
     pm8001_ccb_task_free() call.

  When complete() is called, the upper layer may free the sas_task. As such,
  we should not touch the associated sas_task afterwards, but we do so in the
  pm8001_ccb_task_free() call.

  Fix by swapping the complete() and pm8001_ccb_task_free() calls ordering.
