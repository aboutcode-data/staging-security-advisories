summary: The WP Custom Cursors WordPress plugin before 3.0.1 does not have CSRF check in place
  when creating and editing cursors, which could allow attackers to made a logged in admin perform
  such actions via CSRF attacks. Furthermore, due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping in
  some of the cursor options, it could also lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
