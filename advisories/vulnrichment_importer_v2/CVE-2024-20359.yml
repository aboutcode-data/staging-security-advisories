aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in a legacy capability that allowed for the preloading of VPN clients\
  \ and plug-ins and that has been available in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software\
  \ and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker\
  \ to execute arbitrary code with root-level privileges. Administrator-level privileges are\
  \ required to exploit this vulnerability.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper validation\
  \ of a file when it is read from system flash memory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by copying a crafted file to the disk0: file system of an affected device. A successful\
  \ exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device after\
  \ the next reload of the device, which could alter system behavior. Because the injected code\
  \ could persist across device reboots, Cisco has raised the Security Impact Rating (SIR) of\
  \ this advisory from Medium to High."
