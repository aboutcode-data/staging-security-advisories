aliases: []
summary: The Backup and Staging by WP Time Capsule plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
  file uploads due to missing file type validation in the the UploadHandler.php file and no
  direct file access prevention in all versions up to, and including, 1.22.21. This makes it
  possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server
  which may make remote code execution possible.
