summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: aspeed:\
  \ Fix memory overwrite if timing is 1600x900\n\nWhen capturing 1600x900, system could crash\
  \ when system memory usage is\ntight.\n\nThe way to reproduce this issue:\n1. Use 1600x900\
  \ to display on host\n2. Mount ISO through 'Virtual media' on OpenBMC's web\n3. Run script\
  \ as below on host to do sha continuously\n  #!/bin/bash\n  while [ [1] ];\n  do\n\tfind /media\
  \ -type f -printf '\"%h/%f\"\\n' | xargs sha256sum\n  done\n4. Open KVM on OpenBMC's web\n\
  \nThe size of macro block captured is 8x8. Therefore, we should make sure\nthe height of src-buf\
  \ is 8 aligned to fix this issue."
