aliases: []
summary: A Local File Inclusion vulnerability exists in parisneo/lollms-webui versions below
  v9.8. The vulnerability is due to unverified path concatenation in the `serve_js` function
  in `app.py`, which allows attackers to perform path traversal attacks. This can lead to unauthorized
  access to arbitrary files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive information such as
  private SSH keys, configuration files, and source code.
