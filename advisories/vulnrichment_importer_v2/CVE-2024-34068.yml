aliases: []
summary: Pterodactyl wings is the server control plane for Pterodactyl Panel. An authenticated
  user who has access to a game server is able to bypass the previously implemented access control
  (GHSA-6rg3-8h8x-5xfv) that prevents accessing internal endpoints of the node hosting Wings
  in the pull endpoint. This would allow malicious users to potentially access resources on
  local networks that would otherwise be inaccessible. This issue has been addressed in version
  1.11.2 and users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may enable the `api.disable_remote_download`
  option as a workaround.
