aliases: []
summary: corydolphin/flask-cors version 4.01 contains a vulnerability where the request path
  matching is case-insensitive due to the use of the `try_match` function, which is originally
  intended for matching hosts. This results in a mismatch because paths in URLs are case-sensitive,
  but the regex matching treats them as case-insensitive. This misconfiguration can lead to
  significant security vulnerabilities, allowing unauthorized origins to access paths meant
  to be restricted, resulting in data exposure and potential data leaks.
