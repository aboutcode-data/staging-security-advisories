aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Multicast VPN (MVPN) implementation
  of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a BGP session
  to repeatedly reset, causing a partial denial of service (DoS) condition due to the BGP session
  being down. The vulnerability is due to incorrect parsing of a specific type of BGP MVPN update
  message. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending this BGP MVPN update message
  to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the BGP peer
  connections to reset, which could lead to BGP route instability and impact traffic. The incoming
  BGP MVPN update message is valid but is parsed incorrectly by the NX-OS device, which could
  send a corrupted BGP update to the configured BGP peer. Note: The Cisco implementation of
  BGP accepts incoming BGP traffic from only explicitly configured peers. To exploit this vulnerability,
  an attacker must send a specific BGP MVPN update message over an established TCP connection
  that appears to come from a trusted BGP peer. To do so, the attacker must obtain information
  about the BGP peers in the trusted network of the affected system.'
