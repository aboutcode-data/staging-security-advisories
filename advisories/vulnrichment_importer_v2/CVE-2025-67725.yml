aliases: []
summary: Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library. In versions
  6.5.2 and below, a single maliciously crafted HTTP request can block the server's event loop
  for an extended period, caused by the HTTPHeaders.add method. The function accumulates values
  using string concatenation when the same header name is repeated, causing a Denial of Service
  (DoS).  Due to Python string immutability, each concatenation copies the entire string, resulting
  in O(n²) time complexity. The severity can vary from high if max_header_size has been increased
  from its default, to low if it has its default value of 64KB. This issue is fixed in version
  6.5.3.
