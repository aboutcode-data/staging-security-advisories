aliases: []
summary: Exos 9300 instances are using a randomly generated database password to connect to
  the configured MSSQL server. The password is derived from static random values, which are
  concatenated to the hostname and a random string that can be read by every user from the registry.
  This allows an attacker to derive the database password and get authenticated access to the
  central exos 9300 database as the user Exos9300Common. The user has the roles ExosDialog and
  ExosDialogDotNet assigned, which are able to read most tables of the database as well as update
  and insert into many tables.
