summary: With physical access to the device and enough time an attacker can desolder the flash
  memory, modify it and then reinstall it because of missing encryption. Thus, essential files,
  such as "/etc/passwd", as well as stored certificates, cryptographic keys, stored PINs and
  so on can be modified and read, in order to gain SSH root access on the Linux-based K7 model.
  On the Windows CE based K5 model, the password for the Access Manager can additionally be
  read in plain text from the stored SQLite database.
