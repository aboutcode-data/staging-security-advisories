aliases: []
summary: "The Versa Director SD-WAN orchestration platform includes a Webhook feature for sending\
  \ notifications to external HTTP endpoints. However, the \"Add Webhook\" and \"Test Webhook\"\
  \ functionalities can be abused by an authenticated user to send crafted HTTP requests to\
  \ localhost. This can be leveraged to execute commands on behalf of the versa user, who has\
  \ sudo privileges, potentially leading to privilege escalation or remote code execution. \
  \ \r\n \r\nExploitation Status: \r\n\r\nVersa Networks is not aware of any reported instance\
  \ where this vulnerability was exploited. Proof of concept for this vulnerability has been\
  \ disclosed by third party security researchers.  \r\n\r\nWorkarounds or Mitigation: \r\n\r\
  \nThere are no workarounds to disable the GUI option. Versa recommends that Director be upgraded\
  \ to one of the remediated software versions."
