  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  xfs: fix log recovery buffer allocation for the legacy h_size fixup

  Commit a70f9fe52daa ("xfs: detect and handle invalid iclog size set by
  mkfs") added a fixup for incorrect h_size values used for the initial
  umount record in old xfsprogs versions.  Later commit 0c771b99d6c9
  ("xfs: clean up calculation of LR header blocks") cleaned up the log
  reover buffer calculation, but stoped using the fixed up h_size value
  to size the log recovery buffer, which can lead to an out of bounds
  access when the incorrect h_size does not come from the old mkfs
  tool, but a fuzzer.

  Fix this by open coding xlog_logrec_hblks and taking the fixed h_size
  into account for this calculation.
