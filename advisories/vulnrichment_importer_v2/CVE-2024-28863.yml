aliases: []
summary: node-tar is a Tar for Node.js. node-tar prior to version 6.2.1 has no limit on the
  number of sub-folders created in the folder creation process. An attacker who generates a
  large number of sub-folders can consume memory on the system running node-tar and even crash
  the Node.js client within few seconds of running it using a path with too many sub-folders
  inside. Version 6.2.1 fixes this issue by preventing extraction in excessively deep sub-folders.
