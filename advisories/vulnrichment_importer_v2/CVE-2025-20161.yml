summary: "A vulnerability in the software upgrade process of Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches\
  \ and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode could allow an authenticated,\
  \ local attacker with valid Administrator credentials to execute a command injection attack\
  \ on the underlying operating system of an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due\
  \ to insufficient validation of specific elements within a software image. An attacker could\
  \ exploit this vulnerability by installing a crafted image. A successful exploit could allow\
  \ the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with root\
  \ privileges.&nbsp;\r\nNote: Administrators should validate the hash of any software image\
  \ before installation."
