aliases: []
summary: OpenEMR is a free and open source electronic health records and medical practice management
  application. Prior to version 8.0.0, a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the GAD-7
  anxiety assessment form allows authenticated users with clinician privileges to inject malicious
  JavaScript that executes when other users view the form. This enables session hijacking, account
  takeover, and privilege escalation from clinician to administrator. Version 8.0.0 fixes the
  issue.
