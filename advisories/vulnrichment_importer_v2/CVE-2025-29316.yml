aliases: []
summary: 'An issue in DataPatrol Screenshot watermark, printing watermark agent v.3.5.2.0 allows
  a physically proximate attacker to obtain sensitive information. NOTE: the Supplier disputes
  the Print Job Watermark Bypass claim because the watermark is added by hooking into the OS
  printing mechanism, and thus is not supposed to be visible when previewing a "generated printout"
  on screen. The Supplier disputes the Screenshot Watermark Bypass claim because the product''s
  documentation explains the step of setting Developer Tools to Disallowed through AD Group
  Policy.'
