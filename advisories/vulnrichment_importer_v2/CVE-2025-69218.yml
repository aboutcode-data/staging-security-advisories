aliases: []
summary: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. In versions prior to 3.5.4, 2025.11.2,
  2025.12.1, and 2026.1.0, moderators can access the `top_uploads` admin report which should
  be restricted to admins only. This report displays direct URLs to all uploaded files on the
  site, including sensitive content such as user data exports, admin backups, and other private
  attachments that moderators should not have access to. This issue is patched in versions 3.5.4,
  2025.11.2, 2025.12.1, and 2026.1.0. There is no workaround. Limit moderator privileges to
  trusted users until the patch is applied.
