aliases: []
summary: On affected platforms running Arista EOS with SNMP configured, if “snmp-server transmit
  max-size” is configured, under some circumstances a specially crafted packet can cause the
  snmpd process to leak memory. This may result in the snmpd process being terminated (causing
  SNMP requests to time out until snmpd is restarted) and memory pressure for other processes
  on the switch. Increased memory pressure can cause processes other than snmpd to be at risk
  for unexpected termination as well.
