aliases: []
summary: Dify is an open-source LLM app development platform. Prior to version 1.11.0, the API
  key is exposed in plaintext to the frontend, allowing non-administrator users to view and
  reuse it. This can lead to unauthorized access to third-party services, potentially consuming
  limited quotas. Version 1.11.0 fixes the issue.
