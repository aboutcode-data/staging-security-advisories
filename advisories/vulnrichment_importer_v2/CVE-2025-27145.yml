aliases: []
summary: copyparty, a portable file server, has a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability
  in versions prior to 1.16.15. The vulnerability is considered low-risk. By handing someone
  a maliciously-named file, and then tricking them into dragging the file into copyparty's Web-UI,
  an attacker could execute arbitrary javascript with the same privileges as that user. For
  example, this could give unintended read-access to files owned by that user. The bug is triggered
  by the drag-drop action itself; it is not necessary to actually initiate the upload. The file
  must be empty (zero bytes). Note that, as a general-purpose webserver, it is intentionally
  possible to upload HTML-files with arbitrary javascript in `<script>` tags, which will execute
  when the file is opened. The difference is that this vulnerability would trigger execution
  of javascript during the act of uploading, and not when the uploaded file was opened. Version
  1.16.15 contains a fix.
