aliases: []
summary: 'silverstripe-omnipay is a SilverStripe integration with Omnipay PHP payments library.
  For a subset of Omnipay gateways (those that use intermediary states like `isNotification()`
  or `isRedirect()`), if the payment identifier or success URL is exposed it is possible for
  payments to be prematurely marked as completed without payment being taken. This is mitigated
  by the fact that most payment gateways hide this information from users, however some issuing
  banks offer flawed 3DSecure implementations that may inadvertently expose this data. The following
  versions have been patched to fix this issue: `2.5.2`, `3.0.2`, `3.1.4`, and `3.2.1`. There
  are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.'
