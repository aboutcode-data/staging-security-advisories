aliases: []
summary: The LoginPress Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all
  versions up to, and including, 5.0.1. This is due to insufficient verification on the user
  being returned by the social login token. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access
  to the email and the user does not have an already-existing account for the service returning
  the token.
