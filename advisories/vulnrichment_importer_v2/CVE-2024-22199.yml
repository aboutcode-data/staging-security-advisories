summary: This package provides universal methods to use multiple template engines with the Fiber
  web framework using the Views interface. This vulnerability specifically impacts web applications
  that render user-supplied data through this template engine, potentially leading to the execution
  of malicious scripts in users' browsers when visiting affected web pages. The vulnerability
  has been addressed, the template engine now defaults to having autoescape set to `true`, effectively
  mitigating the risk of XSS attacks.
