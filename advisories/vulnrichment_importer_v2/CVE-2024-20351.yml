aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the TCP/IP traffic handling function of the Snort Detection Engine\
  \ of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software and Cisco FirePOWER Services could allow\
  \ an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause legitimate network traffic to be dropped, resulting\
  \ in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to the improper\
  \ handling of TCP/IP network traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending\
  \ a large amount of TCP/IP network traffic through the affected device. A successful exploit\
  \ could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco FTD device to drop network traffic, resulting\
  \ in a DoS condition. The affected device must be rebooted to resolve the DoS condition."
