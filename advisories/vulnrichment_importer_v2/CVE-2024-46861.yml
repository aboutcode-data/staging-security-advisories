summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  usbnet: ipheth: do not stop RX on failing RX callback

  RX callbacks can fail for multiple reasons:

  * Payload too short
  * Payload formatted incorrecly (e.g. bad NCM framing)
  * Lack of memory

  None of these should cause the driver to seize up.

  Make such failures non-critical and continue processing further
  incoming URBs.
