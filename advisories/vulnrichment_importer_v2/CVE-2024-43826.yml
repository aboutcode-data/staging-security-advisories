summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  nfs: pass explicit offset/count to trace events

  nfs_folio_length is unsafe to use without having the folio locked and a
  check for a NULL ->f_mapping that protects against truncations and can
  lead to kernel crashes.  E.g. when running xfstests generic/065 with
  all nfs trace points enabled.

  Follow the model of the XFS trace points and pass in an explіcit offset
  and length.  This has the additional benefit that these values can
  be more accurate as some of the users touch partial folio ranges.
