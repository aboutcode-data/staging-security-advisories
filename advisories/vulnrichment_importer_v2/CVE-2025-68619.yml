aliases: []
summary: Signal K Server is a server application that runs on a central hub in a boat. Versions
  prior to 2.19.0 of the appstore interface allow administrators to install npm packages through
  a REST API endpoint. While the endpoint validates that the package name exists in the npm
  registry as a known plugin or webapp, the version parameter accepts arbitrary npm version
  specifiers including URLs. npm supports installing packages from git repositories, GitHub
  shorthand syntax, and HTTP/HTTPS URLs pointing to tarballs. When npm installs a package, it
  can automatically execute any `postinstall` script defined in `package.json`, enabling arbitrary
  code execution. The vulnerability exists because npm's version specifier syntax is extremely
  flexible, and the SignalK code passes the version parameter directly to npm without sanitization.
  An attacker with admin access can install a package from an attacker-controlled source containing
  a malicious `postinstall` script. Version 2.19.0 contains a patch for the issue.
