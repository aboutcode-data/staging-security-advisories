summary: A vulnerability in the web-based interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager
  and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (SME) could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to access sensitive information or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.
  The vulnerability is due to improper restrictions on XML entities. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to an affected system that contain references
  in XML entities. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve files from the
  local system, resulting in the disclosure of sensitive information, or cause the application
  to consume available resources, resulting in a DoS condition.
