summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Data Center Network\
  \ Manager (DCNM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view, modify, and delete\
  \ data without proper authorization.\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a failure to limit access\
  \ to resources that are intended for users with Administrator privileges. An attacker could\
  \ exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to click a malicious URL. A successful exploit\
  \ could allow a low-privileged attacker to list, view, create, edit, and delete templates\
  \ in the same manner as a user with Administrator privileges.Cisco has released software updates\
  \ that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
