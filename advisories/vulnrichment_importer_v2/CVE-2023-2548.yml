aliases: []
summary: The RegistrationMagic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object
  References in versions up to, and including, 5.2.0.5. This is due to the plugin providing
  user-controlled access to objects, letting a user bypass authorization and access system resources.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and
  above, to change user passwords and potentially take over super-administrator accounts in
  multisite setup.
