summary: A vulnerability has been identified in SINEMA Remote Connect Server (All versions <
  V3.2 SP4). Affected applications contain private SSL/TLS keys on the server that are not properly
  protected allowing any user with server access to read these keys. This could allow an authenticated
  attacker to impersonate the server potentially enabling man-in-the-middle, traffic decryption
  or unauthorized access to services that trust these certificates.
