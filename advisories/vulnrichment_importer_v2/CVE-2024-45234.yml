aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Fort before 1.6.3. A malicious RPKI repository that descends
  from a (trusted) Trust Anchor can serve (via rsync or RRDP) an ROA or a Manifest containing
  a signedAttrs encoded in non-canonical form. This bypasses Fort's BER decoder, reaching a
  point in the code that panics when faced with data not encoded in DER. Because Fort is an
  RPKI Relying Party, a panic can lead to Route Origin Validation unavailability, which can
  lead to compromised routing.
