aliases: []
summary: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The Grappler optimizer in
  TensorFlow can be used to cause a denial of service by altering a `SavedModel` such that `SafeToRemoveIdentity`
  would trigger `CHECK` failures. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also
  cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range.
