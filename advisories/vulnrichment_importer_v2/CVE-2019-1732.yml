aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Remote Package Manager (RPM) subsystem of Cisco NX-OS Software
  could allow an authenticated, local attacker with administrator credentials to leverage a
  time-of-check, time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition to corrupt local variables, which could
  lead to arbitrary command injection. The vulnerability is due to the lack of a proper locking
  mechanism on critical variables that need to stay static until used. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device and issuing a set of RPM-related
  CLI commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary command injection.
  The attacker would need administrator credentials for the targeted device.
