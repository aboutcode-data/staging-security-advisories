aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) feature of Cisco Nexus 5500, 5600,
  and 6000 Series Switches running Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote
  attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability
  is due to a lack of protection against PTP frame flood attacks. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by sending large streams of malicious IPv4 or IPv6 PTP traffic to the affected
  device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition, impacting
  the traffic passing through the device.
