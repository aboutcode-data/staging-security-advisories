aliases: []
summary: Fleet is open source device management software. In versions prior to 4.78.3, 4.77.1,
  4.76.2, 4.75.2, and 4.53.3, a vulnerability in Fleet's Windows MDM enrollment flow could allow
  an attacker to submit forged authentication tokens that are not properly validated. Because
  JWT signatures were not verified, Fleet could accept attacker-controlled identity claims,
  enabling enrollment of unauthorized devices under arbitrary Azure AD user identities. Versions
  4.78.3, 4.77.1, 4.76.2, 4.75.2, and 4.53.3 fix the issue. If an immediate upgrade is not possible,
  affected Fleet users should temporarily disable Windows MDM.
