aliases: []
summary: Go-Guerrilla SMTP Daemon is a lightweight SMTP server written in Go. Prior to 1.6.7,
  when ProxyOn is enabled, the PROXY command will be accepted multiple times, with later invocations
  overriding earlier ones. The proxy protocol only supports one initial PROXY header; anything
  after that is considered part of the exchange between client and server, so the client is
  free to send further PROXY commands with whatever data it pleases. go-guerrilla will treat
  these as coming from the reverse proxy, allowing a client to spoof its IP address. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 1.6.7.
