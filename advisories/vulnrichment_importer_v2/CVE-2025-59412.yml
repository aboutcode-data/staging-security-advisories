aliases: []
summary: CubeCart is an ecommerce software solution. Prior to version 6.5.11, a vulnerability
  exists in the product reviews feature where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized
  before being displayed. An attacker can submit HTML tags inside the review description field.
  Once the administrator approves the review, the injected HTML is rendered on the product page
  for all visitors. This could be used to redirect users to malicious websites or to display
  unwanted content. This issue has been patched in version 6.5.11.
