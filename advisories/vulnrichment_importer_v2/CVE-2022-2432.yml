summary: The Ecwid Ecommerce Shopping Cart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 6.10.23. This is due to missing or incorrect

  attackers to update plugin options granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
  an action such as clicking on a link.
