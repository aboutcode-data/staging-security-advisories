aliases: []
summary: "A denial of service vulnerability exists in self-hosted Next.js applications that\
  \ have `remotePatterns` configured for the Image Optimizer. The image optimization endpoint\
  \ (`/_next/image`) loads external images entirely into memory without enforcing a maximum\
  \ size limit, allowing an attacker to cause out-of-memory conditions by requesting optimization\
  \ of arbitrarily large images. This vulnerability requires that `remotePatterns` is configured\
  \ to allow image optimization from external domains and that the attacker can serve or control\
  \ a large image on an allowed domain.\r\n\r\nStrongly consider upgrading to 15.5.10 or 16.1.5\
  \ to reduce risk and prevent availability issues in Next applications."
