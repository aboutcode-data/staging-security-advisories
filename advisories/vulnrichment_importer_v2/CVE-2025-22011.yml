  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ARM: dts: bcm2711: Fix xHCI power-domain

  During s2idle tests on the Raspberry CM4 the VPU firmware always crashes
  on xHCI power-domain resume:

  root@raspberrypi:/sys/power# echo freeze > state
  [   70.724347] xhci_suspend finished
  [   70.727730] xhci_plat_suspend finished
  [   70.755624] bcm2835-power bcm2835-power: Power grafx off
  [   70.761127]  USB: Set power to 0

  [   74.653040]  USB: Failed to set power to 1 (-110)

  This seems to be caused because of the mixed usage of
  raspberrypi-power and bcm2835-power at the same time. So avoid
  the usage of the VPU firmware power-domain driver, which
  prevents the VPU crash.
