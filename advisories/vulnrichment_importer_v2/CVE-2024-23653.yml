aliases: []
summary: BuildKit is a toolkit for converting source code to build artifacts in an efficient,
  expressive and repeatable manner. In addition to running containers as build steps, BuildKit
  also provides APIs for running interactive containers based on built images. It was possible
  to use these APIs to ask BuildKit to run a container with elevated privileges. Normally, running
  such containers is only allowed if special `security.insecure` entitlement is enabled both
  by buildkitd configuration and allowed by the user initializing the build request. The issue
  has been fixed in v0.12.5 . Avoid using BuildKit frontends from untrusted sources.
