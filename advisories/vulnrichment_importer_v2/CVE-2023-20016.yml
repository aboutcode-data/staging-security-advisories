aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the backup configuration feature of Cisco UCS Manager Software and
  in the configuration export feature of Cisco FXOS Software could allow an unauthenticated
  attacker with access to a backup file to decrypt sensitive information stored in the full
  state and configuration backup files. This vulnerability is due to a weakness in the encryption
  method used for the backup function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by leveraging
  a static key used for the backup configuration feature. A successful exploit could allow the
  attacker to decrypt sensitive information that is stored in full state and configuration backup
  files, such as local user credentials, authentication server passwords, Simple Network Management
  Protocol (SNMP) community names, and other credentials.
