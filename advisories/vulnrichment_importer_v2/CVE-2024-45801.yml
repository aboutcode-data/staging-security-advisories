aliases: []
summary: DOMPurify is a DOM-only, super-fast, uber-tolerant XSS sanitizer for HTML, MathML and
  SVG. It has been discovered that malicious HTML using special nesting techniques can bypass
  the depth checking added to DOMPurify in recent releases. It was also possible to use Prototype
  Pollution to weaken the depth check. This renders dompurify unable to avoid cross site scripting
  (XSS) attacks. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.5.4 and 3.1.3 of DOMPurify. All
  users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
