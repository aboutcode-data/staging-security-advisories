summary: "A vulnerability in the SFTP server implementation for Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches\
  \ and 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode could allow an authenticated, remote attacker\
  \ to download or overwrite files from the underlying operating system of an affected device.\
  \ \r\n\r This vulnerability is due to a logic error when verifying the user role when an SFTP\
  \ connection is opened to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by connecting and authenticating via SFTP as a valid, non-administrator user. A successful\
  \ exploit could allow the attacker to read or overwrite files from the underlying operating\
  \ system with the privileges of the authenticated user.\r\n\r   There are workarounds that\
  \ address this vulnerability."
