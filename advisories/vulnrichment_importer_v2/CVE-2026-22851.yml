aliases: []
summary: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. Prior to 3.20.1, a
  race condition between the RDPGFX dynamic virtual channel thread and the SDL render thread
  leads to a heap use-after-free. Specifically, an escaped pointer to sdl->primary (SDL_Surface)
  is accessed after it has been freed during RDPGFX ResetGraphics handling. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 3.20.1.
