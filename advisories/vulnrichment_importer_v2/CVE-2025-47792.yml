summary: Nextcloud Desktop is the desktop sync client for Nextcloud. In versions of Nextcloud
  Desktop prior to 3.15, 3rdparty applications already installed on a user machine can create

  to an external service. Nextcloud Desktop fixes the issue in version 3.15. No known workarounds
  are available.
