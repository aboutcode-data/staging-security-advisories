  drm: Fix use-after-free read in drm_getunique()

  There is a time-of-check-to-time-of-use error in drm_getunique() due
  to retrieving file_priv->master prior to locking the device's master
  mutex.

  An example can be seen in the crash report of the use-after-free error
  found by Syzbot:
  https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?id=148d2f1dfac64af52ffd27b661981a540724f803

  In the report, the master pointer was used after being freed. This is
  because another process had acquired the device's master mutex in
  drm_setmaster_ioctl(), then overwrote fpriv->master in
  drm_new_set_master(). The old value of fpriv->master was subsequently
  freed before the mutex was unlocked.

  To fix this, we lock the device's master mutex before retrieving the
  pointer from from fpriv->master. This patch passes the Syzbot
  reproducer test.
