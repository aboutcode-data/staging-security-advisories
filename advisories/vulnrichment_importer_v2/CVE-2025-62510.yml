aliases: []
summary: FileRise is a self-hosted web-based file manager with multi-file upload, editing, and
  batch operations. In version 1.4.0, a regression allowed folder visibility/ownership to be
  inferred from folder names. Low-privilege users could see or interact with folders matching
  their username and, in some cases, other users’ content. This issue has been patched in version
  1.5.0, where it introduces explicit per-folder ACLs (owners/read/write/share/read_own) and
  strict server-side checks across list, read, write, share, rename, copy/move, zip, and WebDAV
  paths.
