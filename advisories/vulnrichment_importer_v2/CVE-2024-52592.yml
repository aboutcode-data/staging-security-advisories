aliases: []
summary: Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. In affected versions missing
  validation in `ApInboxService.update` allows an attacker to modify the result of polls belonging
  to another user. No authentication is required, except for a valid signature from any actor
  on any remote instance. Vulnerable Misskey instances will accept spoofed updates for remote
  polls. Local polls are unaffected. This issue has been addressed in version 2024.11.0-alpha.3.
  Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
