aliases: []
summary: 'OpenBao is an open source identity-based secrets management system. Prior to version
  2.4.4, a privileged operator could use the identity group subsystem to add a root policy to
  a group identity group, escalating their or another user''s permissions in the system. Specifically
  this is an issue when: an operator in the root namespace has access to identity/groups endpoints
  and an operator does not have policy access. Otherwise, an operator with policy access could
  create or modify an existing policy to grant root-equivalent permissions through the sudo
  capability. This issue has been patched in version 2.4.4.'
