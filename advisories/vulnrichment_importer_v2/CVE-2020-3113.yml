aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Data Center Network
  Manager (DCNM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface. The vulnerability is due
  to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An
  attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a
  crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code
  in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
