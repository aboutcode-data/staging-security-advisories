aliases: []
summary: umatiGateway is software for connecting OPC Unified Architecture servers with an MQTT
  broker utilizing JSON messages. The user interface may possibly be publicly accessible with
  umatiGateway's provided docker-compose file. With this access, the configuration can be viewed
  and altered. Commit 5d81a3412bc0051754a3095d89a06d6d743f2b16 uses `127.0.0.1:8080:8080` to
  limit access to the local network. For those who are unable to use this proposed patch, a
  firewall on Port 8080 may block remote access, but the workaround may not be perfect because
  Docker may also bypass a firewall by its iptable based rules for port forwarding.
