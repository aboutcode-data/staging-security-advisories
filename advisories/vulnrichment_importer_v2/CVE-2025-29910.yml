summary: CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security
  Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running
  the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. A memory leak vulnerability was identified
  in the `crypto_handle_incrementing_nontransmitted_counter` function of CryptoLib versions
  1.3.3 and prior. This vulnerability can lead to resource exhaustion and degraded system performance
  over time, particularly in long-running processes or systems processing large volumes of data.
  The vulnerability is present in the `crypto_handle_incrementing_nontransmitted_counter` function
  within `crypto_tc.c`. The function allocates memory using `malloc` without ensuring the allocated
  memory is always freed. This issue can lead to resource exhaustion, reduced system performance,
  and potentially a Denial of Service (DoS) in environments where CryptoLib is used in long-running
  processes or with large volumes of data. Any system using CryptoLib, especially those handling
  high-throughput or continuous data streams, could be impacted. As of time of publication,
  no known patched versions are available.
