aliases: []
summary: The WP Directory Kit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in versions up to, and including, 1.1.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the 'insert' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the
  plugin's settings and inject malicious JavaScript via a forged request, granted they can trick
  a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
