summary: 'Unspecified vulnerability in the expand_stack function in grsecurity PaX allows local
  users to gain privileges via unspecified vectors. NOTE: the grsecurity developer has disputed
  this issue, stating that "the function they claim the vulnerability to be in is a trivial
  function, which can, and has been, easily checked for any supposed vulnerabilities."  The
  developer also cites a past disclosure that was not proven.  As of 20070120, the original
  researcher has released demonstration code'
