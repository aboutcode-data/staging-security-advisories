  HID: amd_sfh: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference

  devm_add_action_or_reset() can suddenly invoke amd_mp2_pci_remove() at
  registration that will cause NULL pointer dereference since
  corresponding data is not initialized yet. The patch moves
  initialization of data before devm_add_action_or_reset().

  Found by Linux Driver Verification project (linuxtesting.org).
