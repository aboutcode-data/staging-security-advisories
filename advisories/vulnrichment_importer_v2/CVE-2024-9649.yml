aliases: []
summary: The WP ULike – The Ultimate Engagement Toolkit for Websites plugin for WordPress is
  vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.7.4. This
  is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wp_ulike_delete_history_api() function.
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete engagements via a forged request
  granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on
  a link.
