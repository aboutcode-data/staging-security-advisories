aliases: []
summary: 'EmpowerID before 7.205.0.1 allows an attacker to bypass an MFA (multi factor authentication)
  requirement if the first factor (username and password) is known, because the first factor
  is sufficient to change an account''s email address, and the product would then send MFA codes
  to the new email address (which may be attacker-controlled). NOTE: this is different from
  CVE-2023-4177, which claims to be about "some unknown processing of the component Multi-Factor
  Authentication Code Handler" and thus cannot be correlated with other vulnerability information.'
