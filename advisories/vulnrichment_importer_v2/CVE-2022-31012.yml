aliases: []
summary: Git for Windows is a fork of Git that contains Windows-specific patches. This vulnerability
  in versions prior to 2.37.1 lets Git for Windows' installer execute a binary into `C:\mingw64\bin\git.exe`
  by mistake. This only happens upon a fresh install, not when upgrading Git for Windows. A
  patch is included in version 2.37.1. Two workarounds are available. Create the `C:\mingw64`
  folder and remove read/write access from this folder, or disallow arbitrary authenticated
  users to create folders in `C:\`.
