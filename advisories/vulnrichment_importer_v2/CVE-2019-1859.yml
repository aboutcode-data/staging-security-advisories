aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Secure Shell (SSH) authentication process of Cisco Small Business
  Switches software could allow an attacker to bypass client-side certificate authentication
  and revert to password authentication. The vulnerability exists because OpenSSH mishandles
  the authentication process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to
  connect to the device via SSH. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the
  configuration as an administrative user if the default credentials are not changed. There
  are no workarounds available; however, if client-side certificate authentication is enabled,
  disable it and use strong password authentication. Client-side certificate authentication
  is disabled by default.
