aliases: []
summary: Medtronic identified that the Pelvic Health clinician apps, which are installed on
  the Smart Programmer mobile device, have a password vulnerability that requires a security
  update to fix. Not updating could potentially result in unauthorized control of the clinician
  therapy application, which has greater control over therapy parameters than the patient app.  Changes
  still cannot be made outside of the established therapy parameters of the programmer.  For
  unauthorized access to occur, an individual would need physical access to the Smart Programmer.
