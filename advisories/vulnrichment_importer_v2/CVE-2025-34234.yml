aliases: []
summary: Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host prior to version 25.1.102
  and Application prior to version 25.1.1413 (VA/SaaS deployments) contain two hardcoded private
  keys that are shipped in the application containers (printerlogic/pi, printerlogic/printer-admin-api,
  and printercloud/pi). The keys are stored in clear text under /var/www/app/config/ as keyfile.ppk.dev
  and keyfile.saasid.ppk.dev. The application uses these keys as the symmetric secret for AES‑256‑CBC
  encryption/decryption of the “SaaS Id” (external identifier) through the getEncryptedExternalId()
  / getDecryptedExternalId() methods. Because the secret is embedded in the deployed image,
  any attacker who can obtain a copy of the Docker image, read the configuration files, or otherwise
  enumerate the filesystem can recover the encryption key. This vulnerability has been confirmed
  to be remediated, but it is unclear as to when the patch was introduced.
