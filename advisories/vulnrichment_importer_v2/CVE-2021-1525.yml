aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Meetings and Cisco Webex Meetings Server could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to redirect users to a malicious file. This vulnerability
  is due to improper validation of URL paths in the application interface. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a specially crafted URL that is
  designed to cause Cisco Webex Meetings to include a remote file in the web UI. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to cause the application to offer a remote file to a user,
  which could allow the attacker to conduct further phishing or spoofing attacks.
