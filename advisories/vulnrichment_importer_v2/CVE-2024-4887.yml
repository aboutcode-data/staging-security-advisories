aliases: []
summary: The Qi Addons For Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.2 via the 'behavior' attributes found in the qi_addons_for_elementor_blog_list
  shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access
  and above, to include remote files on the server, resulting in code execution. Please note
  that this requires an attacker to create a non-existent directory or target an instance where
  file_exists won't return false with a non-existent directory in the path, in order to successfully
  exploit.
