aliases: []
summary: A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the create_conda_env function of the
  parisneo/lollms repository, version 5.9.0. The vulnerability arises from the use of shell=True
  in the subprocess.Popen function, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands by
  manipulating the env_name and python_version parameters. This issue could lead to a serious
  security breach as demonstrated by the ability to execute the 'whoami' command among potentially
  other harmful commands.
