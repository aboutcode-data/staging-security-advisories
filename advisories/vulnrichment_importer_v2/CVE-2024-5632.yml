summary: |
  Longse NVR (Network Video Recorder) model NVR3608PGE2W, as well as products based on this device, create a WiFi network with a default password.
  A user is neither advised to change it during the installation process, nor such a need is described in the manual. As the cameras from the same kit connect automatically, it is very probable for the default password to be left unchanged.
