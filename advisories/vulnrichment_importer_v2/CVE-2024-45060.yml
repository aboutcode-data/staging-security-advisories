datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2024-45060
datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2024/45xxx/CVE-2024-45060.json
aliases: []
summary: PHPSpreadsheet is a pure PHP library for reading and writing spreadsheet files. One
  of the sample scripts in PhpSpreadsheet is susceptible to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
  due to improper handling of input where a number is expected leading to formula injection.
  The code in in `45_Quadratic_equation_solver.php` concatenates the user supplied parameters
  directly into spreadsheet formulas. This allows an attacker to take control over the formula
  and output unsanitized data into the page, resulting in JavaScript execution. This issue has
  been addressed in release versions 1.29.2, 2.1.1, and 2.3.0. All users are advised to upgrade.
  There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
