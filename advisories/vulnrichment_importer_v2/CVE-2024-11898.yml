summary: The Scratch & Win – Giveaways and Contests. Boost subscribers, traffic, repeat visits,  referrals,
  sales and more plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's
  'swin-campaign' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.9 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary
  web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
