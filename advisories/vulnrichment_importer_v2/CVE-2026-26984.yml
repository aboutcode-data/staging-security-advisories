aliases: []
summary: LORIS (Longitudinal Online Research and Imaging System) is a self-hosted web application
  that provides data- and project-management for neuroimaging research. Prior to versions 26.0.5,
  27.0.2, and 28.0.0, an authenticated user with sufficient privileges can exploit a path traversal
  vulnerability to upload a malicious file to an arbitrary location on the server. Once uploaded,
  the file can be used to achieve remote code execution (RCE). An attacker must be authenticated
  and have the appropriate permissions to exploit this issue. If the server is configured as
  read-only, remote code execution (RCE) is not possible; however, the malicious file upload
  may still be achievable. This problem is fixed in LORIS v26.0.5 and above, v27.0.2 and above,
  and v28.0.0 and above. As a workaround, LORIS administrators can disable the media module
  if it is not being used.
