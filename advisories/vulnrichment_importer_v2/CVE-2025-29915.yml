aliases: []
summary: Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention System and Network
  Security Monitoring engine. The AF_PACKET defrag option is enabled by default and allows AF_PACKET
  to re-assemble fragmented packets before reaching Suricata. However the default packet size
  in Suricata is based on the network interface MTU which leads to Suricata seeing truncated
  packets. Upgrade to Suricata 7.0.9, which uses better defaults and adds warnings for user
  configurations that may lead to issues.
