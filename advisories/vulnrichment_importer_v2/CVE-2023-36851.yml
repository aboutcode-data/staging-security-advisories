summary: "A Missing Authentication for Critical Function vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos\
  \ OS on SRX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause limited impact\
  \ to the file system integrity.\n\n\n\nWith a specific request to \n\nwebauth_operation.php\n\
  \nthat doesn't require authentication, an attacker is able to upload and download arbitrary\
  \ files via J-Web, leading to a loss of \n\nintegrity or confidentiality, which may allow\
  \ chaining to other vulnerabilities.\n\n\nThis issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on\
  \ SRX Series:\n\n\n\n  *  \n\n21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S8;\n  *  21.4 \n\nversions prior\
  \ to \n\n21.4R3-S6;\n  *  22.1 \n\nversions prior to \n\n22.1R3-S5;\n  *  22.2 \n\nversions\
  \ prior to \n\n22.2R3-S3;\n  *  22.3 \n\nversions prior to \n\n22.3R3-S2;\n  *  22.4 versions\
