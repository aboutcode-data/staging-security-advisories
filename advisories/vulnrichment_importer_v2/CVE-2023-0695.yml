aliases: []
summary: The Metform Elementor Contact Form Builder for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Scripting by using the 'mf' shortcode to echo unescaped form submissions in versions up to,
  and including, 3.3.0. This allows authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions
  or above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute when the victim visits
  a specific link. Note that getting the JavaScript to execute still requires user interaction
  as the victim must visit a crafted link with the form entry id, but the script itself is stored
  in the site database.
