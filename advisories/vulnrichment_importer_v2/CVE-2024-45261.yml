aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered on certain GL-iNet devices, including MT6000, MT3000, MT2500,
  AXT1800, and AX1800 4.6.2. The SID generated for a specific user is not tied to that user
  itself, which allows other users to potentially use it for authentication. Once an attacker
  bypasses the application's authentication procedures, they can generate a valid SID, escalate
  privileges, and gain full control.
