aliases: []
summary: A remote command injection vulnerability exists in the Barracuda Email Security Gateway
  (appliance form factor only) product effecting versions 5.1.3.001-9.2.0.006. The vulnerability
  arises out of a failure to comprehensively sanitize the processing of .tar file (tape archives). The
  vulnerability stems from incomplete input validation of a user-supplied .tar file as it pertains
  to the names of the files contained within the archive. As a consequence, a remote attacker
  can specifically format these file names in a particular manner that will result in remotely
  executing a system command through Perl's qx operator with the privileges of the Email Security
  Gateway product. This issue was fixed as part of BNSF-36456 patch. This patch was automatically
  applied to all customer appliances.
