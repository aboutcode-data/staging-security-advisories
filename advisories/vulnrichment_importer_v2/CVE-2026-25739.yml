aliases: []
summary: Indico is an event management system that uses Flask-Multipass, a multi-backend authentication
  system for Flask. Versions prior to 3.3.10 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting when uploading
  certain file types as materials. Users should upgrade to version 3.3.10 to receive a patch.
  To apply the fix itself updating is sufficient, but to benefit from the strict Content Security
  Policy (CSP) Indico now applies by default for file downloads, update the webserver config
  in case one uses nginx with Indico's `STATIC_FILE_METHOD` set to `xaccelredirect`. For further
  directions, consult the GitHub Security advisory or Indico setup documentation. Some workarounds
  are available. Use the webserver config to apply a strict CSP for material download endpoints,
  and/or only let trustworthy users create content (including material uploads, which speakers
  can typically do as well) on Indico.
