aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) trap generation for wireless
  clients of the Cisco IOS XE Wireless Controller Software for the Cisco Catalyst 9000 Family
  could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause the device to unexpectedly reload,
  causing a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due
  to the lack of input validation of the information used to generate an SNMP trap in relation
  to a wireless client connection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an
  802.1x packet with crafted parameters during the wireless authentication setup phase of a
  connection. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, causing
  a DoS condition.
