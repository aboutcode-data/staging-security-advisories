aliases: []
summary: Sunway ForceControl version 6.1 SP3 and earlier contains a stack-based buffer overflow
  vulnerability in the SNMP NetDBServer service, which listens on TCP port 2001. The flaw is
  triggered when the service receives a specially crafted packet using opcode 0x57 with an overly
  long payload. Due to improper bounds checking during packet parsing, attacker-controlled data
  overwrites the Structured Exception Handler (SEH), allowing arbitrary code execution in the
  context of the service. This vulnerability can be exploited remotely without authentication
  and may lead to full system compromise on affected Windows hosts.
