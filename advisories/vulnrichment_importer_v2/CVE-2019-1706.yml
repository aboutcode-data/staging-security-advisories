aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the software cryptography module of the Cisco Adaptive Security
  Virtual Appliance (ASAv) and Firepower 2100 Series running Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance
  (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an unexpected reload
  of the device that results in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due
  to a logic error with how the software cryptography module handles IPsec sessions. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by creating and sending traffic in a high number of IPsec
  sessions through the targeted device. A successful exploit could cause the device to reload
  and result in a DoS condition.
