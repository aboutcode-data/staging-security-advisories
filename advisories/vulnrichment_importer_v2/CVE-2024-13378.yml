aliases: []
summary: The Gravity Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the ‘style_settings’ parameter in versions 2.9.0.1 up to, and including, 2.9.1.3 due to
  insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
  an injected page. The attack is only successful in the Chrome web browser, and requires directly
  browsing the media file via the attachment post.
