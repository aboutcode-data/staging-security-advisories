aliases: []
summary: Trend Micro OfficeScan versions 11.0 and XG (12.0) could be exploited by an attacker
  utilizing a directory traversal vulnerability to extract files from an arbitrary zip file
  to a specific folder on the OfficeScan server, which could potentially lead to remote code
  execution (RCE). The remote process execution is bound to a web service account, which depending
  on the web platform used may have restricted permissions. An attempted attack requires user
  authentication.
