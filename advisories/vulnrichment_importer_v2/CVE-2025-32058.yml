aliases: []
summary: |
  The Infotainment ECU manufactured by Bosch uses a RH850 module for CAN communication. RH850 is connected to infotainment over the INC interface through a custom protocol. There is a vulnerability during processing requests of this protocol on the V850 side which allows an attacker with code execution on the infotainment main SoC to perform code execution on the RH850 module and subsequently send arbitrary CAN messages over the connected CAN bus.



  First identified on Nissan Leaf ZE1 manufactured in 2020.
