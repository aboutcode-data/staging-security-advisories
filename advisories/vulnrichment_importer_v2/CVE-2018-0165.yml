aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) packet-processing
  functionality of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to
  exhaust buffers on an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition, aka
  a Memory Leak. The vulnerability is due to the affected software insufficiently processing
  IGMP Membership Query packets that are sent to an affected device. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by sending a large number of IGMP Membership Query packets, which contain
  certain values, to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust
  buffers on the affected device, resulting in a DoS condition that requires the device to be
  reloaded manually. This vulnerability affects: Cisco Catalyst 4500 Switches with Supervisor
  Engine 8-E, if they are running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 3.x.x.E and IP multicast routing
  is configured; Cisco devices that are running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 16.x, if IP multicast
  routing is configured. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCuw09295, CSCve94496.'
