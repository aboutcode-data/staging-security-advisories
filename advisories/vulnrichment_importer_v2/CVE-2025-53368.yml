aliases: []
summary: Citizen is a MediaWiki skin that makes extensions part of the cohesive experience.
  From versions 1.9.4 to before 3.4.0, page descriptions are inserted into raw HTML without
  proper sanitization by the Citizen skin when using the old search bar. Any user with page
  editing privileges can insert cross-site scripting (XSS) payloads into the DOM for other users
  who are searching for specific pages. This issue has been patched in version 3.4.0.
