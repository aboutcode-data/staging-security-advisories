aliases: []
summary: 'Winter is a free, open-source content management system (CMS) based on the Laravel
  PHP framework. Versions of Winter CMS before 1.2.10 allow users with access to the CMS Asset
  Manager were able to upload SVGs without automatic sanitization. To actively exploit this
  security issue, an attacker would need access to the Backend with a user account with the
  following permission: cms.manage_assets. The Winter CMS maintainers strongly recommend that
  the cms.manage_assets permission only be reserved to trusted administrators and developers
  in general. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.2.10.'
