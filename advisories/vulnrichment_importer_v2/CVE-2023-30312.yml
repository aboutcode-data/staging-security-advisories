aliases: []
summary: An issue discovered in OpenWrt 18.06, 19.07, 21.02, 22.03, and beyond allows off-path
  attackers to hijack TCP sessions, which could lead to a denial of service, impersonating the
  client to the server (e.g., for access to files over FTP), and impersonating the server to
  the client (e.g., to deliver false information from a finance website). This occurs because
  nf_conntrack_tcp_no_window_check is true by default.
