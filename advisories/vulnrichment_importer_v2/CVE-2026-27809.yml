aliases: []
summary: psd-tools is a Python package for working with Adobe Photoshop PSD files. Prior to
  version 1.12.2, when a PSD file contains malformed RLE-compressed image data (e.g. a literal
  run that extends past the expected row size), decode_rle() raises ValueError which propagated
  all the way to the user, crashing psd.composite() and psd-tools export. decompress() already
  had a fallback that replaces failed channels with black pixels when result is None, but it
  never triggered because the ValueError from decode_rle() was not caught. The fix in version
  1.12.2 wraps the decode_rle() call in a try/except so the existing fallback handles the error
  gracefully.
