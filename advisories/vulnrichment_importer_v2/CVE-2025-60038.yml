aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability has been identified in Rexroth IndraWorks. This flaw allows an attacker
  to execute arbitrary code on the user's system by parsing a manipulated file containing malicious
  serialized data. Exploitation requires user interaction, specifically opening a specially
  crafted file, which then causes the application to deserialize the malicious data, enabling
  Remote Code Execution (RCE). This can lead to a complete compromise of the system running
  Rexroth IndraWorks.
