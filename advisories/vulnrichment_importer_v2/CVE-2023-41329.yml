aliases: []
summary: WireMock is a tool for mocking HTTP services. The proxy mode of WireMock, can be protected
  by the network restrictions configuration, as documented in Preventing proxying to and recording
  from specific target addresses. These restrictions can be configured using the domain names,
  and in such a case the configuration is vulnerable to the DNS rebinding attacks. A similar
  patch was applied in WireMock 3.0.0-beta-15 for the WireMock Webhook Extensions. The root
  cause of the attack is a defect in the logic which allows for a race condition triggered by
  a DNS server whose address expires in between the initial validation and the outbound network
  request that might go to a domain that was supposed to be prohibited. Control over a DNS service
  is required to exploit this attack, so it has high execution complexity and limited impact.
  This issue has been addressed in version 2.35.1 of wiremock-jre8 and wiremock-jre8-standalone,
  version 3.0.3 of wiremock and wiremock-standalone, version 2.6.1 of the python version of
  wiremock, and versions 2.35.1-1 and 3.0.3-1 of the wiremock/wiremock Docker container. Users
  are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should either configure firewall rules to
  define the list of permitted destinations or to configure WireMock to use IP addresses instead
  of the domain names.
