  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/amd/pm: Update intermediate power state for SI

  Update the current state as boot state during dpm initialization.
  During the subsequent initialization, set_power_state gets called to
  transition to the final power state. set_power_state refers to values
  from the current state and without current state populated, it could
  result in NULL pointer dereference.

  For ex: on platforms where PCI speed change is supported through ACPI
  ATCS method, the link speed of current state needs to be queried before
  deciding on changing to final power state's link speed. The logic to query
  ATCS-support was broken on certain platforms. The issue became visible
  when broken ATCS-support logic got fixed with commit
  f9b7f3703ff9 ("drm/amdgpu/acpi: make ATPX/ATCS structures global (v2)").
