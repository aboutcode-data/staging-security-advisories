aliases: []
summary: 'xdg-open in xdg-utils through 1.2.1 can send requests containing SameSite=Strict cookies,
  which can facilitate CSRF. (For example, xdg-open could be modified to, by default, associate
  x-scheme-handler/https with the execution of a browser with command-line options that arrange
  for an empty cookie store, although this would add substantial complexity, and would not be
  considered a desirable or expected behavior by all users.) NOTE: this is disputed because
  integrations of xdg-open typically do not provide information about whether the xdg-open command
  and arguments were manually entered by a user, or whether they were the result of a navigation
  from content in an untrusted origin.'
