aliases: []
summary: MailEnable versions prior to 10.54 contain a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
  in the Added parameter of /Mondo/lang/sys/Forms/MAI/AddRecipientsResult.aspx. The Added value
  is not properly sanitized when processed via a GET request and is reflected in the response,
  allowing an attacker to break out of existing markup and inject arbitrary script. A remote
  attacker can supply a crafted payload that closes an existing HTML list element, inserts attacker-controlled
  JavaScript, and comments out remaining code, leading to script execution in a victim’s browser
  when the victim visits a malicious link. Successful exploitation can redirect victims to malicious
  sites, steal non-HttpOnly cookies, inject arbitrary HTML or CSS, and perform actions as the
  authenticated user.
