aliases: []
summary: Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform. Starting in version 2.19.0 and
  prior to version 2.44.0, the Email Templating feature uses Jinja2 without proper input sanitization
  or rendering environment restrictions, allowing for Server-Side Template Injection that grants
  Remote Code Execution to privileged users. A privileged user refers to an Admin UI user with
  the default `Owner` or `Contributor` role, who can escalate their access and execute code
  on the underlying Fides Webserver container where the Jinja template rendering function is
  executed. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.44.0`. Users are advised
  to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. There are
  no workarounds.
