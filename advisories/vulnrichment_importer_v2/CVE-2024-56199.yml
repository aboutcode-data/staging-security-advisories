aliases: []
summary: phpMyFAQ is an open source FAQ web application. Starting no later than version 3.2.10
  and prior to version 4.0.2, an attacker can inject malicious HTML content into the FAQ editor
  at `http[:]//localhost/admin/index[.]php?action=editentry`, resulting in a complete disruption
  of the FAQ page's user interface. By injecting malformed HTML elements styled to cover the
  entire screen, an attacker can render the page unusable. This injection manipulates the page
  structure by introducing overlapping buttons, images, and iframes, breaking the intended layout
  and functionality. Exploiting this issue can lead to Denial of Service for legitimate users,
  damage to the user experience, and potential abuse in phishing or defacement attacks. Version
  4.0.2 contains a patch for the vulnerability.
