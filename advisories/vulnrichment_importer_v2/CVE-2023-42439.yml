aliases: []
summary: GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative
  use of geospatial data. A SSRF vulnerability exists starting in version 3.2.0, bypassing existing
  controls on the software. This can allow a user to request internal services for a full read
  SSRF, returning any data from the internal network. The application is using a whitelist,
  but the whitelist can be bypassed. The bypass will trick the application that the first host
  is a whitelisted address, but the browser will use `@` or `%40` as a credential to the host
  geoserver on port 8080, this will return the data to that host on the response. Version 4.1.3.post1
  is the first available version that contains a patch.
