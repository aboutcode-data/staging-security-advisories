aliases: []
summary: Metabase is an open-source business intelligence and analytics platform. Prior to versions
  0.43.7.3, 0.44.7.3, 0.45.4.3, 0.46.6.4, 1.43.7.3, 1.44.7.3, 1.45.4.3, and 1.46.6.4, a vulnerability
  could potentially allow remote code execution on one's Metabase server. The core issue is
  that one of the supported data warehouses (an embedded in-memory database H2), exposes a number
  of ways for a connection string to include code that is then executed by the process running
  the embedded database. Because Metabase allows users to connect to databases, this means that
  a user supplied string can be used to inject executable code. Metabase allows users to validate
  their connection string before adding a database (including on setup), and this validation
  API was the primary vector used as it can be called without validation. Versions 0.43.7.3,
  0.44.7.3, 0.45.4.3, 0.46.6.4, 1.43.7.3, 1.44.7.3, 1.45.4.3, and 1.46.6.4 fix this issue by
  removing the ability of users to add H2 databases entirely. As a workaround, it is possible
  to block these vulnerabilities at the network level by blocking the endpoints `POST /api/database`,
  `PUT /api/database/:id`, and `POST /api/setup/validateuntil`. Those who use H2 as a file-based
  database should migrate to SQLite.
