aliases: []
summary: The Multi Step Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due
  to missing file type validation via the import functionality in all versions up to, and including,
  1.7.25. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access
  and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code
  execution possible.
