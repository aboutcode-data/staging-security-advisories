  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  usbnet: Run unregister_netdev() before unbind() again

  Commit 2c9d6c2b871d ("usbnet: run unbind() before unregister_netdev()")
  sought to fix a use-after-free on disconnect of USB Ethernet adapters.

  It turns out that a different fix is necessary to address the issue:
  https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/18b3541e5372bc9b9fc733d422f4e698c089077c.1650177997.git.lukas@wunner.de/

  So the commit was not necessary.

  The commit made binding and unbinding of USB Ethernet asymmetrical:
  Before, usbnet_probe() first invoked the ->bind() callback and then
  register_netdev().  usbnet_disconnect() mirrored that by first invoking
  unregister_netdev() and then ->unbind().

  Since the commit, the order in usbnet_disconnect() is reversed and no
  longer mirrors usbnet_probe().

  One consequence is that a PHY disconnected (and stopped) in ->unbind()
  is afterwards stopped once more by unregister_netdev() as it closes the
  netdev before unregistering.  That necessitates a contortion in ->stop()
  because the PHY may only be stopped if it hasn't already been
  disconnected.

  Reverting the commit allows making the call to phy_stop() unconditional
  in ->stop().
