aliases: []
summary: The Plus Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
  reads in versions up to, and including 4.1.9 (pro) and 2.0.6 (free). The plugin has a feature
  to add an "Info Box" to an Elementor created page. This Info Box can include an SVG image
  for the box. Unfortunately, the plugin used file_get_contents with no verification that the
  file being supplied was an SVG file, so any user with access to the Elementor page builder,
  such as contributors, could read arbitrary files on the WordPress installation.
