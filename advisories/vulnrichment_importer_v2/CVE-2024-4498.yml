aliases: []
summary: A Path Traversal and Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability exists in the parisneo/lollms-webui
  application, affecting versions v9.7 to the latest. The vulnerability arises from insufficient
  input validation in the `/apply_settings` function, allowing an attacker to manipulate the
  `discussion_db_name` parameter to traverse the file system and include arbitrary files. This
  issue is compounded by the bypass of input filtering in the `install_binding`, `reinstall_binding`,
  and `unInstall_binding` endpoints, despite the presence of a `sanitize_path_from_endpoint(data.name)`
  filter. Successful exploitation enables an attacker to upload and execute malicious code on
  the victim's system, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
