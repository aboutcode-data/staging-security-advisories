aliases: []
summary: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.0.4 of the `stable`
  branch and version 3.1.0.beta5 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, an attacker could
  use the new topics dismissal endpoint to reveal the number of topics recently created (but
  not the actual content thereof) in categories they didn't have access to. This issue is patched
  in version 3.0.4 of the `stable` branch and version 3.1.0.beta5 of the `beta` and `tests-passed`
  branches. There are no known workarounds.
