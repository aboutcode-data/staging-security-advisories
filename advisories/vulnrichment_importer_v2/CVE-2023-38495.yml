aliases: []
summary: Crossplane is a framework for building cloud native control planes without needing
  to write code. In versions prior to 1.11.5, 1.12.3, and 1.13.0, Crossplane's image backend
  does not validate the byte contents of Crossplane packages. As such, Crossplane does not detect
  if an attacker has tampered with a Package. The problem has been fixed in 1.11.5, 1.12.3 and
  1.13.0. As a workaround, only use images from trusted sources and keep Package editing/creating
  privileges to administrators only.
