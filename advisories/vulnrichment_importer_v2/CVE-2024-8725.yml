aliases: []
summary: Multiple plugins and/or themes for WordPress are vulnerable to Limited File Upload
  in various versions. This is due to a lack of proper checks to ensure lower-privileged roles
  cannot upload .css and .js files to arbitrary directories. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, and granted permissions by an administrator,
  to upload .css and .js files to any directory within the WordPress root directory, which could
  lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting. The Advanced File Manager Shortcodes plugin must be installed
  to exploit this vulnerability.
