aliases: []
summary: The video carousel slider with lightbox plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery in version 1.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the
  responsive_video_gallery_with_lightbox_video_management_func() function. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to delete videos hosted from the video slider via a forged request
  granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on
  a link.
