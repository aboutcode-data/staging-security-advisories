aliases: []
summary: Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications
  on Linux. In versions prior to 1.10.4 and 1.12.0, Flatpak apps with direct access to AF_UNIX
  sockets such as those used by Wayland, Pipewire or pipewire-pulse can trick portals and other
  host-OS services into treating the Flatpak app as though it was an ordinary, non-sandboxed
  host-OS process. They can do this by manipulating the VFS using recent mount-related syscalls
  that are not blocked by Flatpak's denylist seccomp filter, in order to substitute a crafted
  `/.flatpak-info` or make that file disappear entirely. Flatpak apps that act as clients for
  AF_UNIX sockets such as those used by Wayland, Pipewire or pipewire-pulse can escalate the
  privileges that the corresponding services will believe the Flatpak app has. Note that protocols
  that operate entirely over the D-Bus session bus (user bus), system bus or accessibility bus
  are not affected by this. This is due to the use of a proxy process `xdg-dbus-proxy`, whose
  VFS cannot be manipulated by the Flatpak app, when interacting with these buses. Patches exist
  for versions 1.10.4 and 1.12.0, and as of time of publication, a patch for version 1.8.2 is
  being planned. There are no workarounds aside from upgrading to a patched version.
