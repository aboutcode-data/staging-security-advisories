summary: A vulnerability has been identified in SINEMA Remote Connect Server (All versions <
  V3.2 SP4). Affected applications do not properly validate license restrictions against the

  without proper enforcement checks. This could allow with database access to circumvent licensing
  restrictions by directly modifying database values and potentially enabling unauthorized use
  beyond the permitted scope.
