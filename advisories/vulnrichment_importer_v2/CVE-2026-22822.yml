aliases: []
summary: External Secrets Operator reads information from a third-party service and automatically
  injects the values as Kubernetes Secrets.  Starting in version 0.20.2 and prior to version
  1.2.0, the `getSecretKey` template function, while introduced for senhasegura Devops Secrets
  Management (DSM) provider, has the ability to fetch secrets cross-namespaces with the roleBinding
  of the external-secrets controller, bypassing our security mechanisms. This function was completely
  removed in version 1.2.0, as everything done with that templating function can be done in
  a different way while respecting External Secrets Operator's safeguards As a workaround, use
  a policy engine such as Kubernetes, Kyverno, Kubewarden, or OPA to prevent the usage of `getSecretKey`
  in any ExternalSecret resource.
