aliases: []
summary: RIOT-OS, an operating system that supports Internet of Things devices, has an ineffective
  size check implemented with `assert()` can lead to buffer overflow in versions up to and including
  2025.04. Assertions are usually compiled out in production builds. If assertions are the only
  defense against untrusted inputs, the software may be exposed to attacks that utilize the
  lack of proper input checks. In the `l2filter_add()` function shown below, `addr_len` is checked
  using an assertion and is subsequently used as an argument in a `memcpy()` call. When assertions
  are disabled, there would be no size check for `addr_len`. As a consequence, if an attacker
  were to provide an `addr_len` value larger than `CONFIG_L2FILTER_ADDR_MAXLEN`, they can trigger
  a buffer overflow and write past the `list[i].addr` buffer. If the unchecked input is attacker-controlled,
  the impact of the buffer overflow can range from a denial of service to arbitrary code execution.
  Commit f6f7de4ccc107c018630e4c15500825caf02e1c2 contains a patch for the vulnerability.
