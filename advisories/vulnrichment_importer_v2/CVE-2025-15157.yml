aliases: []
summary: The Starfish Review Generation & Marketing for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing
  capability check on the 'srm_restore_options_defaults' function in all versions up to, and
  including, 3.1.19. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
  access and above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged
  to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration
  for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site.
