aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the fabric infrastructure VLAN connection establishment of Cisco
  Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) Mode could allow
  an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to bypass security validations and connect an unauthorized
  server to the infrastructure VLAN. This vulnerability is due to insufficient security requirements
  during the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) setup phase of the infrastructure VLAN. An
  attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted LLDP packet on the adjacent
  subnet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to connect an
  unauthorized server to the infrastructure VLAN, which is highly privileged. With a connection
  to the infrastructure VLAN, the attacker can make unauthorized connections to Cisco Application
  Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) services or join other host endpoints.
