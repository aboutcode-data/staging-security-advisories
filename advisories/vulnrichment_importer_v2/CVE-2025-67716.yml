aliases: []
summary: The Auth0 Next.js SDK is a library for implementing user authentication in Next.js
  applications. Versions 4.9.0 through 4.12.1 contain an input-validation flaw in the returnTo
  parameter, which could allow attackers to inject unintended OAuth query parameters into the
  Auth0 authorization request. Successful exploitation may result in tokens being issued with
  unintended parameters. This issue is fixed in version 4.13.0.
