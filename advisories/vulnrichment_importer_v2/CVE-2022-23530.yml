aliases: []
summary: GuardDog is a CLI tool to identify malicious PyPI packages. Versions prior to v0.1.8
  are vulnerable to arbitrary file write when scanning a specially-crafted remote PyPI package.
  Extracting files using shutil.unpack_archive() from a potentially malicious tarball without
  validating that the destination file path is within the intended destination directory can
  cause files outside the destination directory to be overwritten.  This issue is patched in
  version 0.1.8. Potential workarounds include using a safer module, like zipfile, and validating
  the location of the extracted files and discarding those with malicious paths.
