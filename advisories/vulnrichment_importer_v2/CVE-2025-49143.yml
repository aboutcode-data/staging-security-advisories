aliases: []
summary: Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform. Prior to v2.4.10
  and v1.6.32 , files uploaded by users to Nautobot's MEDIA_ROOT directory, including DeviceType
  image attachments as well as images attached to a Location, Device, or Rack, are served to
  users via a URL endpoint that was not enforcing user authentication. As a consequence, such
  files can be retrieved by anonymous users who know or can guess the correct URL for a given
  file. Nautobot v2.4.10 and v1.6.32 address this issue by adding enforcement of Nautobot user
  authentication to this endpoint.
