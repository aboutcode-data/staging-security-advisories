aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the implementation of Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN
  (EAPOL) functionality in Cisco Small Business 100 Series Wireless Access Points and Cisco
  Small Business 300 Series Wireless Access Points could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent
  attacker to force the downgrade of the encryption algorithm that is used between an authenticator
  (access point) and a supplicant (Wi-Fi client). The vulnerability is due to the improper processing
  of certain EAPOL messages that are received during the Wi-Fi handshake process. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by establishing a man-in-the-middle position between a supplicant
  and an authenticator and manipulating an EAPOL message exchange to force usage of a WPA-TKIP
  cipher instead of the more secure AES-CCMP cipher. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to conduct subsequent cryptographic attacks, which could lead to the disclosure of confidential
  information. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvj29229.'
