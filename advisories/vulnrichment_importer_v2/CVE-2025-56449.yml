aliases: []
summary: A security vulnerability was identified in Obsidian Scheduler's REST API 5.0.0 thru
  6.3.0. If an account is locked out due to not enrolling in MFA (e.g. after the 7-day enforcement
  window), the REST API still allows the use of Basic Authentication to authenticate and perform
  administrative actions. In particular, the default admin account was found to be locked out
  via the web interface but still usable through the REST API. This allowed creation of a new
  privileged user, bypassing MFA protections. This undermines the intended security posture
  of MFA enforcement.
