aliases: []
summary: The Code Explorer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary external file reading
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.5. This is due to the fact that the plugin does
  not restrict accessing files to those outside of the WordPress instance, though the intention
  of the plugin is to only access WordPress related files. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with administrator-level access, to read files outside of the WordPress instance.
