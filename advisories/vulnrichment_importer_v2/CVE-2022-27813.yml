aliases: []
summary: Motorola MTM5000 series firmwares lack properly configured memory protection of pages
  shared between the OMAP-L138 ARM and DSP cores. The SoC provides two memory protection units,
  MPU1 and MPU2, to enforce the trust boundary between the two cores. Since both units are left
  unconfigured by the firmwares, an adversary with control over either core can trivially gain
  code execution on the other, by overwriting code located in shared RAM or DDR2 memory regions.
