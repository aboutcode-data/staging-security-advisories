aliases: []
summary: 'Anubis is a Web AI Firewall Utility that weighs the soul of users'' connections using
  one or more challenges in order to protect upstream resources from scraper bots. In versions
  1.21.2 and below, attackers can craft malicious pass-challenge pages that cause a user to
  execute arbitrary JavaScript code or trigger other nonstandard schemes. An incomplete version
  of this fix was tagged at 1.21.2 and then the release process was aborted upon final testing.
  To work around this issue: block any requests to the /.within.website/x/cmd/anubis/api/pass-challenge
  route with the ?redir= parameter set to anything that doesn''t start with the URL scheme http,
  https, or no scheme (local path redirect). This was fixed in version 1.21.3.'
