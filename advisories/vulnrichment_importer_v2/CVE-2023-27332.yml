summary: |
  TP-Link Archer AX21 tdpServer Logging Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of TP-Link Archer AX21 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

  The specific flaw exists within the logging functionality of the tdpServer program, which listens on UDP port 20002. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.
  . Was ZDI-CAN-19898.
