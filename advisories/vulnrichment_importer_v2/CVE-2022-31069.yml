aliases: []
summary: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0,
  the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to control when Authorization headers should should
  be forwarded for specific backend services configured by the application developer. This could
  have resulted in sensitive information such as OAuth bearer access tokens being inadvertently
  exposed to such services that should not see them. A new feature has been introduced in the
  patched version of nestjs-proxy that allows application developers to opt out of forwarding
  the Authorization headers on a per service basis using the `forwardToken` config setting.
  Developers are advised to review the README for this library on Github or NPM for further
  details on how this configuration can be applied. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0
  of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has
  been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should
  update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.
