summary: 'OpenEMR is a free and open source electronic health records and medical practice management
  application. A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in versions prior to 7.0.3.4
  allows any authenticated user with patient creation and editing privileges to inject arbitrary
  JavaScript code into the system by entering malicious payloads in the (1) Text Box fields
  of Address, Address Line 2, Postal Code and City fields  and (2) Drop Down menu options of
  Address Use, State and Country of the Additional Addresses section of the Contact tab in Patient
  Demographics. The injected script can execute in two scenarios: (1) dynamically during form
  input, and (2) when the form data is later loaded for editing. Version 7.0.3.4 contains a
  patch for the issue.'
