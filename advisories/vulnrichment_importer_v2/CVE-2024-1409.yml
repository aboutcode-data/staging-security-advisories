aliases: []
summary: The Paid Membership Plugin, Ecommerce, User Registration Form, Login Form, User Profile
  & Restrict Content – ProfilePress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the plugin's [reg-select-role] shortcode in all versions up to, and including,
  4.15.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions
  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page.
