aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Dynatrace OneAgent before 1.325.47. When attempting to access
  a remote network share from a machine where OneAgent is installed and receiving a "STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE"
  error, the agent will retrieve every user token on the machine and repeatedly attempt to access
  the network share while impersonating them. The exploitation of this vulnerability can allow
  an unprivileged attacker with access to the affected system to perform NTLM relay attacks.
