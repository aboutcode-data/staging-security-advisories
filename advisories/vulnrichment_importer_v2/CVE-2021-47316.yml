  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  nfsd: fix NULL dereference in nfs3svc_encode_getaclres

  In error cases the dentry may be NULL.

  Before 20798dfe249a, the encoder also checked dentry and
  d_really_is_positive(dentry), but that looks like overkill to me--zero
  status should be enough to guarantee a positive dentry.

  This isn't the first time we've seen an error-case NULL dereference
  hidden in the initialization of a local variable in an xdr encoder.  But
  I went back through the other recent rewrites and didn't spot any
  similar bugs.
