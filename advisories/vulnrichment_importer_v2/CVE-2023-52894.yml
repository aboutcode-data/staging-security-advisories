  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  usb: gadget: f_ncm: fix potential NULL ptr deref in ncm_bitrate()

  In Google internal bug 265639009 we've received an (as yet) unreproducible
  crash report from an aarch64 GKI 5.10.149-android13 running device.

  AFAICT the source code is at:
    https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+/refs/tags/ASB-2022-12-05_13-5.10

  The call stack is:
    ncm_close() -> ncm_notify() -> ncm_do_notify()
  with the crash at:
    ncm_do_notify+0x98/0x270
  Code: 79000d0b b9000a6c f940012a f9400269 (b9405d4b)

  Which I believe disassembles to (I don't know ARM assembly, but it looks sane enough to me...):

    // halfword (16-bit) store presumably to event->wLength (at offset 6 of struct usb_cdc_notification)
    0B 0D 00 79    strh w11, [x8, #6]

    // word (32-bit) store presumably to req->Length (at offset 8 of struct usb_request)
    6C 0A 00 B9    str  w12, [x19, #8]

    // x10 (NULL) was read here from offset 0 of valid pointer x9
    // IMHO we're reading 'cdev->gadget' and getting NULL
    // gadget is indeed at offset 0 of struct usb_composite_dev
    2A 01 40 F9    ldr  x10, [x9]

    // loading req->buf pointer, which is at offset 0 of struct usb_request
    69 02 40 F9    ldr  x9, [x19]

    // x10 is null, crash, appears to be attempt to read cdev->gadget->max_speed
    4B 5D 40 B9    ldr  w11, [x10, #0x5c]

  which seems to line up with ncm_do_notify() case NCM_NOTIFY_SPEED code fragment:

    event->wLength = cpu_to_le16(8);
    req->length = NCM_STATUS_BYTECOUNT;

    /* SPEED_CHANGE data is up/down speeds in bits/sec */
    data = req->buf + sizeof *event;
    data[0] = cpu_to_le32(ncm_bitrate(cdev->gadget));

  My analysis of registers and NULL ptr deref crash offset
    (Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 000000000000005c)
  heavily suggests that the crash is due to 'cdev->gadget' being NULL when executing:
    data[0] = cpu_to_le32(ncm_bitrate(cdev->gadget));
  which calls:
    ncm_bitrate(NULL)
  which then calls:
    gadget_is_superspeed(NULL)
  which reads
    ((struct usb_gadget *)NULL)->max_speed
  and hits a panic.

  AFAICT, if I'm counting right, the offset of max_speed is indeed 0x5C.
  (remember there's a GKI KABI reservation of 16 bytes in struct work_struct)

  It's not at all clear to me how this is all supposed to work...
  but returning 0 seems much better than panic-ing...
