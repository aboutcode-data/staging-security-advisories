aliases: []
summary: 'redis-py before 4.4.4 and 4.5.x before 4.5.4 leaves a connection open after canceling
  an async Redis command at an inopportune time, and can send response data to the client of
  an unrelated request. (This could, for example, happen for a non-pipeline operation.) NOTE:
  the solutions for CVE-2023-28859 address data leakage across AsyncIO connections in general.'
