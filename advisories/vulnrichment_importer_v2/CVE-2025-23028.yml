aliases: []
summary: Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane.
  A denial of service vulnerability affects versions 1.14.0 through 1.14.7, 1.15.0 through 1.15.11,
  and 1.16.0 through 1.16.4. In a Kubernetes cluster where Cilium is configured to proxy DNS
  traffic, an attacker can crash Cilium agents by sending a crafted DNS response to workloads
  from outside the cluster. For traffic that is allowed but without using DNS-based policy,
  the dataplane will continue to pass traffic as configured at the time of the DoS. For workloads
  that have DNS-based policy configured, existing connections may continue to operate, and new
  connections made without relying on DNS resolution may continue to be established, but new
  connections which rely on DNS resolution may be disrupted. Any configuration changes that
  affect the impacted agent may not be applied until the agent is able to restart. This issue
  is fixed in Cilium v1.14.18, v1.15.12, and v1.16.5. No known workarounds are available.
