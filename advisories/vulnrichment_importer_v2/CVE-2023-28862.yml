aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in LemonLDAP::NG before 2.16.1. Weak session ID generation
  in the AuthBasic handler and incorrect failure handling during a password check allow attackers
  to bypass 2FA verification. Any plugin that tries to deny session creation after the store
  step does not deny an AuthBasic session.
