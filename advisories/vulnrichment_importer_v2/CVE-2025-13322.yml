aliases: []
summary: The WP AUDIO GALLERY plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion
  due to insufficient file path validation in all versions up to, and including, 2.0. This is
  due to the `wpag_uploadaudio_callback()` AJAX handler not properly validating user-supplied
  file paths in the `audio_upload` parameter before passing them to `unlink()`. This makes it
  possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary
  files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when critical files like
  wp-config.php are deleted.
