summary: A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) punt handling function
  of Cisco cBR-8 Converged Broadband Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to
  overload a device punt path, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability
  is due to the punt path being overwhelmed by large quantities of SNMP requests. An attacker
