aliases: []
summary: Nagios Fusion versions prior to 4.2.0 contain a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS)
  vulnerability in the license key configuration flow that can result in execution of attacker-controlled
  script in the browser of a user who follows a crafted URL. While the application server itself
  is not directly corrupted by the reflected XSS, the resulting browser compromise can lead
  to credential/session theft and unauthorized administrative actions.
