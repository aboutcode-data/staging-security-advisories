  net: sparx5: Fix use after free inside sparx5_del_mact_entry

  Based on the static analyzis of the code it looks like when an entry
  from the MAC table was removed, the entry was still used after being
  freed. More precise the vid of the mac_entry was used after calling
  devm_kfree on the mac_entry.
  The fix consists in first using the vid of the mac_entry to delete the
  entry from the HW and after that to free it.
