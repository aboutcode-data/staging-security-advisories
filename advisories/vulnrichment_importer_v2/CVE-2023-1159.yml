aliases: []
summary: The Bookly plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via service
  titles in versions up to, and including, 21.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
  escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrative privileges
  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has
  been disabled.
