summary: The Modern Footnotes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the plugin's shortcode in versions up to, and including, 1.4.16 due to insufficient input
  sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in
  pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
