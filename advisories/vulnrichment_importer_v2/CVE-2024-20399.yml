aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated user\
  \ in possession of Administrator credentials to execute arbitrary commands as root on the\
  \ underlying operating system of an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient\
  \ validation of arguments that are passed to specific configuration CLI commands. An attacker\
  \ could exploit this vulnerability by including crafted input as the argument of an affected\
  \ configuration CLI command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary\
  \ commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of root.\r\nNote: To successfully\
  \ exploit this vulnerability on a Cisco NX-OS device, an attacker must have Administrator\
  \ credentials. The following Cisco devices already allow administrative users to access the\
  \ underlying operating system through the bash-shell feature, so, for these devices, this\
  \ vulnerability does not grant any additional privileges:\r\n\r\nNexus 3000 Series Switches\r\
  \nNexus 7000 Series Switches that are running Cisco NX-OS Software releases 8.1(1) and later\r\
  \nNexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode"
