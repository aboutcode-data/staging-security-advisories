aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the DHCPv6 feature of the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches
  in Application-Centric Infrastructure (ACI) Mode could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to cause the device to run low on system memory, which could result in a Denial of Service
  (DoS) condition on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to improper memory management
  when DHCPv6 packets are received on an interface of the targeted device. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by sending a high number of malicious DHCPv6 packets to be processed
  by an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the system to
  run low on memory, which could cause an eventual reboot of an affected device. The vulnerability
  only applies to IPv6 protocol packets and not for IPv4 protocol packets. This vulnerability
  affects Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI Mode running software version 13.0(1k).
  The vulnerability can only be exploited when unicast routing is enabled on the Bridge Domain
  (BD). DHCP and DHCP relay do not have to be configured for the vulnerability to be exploited.
