aliases: []
summary: 'quic-go is an implementation of the QUIC protocol in Go. The loss recovery logic for
  path probe packets that was added in the v0.50.0 release can be used to trigger a nil-pointer
  dereference by a malicious QUIC client. In order to do so, the attacker first sends valid
  QUIC packets from different remote addresses (thereby triggering the newly added path validation
  logic: the server sends path probe packets), and then sending ACKs for packets received from
  the server specifically crafted to trigger the nil-pointer dereference. v0.50.1 contains a
  patch that fixes the vulnerability. This release contains a test that generates random sequences
  of sent packets (both regular and path probe packets), that was used to verify that the patch
  actually covers all corner cases. No known workarounds are available.'
