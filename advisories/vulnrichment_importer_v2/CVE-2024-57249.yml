aliases: []
summary: Incorrect Access Control in the Preview Function of Gleamtech FileVista 9.2.0.0 allows
  remote attackers to gain unauthorized access via exploiting a vulnerability in access control
  mechanisms by removing authentication-related HTTP headers, such as the Cookie header, in
  the request. This bypasses the authentication process and grants attackers access to sensitive
  image files without proper login credentials.
