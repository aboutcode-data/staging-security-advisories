summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  xen-netback: take a reference to the RX task thread

  Do this in order to prevent the task from being freed if the thread
  returns (which can be triggered by the frontend) before the call to
  kthread_stop done as part of the backend tear down. Not taking the
  reference will lead to a use-after-free in that scenario. Such
  reference was taken before but dropped as part of the rework done in
  2ac061ce97f4.

  Reintroduce the reference taking and add a comment this time
  explaining why it's needed.

  This is XSA-374 / CVE-2021-28691.
