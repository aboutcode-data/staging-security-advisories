aliases: []
summary: Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host and Application (VA and
  SaaS deployments) mount host configuration and secret material under /var/www/efs_storage
  into many Docker containers with overly-permissive filesystem permissions. Files such as secrets.env,
  GPG-encrypted blobs in .secrets, MySQL client keys, and application session files are accessible
  from multiple containers. An attacker who controls or reaches any container can read or modify
  these artifacts, leading to credential theft, RCE via Laravel APP_KEY, Portainer takeover,
  and full compromise.
