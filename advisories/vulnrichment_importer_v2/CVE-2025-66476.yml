aliases: []
summary: Vim is an open source, command line text editor. Prior to version 9.1.1947, an uncontrolled
  search path vulnerability on Windows allows Vim to execute malicious executables placed in
  the current working directory for the current edited file. On Windows, when using cmd.exe
  as a shell, Vim resolves external commands by searching the current working directory before
  system paths. When Vim invokes tools such as findstr for :grep, external commands or filters
  via :!, or compiler/:make commands, it may inadvertently run a malicious executable present
  in the same directory as the file being edited. The issue affects Vim for Windows prior to
  version 9.1.1947.
