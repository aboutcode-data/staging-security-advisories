aliases: []
summary: The Jeg Elementor Kit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the custom attribute of a link in several Elementor widgets in all versions up to, and
  including, 2.6.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied
  attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access
  and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
  an injected page.
