aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the application-hosting subsystem of Cisco IOS XE Software could
  allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges to root on an affected device.
  The attacker could execute IOS XE commands outside the application-hosting subsystem Docker
  container as well as on the underlying Linux operating system. These commands could be run
  as the root user. The vulnerability is due to a combination of two factors: (a) incomplete
  input validation of the user payload of CLI commands, and (b) improper role-based access control
  (RBAC) when commands are issued at the command line within the application-hosting subsystem.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a CLI command with crafted user input.
  A successful exploit could allow the lower-privileged attacker to execute arbitrary CLI commands
  with root privileges. The attacker would need valid user credentials to exploit this vulnerability.'
