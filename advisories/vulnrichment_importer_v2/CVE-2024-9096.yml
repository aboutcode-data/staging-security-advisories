aliases: []
summary: In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.4.28, the /checklists/:id route allows low-privilege
  users to modify checklists by sending a PATCH request. The route lacks proper access control,
  such as middleware to ensure that only authorized users (e.g., project owners or admins) can
  modify checklist data. This vulnerability allows any user associated with the project, regardless
  of their role, to modify checklists, including changing the slug or data fields, which can
  lead to tampering with essential project workflows, altering business logic, and introducing
  errors that undermine integrity.
