aliases: []
summary: Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library. The algorithm
  used for parsing HTTP cookies in Tornado versions prior to 6.4.2 sometimes has quadratic complexity,
  leading to excessive CPU consumption when parsing maliciously-crafted cookie headers. This
  parsing occurs in the event loop thread and may block the processing of other requests. Version
  6.4.2 fixes the issue.
