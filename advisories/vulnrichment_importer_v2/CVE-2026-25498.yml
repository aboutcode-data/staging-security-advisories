aliases: []
summary: Craft is a platform for creating digital experiences. In versions 4.0.0-RC1 through
  4.16.17 and 5.0.0-RC1 through 5.8.21, a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in
  Craft CMS where the assembleLayoutFromPost() function in src/services/Fields.php fails to
  sanitize user-supplied configuration data before passing it to Craft::createObject(). This
  allows authenticated administrators to inject malicious Yii2 behavior configurations that
  execute arbitrary system commands on the server. This vulnerability represents an unpatched
  variant of the behavior injection vulnerability addressed in CVE-2025-68455, affecting different
  endpoints through a separate code path. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.8.22.
