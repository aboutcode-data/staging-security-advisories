aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the SOAP API of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) could
  allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain read access to information that is stored
  on an affected system. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need administrative
  privileges on the DCNM application. The vulnerability exists because the SOAP API improperly
  handles XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious XML content in an API request. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files from the affected device. Note: The
  severity of this vulnerability is aggravated by the vulnerabilities described in the Cisco
  Data Center Network Manager Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities advisory, published simultaneously
  with this one.'
