  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  nfsd: fix nfsd4_deleg_getattr_conflict in presence of third party lease

  It is not safe to dereference fl->c.flc_owner without first confirming
  fl->fl_lmops is the expected manager.  nfsd4_deleg_getattr_conflict()
  tests fl_lmops but largely ignores the result and assumes that flc_owner
  is an nfs4_delegation anyway.  This is wrong.

  With this patch we restore the "!= &nfsd_lease_mng_ops" case to behave
  as it did before the change mentioned below.  This is the same as the
  current code, but without any reference to a possible delegation.
