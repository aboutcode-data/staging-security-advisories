aliases: []
summary: OpenBao exists to provide a software solution to manage, store, and distribute sensitive
  data including secrets, certificates, and keys. OpenBao before v2.3.0 allowed an attacker
  to perform unauthenticated, unaudited cancellation of root rekey and recovery rekey operations,
  effecting a denial of service. In OpenBao v2.2.0 and later, manually setting the configuration
  option `disable_unauthed_rekey_endpoints=true` allows an operator to deny these rarely-used
  endpoints on global listeners. A patch is available at commit fe75468822a22a88318c6079425357a02ae5b77b.
  In a future OpenBao release communicated on OpenBao's website, the maintainers will set this
  to `true` for all users and provide an authenticated alternative. As a workaround, if an active
  proxy or load balancer sits in front of OpenBao, an operator can deny requests to these endpoints
  from unauthorized IP ranges.
