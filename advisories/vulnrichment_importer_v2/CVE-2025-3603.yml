aliases: []
summary: The Flynax Bridge plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account
  takeover in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.0. This is due to the plugin not properly
  validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like password. This makes it
  possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators,
  and leverage that to gain access to their account.
