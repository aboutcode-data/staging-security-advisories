aliases: []
summary: Authentication bypass in Netcomm router models NF20MESH, NF20, and NL1902 allows an
  unauthenticated user to access content. In order to serve static content, the application
  performs a check for the existence of specific characters in the URL (.css, .png etc). If
  it exists, it performs a "fake login" to give the request an active session to load the file
  and not redirect to the login page.
