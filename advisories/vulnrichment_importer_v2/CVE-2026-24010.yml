aliases: []
summary: Horilla is a free and open source Human Resource Management System (HRMS). A critical
  File Upload vulnerability in versions prior to 1.5.0, with Social Engineering, allows authenticated
  users to deploy phishing attacks. By uploading a malicious HTML file disguised as a profile
  picture, an attacker can create a convincing login page replica that steals user credentials.
  When a victim visits the uploaded file URL, they see an authentic-looking "Session Expired"
  message prompting them to re-authenticate. All entered credentials are captured and sent to
  the attacker's server, enabling Account Takeover. Version 1.5.0 patches the issue.
