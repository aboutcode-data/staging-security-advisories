aliases: []
summary: filippo.io/edwards25519 is a Go library implementing the edwards25519 elliptic curve
  with APIs for building cryptographic primitives. In versions 1.1.0 and earlier, MultiScalarMult
  produces invalid results or undefined behavior if the receiver is not the identity point.
  If (*Point).MultiScalarMult is called on an initialized point that is not the identity point,
  it returns an incorrect result. If the method is called on an uninitialized point, the behavior
  is undefined. In particular, if the receiver is the zero value, MultiScalarMult returns an
  invalid point that compares Equal to every other point. Note that MultiScalarMult is a rarely
  used, advanced API. For example, users who depend on filippo.io/edwards25519 only through
  github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql are not affected. This issue has been fixed in version 1.1.1.
