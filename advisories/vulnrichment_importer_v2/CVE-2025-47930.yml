aliases: []
summary: Zulip is an open-source team chat application. Starting in version 10.0 and prior to
  version 10.3, the "Who can create public channels" access control mechanism can be circumvented
  by creating a private or web-public channel, and then changing the channel privacy to public.
  A similar technique works for creating private channels without permission, though such a
  process requires either the API or modifying the HTML, as we do mark the "private" radio button
  as disabled in such cases. Version 10.3 contains a patch.
