aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Session Initiation Protocol
  (SIP) Software for Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an authenticated user of the interface to follow
  a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions
  on a targeted device via a web browser and with the privileges of the user. This vulnerability
  affects Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series products running a SIP Software release prior to 11.0(5)
  for Wireless IP Phone 8821 and 8821-EX; and 12.5(1)SR1 for the IP Conference Phone 8832 and
  the rest of the IP Phone 8800 Series. Cisco IP Conference Phone 8831 is not affected.
