aliases: []
summary: The PixelYourSite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via admin settings in versions up to, and including, 9.3.6 (9.6.1 in the Pro version) due
  to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts
  in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site
  installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
