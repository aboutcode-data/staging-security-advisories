aliases: []
summary: Barracuda products, confirmed in Spam & Virus Firewall, SSL VPN, and Web Application
  Firewall versions prior to October 2010, contain a path traversal vulnerability in the view_help.cgi
  endpoint. The locale parameter fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing attackers to
  inject traversal sequences and null-byte terminators to access arbitrary files on the underlying
  system. By exploiting this flaw, unauthenticated remote attackers can retrieve sensitive configuration
  files such as /mail/snapshot/config.snapshot, potentially exposing credentials, internal settings,
  and other critical data.
