  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  KEYS: trusted: Fix TPM reservation for seal/unseal

  The original patch 8c657a0590de ("KEYS: trusted: Reserve TPM for seal
  and unseal operations") was correct on the mailing list:

  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-integrity/20210128235621.127925-4-jarkko@kernel.org/

  But somehow got rebased so that the tpm_try_get_ops() in
  tpm2_seal_trusted() got lost.  This causes an imbalanced put of the
  TPM ops and causes oopses on TIS based hardware.

  This fix puts back the lost tpm_try_get_ops()
