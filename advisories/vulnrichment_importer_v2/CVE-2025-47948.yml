aliases: []
summary: Cocotais Bot is a QQ official robot framework based on qq-bot-sdk. Starting in version
  1.5.0-test2-hotfix and prior to version 1.6.2, command echoing feature in the framework allows
  users to indirectly trigger privileged behavior by injecting special platform tags. Specifically,
  an unauthorized user can use the `/echo <qqbot-at-everyone />` command to cause the bot to
  send a message that mentions all members in the chat, bypassing any permission controls. This
  can lead to spam, disruption, or abuse of notification systems. Version 1.6.2 contains a patch
  for the issue.
