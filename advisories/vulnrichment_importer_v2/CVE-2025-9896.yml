summary: The HidePost plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all
  versions up to, and including, 2.3.8. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation

  modify plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
  performing an action such as clicking on a link.
