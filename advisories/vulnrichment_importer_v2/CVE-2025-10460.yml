aliases: []
summary: |
  A SQL Injection vulnerability on an endpoint in BEIMS Contractor Web, a legacy product that is no longer maintained or patched by the vendor, allows an unauthorised user to retrieve sensitive database contents via unsanitized parameter input. This vulnerability occurs due to improper input validation on /BEIMSWeb/contractor.asp endpoint and successful exploitation requires a contractor.asp endpoint open to the internet. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands, compromising the confidentiality, integrity and potentially the availability of the database. 





  Version 5.7.139

   has been confirmed as vulnerable. Other versions have not been confirmed by the vendor and users should assume that all versions of BEIMS Contractor Web may be impacted until further guidance is provided by the vendor.
