aliases: []
summary: PingOne MFA Integration Kit contains a vulnerability related to the Prompt Users to
  Set Up MFA configuration. Under certain conditions, this configuration could allow for a new
  MFA device to be paired with a target user account without requiring second-factor authentication

  vulnerability to register their own MFA device with a target user’s account if they have existing
  knowledge of the target user’s first factor credential.
