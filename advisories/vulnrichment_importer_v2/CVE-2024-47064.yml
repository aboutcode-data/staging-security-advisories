aliases: []
summary: Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) is an interactive video and image annotation
  tool for computer vision. If an attacker can trick a logged-in CVAT user into visiting a maliciously-constructed
  URL, they can initiate any API calls on that user's behalf. This gives the attacker temporary
  access to all data that the victim user has access to. Upgrade to CVAT 2.19.0 or a later version
  to fix this issue.
