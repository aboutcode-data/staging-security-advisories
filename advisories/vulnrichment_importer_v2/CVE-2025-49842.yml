datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2025/49xxx/CVE-2025-49842.json
aliases: []
summary: conda-forge-webservices is the web app deployed to run conda-forge admin commands and
  linting. Prior to version 2025.3.24, the conda_forge_webservice Docker container executes
  commands without specifying a user. By default, Docker containers run as the root user, which
  increases the risk of privilege escalation and host compromise if a vulnerability is exploited.
  This issue has been patched in version 2025.3.24.
