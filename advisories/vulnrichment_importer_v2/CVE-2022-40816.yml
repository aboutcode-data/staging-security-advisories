aliases: []
summary: Zammad 5.2.1 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control. Zammad's asset handling mechanism
  has logic to ensure that customer users are not able to see personal information of other
  users. This logic was not effective when used through a web socket connection, so that a logged-in
  attacker would be able to fetch personal data of other users by querying the Zammad API. This
  issue is fixed in , 5.2.2.
