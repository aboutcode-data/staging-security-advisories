  arm64: acpi: Harden get_cpu_for_acpi_id() against missing CPU entry

  In a review discussion of the changes to support vCPU hotplug where
  a check was added on the GICC being enabled if was online, it was
  noted that there is need to map back to the cpu and use that to index
  into a cpumask. As such, a valid ID is needed.

  If an MPIDR check fails in acpi_map_gic_cpu_interface() it is possible
  for the entry in cpu_madt_gicc[cpu] == NULL.  This function would
  then cause a NULL pointer dereference.   Whilst a path to trigger
  this has not been established, harden this caller against the
  possibility.
