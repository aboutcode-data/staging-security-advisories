  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  nvme: move stopping keep-alive into nvme_uninit_ctrl()

  Commit 4733b65d82bd ("nvme: start keep-alive after admin queue setup")
  moves starting keep-alive from nvme_start_ctrl() into
  nvme_init_ctrl_finish(), but don't move stopping keep-alive into
  nvme_uninit_ctrl(), so keep-alive work can be started and keep pending
  after failing to start controller, finally use-after-free is triggered if
  nvme host driver is unloaded.

  This patch fixes kernel panic when running nvme/004 in case that connection
  failure is triggered, by moving stopping keep-alive into nvme_uninit_ctrl().

  This way is reasonable because keep-alive is now started in
  nvme_init_ctrl_finish().
