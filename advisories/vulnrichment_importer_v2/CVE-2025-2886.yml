summary: Missing validation of terminating delegation causes the client to continue searching
  the defined delegation list, even after searching a terminating delegation. This could cause
  the client to fetch a target from an incorrect source, altering the target contents. Users
  should upgrade to tough version 0.20.0 or later and ensure any forked or derivative code is
  patched to incorporate the new fixes.
