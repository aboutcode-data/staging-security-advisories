  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mfd: intel_soc_pmic_bxtwc: Use IRQ domain for PMIC devices

  While design wise the idea of converting the driver to use
  the hierarchy of the IRQ chips is correct, the implementation
  has (inherited) flaws. This was unveiled when platform_get_irq()
  had started WARN() on IRQ 0 that is supposed to be a Linux
  IRQ number (also known as vIRQ).

  Rework the driver to respect IRQ domain when creating each MFD
  device separately, as the domain is not the same for all of them.
