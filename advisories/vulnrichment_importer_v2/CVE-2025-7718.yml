aliases: []
summary: The Resideo Plugin for Resideo - Real Estate WordPress Theme plugin for WordPress is
  vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including,
  2.5.4. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating
  their details like email. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
  access and above, to change arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators, and
  leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account.
