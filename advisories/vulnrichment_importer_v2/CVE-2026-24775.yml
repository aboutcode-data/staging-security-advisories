aliases: []
summary: OpenProject is an open-source, web-based project management software. In the new editor
  for collaborative documents based on BlockNote, OpenProject maintainers added a custom extension
  in OpenProject version 17.0.0 that allows to mention OpenProject work packages in the document.
  To show work package details, the editor loads details about the work package via the OpenProject
  API. For this API call, the extension to the BlockNote editor did not properly validate the
  given work package ID to be only a number. This allowed an attacker to generate a document
  with relative links that upon opening could make arbitrary `GET` requests to any URL within
  the OpenProject instance. This issue was patched in version version 0.0.22 of op-blocknote-extensions,
  which was shipped with OpenProject 17.0.2. If users cannot update immediately to version 17.0.2
  of OpenProject, administrators can disable collaborative document editing in Settings -> Documents
  -> Real time collaboration -> Disable.
