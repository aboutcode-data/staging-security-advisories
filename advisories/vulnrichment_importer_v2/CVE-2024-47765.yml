aliases: []
summary: Minecraft MOTD Parser is a PHP library to parse minecraft server motd. The HtmlGenerator
  class is subject to potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attack through a parsed malformed
  Minecraft server MOTD. The HtmlGenerator iterates through objects of MotdItem that are contained
  in an object of MotdItemCollection to generate a HTML string. An attacker can make malicious
  inputs to the color and text properties of MotdItem to inject own HTML into a web page during
  web page generation. For example by sending a malicious MOTD from a Minecraft server under
  their control that was queried and passed to the HtmlGenerator. This XSS vulnerability exists
  because the values of these properties are neither filtered nor escaped. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 1.0.6.
