aliases: []
summary: An error in the SignServer container startup logic was found in Keyfactor SignServer
  versions prior to 7.2. The Admin CLI command used to configure Certificate access to the initial
  startup of the container sets a property of "allowany" to allow any user with a valid and
  trusted client auth certificate to connect. Admins can then set more restricted access to
  specific certificates. A logic error caused this admin CLI command to be run on each restart
  of the container instead of only the first startup as intended resetting the configuration
  to "allowany".
