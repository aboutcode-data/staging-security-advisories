summary: 'A vulnerability in the NX-API feature of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated,
  remote attacker to send a malicious packet to the management interface on an affected system
  and execute a command-injection exploit. The vulnerability is due to incorrect input validation
  of user-supplied data to the NX-API subsystem. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a malicious HTTP or HTTPS packet to the management interface of an affected system
  that has the NX-API feature enabled. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute
  arbitrary commands with root privileges. Note: NX-API is disabled by default. This vulnerability
  affects MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches, Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders, Nexus 3000
  Series Switches, Nexus 3500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5600 Platform
  Switches, Nexus 6000 Series Switches, Nexus 7000 Series Switches, Nexus 7700 Series Switches,
  Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode, Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric
  Modules. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd47415, CSCve03216, CSCve03224, CSCve03234.'
