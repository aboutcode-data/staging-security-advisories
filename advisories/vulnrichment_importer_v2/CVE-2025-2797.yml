aliases: []
summary: The Woffice Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in
  all versions up to, and including, 5.4.21. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the 'woffice_handle_user_approval_actions' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to approve registration for any user via a forged request granted they can trick
  a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
