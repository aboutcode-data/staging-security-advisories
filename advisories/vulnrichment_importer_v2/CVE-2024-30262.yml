aliases: []
summary: Contao is an open source content management system. Prior to version 4.13.40, when
  a frontend member changes their password in the personal data or the password lost module,
  the corresponding remember-me tokens are not removed. If someone compromises an account and
  is able to get a remember-me token, changing the password would not be enough to reclaim control
  over the account. Version 4.13.40 contains a fix for the issue. As a workaround, disable "Allow
  auto login" in the login module.
