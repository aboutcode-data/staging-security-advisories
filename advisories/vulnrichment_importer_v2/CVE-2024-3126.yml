datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2024-3126
datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2024/3xxx/CVE-2024-3126.json
aliases: []
summary: A command injection vulnerability exists in the 'run_xtts_api_server' function of the
  parisneo/lollms-webui application, specifically within the 'lollms_xtts.py' script. The vulnerability
  arises due to the improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command. The affected
  function utilizes 'subprocess.Popen' to execute a command constructed with a Python f-string,
  without adequately sanitizing the 'xtts_base_url' input. This flaw allows attackers to execute
  arbitrary commands remotely by manipulating the 'xtts_base_url' parameter. The vulnerability
  affects versions up to and including the latest version before 9.5. Successful exploitation
  could lead to arbitrary remote code execution (RCE) on the system where the application is
  deployed.
