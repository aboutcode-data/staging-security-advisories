aliases: []
summary: listmonk is a standalone, self-hosted, newsletter and mailing list manager. In versions
  up to and including 1.1.0, every http request in addition to the session cookie `session`
  there included `nonce`. The value is not checked and validated by the backend, removing `nonce`
  allows the requests to be processed correctly. This may seem harmless, but if chained to other
  vulnerabilities it can become a critical vulnerability. Cross-site request forgery and cross-site
  scripting chained together can result in improper admin account creation. As of time of publication,
  no patched versions are available.
