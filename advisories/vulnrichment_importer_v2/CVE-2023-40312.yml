aliases: []
summary: Multiple reflected XSS were found on different JSP files with unsanitized parameters
  in OpenMNS Horizon 31.0.8 and versions earlier than 32.0.2 on multiple platforms that an attacker
  can modify to craft a malicious XSS payload. The solution is to upgrade to Meridian 2023.1.6,
  2022.1.19, 2021.1.30, 2020.1.38 or Horizon 32.0.2 or newer. Meridian and Horizon installation
  instructions state that they are intended for installation within an organization's private
  networks and should not be directly accessible from the Internet. OpenNMS thanks Jordi Miralles
  Comins for reporting this issue.
