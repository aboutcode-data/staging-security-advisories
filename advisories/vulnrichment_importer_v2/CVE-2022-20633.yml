summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco&nbsp;ECE could allow\
  \ an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a username enumeration attack against an\
  \ affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to differences in authentication responses\
  \ that are sent back from the application as part of an authentication attempt. An attacker\
  \ could exploit this vulnerability by sending authentication requests to an affected device.\
  \ A successful exploit could allow the attacker to confirm existing user accounts, which could\
  \ be used in further attacks.\r\nCisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this\
  \ vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
