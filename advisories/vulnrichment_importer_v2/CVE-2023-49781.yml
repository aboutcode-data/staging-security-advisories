aliases: []
summary: NocoDB is software for building databases as spreadsheets. Prior to 0.202.9, a stored
  cross-site scripting vulnerability exists within the Formula virtual cell comments functionality.
  The nc-gui/components/virtual-cell/Formula.vue displays a v-html tag with the value of "urls"
  whose contents are processed by the function replaceUrlsWithLink(). This function recognizes
  the pattern URI::(XXX) and creates a hyperlink tag <a> with href=XXX. However, it leaves all
  the other contents outside of the pattern URI::(XXX) unchanged. This vulnerability is fixed
  in 0.202.9.
