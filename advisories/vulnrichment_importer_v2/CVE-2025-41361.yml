aliases: []
summary: Uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in IDF v0.10.0-0C03-03 and ZLF v0.10.0-0C03-04.
  The devices improperly handle TLS requests associated with PROCOME sockets, so TLS requests
  sent to those PROCOME ports could cause the device to reboot and result in a denial of service.
  To exploit this vulnerability, PROCOME ports must be configured and active, with communications
  encryption active.
