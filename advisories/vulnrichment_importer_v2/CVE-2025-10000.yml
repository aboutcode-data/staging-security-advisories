aliases: []
summary: The Qyrr – simply and modern QR-Code creation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the blob_to_file() function
  in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Contributor-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's
  server which may make remote code execution possible.
