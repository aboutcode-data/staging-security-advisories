aliases: []
summary: 'A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the kernel of
  Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of
  Service (DoS). In an MPLS scenario specific packets destined to an Integrated Routing and
  Bridging (irb) interface of the device will cause a buffer (mbuf) to leak. Continued receipt
  of these specific packets will eventually cause a loss of connectivity to and from the device,
  and requires a reboot to recover. These mbufs can be monitored by using the CLI command ''show
  system buffers'': user@host> show system buffers 783/1497/2280 mbufs in use (current/cache/total)
  user@host> show system buffers 793/1487/2280 mbufs in use (current/cache/total) <<<<<< mbuf
  usage increased This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS: All versions prior to 19.3R3-S7;
  19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S9; 20.1 version 20.1R1 and later versions; 20.2 versions prior
  to 20.2R3-S5; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S5; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S4; 21.1 versions
  prior to 21.1R3-S3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S2; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S1; 21.4
  versions prior to 21.4R3; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R2.'
