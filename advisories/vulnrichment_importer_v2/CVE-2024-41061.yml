  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/amd/display: Fix array-index-out-of-bounds in dml2/FCLKChangeSupport

  [Why]
  Potential out of bounds access in dml2_calculate_rq_and_dlg_params()
  because the value of out_lowest_state_idx used as an index for FCLKChangeSupport
  array can be greater than 1.

  [How]
  Currently dml2 core specifies identical values for all FCLKChangeSupport
  elements. Always use index 0 in the condition to avoid out of bounds access.
