summary: Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. In affected versions
  an attacker can make craft an XHR request to poison the anonymous cache (for example, the
  cache may have a response with missing  preloaded data). This issue only affects anonymous
  visitors of the site. This problem has been patched in the latest version of Discourse. Users
  are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable anonymous cache by setting
  the `DISCOURSE_DISABLE_ANON_CACHE` environment variable to a non-empty value.
