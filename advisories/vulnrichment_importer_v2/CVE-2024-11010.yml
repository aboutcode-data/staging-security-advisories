aliases: []
summary: The FileOrganizer – Manage WordPress and Website Files plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Local JavaScript File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.4 via the 'default_lang'
  parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access
  and above, to include and execute arbitrary JavaScript files on the server, allowing the execution
  of any JavaScript code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain
  sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types
  can be uploaded and included.
