aliases: []
summary: iccDEV provides a set of libraries and tools that allow for the interaction, manipulation,
  and application of ICC color management profiles. Prior to version 2.3.1.2, a heap buffer
  over-read when the strlen() function attempts to read a non-null-terminated buffer potentially
  leaking heap memory contents and causing application termination. This vulnerability affects
  users of the iccDEV library who process ICC color profiles. ICC Profile Injection vulnerabilities
  arise when user-controllable input is incorporated into ICC profile data or other structured
  binary blobs in an unsafe manner. Version 2.3.1.2 contains a fix for the issue. No known workarounds
  are available.
