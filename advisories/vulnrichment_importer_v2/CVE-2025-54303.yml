aliases: []
summary: The Thermo Fisher Torrent Suite Django application 5.18.1 has weak default credentials,
  which are stored as fixtures for the Django ORM API. The ionadmin user account can be used
  to authenticate to default deployments with the password ionadmin. The user guide recommends
  changing default credentials; however, a password change policy for default administrative
  accounts is not enforced. Many deployments may retain default credentials, in which case an
  attacker is likely to be able to successfully authenticate with administrative privileges.
