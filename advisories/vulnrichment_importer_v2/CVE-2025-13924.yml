aliases: []
summary: The Advanced Product Fields (Product Addons) for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is
  vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.17. This
  is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'maybe_duplicate' function. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to duplicate and publish product field groups, including
  draft and pending field groups, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
