aliases: []
summary: The MStore API – Create Native Android & iOS Apps On The Cloud plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 4.15.2. This is due
  to the use of loose comparison in the 'verify_id_token' function. This makes it possible for
  unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator,
  if they have access to an @flutter.io email address or phone number. This also requires firebase
  to be configured on the website and the user to have set up firebase for their account.
