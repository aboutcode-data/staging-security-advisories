aliases: []
summary: 'ClipBucket is a web-based video-sharing platform. In ClipBucket version 5.5.2 - #146
  and earlier, the /admin_area/template_editor.php endpoint is vulnerable to path traversal.
  The validation of the file-loading path is inadequate, allowing authenticated administrators
  to read and write arbitrary files outside the intended template directory by inserting path
  traversal sequences into the folder parameter. An attacker with administrator privileges can
  exploit this vulnerability to read sensitive files such as /etc/passwd and modify writable
  files on the system, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure and compromise
  of the application or server. This issue is fixed in version 5.5.2 - #147.'
