aliases: []
summary: The Homey theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions
  up to, and including, 2.4.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'homey_verify_user_manually'
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update verify an user via
  a forged request, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such
  as clicking on a link.
