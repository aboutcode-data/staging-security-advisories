aliases: []
summary: The Run Log plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all
  versions up to, and including, 1.7.10. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the oirl_plugin_options function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to modify plugin settings including distance units, pace display preferences, style themes,
  and display positions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
  performing an action such as clicking on a link.
