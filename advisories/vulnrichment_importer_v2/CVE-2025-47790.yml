aliases: []
summary: Nextcloud Server is a self hosted personal cloud system. Nextcloud Server prior to
  29.0.15, 30.0.9, and 31.0.3 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server prior to 26.0.13.15, 27.1.11.15,
  28.0.14.6, 29.0.15, 30.0.9, and 31.0.3 have a bug with session handling. The bug caused skipping
  the second factor confirmation after a successful login with the username and password when
  the server was configured with `remember_login_cookie_lifetime` set to `0`, once the session
  expired on the page to select the second factor and the page is reloaded. Nextcloud Server
  29.0.15, 30.0.9, and 31.0.3 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server is upgraded to 26.0.13.15, 27.1.11.15,
  28.0.14.6, 29.0.15, 30.0.9 and 31.0.3 contain a patch. As a workaround, set the `remember_login_cookie_lifetime`
  in config.php to a value other than `0`, e.g. `900`. Beware that this is only a workaround
  for new sessions created after the configuration change. System administration can delete
  affected sessions.
