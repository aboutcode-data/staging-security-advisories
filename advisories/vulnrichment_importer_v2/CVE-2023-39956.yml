aliases: []
summary: 'Electron is a framework which lets you write cross-platform desktop applications using
  JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Electron apps that are launched as command line executables are
  impacted.   Specifically this issue can only be exploited if the following conditions are
  met: 1. The app is launched with an attacker-controlled working directory and 2. The attacker
  has the ability to write files to that working directory. This makes the risk quite low, in
  fact normally issues of this kind are considered outside of our threat model as similar to
  Chromium we exclude Physically Local Attacks but given the ability for this issue to bypass
  certain protections like ASAR Integrity it is being treated with higher importance.  This
  issue has been fixed in versions:`26.0.0-beta.13`, `25.4.1`, `24.7.1`, `23.3.13`, and `22.3.19`.
  There are no app side workarounds, users must update to a patched version of Electron.'
