aliases: []
summary: The Flatsome theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the
  plugin's shortcode(s) in all versions up to, and including, 3.18.7 due to insufficient input
  sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
  that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
