aliases: []
summary: conda-smithy is a tool for combining a conda recipe with configurations to build using
  freely hosted CI services into a single repository. Prior to version 3.47.1, the travis_headers
  function in the conda-smithy repository creates files with permissions exceeding 0o600, allowing
  read and write access beyond the intended user/owner. This violates the principle of least
  privilege, which mandates restricting file permissions to the minimum necessary. An attacker
  could exploit this to access configuration files in shared hosting environments. This issue
  has been patched in version 3.47.1.
