aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  wifi: rtw89: fw: scan offload prohibit all 6 GHz channel if no 6 GHz sband

  We have some policy via BIOS to block uses of 6 GHz. In this case, 6 GHz
  sband will be NULL even if it is WiFi 7 chip. So, add NULL handling here
  to avoid crash.
