aliases: []
summary: The Beauty theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the
  ‘tpl_featured_cat_id’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.4 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
  execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
