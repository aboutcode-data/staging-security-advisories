aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web portal of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS)
  could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view a password in clear text. The vulnerability
  is due to incorrectly logging the admin password when a user is forced to modify the default
  password when logging in to the web portal for the first time. Subsequent password changes
  are not logged and other accounts are not affected. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by viewing the admin clear text password and using it to access the affected system. The attacker
  would need a valid user account to exploit this vulnerability.
