aliases: []
summary: jinjava is a Java-based template engine based on django template syntax, adapted to
  render jinja templates. Priori to 2.8.1, by using mapper.getTypeFactory().constructFromCanonical(),
  it is possible to instruct the underlying ObjectMapper to deserialize attacker-controlled
  input into arbitrary classes. This enables the creation of semi-arbitrary class instances
  without directly invoking restricted methods or class literals. As a result, an attacker can
  escape the sandbox and instantiate classes such as java.net.URL, opening up the ability to
  access local files and URLs(e.g., file:///etc/passwd). With further chaining, this primitive
  can potentially lead to remote code execution (RCE). This vulnerability is fixed in 2.8.1.
