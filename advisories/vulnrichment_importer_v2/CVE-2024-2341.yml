aliases: []
summary: The Appointment Booking Calendar — Simply Schedule Appointments Booking Plugin plugin
  for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the keys parameter in all versions up to,
  and including, 1.6.7.7 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack
  of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with subscriber access and above,  to append additional SQL queries into already
  existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
