  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  s390/dasd: protect device queue against concurrent access

  In dasd_profile_start() the amount of requests on the device queue are
  counted. The access to the device queue is unprotected against
  concurrent access. With a lot of parallel I/O, especially with alias
  devices enabled, the device queue can change while dasd_profile_start()
  is accessing the queue. In the worst case this leads to a kernel panic
  due to incorrect pointer accesses.

  Fix this by taking the device lock before accessing the queue and
  counting the requests. Additionally the check for a valid profile data
  pointer can be done earlier to avoid unnecessary locking in a hot path.
