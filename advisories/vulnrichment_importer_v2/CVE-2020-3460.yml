aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Data Center Network
  Manager (DCNM) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attack against a user of the interface. The vulnerability exists because the web-based
  management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by intercepting a request from a user and injecting malicious data into
  an HTTP header. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script
  code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.
