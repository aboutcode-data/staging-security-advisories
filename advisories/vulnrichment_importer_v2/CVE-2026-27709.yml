aliases: []
summary: NanaZip is an open source file archive. Starting in version 5.0.1252.0 and prior to
  versions 6.0.1638.0 and 6.5.1638.0, NanaZip’s `.NET Single File Application` parser has an
  out-of-bounds read vulnerability in manifest parsing. A crafted bundle can provide a malformed
  `RelativePathLength` so the parser constructs a `std::string` from memory beyond `HeaderBuffer`,
  leading to crash and potential in-process memory disclosure. Versions 6.0.1638.0 and 6.5.1638.0
  fix the issue.
