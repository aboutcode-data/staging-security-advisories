aliases: []
summary: The WordPress Automatic Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary options updates
  in versions up to, and including, 3.53.2. This is due to missing authorization and option
  validation in the process_form.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to arbitrarily update the settings of a vulnerable site and ultimately compromise the entire
  site.
