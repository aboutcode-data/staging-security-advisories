aliases: []
summary: Nero BackItUp in the Nero Productline is vulnerable to a path parsing/UI rendering
  flaw (CWE-22) that, in combination with Windows ShellExecuteW fallback extension resolution,
  leads to arbitrary code execution when a user clicks a crafted entry. By creating a trailing-dot
  folder and placing a same-basename script, Nero BackItUp renders the file as a folder icon
  and then invokes ShellExecuteW, which executes the script via PATHEXT fallback (.COM/.EXE/.BAT/.CMD).
  The issue affects recent Nero BackItUp product lines (2019-2025 and earlier) and has been
  acknowledged by the vendor.
