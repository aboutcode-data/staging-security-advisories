summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco IOS XE New Generation
  Wireless Controller (NGWC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site
  request forgery (CSRF) attack and perform arbitrary actions on an affected device. The vulnerability
  is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of the affected
  software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface
  to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary
  actions on an affected device by using a web browser and with the privileges of the user.
