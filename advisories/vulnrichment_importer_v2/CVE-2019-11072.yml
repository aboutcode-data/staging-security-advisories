aliases: []
summary: 'lighttpd before 1.4.54 has a signed integer overflow, which might allow remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact
  via a malicious HTTP GET request, as demonstrated by mishandling of /%2F? in burl_normalize_2F_to_slash_fix
  in burl.c. NOTE: The developer states "The feature which can be abused to cause the crash
  is a new feature in lighttpd 1.4.50, and is not enabled by default. It must be explicitly
  configured in the config file (e.g. lighttpd.conf). Certain input will trigger an abort()
  in lighttpd when that feature is enabled. lighttpd detects the underflow or realloc() will
  fail (in both 32-bit and 64-bit executables), also detected in lighttpd. Either triggers an
  explicit abort() by lighttpd. This is not exploitable beyond triggering the explicit abort()
  with subsequent application exit.'
