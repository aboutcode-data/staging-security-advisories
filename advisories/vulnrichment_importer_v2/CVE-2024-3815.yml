summary: The Newspaper theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via
  attachment meta in the archive page in all versions up to, and including, 12.6.5 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts
  in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
