aliases: []
summary: The Nested Pages plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in
  all versions up to, and including, 3.2.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the 'settingsPage' function and missing santization of the 'tab' parameter. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to call local php files via a forged request granted
  they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
