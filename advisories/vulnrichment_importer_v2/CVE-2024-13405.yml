summary: The Apptivo Business Site CRM plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce

  to block IP addresses via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
  performing an action such as clicking on a link.
