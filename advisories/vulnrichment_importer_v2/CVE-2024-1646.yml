aliases: []
summary: parisneo/lollms-webui is vulnerable to authentication bypass due to insufficient protection
  over sensitive endpoints. The application checks if the host parameter is not '0.0.0.0' to
  restrict access, which is inadequate when the application is bound to a specific interface,
  allowing unauthorized access to endpoints such as '/restart_program', '/update_software',
  '/check_update', '/start_recording', and '/stop_recording'. This vulnerability can lead to
  denial of service, unauthorized disabling or overriding of recordings, and potentially other
  impacts if certain features are enabled in the configuration.
