summary: A vulnerability in the ObsidianReader class of the run-llama/llama_index repository,
  specifically in version 0.12.27, allows for hardlink-based path traversal. This flaw permits
  attackers to bypass path restrictions and access sensitive system files, such as /etc/passwd,
  by exploiting hardlinks. The vulnerability arises from inadequate handling of hardlinks in
  the load_data() method, where the security checks fail to differentiate between real files
  and hardlinks. This issue is resolved in version 0.5.2.
