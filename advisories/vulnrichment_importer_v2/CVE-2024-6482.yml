aliases: []
summary: The Login with phone number plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.49. This is due to a lack of validation and missing
  capability check on user-supplied data in the 'lwp_update_password_action' function. This
  makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to
  update their role to any other role, including Administrator. The vulnerability was partially
  patched in version 1.7.40. The login with phone number pro plugin was required to exploit
  the vulnerability in versions 1.7.40 - 1.7.49.
