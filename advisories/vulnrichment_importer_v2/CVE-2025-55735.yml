aliases: []
summary: flaskBlog is a blog app built with Flask. In 2.8.0 and earlier, when creating a post,
  there's no validation of the content of the post stored in the variable "postContent". The
  vulnerability arises when displaying the content of the post using the | safe filter, that
  tells the engine to not escape the rendered content. This can lead to a stored XSS inside
  the content of the post. The code that causes the problem is in template/routes.html.
