summary: "A vulnerability in the system file permission handling of Cisco APIC could allow an\
  \ authenticated, local attacker to overwrite critical system files, which could cause a DoS\
  \ condition. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials.\r\
  \n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to a race condition with handling system files. An attacker\
