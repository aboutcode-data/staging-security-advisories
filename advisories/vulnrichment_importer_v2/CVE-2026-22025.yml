aliases: []
summary: CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security
  Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running
  the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. Prior to version 1.4.3, when the KMC server
  returns a non-200 HTTP status code, cryptography_encrypt() and cryptography_decrypt() return
  immediately without freeing previously allocated buffers. Each failed request leaks approximately
  467 bytes. Repeated failures (from a malicious server or network issues) can gradually exhaust
  memory. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.3.
