aliases: []
summary: In mlflow/mlflow version 2.17.2, the `/graphql` endpoint is vulnerable to a denial
  of service attack. An attacker can create large batches of queries that repeatedly request
  all runs from a given experiment. This can tie up all the workers allocated by MLFlow, rendering
  the application unable to respond to other requests. This vulnerability is due to uncontrolled
  resource consumption.
