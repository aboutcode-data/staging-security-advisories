aliases: []
summary: The /n software IPWorks SSH library SFTPServer component can be induced to make unintended
  filesystem or network path requests when loading a SSH public key or certificate. To be exploitable,
  an application calling the SFTPServer component must grant user access without verifying the
  SSH public key or certificate (which would most likely be a separate vulnerability in the
  calling application). IPWorks SSH versions 22.0.8945 and 24.0.8945 were released to address
  this condition by blocking all filesystem and network path requests for SSH public keys or
  certificates.
