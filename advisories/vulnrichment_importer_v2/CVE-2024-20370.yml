aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Cisco FXOS CLI feature on specific hardware platforms for Cisco
  Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software
  could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate their administrative privileges to
  root. The attacker would need valid administrative credentials on the device to exploit this
  vulnerability. This vulnerability exists because certain system configurations and executable
  files have insecure storage and permissions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by authenticating on the device and then performing a series of steps that includes downloading
  malicious system files and accessing the Cisco FXOS CLI to configure the attack. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to obtain root access on the device.
