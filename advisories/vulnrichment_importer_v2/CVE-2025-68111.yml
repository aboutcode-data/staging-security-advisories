summary: ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. In versions prior to 6.5.3, a
  SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `eGive.php` file within the "ReImport" functionality.
  An authenticated user with finance privileges can execute arbitrary SQL queries by manipulating
  the `MissingEgive_FamID_...` POST parameter. This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification,
  or deletion within the database. Version 6.5.3 has a patch for the issue.
