aliases: []
summary: The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted
  input via the 'file[package_dir]' parameter in versions up to, and including 3.2.49. This
  makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor privileges and above to call
  files using a PHAR wrapper that will deserialize the data and call arbitrary PHP Objects that
  can be used to perform a variety of malicious actions granted a POP chain is also present.
  It also requires that the attacker is successful in uploading a file with the serialized payload.
