aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the role-based access control of Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software could
  allow an authenticated, local attacker with read-only privileges to obtain administrative
  privileges by using the console port when the device is in the default SD-WAN configuration.
  This vulnerability occurs because the default configuration is applied for console authentication
  and authorization. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the console
  port and authenticating as a read-only user. A successful exploit could allow a user with
  read-only permissions to access administrative privileges.
