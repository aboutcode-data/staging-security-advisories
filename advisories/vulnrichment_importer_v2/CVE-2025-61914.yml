aliases: []
summary: n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. Prior to version 1.114.0, a stored
  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability may occur in n8n when using the “Respond to Webhook”
  node. When this node responds with HTML content containing executable scripts, the payload
  may execute directly in the top-level window, rather than within the expected sandbox introduced
  in version 1.103.0. This behavior can enable a malicious actor with workflow creation permissions
  to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the n8n editor interface. This issue has
  been patched in version 1.114.0. Workarounds for this issue involve restricting workflow creation
  and modification privileges to trusted users only, avoiding use of untrusted HTML responses
  in the “Respond to Webhook” node, and using an external reverse proxy or HTML sanitizer to
  filter responses that include executable scripts.
