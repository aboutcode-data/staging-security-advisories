  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  habanalabs/gaudi: Fix a potential use after free in gaudi_memset_device_memory

  Our code analyzer reported a uaf.

  In gaudi_memset_device_memory, cb is get via hl_cb_kernel_create()
  with 2 refcount.
  If hl_cs_allocate_job() failed, the execution runs into release_cb
  branch. One ref of cb is dropped by hl_cb_put(cb) and could be freed
  if other thread also drops one ref. Then cb is used by cb->id later,
  which is a potential uaf.

  My patch add a variable 'id' to accept the value of cb->id before the
  hl_cb_put(cb) is called, to avoid the potential uaf.
