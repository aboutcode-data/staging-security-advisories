aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Fort before 1.6.3. A malicious RPKI repository that descends
  from a (trusted) Trust Anchor can serve (via rsync or RRDP) a resource certificate containing
  an Authority Key Identifier extension that lacks the keyIdentifier field. Fort references
  this pointer without sanitizing it first. Because Fort is an RPKI Relying Party, a crash can
  lead to Route Origin Validation unavailability, which can lead to compromised routing.
