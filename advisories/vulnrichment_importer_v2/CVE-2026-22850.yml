aliases: []
summary: Koko Analytics is an open-source analytics plugin for WordPress. Versions prior to
  2.1.3 are vulnerable to arbitrary SQL execution through unescaped analytics export/import
  and permissive admin SQL import. Unauthenticated visitors can submit arbitrary path (`pa`)
  and referrer (`r`) values to the public tracking endpoint in src/Resources/functions/collect.php,
  which stores those strings verbatim in the analytics tables. The admin export logic in src/Admin/Data_Export.php
  writes these stored values directly into SQL INSERT statements without escaping. A crafted
  path such as "),('999','x');DROP TABLE wp_users;-- breaks out of the value list. When an administrator
  later imports that export file, the import handler in src/Admin/Data_Import.php reads the
  uploaded SQL with file_get_contents, performs only a superficial header check, splits on semicolons,
  and executes each statement via $wpdb->query with no validation of table names or statement
  types. Additionally, any authenticated user with manage_koko_analytics can upload an arbitrary
  .sql file and have it executed in the same permissive way. Combined, attacker-controlled input
  flows from the tracking endpoint into exported SQL and through the import execution sink,
  or directly via malicious uploads, enabling arbitrary SQL execution. In a worst-case scenario,
  attackers can achieve arbitrary SQL execution on the WordPress database, allowing deletion
  of core tables (e.g., wp_users), insertion of backdoor administrator accounts, or other destructive/privilege-escalating
  actions. Version 2.1.3 patches the issue.
