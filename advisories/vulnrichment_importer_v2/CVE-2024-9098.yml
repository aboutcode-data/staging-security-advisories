aliases: []
summary: In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.30, a privilege escalation vulnerability exists
  where admins can invite new members with billing permissions, thereby gaining unauthorized
  access to billing resources. This issue arises because the user creation endpoint does not
  restrict admins from inviting users with billing roles. As a result, admins can circumvent
  the intended access control, posing a risk to the organization's financial resources.
