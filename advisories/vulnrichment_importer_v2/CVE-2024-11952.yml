aliases: []
summary: The Classic Addons – WPBakery Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Limited
  Local PHP File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 3.0 via the 'style' parameter.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above,
  and permissions granted by an Administrator, to include and execute arbitrary files on the
  server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass
  access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and
  other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included. The vulnerability is limited to PHP
  files in a Windows environment.
