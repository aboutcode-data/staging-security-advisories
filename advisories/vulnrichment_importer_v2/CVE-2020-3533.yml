aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) input packet processor
  of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to cause an affected device to restart unexpectedly. The vulnerability is due to a lack of
  sufficient memory management protections under heavy SNMP polling loads. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of SNMP requests to the SNMP daemon through
  the management interface on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to cause the SNMP daemon process to consume a large amount of system memory over time, which
  could then lead to an unexpected device restart, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition.
  This vulnerability affects all versions of SNMP.
