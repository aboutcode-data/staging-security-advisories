summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management
  Center (FMC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected system. The
  vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management
  interface of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading
  a user to access a report containing malicious content. A successful exploit could allow the
  attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access
  sensitive, browser-based information. Versions 6.2.3, 6.3.0, and 6.4.0 are affected.
