summary: "A vulnerability in system resource management in Cisco UCS 6400 and 6500 Series Fabric\
  \ Interconnects that are in Intersight Managed Mode (IMM) could allow an unauthenticated,\
  \ remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on the Device Console UI of\
  \ an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to insufficient rate-limiting of TCP\
  \ connections to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending\
  \ a high number of TCP packets to the Device Console UI. A successful exploit could allow\
  \ an attacker to cause the Device Console UI process to crash, resulting in a DoS condition.\
  \ A manual reload of the fabric interconnect is needed to restore complete functionality."
