aliases: []
summary: PHPSpreadsheet is a pure PHP library for reading and writing spreadsheet files. In
  affected versions `\PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Writer\Html` doesn't sanitize spreadsheet styling
  information such as font names, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript on the
  page. As a result an attacker may used a crafted spreadsheet to fully takeover a session of
  a user viewing spreadsheet files as HTML. This issue has been addressed in release version
  2.1.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
