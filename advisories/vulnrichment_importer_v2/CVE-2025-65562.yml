aliases: []
summary: The free5GC UPF suffers from a lack of bounds checking on the SEID when processing
  PFCP Session Deletion Requests. An unauthenticated remote attacker can send a request with
  a very large SEID (e.g., 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) that causes an integer conversion/underflow in
  LocalNode.DeleteSess() / LocalNode.Sess() when a uint64 SEID is converted to int and used
  in index arithmetic. This leads to a negative index into n.sess and a Go runtime panic, resulting
  in a denial of service (UPF crash). The issue has been reproduced on free5GC v4.1.0 with crashes
  observed in the session lookup/deletion path in internal/pfcp/node.go; other versions may
  also be affected. No authentication is required.
