aliases: []
summary: NeuVector supports login authentication through OpenID Connect. However, the TLS verification
  (which verifies the remote server's authenticity and integrity) for OpenID Connect is not
  enforced by default. As a result this may expose the system to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
