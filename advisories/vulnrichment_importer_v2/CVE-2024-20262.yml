aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) and SFTP feature of Cisco IOS XR\
  \ Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to create or overwrite files in a\
  \ system directory, which could lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition. The attacker\
  \ would require valid user credentials to perform this attack.\r\n\r This vulnerability is\
  \ due to a lack of proper validation of SCP and SFTP CLI input parameters. An attacker could\
  \ exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and issuing SCP or SFTP CLI commands\
  \ with specific parameters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to impact the functionality\
  \ of the device, which could lead to a DoS condition. The device may need to be manually rebooted\
  \ to recover.\r\n\r Note: This vulnerability is exploitable only when a local user invokes\
  \ SCP or SFTP commands at the Cisco IOS XR CLI. A local user with administrative privileges\
  \ could exploit this vulnerability remotely."
