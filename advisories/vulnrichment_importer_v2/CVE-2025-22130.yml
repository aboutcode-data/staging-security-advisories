aliases: []
summary: Soft Serve is a self-hostable Git server for the command line. Prior to 0.8.2 , a path
  traversal attack allows existing non-admin users to access and take over other user's repositories.
  A malicious user then can modify, delete, and arbitrarily repositories as if they were an
  admin user without explicitly giving them permissions. This is patched in v0.8.2.
