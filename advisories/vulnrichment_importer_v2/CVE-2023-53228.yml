  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/amdgpu: drop redundant sched job cleanup when cs is aborted

  Once command submission failed due to userptr invalidation in
  amdgpu_cs_submit, legacy code will perform cleanup of scheduler
  job. However, it's not needed at all, as former commit has integrated
  job cleanup stuff into amdgpu_job_free. Otherwise, because of double
  free, a NULL pointer dereference will occur in such scenario.
