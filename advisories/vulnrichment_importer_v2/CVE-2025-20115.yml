summary: "A vulnerability in confederation implementation for the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)&nbsp;in\
  \ Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial\
  \ of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to a memory corruption that\
  \ occurs when a BGP update is created with an AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE attribute that has 255 autonomous\
  \ system numbers (AS numbers). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted\
  \ BGP update message, or the network could be designed in such a manner that the AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE\
  \ attribute grows to 255 AS numbers or more. A successful exploit could allow the attacker\
  \ to cause memory corruption, which may cause the BGP process to restart, resulting in a DoS\
  \ condition. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must control a BGP confederation speaker\
  \ within the same autonomous system as the victim, or the network must be designed in such\
  \ a manner that the AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE attribute grows to 255 AS numbers or more."
