aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Rate Limiting Network Address Translation (NAT) feature of Cisco
  IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause high CPU utilization
  in the Cisco QuantumFlow Processor of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service
  (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to mishandling of the rate limiting feature within
  the QuantumFlow Processor. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending large amounts
  of traffic that would be subject to NAT and rate limiting through an affected device. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to cause the QuantumFlow Processor utilization to reach 100
  percent on the affected device, resulting in a DoS condition.
