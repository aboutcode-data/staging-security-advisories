aliases: []
summary: "Smartwares cameras CIP-37210AT and C724IP, as well as others which share the same\
  \ firmware in versions up to 3.3.0, are vulnerable to command injection. \nDuring the initialization\
  \ process, a user has to use a mobile app to provide devices with Access Point credentials.\
  \ This input is not properly sanitized, what allows for command injection.\nThe vendor has\
  \ not replied to reports, so the patching status remains unknown. Newer firmware versions\
  \ might be vulnerable as well."
