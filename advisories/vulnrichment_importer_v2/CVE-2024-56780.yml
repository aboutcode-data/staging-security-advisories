summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  quota: flush quota_release_work upon quota writeback

  One of the paths quota writeback is called from is:

  freeze_super()
    sync_filesystem()
      ext4_sync_fs()
        dquot_writeback_dquots()

  Since we currently don't always flush the quota_release_work queue in
  this path, we can end up with the following race:

   1. dquot are added to releasing_dquots list during regular operations.
   2. FS Freeze starts, however, this does not flush the quota_release_work queue.
   3. Freeze completes.
   4. Kernel eventually tries to flush the workqueue while FS is frozen which
      hits a WARN_ON since transaction gets started during frozen state:

    ext4_journal_check_start+0x28/0x110 [ext4] (unreliable)
    __ext4_journal_start_sb+0x64/0x1c0 [ext4]
    ext4_release_dquot+0x90/0x1d0 [ext4]
    quota_release_workfn+0x43c/0x4d0

  Which is the following line:

    WARN_ON(sb->s_writers.frozen == SB_FREEZE_COMPLETE);

  Which ultimately results in generic/390 failing due to dmesg
  noise. This was detected on powerpc machine 15 cores.

  To avoid this, make sure to flush the workqueue during
  dquot_writeback_dquots() so we dont have any pending workitems after
  freeze.
