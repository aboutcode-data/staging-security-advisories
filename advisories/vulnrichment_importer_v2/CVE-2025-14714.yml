aliases: []
summary: |
  An Authentication Bypass vulnerability existed where the application bundled an interpreter (Python) that inherits the Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) permissions granted by the user to the main application bundle




  By executing the bundled interpreter directly the attacker's scripts run with the application's TCC privileges




  In fixed versions parent-constraints are used to allow only the main application to launch interpreter with those permissions

  This issue affects LibreOffice on macOS: from 25.2 before < 25.2.4.
