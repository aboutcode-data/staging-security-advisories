aliases: []
summary: The Newsletters plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions
  up to, and including, 4.9.9.2. This is due to the plugin not restricting what user meta can
  be updated as screen options. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level
  access and above, to escalate their privileges to that of an administrator. Please note that
  this only affects users with access to edit/update screen options, which means an administrator
  would need to grant lower privilege users with access to the Sent & Draft Emails page of the
  plugin in order for this to be exploited.
