aliases: []
summary: D-Tale is the combination of a Flask back-end and a React front-end to view & analyze
  Pandas data structures. Prior to version 3.7.0, users hosting D-Tale publicly can be vulnerable
  to remote code execution, allowing attackers to run malicious code on the server. This issue
  has been patched in version 3.7.0 by turning off "Custom Filter" input by default. The only
  workaround for versions earlier than 3.7.0 is to only host D-Tale to trusted users.
