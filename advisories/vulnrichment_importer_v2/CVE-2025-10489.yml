aliases: []
summary: The SureForms – Drag and Drop Contact Form Builder – Multi-step Forms, Conversational
  Forms and more plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized creation of forms due to
  a missing capability check on the register_post_types() function in all versions up to, and
  including, 1.12.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level
  access and above, to create forms when the user interface specifically prohibits it.
