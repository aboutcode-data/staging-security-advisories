summary: A security issue in Sitevision version 10.3.1 and older allows a remote attacker, in
  certain (non-default) scenarios, to gain access to the private keys used for signing SAML
  Authn requests. The underlying issue is a Java keystore that may become accessible and downloadable
  via WebDAV. This keystore is protected with a low-complexity, auto-generated password.
