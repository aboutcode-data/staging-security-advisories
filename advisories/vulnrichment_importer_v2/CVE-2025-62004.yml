summary: BullWall Server Intrusion Protection (SIP) services are initialized after login services
  during system startup. A local, authenticated attacker can log in after boot and before SIP
  MFA is running. The SIP services do not retroactively enforce MFA or disconnect sessions that
  were not subject to SIP MFA. Versions 4.6.0.0, 4.6.0.6, 4.6.0.7, and 4.6.1.4 are affected.
  Other versions mayy also be affected. BullWall plans to improve detection method documentation.
