aliases: []
summary: All versions of the package node-qpdf are vulnerable to Command Injection such that
  the package-exported method encrypt() fails to sanitize its parameter input, which later flows
  into a sensitive command execution API. As a result, attackers may inject malicious commands
  once they can specify the input pdf file path.
