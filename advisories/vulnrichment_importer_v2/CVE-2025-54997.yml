aliases: []
summary: OpenBao exists to provide a software solution to manage, store, and distribute sensitive
  data including secrets, certificates, and keys. In versions 2.3.1 and below, some OpenBao
  deployments intentionally limit privileged API operators from executing system code or making
  network connections. However, these operators can bypass both restrictions through the audit
  subsystem by manipulating log prefixes. This allows unauthorized code execution and network
  access that violates the intended security model. This issue is fixed in version 2.3.2. To
  workaround, users can block access to sys/audit/* endpoints using explicit deny policies,
  but root operators cannot be restricted this way.
