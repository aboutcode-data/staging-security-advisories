aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV160,
  RV160W, RV260, RV260P, and RV260W VPN Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of an affected device. This
  vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation. An attacker could exploit this
  vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device using
  root-level privileges. Due to the nature of the vulnerability, only commands without parameters
  can be executed.
