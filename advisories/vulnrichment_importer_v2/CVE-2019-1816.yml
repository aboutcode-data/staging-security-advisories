summary: A vulnerability in the log subscription subsystem of the Cisco Web Security Appliance
  (WSA) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform command injection and elevate
  privileges to root. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input
  on the web and command-line interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating
  to the affected device and injecting scripting commands in the scope of the log subscription
  subsystem. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on
  the underlying operating system and elevate privileges to root.
