aliases: []
summary: Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Prior to versions 2.2.22, 3.1.20, and
  3.2.5, `Rack::Directory` generates an HTML directory index where each file entry is rendered
  as a clickable link. If a file exists on disk whose basename starts with the `javascript:`
  scheme (e.g. `javascript:alert(1)`), the generated index contains an anchor whose `href` is
  exactly `javascript:alert(1)`. Clicking the entry executes JavaScript in the browser (demonstrated
  with `alert(1)`). Versions 2.2.22, 3.1.20, and 3.2.5 fix the issue.
