aliases: []
summary: Due to a misconfiguration, the WARP Mobile Client (< 6.29) for Android was susceptible
  to a tapjacking attack. In the event that an attacker built a malicious application and managed
  to install it on a victim's device, the attacker would be able to trick the user into believing
  that the app shown on the screen was the WARP client when in reality it was the attacker's
  app.
