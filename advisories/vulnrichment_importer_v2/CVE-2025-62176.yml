aliases: []
summary: Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on ActivityPub. In Mastodon
  before 4.4.6, 4.3.14, and 4.2.27, the streaming server accepts serving events for public timelines
  to clients using any valid authentication token, even if those tokens lack the read:statuses
  scope. This allows OAuth clients without the read scope to subscribe to public channels and
  receive public timeline events. The impact is limited, as this only affects new public posts
  published on the public timelines and requires an otherwise valid token, but this may lead
  to unexpected access to public posts in a limited-federation setting. This issue has been
  patched in versions 4.4.6, 4.3.14, and 4.2.27. No known workarounds exist.
