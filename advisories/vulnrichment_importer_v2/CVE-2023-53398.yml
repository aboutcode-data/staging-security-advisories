  mlx5: fix possible ptp queue fifo use-after-free

  Fifo indexes are not checked during pop operations and it leads to
  potential use-after-free when poping from empty queue. Such case was
  possible during re-sync action. WARN_ON_ONCE covers future cases.

  There were out-of-order cqe spotted which lead to drain of the queue and
  use-after-free because of lack of fifo pointers check. Special check and
  counter are added to avoid resync operation if SKB could not exist in the
  fifo because of OOO cqe (skb_id must be between consumer and producer
  index).
