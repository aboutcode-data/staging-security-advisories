aliases: []
summary: LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries stored in an LDAP
  directory. LAM before 9.3 allows stored cross-site scripting in the Profile section via the
  profile name field, which renders untrusted input as HTML and executes a supplied script (for
  example a script element). An authenticated user with permission to create or edit a profile
  can insert a script payload into the profile name and have it executed when the profile data
  is viewed in a browser. This issue is fixed in version 9.3. No known workarounds are mentioned.
