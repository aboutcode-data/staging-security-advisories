aliases: []
summary: ssh in OpenSSH before 10.1 allows control characters in usernames that originate from
  certain possibly untrusted sources, potentially leading to code execution when a ProxyCommand
  is used. The untrusted sources are the command line and %-sequence expansion of a configuration
  file. (A configuration file that provides a complete literal username is not categorized as
  an untrusted source.)
