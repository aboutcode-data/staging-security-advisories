aliases: []
summary: 'One Identity by Quest Safeguard for Privileged Passwords Appliance 7.5.1.20903 is
  vulnerable to One Time Password (OTP)/Multifactor Authentication (MFA) bypass using response
  manipulation. An attacker who intercepts or captures a valid OTP response can bypass the OTP
  verification step by replaying the same response. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because,
  by design, the product successfully authenticates a client that possesses a cookie whose validity
  time interval includes the current time, and thus authentication after any type of "interception"
  is not a violation of the security model. (The cookie has the HttpOnly attribute.)'
