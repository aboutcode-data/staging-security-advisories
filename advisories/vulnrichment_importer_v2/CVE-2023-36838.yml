aliases: []
summary: |
  An Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability in the flow processing daemon (flowd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series allows a local, authenticated attacker with low privileges, to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

  If a low privileged user executes a specific CLI command, flowd which is responsible for traffic forwarding in SRX crashes and generates a core dump. This will cause temporary traffic interruption until the flowd process is restarted automatically. Continued execution of this command will lead to a sustained DoS.

  This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series:
  All versions prior to 20.2R3-S7;
  20.3 version 20.3R1 and later versions;
  20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S6;
  21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S5;
  21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S4;
  21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S4;
  21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S3;
  22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-S1;
  22.2 versions prior to 22.2R3;
  22.3 versions prior to 22.3R2;
  22.4 versions prior to 22.4R1-S1, 22.4R2.
