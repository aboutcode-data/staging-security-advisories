aliases: []
summary: OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to version 2026.2.15, `normalizeForHash`
  in `src/agents/sandbox/config-hash.ts` recursively sorted arrays that contained only primitive
  values. This made order-sensitive sandbox configuration arrays hash to the same value even
  when order changed. In OpenClaw sandbox flows, this hash is used to decide whether existing
  sandbox containers should be recreated. As a result, order-only config changes (for example
  Docker `dns` and `binds` array order) could be treated as unchanged and stale containers could
  be reused. This is a configuration integrity issue affecting sandbox recreation behavior.
  Starting in version 2026.2.15, array ordering is preserved during hash normalization; only
  object key ordering remains normalized for deterministic hashing.
