aliases: []
summary: OrangeHRM is a comprehensive human resource management (HRM) system. From version 5.0
  to 5.7, the application contains an input-neutralization flaw in its mail configuration and
  delivery workflow that allows user-controlled values to flow directly into the system’s sendmail
  command. Because these values are not sanitized or constrained before being incorporated into
  the command execution path, certain sendmail behaviors can be unintentionally invoked during
  email processing. This makes it possible for the application to write files on the server
  as part of the mail-handling routine, and in deployments where those files end up in web-accessible
  locations, the behavior can be leveraged to achieve execution of attacker-controlled content.
  The issue stems entirely from constructing OS-level command strings using unsanitized input
  within the mail-sending logic. This issue has been patched in version 5.8.
