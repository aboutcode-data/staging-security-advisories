aliases: []
summary: The csvtojson package, a tool for converting CSV data to JSON with customizable parsing
  capabilities, contains a prototype pollution vulnerability in versions prior to 2.0.10. This
  issue arises due to insufficient sanitization of nested header names during the parsing process
  in the parser_jsonarray component. When processing CSV input containing specially crafted
  header fields that reference prototype chains (e.g., using __proto__ syntax), the application
  may unintentionally modify properties of the base Object prototype. This vulnerability can
  lead to denial of service conditions or unexpected behavior in applications relying on unmodified
  prototype chains, particularly when untrusted CSV data is processed. The flaw does not require
  user interaction beyond providing a maliciously constructed CSV file.
