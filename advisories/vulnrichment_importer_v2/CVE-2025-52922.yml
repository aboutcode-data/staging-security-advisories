aliases: []
summary: 'Innoshop through 0.4.1 allows directory traversal via FileManager API endpoints. An
  authenticated attacker with access to the admin panel could abuse this to: (1) fully map the
  filesystem structure via the /api/file_manager/files?base_folder= endpoint, (2) create arbitrary
  directories on the server via the /api/file_manager/directories endpoint, (3) read arbitrary
  files from the server by copying the file to a readable location within the application via
  the /api/file_manager/copy_files endpoint, {4) delete arbitrary files from the server via
  a DELETE request to /api/file_manager/files, or (5) create arbitrary files on the server by
  uploading them and then leveraging the /api/file_manager/move_files endpoint to move them
  anywhere in the filesystem.'
