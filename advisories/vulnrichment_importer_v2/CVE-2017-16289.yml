aliases: []
summary: Multiple exploitable buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the PubNub message handler
  for the "cc" channel of Insteon Hub running firmware version 1012. Specially crafted commands
  sent through the PubNub service can cause a stack-based buffer overflow overwriting arbitrary
  data. An attacker should send an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.
  In cmd s_utc, at 0x9d0193ac, the value for the `offset` key is copied using `strcpy` to the
  buffer at `$sp+0x2d0`.This buffer is 100 bytes large, sending anything longer will cause a
  buffer overflow.
