aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in auxiliary asynchronous port (AUX) functions of Cisco IOS XE Software\
  \ could allow an authenticated, local attacker to cause an affected device to reload or stop\
  \ responding.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of specific ingress\
  \ traffic when flow control hardware is enabled on the AUX port. An attacker could exploit\
  \ this vulnerability by reverse telnetting to the AUX port and sending specific data after\
  \ connecting. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reset or\
  \ stop responding, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition."
