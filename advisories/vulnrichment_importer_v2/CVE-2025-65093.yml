aliases: []
summary: LibreNMS is an auto-discovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP based network monitoring tool. Prior
  to version 25.11.0, a boolean-based blind SQL injection vulnerability was identified in the
  LibreNMS application at the /ajax_output.php endpoint. The hostname parameter is interpolated
  directly into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameter binding, allowing an attacker
  to manipulate the query logic and infer data from the database through conditional responses.
  This issue has been patched in version 25.11.0.
