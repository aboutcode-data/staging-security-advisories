aliases: []
summary: In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.13, an insufficient granularity of access control vulnerability
  allows users to create, update, get, and delete prompt variations for datasets not owned by
  their organization. This issue arises due to the application not properly validating the ownership
  of dataset prompts and their variations against the organization or project of the requesting
  user. As a result, unauthorized modifications to dataset prompts can occur, leading to altered
  or removed dataset prompts without proper authorization. This vulnerability impacts the integrity
  and consistency of dataset information, potentially affecting the results of experiments.
