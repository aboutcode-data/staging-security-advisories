aliases: []
summary: File upload vulnerability in Fiora chat application 1.0.0 through user avatar upload
  functionality. The application fails to validate SVG file content, allowing malicious SVG
  files with embedded foreignObject elements containing iframe tags and JavaScript event handlers
  (onmouseover) to be uploaded and stored. When rendered, these SVG files execute arbitrary
  JavaScript, enabling attackers to steal user sessions, cookies, and perform unauthorized actions
  in the context of users viewing affected profiles.
