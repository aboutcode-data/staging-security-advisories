aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) could allow
  an authenticated, local attacker with administrative credentials to bypass restrictions on
  the CLI. The vulnerability is due to insufficient security mechanisms in the restricted shell
  implementation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted commands to
  the CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to escape the restricted shell and
  execute a set of normally unauthorized commands with the privileges of a non-root user. To
  exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have valid administrative credentials.
