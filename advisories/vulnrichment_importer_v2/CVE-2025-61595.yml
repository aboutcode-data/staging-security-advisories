aliases: []
summary: MANTRA is a purpose-built RWA Layer 1 Blockchain, capable of adherence to real world
  regulatory requirements. Versions 4.0.1 and below do not enforce the tx gas limit in its send
  hooks. Send hooks can spend more gas than what remains in tx, combined with recursive calls
  in the wasm contract, potentially amplifying the gas consumption exponentially. This is fixed
  in version 4.0.2.
