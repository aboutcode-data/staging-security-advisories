aliases: []
summary: '`@chainsafe/libp2p-noise` contains TypeScript implementation of noise protocol, an
  encryption protocol used in libp2p. `@chainsafe/libp2p-noise` before 4.1.2 and 5.0.3 does
  not correctly validate signatures during the handshake process. This may allow a man-in-the-middle
  to pose as other peers and get those peers banned. Users should upgrade to version 4.1.2 or
  5.0.3 to receive a patch. There are currently no known workarounds.'
