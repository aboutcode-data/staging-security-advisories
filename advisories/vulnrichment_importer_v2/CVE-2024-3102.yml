summary: A JSON Injection vulnerability exists in the `mintplex-labs/anything-llm` application,
  specifically within the username parameter during the login process at the `/api/request-token`
  endpoint. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of values, allowing attackers to
  perform brute force attacks without prior knowledge of the username. Once the password is
