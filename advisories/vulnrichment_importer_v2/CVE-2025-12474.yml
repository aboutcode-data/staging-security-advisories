aliases: []
summary: |
  A specially-crafted file can cause libjxl's decoder to read pixel data from uninitialized (but allocated) memory.

  This can be done by causing the decoder to reference an outside-image-bound area in a subsequent patches. An incorrect optimization causes the decoder to omit populating those areas.
