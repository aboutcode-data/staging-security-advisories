aliases: []
summary: The Download Plugins and Themes in ZIP from Dashboard plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.6. This is due to
  missing or incorrect nonce validation on the download_plugin_bulk and download_theme_bulk

  and themes and place them in the `wp-content/uploads/` directory via a forged request granted
  they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
