aliases: []
summary: diskover-web v2.3.0 Community Edition is vulnerable to multiple boolean-based blind
  SQL injection flaws in its Elasticsearch configuration form. Unsanitized user input in POST
  parameters such as ES_PASS, ES_MAXSIZE, ES_TRANSLOGSIZE, ES_TIMEOUT, ES_USER, ES_HOST, ES_PORT,
  ES_SCROLLSIZE, ES_CHUNKSIZE and others can be crafted to inject arbitrary SQLite expressions
  wrapped in JSON functions. By exploiting these injection points, an attacker can infer or
  extract sensitive information from the underlying database without authentication. This issue
  stems from improper input validation and parameterization in the application's JSON-based
  query construction.
