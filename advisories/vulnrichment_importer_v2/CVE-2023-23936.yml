aliases: []
summary: Undici is an HTTP/1.1 client for Node.js. Starting with version 2.0.0 and prior to
  version 5.19.1, the undici library does not protect `host` HTTP header from CRLF injection
  vulnerabilities. This issue is patched in Undici v5.19.1. As a workaround, sanitize the `headers.host`
  string before passing to undici.
