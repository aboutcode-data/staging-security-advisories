aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability was identified in the handling of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) fixed
  channels (such as SMP or ATT). Specifically, an attacker could exploit a flaw that causes
  the BLE target (i.e., the device under attack) to attempt to disconnect a fixed channel, which
  is not allowed per the Bluetooth specification. This leads to undefined behavior, including
  potential assertion failures, crashes, or memory corruption, depending on the BLE stack implementation.
