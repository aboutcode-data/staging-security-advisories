aliases: []
summary: |
  SAP Transportation Management (Collaboration
  Portal) allows an attacker with non-administrative privileges to send a crafted
  request from a vulnerable web application. This will trigger the application
  handler to send a request to an unintended service, which may reveal
  information about that service. The information obtained could be used to
  target internal systems behind firewalls that are normally inaccessible to an
  attacker from the external network, resulting in a Server-Side Request Forgery
  vulnerability. There is no effect on integrity or availability of the
  application.
