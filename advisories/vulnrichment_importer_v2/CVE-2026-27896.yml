aliases: []
summary: The Go MCP SDK used Go's standard encoding/json.Unmarshal for JSON-RPC and MCP protocol
  message parsing in versions prior to 1.3.1. Go's standard library performs case-insensitive
  matching of JSON keys to struct field tags — a field tagged json:"method" would also match
  "Method", "METHOD", etc. This violated the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification, which defines exact
  field names. A malicious MCP peer may have been able to send protocol messages with non-standard
  field casing that the SDK would silently accept. This had the potential for bypassing intermediary
  inspection and coss-implementation inconsistency. Go's standard JSON unmarshaling was replaced
  with a case-sensitive decoder in commit 7b8d81c. Users are advised to update to v1.3.1 to
  resolve this issue.
