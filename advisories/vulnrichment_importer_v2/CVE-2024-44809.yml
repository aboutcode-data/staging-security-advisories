aliases: []
summary: A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in the Pi Camera project, version
  1.0, maintained by RECANTHA. The issue arises from improper sanitization of user input passed
  to the "position" GET parameter in the tilt.php script. An attacker can exploit this by sending
  crafted input data that includes malicious command sequences, allowing arbitrary commands
  to be executed on the server with the privileges of the web server user. This vulnerability
  is exploitable remotely and poses significant risk if the application is exposed to untrusted
  networks.
