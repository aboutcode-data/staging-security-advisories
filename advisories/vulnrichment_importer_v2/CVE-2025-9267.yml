aliases: []
summary: In Seagate Toolkit on Windows a vulnerability exists in the Toolkit Installer prior
  to versions 2.35.0.6 where it attempts to load DLLs from the current working directory without
  validating their origin or integrity. This behavior can be exploited by placing a malicious
  DLL in the same directory as the installer executable, leading to arbitrary code execution
  with the privileges of the user running the installer. The issue stems from the use of insecure
  DLL loading practices, such as relying on relative paths or failing to specify fully qualified
  paths when invoking system libraries.
