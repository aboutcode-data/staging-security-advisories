aliases: []
summary: In pig-mesh Pig versions 3.8.2 and below, when setting up scheduled tasks in the Quartz
  management function under the system management module, it is possible to execute any Java
  class with a parameterless constructor and its methods with parameter type String through
  reflection. At this time, the eval method in Tomcat's built-in class jakarta.el.ELProcessor
  can be used to execute commands, leading to a remote code execution vulnerability.
