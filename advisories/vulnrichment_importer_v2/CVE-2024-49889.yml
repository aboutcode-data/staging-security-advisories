  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ext4: avoid use-after-free in ext4_ext_show_leaf()

  In ext4_find_extent(), path may be freed by error or be reallocated, so
  using a previously saved *ppath may have been freed and thus may trigger
  use-after-free, as follows:

  ext4_split_extent
    path = *ppath;
    ext4_split_extent_at(ppath)
    path = ext4_find_extent(ppath)
    ext4_split_extent_at(ppath)
      // ext4_find_extent fails to free path
      // but zeroout succeeds
    ext4_ext_show_leaf(inode, path)
      eh = path[depth].p_hdr
      // path use-after-free !!!

  Similar to ext4_split_extent_at(), we use *ppath directly as an input to
  ext4_ext_show_leaf(). Fix a spelling error by the way.

  Same problem in ext4_ext_handle_unwritten_extents(). Since 'path' is only
  used in ext4_ext_show_leaf(), remove 'path' and use *ppath directly.

  This issue is triggered only when EXT_DEBUG is defined and therefore does
  not affect functionality.
