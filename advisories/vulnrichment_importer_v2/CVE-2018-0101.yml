summary: 'A vulnerability in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) VPN functionality of the Cisco Adaptive
  Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause
  a reload of the affected system or to remotely execute code. The vulnerability is due to an
  attempt to double free a region of memory when the webvpn feature is enabled on the Cisco
  ASA device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple, crafted XML
  packets to a webvpn-configured interface on the affected system. An exploit could allow the
  attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the system, or cause a reload
  of the affected device. This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software that is running on the
  following Cisco products: 3000 Series Industrial Security Appliance (ISA), ASA 5500 Series
  Adaptive Security Appliances, ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls, ASA Services Module
