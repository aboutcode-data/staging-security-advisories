aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability exists in the HCI IEC 60870-5-104 function included in certain versions
  of the RTU500 series product. The vulnerability can only be exploited, if the HCI 60870-5-104
  is configured with support for IEC 62351-5 and the CMU contains the license feature ‘Advanced
  security’ which must be ordered separately. If these preconditions are fulfilled, an attacker
  could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted message to the RTU500, causing
  the targeted RTU500 CMU to reboot. The vulnerability is caused by a missing input data validation
  which eventually if exploited causes an internal buffer to overflow in the HCI IEC 60870-5-104
  function.
