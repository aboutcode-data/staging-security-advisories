aliases: []
summary: Frappe Learning Management System (LMS) is a learning system that helps users structure
  their content. Prior to 2.41.0, a flaw in the server-side authorization logic allowed authenticated
  users to perform actions beyond their assigned roles across multiple features. Because the
  affected endpoints relied on client-side or UI-level checks instead of enforcing permissions
  on the server, users with low-privileged roles (such as students) could perform operations
  intended only for instructors or administrators via directly using the API's. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 2.41.0.
