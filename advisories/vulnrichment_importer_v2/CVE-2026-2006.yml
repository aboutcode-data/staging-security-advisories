summary: Missing validation of multibyte character length in PostgreSQL text manipulation allows
  a database user to issue crafted queries that achieve a buffer overrun.  That suffices to
  execute arbitrary code as the operating system user running the database.  Versions before
  PostgreSQL 18.2, 17.8, 16.12, 15.16, and 14.21 are affected.
