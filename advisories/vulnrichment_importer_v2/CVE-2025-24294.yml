aliases: []
summary: "The attack vector is a potential Denial of Service (DoS). The vulnerability is caused\
  \ by an insufficient check on the length of a decompressed domain name within a DNS packet.\r\
  \n\r\nAn attacker can craft a malicious DNS packet containing a highly compressed domain name.\
  \ When the resolv library parses such a packet, the name decompression process consumes a\
  \ large amount of CPU resources, as the library does not limit the resulting length of the\
  \ name.\r\n\r\nThis resource consumption can cause the application thread to become unresponsive,\
  \ resulting in a Denial of Service condition."
