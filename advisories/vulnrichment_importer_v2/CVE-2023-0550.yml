aliases: []
summary: The Quick Restaurant Menu plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object
  Reference in versions up to, and including, 2.0.2. This is due to the fact that during menu
  item deletion/modification, the plugin does not verify that the post ID provided to the AJAX
  action is indeed a menu item. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level
  access or higher, to modify or delete arbitrary posts.
