aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the handling of encrypted wireless frames of Cisco Aironet Access\
  \ Point (AP) Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial\
  \ of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to incomplete\
  \ cleanup of resources when dropping certain malformed frames. An attacker could exploit this\
  \ vulnerability by connecting as a wireless client to an affected AP and sending specific\
  \ malformed frames over the wireless connection. A successful exploit could allow the attacker\
  \ to cause degradation of service to other clients, which could potentially lead to a complete\
  \ DoS condition."
