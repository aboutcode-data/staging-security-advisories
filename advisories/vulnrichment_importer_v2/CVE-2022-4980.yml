datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2022/4xxx/CVE-2022-4980.json
aliases: []
summary: General Bytes Crypto Application Server (CAS) beginning with version 20201208 prior
  to 20220531.38 (backport) and 20220725.22 (mainline) contains an authentication bypass in
  the admin web interface. An unauthenticated attacker could invoke the same URL used by the
  product's default-installation / first-admin creation page and create a new administrative
  account remotely. By gaining admin privileges, the attacker can change the ATM configuration
  resulting in redirected funds. Public vendor advisories and multiple independent writeups
  describe the vulnerability as a call to the page used for initial/default installation / first
  administration user creation; General Bytes has not publicly published the exact endpoint/parameter
  name. The issue was actively exploited in the wild against cloud-hosted and standalone CAS
  deployments (scanning exposed CAS instances on ports 7777/443), and publicly acknowledged
  by the General Bytes in September 2022.
