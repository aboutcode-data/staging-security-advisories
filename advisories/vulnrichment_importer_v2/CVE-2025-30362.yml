summary: WeGIA is a Web manager for charitable institutions. A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  vulnerability was identified in versions prior to 3.2.8. This vulnerability allows unauthorized
  scripts to be executed within the user's browser context. Stored XSS is particularly critical,
  as the malicious code is permanently stored on the server and executed whenever a compromised
  page is loaded, affecting all users accessing this page. Version 3.2.8 fixes the issue.
