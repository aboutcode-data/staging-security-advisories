summary: "A vulnerability in the SSH server of Cisco Catalyst Center, formerly Cisco DNA Center,\
  \ could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to impersonate a Cisco Catalyst Center appliance.\r\
  \n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to the presence of a static SSH host key. An attacker could\
  \ exploit this vulnerability by performing a machine-in-the-middle attack on SSH connections,\
  \ which could allow the attacker to intercept traffic between SSH clients and a Cisco Catalyst\
  \ Center appliance. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to impersonate the affected\
  \ appliance, inject commands into the terminal session, and steal valid user credentials."
