aliases: []
summary: 'OpenPLC Runtime v3 contains an input validation flaw in the /upload-program-action
  endpoint: the epoch_time field supplied during program uploads is not validated and can be
  crafted to induce corruption of the programs database. After a successful malformed upload
  the runtime continues to operate until a restart; on restart the runtime can fail to start
  because of corrupted database entries, resulting in persistent denial of service requiring
  complete rebase of the product to recover. This vulnerability was remediated by commit 095ee09.'
