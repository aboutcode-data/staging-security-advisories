aliases: []
summary: The Schedule Post Changes With PublishPress Future plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to authorization bypass in all versions up to, and including, 4.9.3. This is due to the plugin
  not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform an action. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to create, update, delete,
  and publish malicious workflows that may automatically delete any post upon publication or
  update, including posts created by administrators.
