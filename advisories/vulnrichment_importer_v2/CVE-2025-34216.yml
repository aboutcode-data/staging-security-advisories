aliases: []
summary: 'Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host prior to version 22.0.1026 and
  Application prior to version 20.0.2702 (VA deployments only) expose a set of unauthenticated
  REST API endpoints that return configuration files and clear‑text passwords. The same endpoints
  also disclose the Laravel APP_KEY used for cryptographic signing. Because the APP_KEY is required
  to generate valid signed requests, an attacker who obtains it can craft malicious payloads
  that are accepted by the application and achieve remote code execution on the appliance. This
  vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2024-018 — RCE & Leaks via API.'
