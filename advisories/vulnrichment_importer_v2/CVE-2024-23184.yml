aliases: []
summary: Having a large number of address headers (From, To, Cc, Bcc, etc.) becomes excessively
  CPU intensive. With 100k header lines CPU usage is already 12 seconds, and in a production
  environment we observed 500k header lines taking 18 minutes to parse. Since this can be triggered
  by external actors sending emails to a victim, this is a security issue. An external attacker
  can send specially crafted messages that consume target system resources and cause outage.
  One can implement restrictions on address headers on MTA component preceding Dovecot. No publicly
  available exploits are known.
