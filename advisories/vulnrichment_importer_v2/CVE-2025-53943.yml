summary: VoidBot Open-Source is a customizable Discord bot. VoidBot Open-Source versions 0.0.1
  through 0.8.1 contain a vulnerability in the command handler where permission checks are not
  properly enforced for certain administrative commands. This allows users without the required
  roles or privileges to execute sensitive commands such as `ban`, `kick`, or `shutdown`, potentially
  disrupting server operations. Version 1.0.0 fixes the issue.
