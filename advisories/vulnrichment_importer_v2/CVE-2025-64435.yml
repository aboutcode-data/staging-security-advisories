aliases: []
summary: KubeVirt is a virtual machine management add-on for Kubernetes. Prior to 1.7.0-beta.0,
  a logic flaw in the virt-controller allows an attacker to disrupt the control over a running
  VMI by creating a pod with the same labels as the legitimate virt-launcher pod associated
  with the VMI. This can mislead the virt-controller into associating the fake pod with the
  VMI, resulting in incorrect status updates and potentially causing a DoS (Denial-of-Service).
  This vulnerability is fixed in 1.7.0-beta.0.
