aliases: []
summary: The The Enable Shortcodes inside Widgets,Comments and Experts plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0.
  This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate
  a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to execute arbitrary shortcodes.
