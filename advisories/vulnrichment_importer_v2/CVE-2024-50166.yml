  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  fsl/fman: Fix refcount handling of fman-related devices

  In mac_probe() there are multiple calls to of_find_device_by_node(),
  fman_bind() and fman_port_bind() which takes references to of_dev->dev.
  Not all references taken by these calls are released later on error path
  in mac_probe() and in mac_remove() which lead to reference leaks.

  Add references release.
