summary: LibreNMS is an auto-discovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP based network monitoring tool. Versions
  25.12.0 and below have a Time-Based Blind SQL Injection vulnerability in address-search.inc.php
  via the address parameter. When a crafted subnet prefix is supplied, the prefix value is concatenated
  directly into an SQL query without proper parameter binding, allowing an attacker to manipulate
  query logic and infer database information through time-based conditional responses. This
  vulnerability requires authentication and is exploitable by any authenticated user. This issue
  has been fixedd in version 26.2.0.
