summary: Cybersecurity AI (CAI) is a framework for AI Security. In versions up to and including
  0.5.10, the CAI (Cybersecurity AI) framework contains multiple argument injection vulnerabilities
  in its function tools. User-controlled input is passed directly to shell commands via `subprocess.Popen()`
  with `shell=True`, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the host system. The
  `find_file()` tool executes without requiring user approval because find is considered a "safe"
  pre-approved command. This means an attacker can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) by injecting
  malicious arguments (like -exec) into the args parameter, completely bypassing any human-in-the-loop
  safety mechanisms. Commit e22a1220f764e2d7cf9da6d6144926f53ca01cde contains a fix.
