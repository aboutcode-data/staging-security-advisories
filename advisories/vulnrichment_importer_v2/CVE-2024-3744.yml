aliases: []
summary: A security issue was discovered in azure-file-csi-driver where an actor with access
  to the driver logs could observe service account tokens. These tokens could then potentially
  be exchanged with external cloud providers to access secrets stored in cloud vault solutions.
  Tokens are only logged when TokenRequests is configured in the CSIDriver object and the driver
  is set to run at log level 2 or greater via the -v flag.
