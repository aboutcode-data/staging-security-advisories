aliases: []
summary: ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital
  images. Prior to version 7.1.2-1, ImageMagick is vulnerable to heap-buffer overflow read around
  the handling of images with separate alpha channels when performing image magnification in
  ReadOneMNGIMage. This can likely be used to leak subsequent memory contents into the output
  image. This issue has been patched in version 7.1.2-1.
