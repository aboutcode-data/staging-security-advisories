aliases: []
summary: The Ibexa Admin UI Bundle contains all the necessary parts to run the Ibexa DXP Back
  Office interface. The file upload widget is vulnerable to XSS payloads in filenames. Access
  permission to upload files is required. As such, in most cases only authenticated editors
  and administrators will have the required permission. It is not persistent, i.e. the payload
  is only executed during the upload. In effect, an attacker will have to trick an editor/administrator
  into uploading a strangely named file.
