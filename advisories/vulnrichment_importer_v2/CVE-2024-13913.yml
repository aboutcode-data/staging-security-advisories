aliases: []
summary: The InstaWP Connect – 1-click WP Staging & Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 0.1.0.83. This is due
  to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the '/migrate/templates/main.php' file. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the server,
  allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls,
  obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file
  types can be uploaded and included.
