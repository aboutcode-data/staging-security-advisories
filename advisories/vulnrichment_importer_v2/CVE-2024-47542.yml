datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2024/47xxx/CVE-2024-47542.json
aliases: []
summary: GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. A null
  pointer dereference has been discovered in the id3v2_read_synch_uint function, located in
  id3v2.c. If id3v2_read_synch_uint is called with a null work->hdr.frame_data, the pointer
  guint8 *data is accessed without validation, resulting in a null pointer dereference. This
  vulnerability can result in a Denial of Service (DoS) by triggering a segmentation fault (SEGV).
  This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.
