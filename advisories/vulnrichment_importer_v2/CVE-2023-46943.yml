aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in NPM's package @evershop/evershop before version 1.0.0-rc.8.
  The HMAC secret used for generating tokens is hardcoded as "secret". A weak HMAC secret poses
  a risk because attackers can use the predictable secret to create valid JSON Web Tokens (JWTs),
  allowing them access to important information and actions within the application.
