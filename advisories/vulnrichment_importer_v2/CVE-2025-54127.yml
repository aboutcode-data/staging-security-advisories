aliases: []
summary: HAXcms with nodejs backend allows users to start the server in any HAXsite or HAXcms
  instance. In versions 11.0.6 and below, the NodeJS version of HAXcms uses an insecure default
  configuration designed for local development. The default configuration does not perform authorization
  or authentication checks. If a user were to deploy haxcms-nodejs without modifying the default
  settings, ‘HAXCMS_DISABLE_JWT_CHECKS‘ would be set to ‘true‘ and their deployment would lack
  session authentication. This is fixed in version 11.0.7.
