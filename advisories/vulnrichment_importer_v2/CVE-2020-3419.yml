aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Meetings and Cisco Webex Meetings Server could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to join a Webex session without appearing on the participant
  list. This vulnerability is due to improper handling of authentication tokens by a vulnerable
  Webex site. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests to a
  vulnerable Cisco Webex Meetings or Cisco Webex Meetings Server site. A successful exploit
  requires the attacker to have access to join a Webex meeting, including applicable meeting
  join links and passwords. The attacker could then exploit this vulnerability to join meetings,
  without appearing in the participant list, while having full access to audio, video, chat,
  and screen sharing capabilities.
