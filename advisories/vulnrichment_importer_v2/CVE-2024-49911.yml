  drm/amd/display: Add NULL check for function pointer in dcn20_set_output_transfer_func

  This commit adds a null check for the set_output_gamma function pointer
  in the dcn20_set_output_transfer_func function. Previously,
  set_output_gamma was being checked for null at line 1030, but then it
  was being dereferenced without any null check at line 1048. This could
  potentially lead to a null pointer dereference error if set_output_gamma
  is null.

  To fix this, we now ensure that set_output_gamma is not null before
  dereferencing it. We do this by adding a null check for set_output_gamma
  before the call to set_output_gamma at line 1048.
