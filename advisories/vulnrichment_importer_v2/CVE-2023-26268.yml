aliases: []
summary: |
  Design documents with matching document IDs, from databases on the same cluster, may share a mutable Javascript environment when using these design document functions:
    *  validate_doc_update

    *  list

    *  filter

    *  filter views (using view functions as filters)

    *  rewrite

    *  update



  This doesn't affect map/reduce or search (Dreyfus) index functions.

  Users are recommended to upgrade to a version that is no longer affected by this issue (Apache CouchDB 3.3.2 or 3.2.3).

  Workaround: Avoid using design documents from untrusted sources which may attempt to cache or store data in the Javascript environment.
