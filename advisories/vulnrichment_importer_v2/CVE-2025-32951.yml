aliases: []
summary: Jmix is a set of libraries and tools to speed up Spring Boot data-centric application
  development. In versions 1.0.0 to 1.6.1 and 2.0.0 to 2.3.4, the input parameter, which consists
  of a file path and name, can be manipulated to return the Content-Type header with text/html
  if the name part ends with .html. This could allow malicious JavaScript code to be executed
  in the browser. For a successful attack, a malicious file needs to be uploaded beforehand.
  This issue has been patched in versions 1.6.2 and 2.4.0. A workaround is provided on the Jmix
  documentation website.
