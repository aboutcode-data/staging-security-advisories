summary: Basecamp's Google Sign-In adds Google sign-in to Rails applications. Prior to version
  1.3.0, it is possible to craft a malformed URL that passes the "same origin" check, resulting
  in the user being redirected to another origin. Rails applications configured to store the
  flash information in a session cookie may be vulnerable, if this can be chained with an attack
  that allows injection of arbitrary data into the session cookie. This issue has been patched
  in version 1.3.0. If upgrading is not possible at this time, a way to mitigate the chained
  attack can be done by explicitly setting SameSite=Lax or SameSite=Strict on the application
  session cookie.
