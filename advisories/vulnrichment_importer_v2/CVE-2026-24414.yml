aliases: []
summary: The Icinga PowerShell Framework provides configuration and check possibilities to ensure
  integration and monitoring of Windows environments. In versions prior to 1.13.4, 1.12.4, and
  1.11.2, permissions of the Icinga for Windows `certificate` directory grant every user read
  access, which results in the exposure of private key of the Icinga certificate for the given
  host. All installations are affected. Versions 1.13.4, 1.12.4, and 1.11.2 contains a patch.
  Please note that upgrading to a fixed version of Icinga for Windows will also automatically
  fix a similar issue present in Icinga 2, CVE-2026-24413. As a workaround, the permissions
  can be restricted manually by updating the ACL for the given folder `C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\modules\icinga-powershell-framework\certificate`
  (and `C:\ProgramData\icinga2\var` to fix the issue for the Icinga 2 agent as well) including
  every sub-folder and item to restrict access for general users, only allowing the Icinga service
  user and administrators access.
