summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Mobility Express Software
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
  attack on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for
  the web-based management interface on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability

  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions, including modifying
  the configuration, with the privilege level of the user.
