aliases: []
summary: There exists an unchecked length field in UBoot. The U-Boot DFU implementation does
  not bound the length field in USB DFU download setup packets, and it does not verify that
  the transfer direction corresponds to the specified command. Consequently, if a physical attacker
  crafts a USB DFU download setup packet with a `wLength` greater than 4096 bytes, they can
  write beyond the heap-allocated request buffer.
