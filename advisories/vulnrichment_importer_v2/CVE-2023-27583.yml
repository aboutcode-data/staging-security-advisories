aliases: []
summary: PanIndex is a network disk directory index. In Panindex prior to version 3.1.3,  a
  hard-coded JWT key `PanIndex` is used. An attacker can use the hard-coded JWT key to sign
  JWT token and perform any actions as a user with admin privileges. Version 3.1.3 has a patch
  for the issue. As a workaround, one may change the JWT key in the source code before compiling
  the project.
