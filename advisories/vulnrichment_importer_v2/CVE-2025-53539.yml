aliases: []
summary: FastAPI Guard is a security library for FastAPI that provides middleware to control
  IPs, log requests, and detect penetration attempts. fastapi-guard's penetration attempts detection
  uses regex to scan incoming requests. However, some of the regex patterns used in detection
  are extremely inefficient and can cause polynomial complexity backtracks when handling specially
  crafted inputs. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.0.1.
