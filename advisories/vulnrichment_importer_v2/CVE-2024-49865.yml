  drm/xe/vm: move xa_alloc to prevent UAF

  Evil user can guess the next id of the vm before the ioctl completes and
  then call vm destroy ioctl to trigger UAF since create ioctl is still
  referencing the same vm. Move the xa_alloc all the way to the end to
  prevent this.

  v2:
   - Rebase

  (cherry picked from commit dcfd3971327f3ee92765154baebbaece833d3ca9)
