aliases: []
summary: The Meatmeet Pro was found to be shipped with hardcoded Wi-Fi credentials in the firmware,
  for the test network it was developed on. If an attacker retrieved this, and found the physical
  location of the Wi-Fi network, they could gain unauthorized access to the Wi-Fi network of
  the vendor. Additionally, if an attacker were located in close physical proximity to the device
  when it was first set up, they may be able to force the device to auto-connect to an attacker-controlled
  access point by setting the SSID and password to the same as which was found in the firmware
  file.
