summary: The Gutenberg Blocks and Page Layouts – Attire Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the disable_fe_assets

  attackers, with subscriber access or above, to change the plugin's settings. Additionally,
  no nonce check is performed resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.
