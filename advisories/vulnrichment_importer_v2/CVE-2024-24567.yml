aliases: []
summary: Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual machine. Vyper
  compiler allows passing a value in builtin raw_call even if the call is a delegatecall or
  a staticcall. But in the context of delegatecall and staticcall the handling of value is not
  possible due to the semantics of the respective opcodes, and vyper will silently ignore the
  value= argument. If the semantics of the EVM are unknown to the developer, he could suspect
  that by specifying the `value` kwarg, exactly the given amount will be sent along to the target.
  This vulnerability affects 0.3.10 and earlier versions.
