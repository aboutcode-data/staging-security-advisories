aliases: []
summary: Dex is an identity service that uses OpenID Connect to drive authentication for other
  apps. Dex 2.37.0 serves HTTPS with insecure TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1. `cmd/dex/serve.go` line 425
  seemingly sets TLS 1.2 as minimum version, but the whole `tlsConfig` is ignored after `TLS
  cert reloader` was introduced in v2.37.0. Configured cipher suites are not respected either.
  This issue is fixed in Dex 2.38.0.
