aliases: []
summary: TYPO3 is an open source, PHP based web content management system. In versions on the
  12.x branch prior to 12.4.31 LTS and the 13.x branch prior to 13.4.2 LTS, Webhooks are inherently
  vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), which can be exploited by adversaries to
  target internal resources (e.g., localhost or other services on the local network). While
  this is not a vulnerability in TYPO3 itself, it may enable attackers to blindly access systems
  that would otherwise be inaccessible. An administrator-level backend user account is required
  to exploit this vulnerability. Users should update to TYPO3 version 12.4.31 LTS or 13.4.12
  LTS to fix the problem.
