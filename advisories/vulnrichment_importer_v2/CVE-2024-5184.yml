aliases: []
summary: The EmailGPT service contains a prompt injection vulnerability. The service uses an
  API service that allows a malicious user to inject a direct prompt and take over the service
  logic. Attackers can exploit the issue by forcing the AI service to leak the standard hard-coded
  system prompts and/or execute unwanted prompts. When engaging with EmailGPT by submitting
  a malicious prompt that requests harmful information, the system will respond by providing
  the requested data. This vulnerability can be exploited by any individual with access to the
  service.
