aliases: []
summary: Wimi Teamwork versions prior to 7.38.17 contains a cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
  vulnerability in its API. The API accepts any authenticated request that contains a JSON field
  named 'csrf_token' without validating the field’s value; only the presence of the field is
  checked. An attacker can craft a cross-site request that causes a logged-in victim’s browser
  to submit a JSON POST containing an arbitrary or empty 'csrf_token', and the API will execute
  the request with the victim’s privileges. Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to
  perform privileged actions as the victim potentially resulting in account takeover, privilege
  escalation, or service disruption.
