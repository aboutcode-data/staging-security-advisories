aliases: []
summary: Users may have access to secure endpoints in the control plane network. Kubernetes
  clusters are only affected if an untrusted user can modify Node objects and send proxy requests
  to them. Kubernetes supports node proxying, which allows clients of kube-apiserver to access
  endpoints of a Kubelet to establish connections to Pods, retrieve container logs, and more.
  While Kubernetes already validates the proxying address for Nodes, a bug in kube-apiserver
  made it possible to bypass this validation. Bypassing this validation could allow authenticated
  requests destined for Nodes to to the API server's private network.
