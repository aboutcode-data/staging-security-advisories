aliases: []
summary: The Unlimited Elements For Elementor (Free Widgets, Addons, Templates) plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's text field widget in all versions
  up to, and including, 1.5.107 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on
  user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses an injected page. Please note that this vulnerability is different in that the issue
  stems from an external template. It appears that older version may also be patched due to
  this, however, we are choosing 1.5.108 as the patched version since that is the most recent
  version containing as known patch.
