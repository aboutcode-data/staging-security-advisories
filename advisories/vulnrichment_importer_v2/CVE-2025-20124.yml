summary: "A vulnerability in an API of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker\
  \ to execute arbitrary commands as the root user on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability\
  \ is due to insecure deserialization of user-supplied Java byte streams by the affected software.\
  \ An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted serialized Java object\
  \ to an affected API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands\
  \ on the device and elevate privileges.\r\nNote:&nbsp;To successfully exploit this vulnerability,\
  \ the attacker must have valid read-only administrative credentials. In a single-node deployment,\
  \ new devices will not be able to authenticate during the reload time."
