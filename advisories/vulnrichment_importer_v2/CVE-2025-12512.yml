aliases: []
summary: The GenerateBlocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to information exposure due to
  missing object-level authorization checks in versions up to, and including, 2.1.2. This is
  due to the plugin registering multiple REST API routes under `generateblocks/v1/meta/` that
  gate access with `current_user_can('edit_posts')`, which is granted to low-privileged roles
  such as Contributor. The handlers accept arbitrary entity IDs (user IDs, post IDs, etc.) and
  meta keys, returning any requested metadata with only a short blacklist of password-like keys
  for protection. There is no object-level authorization ensuring the caller is requesting only
  their own data, and there is no allowlist of safe keys. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to exfiltrate personally identifiable
  information (PII) and other sensitive profile data of administrator accounts or any other
  users by directly querying user meta keys via the exposed endpoints via the `get_user_meta_rest`
  function. In typical WordPress + WooCommerce setups, this includes names, email, phone, and
  address fields that WooCommerce stores in user meta, enabling targeted phishing, account takeover
  pretexting, and privacy breaches.
