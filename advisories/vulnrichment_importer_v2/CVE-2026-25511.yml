aliases: []
summary: Group-Office is an enterprise customer relationship management and groupware tool.
  Prior to versions 6.8.150, 25.0.82, and 26.0.5, an authenticated user within the System Administrator
  group can trigger a full SSRF via the WOPI service discovery URL, including access to internal
  hosts/ports. The SSRF response body can be exfiltrated via the built‑in debug system, turning
  it into a visible SSRF. This also allows full server-side file read. This issue has been patched
  in versions 6.8.150, 25.0.82, and 26.0.5.
