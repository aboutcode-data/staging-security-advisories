summary: FACTION is a PenTesting Report Generation and Collaboration Framework. Authentication
  is bypassed when an attacker registers a new user with admin privileges. This is possible
  at any time without any authorization. The request must follow the validation rules (no missing
  information, secure password, etc) but there are no other controls stopping them. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 1.4.3.
