summary: "A vulnerability in the RADIUS setting Reject RADIUS requests from clients with repeated\
  \ failures on Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote\
  \ attacker to cause Cisco ISE to restart unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to\
  \ a logic error when processing a RADIUS access request for a MAC address that is already\
  \ a rejected endpoint. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific\
  \ sequence of multiple crafted RADIUS access request messages to Cisco ISE. A successful exploit\
  \ could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition when Cisco ISE restarts."
