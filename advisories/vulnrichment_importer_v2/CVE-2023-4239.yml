aliases: []
summary: The Real Estate Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
  in versions up to, and including, 6.7.1 due to insufficient restriction on the 'rem_save_profile_front'
  function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such
  as a subscriber, to modify their user role by supplying the 'wp_capabilities' parameter during
  a profile update.
