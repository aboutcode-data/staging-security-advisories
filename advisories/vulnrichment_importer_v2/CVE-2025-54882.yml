aliases: []
summary: Himmelblau is an interoperability suite for Microsoft Azure Entra ID and Intune. In
  versions 0.8.0 through 0.9.21 and 1.0.0-beta through 1.1.0, Himmelblau stores the cloud TGT
  received during logon in the Kerberos credential cache. The created credential cache collection
  and received credentials are stored as world readable. This is fixed in versions 0.9.22 and
  1.2.0. To work around this issue, remove all read access to Himmelblau caches for all users
  except for owners.
