aliases: []
summary: FOG is a cloning/imaging/rescue suite/inventory management system. An improperly restricted
  file upload feature allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary code on the fogproject
  server. The Rebranding feature has a check on the client banner image requiring it to be 650
  pixels wide and 120 pixels high. Apart from that, there are no checks on things like file
  extensions. This can be abused by appending a PHP webshell to the end of the image and changing
  the extension to anything the PHP web server will parse. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.5.10.41.
