aliases: []
summary: The /device/signin end-point for the Ourphoto App version 1.4.1 discloses clear-text
  password information for functionality within the picture frame devices. The deviceVideoCallPassword
  and mqttPassword are returned in clear-text. The lack of sessions management and presence
  of insecure direct object references allows to return password information for other end-users
  devices. Many of the picture frame devices offer video calling, and it is likely this information
  can be used to abuse that functionality.
