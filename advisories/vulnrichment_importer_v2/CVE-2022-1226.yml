summary: A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in phpipam/phpipam versions prior to 1.4.7
  allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of a victim. This vulnerability
  affects the import Data set feature via a spreadsheet file upload. The affected endpoints

  import-devtype-preview.php, import-devices-preview.php, and import-l2dom-preview.php. The
