summary: 'A vulnerability in the detection engine of Cisco FireSIGHT System Software could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a URL-based access control policy that is configured
  to block traffic for an affected system. The vulnerability exists because the affected software
  incorrectly handles TCP packets that are received out of order when a TCP SYN retransmission
  is issued. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a maliciously crafted connection
  through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass a URL-based
  access control policy that is configured to block traffic for the affected system. Cisco Bug
  IDs: CSCvh84511.'
