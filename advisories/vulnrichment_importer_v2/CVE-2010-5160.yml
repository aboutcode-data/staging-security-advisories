aliases: []
summary: 'Race condition in ESET Smart Security 4.2.35.3 on Windows XP allows local users to
  bypass kernel-mode hook handlers, and execute dangerous code that would otherwise be blocked
  by a handler but not blocked by signature-based malware detection, via certain user-space
  memory changes during hook-handler execution, aka an argument-switch attack or a KHOBE attack.  NOTE:
  this issue is disputed by some third parties because it is a flaw in a protection mechanism
  for situations where a crafted program has already begun to execute'
