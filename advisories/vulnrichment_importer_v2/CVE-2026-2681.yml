aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in the blst cryptographic library. This out-of-bounds stack write
  vulnerability, specifically in the blst_sha256_bcopy assembly routine, occurs due to a missing
  zero-length guard. A remote attacker can exploit this by providing a zero-length salt parameter
  to key generation functions, such as blst_keygen_v5(), if the application exposes this functionality.
  Successful exploitation leads to memory corruption and immediate process termination, resulting
  in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
