aliases: []
summary: 'DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. In affected versions a low privileged
  user could remove a user, edit group members, or edit another user''s profile information.
  The default privileges gave too many broad permissions to low privileged users. These have
  been constrained in PR #9067 to prevent abuse. This issue can result in privilege escalation
  for lower privileged users up to admin privileges, potentially, if a group with admin privileges
  exists. May not impact instances that have modified default privileges. This issue has been
  addressed in datahub version 0.12.1. Users are advised to upgrade.'
