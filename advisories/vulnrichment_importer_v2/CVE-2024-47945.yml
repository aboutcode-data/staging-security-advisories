aliases: []
summary: "The devices are vulnerable to session hijacking due to insufficient \nentropy in its\
  \ session ID generation algorithm. The session IDs are \npredictable, with only 32,768 possible\
  \ values per user, which allows \nattackers to pre-generate valid session IDs, leading to\
  \ unauthorized \naccess to user sessions. This is not only due to the use of an \n(insecure)\
  \ rand() function call but also because of missing \ninitialization via srand(). As a result\
  \ only the PIDs are effectively \nused as seed."
