aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  io_uring/kbuf: always use READ_ONCE() to read ring provided buffer lengths

  Since the buffers are mapped from userspace, it is prudent to use
  READ_ONCE() to read the value into a local variable, and use that for
  any other actions taken. Having a stable read of the buffer length
  avoids worrying about it changing after checking, or being read multiple
  times.

  Similarly, the buffer may well change in between it being picked and
  being committed. Ensure the looping for incremental ring buffer commit
  stops if it hits a zero sized buffer, as no further progress can be made
  at that point.
