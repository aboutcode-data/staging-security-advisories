aliases: []
summary: "When using Arm Cortex-M Security Extensions (CMSE), Secure stack \ncontents can be\
  \ leaked to Non-secure state via floating-point registers \nwhen a Secure to Non-secure function\
  \ call is made that returns a \nfloating-point value and when this is the first use of floating-point\
  \ \nsince entering Secure state. This allows an attacker to read a limited \nquantity of Secure\
  \ stack contents with an impact on confidentiality. \nThis issue is specific to code generated\
  \ using LLVM-based compilers."
