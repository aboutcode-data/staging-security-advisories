  devlink: fix netns refcount leak in devlink_nl_cmd_reload()

  While preparing my patch series adding netns refcount tracking,
  I spotted bugs in devlink_nl_cmd_reload()

  Some error paths forgot to release a refcount on a netns.

  To fix this, we can reduce the scope of get_net()/put_net()
  section around the call to devlink_reload().
