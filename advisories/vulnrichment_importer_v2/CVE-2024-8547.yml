aliases: []
summary: The Simple Popup Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the plugin's [popup] shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 4.5 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary
  web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
