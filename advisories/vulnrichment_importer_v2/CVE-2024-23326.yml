aliases: []
summary: Envoy is a cloud-native, open source edge and service proxy. A theoretical request
  smuggling vulnerability exists through Envoy if a server can be tricked into adding an upgrade
  header into a response. Per RFC https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230#section-6.7 a server
  sends 101 when switching protocols. Envoy incorrectly accepts a 200 response from a server
  when requesting a protocol upgrade, but 200 does not indicate protocol switch. This opens
  up the possibility of request smuggling through Envoy if the server can be tricked into adding
  the upgrade header to the response.
