aliases: []
summary: The Swift Framework plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification
  of data due to a missing capability check on the sf_edit_directory_item() function in all
  versions up to, and including, 2.7.31. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to update arbitrary posts with arbitrary content. Unfortunately, we did not receive a response
  from the vendor to send over the vulnerability details.
