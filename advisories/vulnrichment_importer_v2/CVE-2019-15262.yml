aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Secure Shell (SSH) session management for Cisco Wireless LAN
  Controller (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial
  of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the SSH
  process is not properly deleted when an SSH connection to the device is disconnected. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly opening SSH connections to an affected device.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust system resources by initiating multiple
  SSH connections to the device that are not effectively terminated, which could result in a
  DoS condition.
