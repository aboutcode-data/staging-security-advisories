aliases: []
summary: 'git-commiters is a Node.js function module providing committers stats for their git
  repository. Prior to version 0.1.2, there is a command injection vulnerability in git-commiters.
  This vulnerability manifests with the library''s primary exported API: gitCommiters(options,
  callback) which allows specifying options such as cwd for current working directory and revisionRange
  as a revision pointer, such as HEAD. However, the library does not sanitize for user input
  or practice secure process execution API to separate commands from their arguments and as
  such, uncontrolled user input is concatenated into command execution. This issue has been
  patched in version 0.1.2.'
