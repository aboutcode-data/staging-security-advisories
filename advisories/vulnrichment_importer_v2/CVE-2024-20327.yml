aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) termination feature of Cisco IOS\
  \ XR Software for Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers could allow an unauthenticated,\
  \ adjacent attacker to crash the ppp_ma process, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\
  \n\r This vulnerability is due to the improper handling of malformed PPPoE packets that are\
  \ received on a router that is running Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) functionality with\
  \ PPPoE termination on a Lightspeed-based or Lightspeed-Plus-based line card. An attacker\
  \ could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PPPoE packet to an affected line card\
  \ interface that does not terminate PPPoE. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to\
  \ crash the ppp_ma process, resulting in a DoS condition for PPPoE traffic across the router."
