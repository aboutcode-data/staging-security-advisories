aliases: []
summary: The Wallet for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to incorrect conversion
  between numeric types in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.6. This is due to a numerical
  logic flaw when transferring funds to another user. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to create funds during a transfer and distribute
  these funds to any number of other users or their own account, rendering products free. Attackers
  could also request to withdraw funds if the Wallet Withdrawal extension is used and the request
  is approved by an administrator.
