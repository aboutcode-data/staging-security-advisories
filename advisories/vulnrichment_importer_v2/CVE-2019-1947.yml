aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the email message filtering feature of Cisco AsyncOS Software for
  Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause
  the CPU utilization to increase to 100 percent, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition
  on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of email messages that
  contain large attachments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious
  email message through the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
  cause a permanent DoS condition due to high CPU utilization. This vulnerability may require
  manual intervention to recover the ESA.
