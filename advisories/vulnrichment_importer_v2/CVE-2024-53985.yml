aliases: []
summary: rails-html-sanitizer is responsible for sanitizing HTML fragments in Rails applications.
  There is a possible XSS vulnerability with certain configurations of Rails::HTML::Sanitizer
  1.6.0 when used with Rails >= 7.1.0 and Nokogiri < 1.15.7, or 1.16.x < 1.16.8. The XSS vulnerability
  with certain configurations of Rails::HTML::Sanitizer may allow an attacker to inject content
  if HTML5 sanitization is enabled and the application developer has overridden the sanitizer's
  allowed tags with both "math" and "style" elements or both both "svg" and "style" elements.
  This vulnerability is fixed in 1.6.1.
