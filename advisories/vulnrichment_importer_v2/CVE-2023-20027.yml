aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the implementation of the IPv4 Virtual Fragmentation Reassembly
  (VFR) feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
  cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due
  to improper reassembly of large packets that occurs when VFR is enabled on either a tunnel
  interface or on a physical interface that is configured with a maximum transmission unit (MTU)
  greater than 4,615 bytes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending fragmented
  packets through a VFR-enabled interface on an affected device. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.
