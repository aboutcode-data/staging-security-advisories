aliases: []
summary: Formwork is a flat file-based Content Management System (CMS). In versions 2.0.0 through
  2.3.3, the application fails to properly enforce role-based authorization during account creation.
  Although the system validates that the specified role exists, it does not verify whether the
  current user has sufficient privileges to assign highly privileged roles such as admin. As
  a result, an authenticated user with the editor role can create a new account with administrative
  privileges, leading to full administrative access and complete compromise of the CMS. This
  issue has been fixed in version 2.3.4.
