aliases: []
summary: The EmbedAI application is susceptible to security issues that enable Data Poisoning
  attacks. This weakness could result in the application becoming compromised, leading to unauthorized
  entries or data poisoning attacks, which are delivered by a CSRF vulnerability due to the
  absence of a secure session management implementation and weak CORS policies weakness. An
  attacker can direct a user to a malicious webpage that exploits a CSRF vulnerability within
  the EmbedAI application. By leveraging this CSRF vulnerability, the attacker can deceive the
  user into inadvertently uploading and integrating incorrect data into the application’s language
  model.
