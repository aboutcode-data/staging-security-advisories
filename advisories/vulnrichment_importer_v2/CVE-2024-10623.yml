aliases: []
summary: The ForumEngine theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  via a URL in all versions up to, and including, 1.8 due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary
  web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an
  action such as clicking on a link.
