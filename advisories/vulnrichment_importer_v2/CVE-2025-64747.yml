aliases: []
summary: Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. A
  stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in versions prior to 11.13.0 that allows
  users with `upload files` and `edit item` permissions to inject malicious JavaScript through
  the Block Editor interface. Attackers can bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions
  by combining file uploads with iframe srcdoc attributes, resulting in persistent XSS execution.
  Version 11.13.0 fixes the issue.
