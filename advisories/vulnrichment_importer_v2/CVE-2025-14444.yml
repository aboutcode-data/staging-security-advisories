aliases: []
summary: The RegistrationMagic – Custom Registration Forms, User Registration, Payment, and
  User Login plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to payment bypass due to insufficient verification
  of data authenticity on the 'process_paypal_sdk_payment' function in all versions up to, and
  including, 6.0.6.9. This is due to the plugin trusting client-supplied values for payment
  verification without validating that the payment actually went through PayPal. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass paid registration by manipulating payment
  status and activating their account without completing a real PayPal payment.
