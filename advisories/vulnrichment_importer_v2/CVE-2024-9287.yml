datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2024/9xxx/CVE-2024-9287.json
aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability has been found in the CPython `venv` module and CLI where path names
  provided when creating a virtual environment were not quoted properly, allowing the creator
  to inject commands into virtual environment "activation" scripts (ie "source venv/bin/activate").
  This means that attacker-controlled virtual environments are able to run commands when the
  virtual environment is activated. Virtual environments which are not created by an attacker
  or which aren't activated before being used (ie "./venv/bin/python") are not affected.
