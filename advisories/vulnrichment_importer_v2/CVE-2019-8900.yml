aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the SecureROM of some Apple devices can be exploited by an unauthenticated
  local attacker to execute arbitrary code upon booting those devices. This vulnerability allows
  arbitrary code to be executed on the device. Exploiting the vulnerability requires physical
  access to the device: the device must be plugged in to a computer upon booting, and it must
  be put into Device Firmware Update (DFU) mode. The exploit is not persistent; rebooting the
  device overrides any changes to the device''s software that were made during an exploited
  session on the device. Additionally, unless an attacker has access to the device''s unlock
  PIN or fingerprint, an attacker cannot gain access to information protected by Apple''s Secure
  Enclave or Touch ID features.'
