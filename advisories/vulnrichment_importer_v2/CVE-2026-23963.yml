aliases: []
summary: Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on ActivityPub. Prior to
  versions 4.5.5, 4.4.12, and 4.3.18, the server does not enforce a maximum length for the names
  of lists or filters, or for filter keywords, allowing any user to set an arbitrarily long
  string as the name or keyword. Any local user can abuse the list or filter fields to cause
  disproportionate storage and computing resource usage. They can additionally cause their own
  web interface to be unusable, although they must intentionally do this to themselves or unknowingly
  approve a malicious API client. Mastodon versions v4.5.5, v4.4.12, v4.3.18 are patched.
