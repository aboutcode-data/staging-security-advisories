aliases: []
summary: 'GrowthBook is an open-source platform for feature flagging and A/B testing. With some
  self-hosted configurations in versions prior to 2022-08-29, attackers can register new accounts
  and upload files to arbitrary directories within the container. If the attacker uploads a
  Python script to the right location, they can execute arbitrary code within the container.
  To be affected, ALL of the following must be true: Self-hosted deployment (GrowthBook Cloud
  is unaffected); using local file uploads (as opposed to S3 or Google Cloud Storage); NODE_ENV
  set to a non-production value and JWT_SECRET set to an easily guessable string like `dev`.
  This issue is patched in commit 1a5edff8786d141161bf880c2fd9ccbe2850a264 (2022-08-29). As
  a workaround, set `JWT_SECRET` environment variable to a long random string. This will stop
  arbitrary file uploads, but the only way to stop attackers from registering accounts is by
  updating to the latest build.'
