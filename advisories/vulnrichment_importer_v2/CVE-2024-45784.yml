aliases: []
summary: Apache Airflow versions before 2.10.3 contain a vulnerability that could expose sensitive
  configuration variables in task logs. This vulnerability allows DAG authors to unintentionally
  or intentionally log sensitive configuration variables. Unauthorized users could access these
  logs, potentially exposing critical data that could be exploited to compromise the security
  of the Airflow deployment. In version 2.10.3, secrets are now masked in task logs to prevent
  sensitive configuration variables from being exposed in the logging output. Users should upgrade
  to Airflow 2.10.3 or the latest version to eliminate this vulnerability. If you suspect that
  DAG authors could have logged the secret values to the logs and that your logs are not additionally
  protected, it is also recommended that you update those secrets.
