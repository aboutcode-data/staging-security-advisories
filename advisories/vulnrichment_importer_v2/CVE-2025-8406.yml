aliases: []
summary: ZenML version 0.83.1 is affected by a path traversal vulnerability in the `PathMaterializer`
  class. The `load` function uses `is_path_within_directory` to validate files during `data.tar.gz`
  extraction, which fails to effectively detect symbolic and hard links. This vulnerability
  can lead to arbitrary file writes, potentially resulting in arbitrary command execution if
  critical files are overwritten.
