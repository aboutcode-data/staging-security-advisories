aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in TACACS authentication with Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software
  could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform certain operations within the GUI
  that are not normally available to that user on the CLI. The vulnerability is due to incorrect
  parsing of a specific TACACS attribute received in the TACACS response from the remote TACACS
  server. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating via TACACS to the GUI
  on the affected device. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to create local user
  accounts with administrative privileges on an affected WLC and execute other commands that
  are not allowed from the CLI and should be prohibited.
