aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability was discovered in the odoh-rs rust crate that stems from faulty logic
  during the parsing of encrypted queries. This issue specifically occurs when processing encrypted
  query data received from remote clients and enables an attacker with knowledge of this vulnerability
  to craft and send specially designed encrypted queries to targeted ODOH servers running with
  odoh-rs. Upon successful exploitation, the server will crash abruptly, disrupting its normal
  operation and rendering the service temporarily unavailable.
