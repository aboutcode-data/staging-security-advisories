aliases: []
summary: "The Android Client application, when enrolled to the AppHub server, connects to an\
  \ MQTT\r\nbroker to exchange messages and receive commands to execute on the HMI device.\r\
  \nThe protocol builds on top of MQTT to implement the remote management of the device is encrypted\
  \ with a hard-coded DES symmetric key, that can be retrieved reversing both the Android Client\
  \ application and the server-side web application.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis issue allows an attacker\
  \ able to control a malicious MQTT broker on the same subnet\r\nnetwork of the device, to\
  \ craft malicious messages and send them to the HMI device, executing arbitrary commands on\
  \ the device itself."
