aliases: []
summary: A host header injection vulnerability exists in the NPM package @perfood/couch-auth
  versions <= 0.20.0. By sending a specially crafted host header in the forgot password request,
  it is possible to send password reset links to users which, once clicked, lead to an attacker-controlled
  server and thus leak the password reset token. This may allow an attacker to reset other users'
  passwords and take over their accounts.
