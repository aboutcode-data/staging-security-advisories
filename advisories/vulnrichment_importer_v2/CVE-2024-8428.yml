aliases: []
summary: The ForumWP – Forum & Discussion Board Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  Privilege Escalation via Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including,
  2.0.2 via the submit_form_handler due to missing validation on the 'user_id' user controlled
  key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and
  above, to change the email address of administrative user accounts which can then be leveraged
  to reset the administrative users password and gain access to their account.
