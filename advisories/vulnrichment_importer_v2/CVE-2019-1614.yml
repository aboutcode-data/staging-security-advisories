summary: 'A vulnerability in the NX-API feature of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated,
  remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. The vulnerability is due
  to incorrect input validation of user-supplied data by the NX-API subsystem. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious HTTP or HTTPS packets to the management interface
  of an affected system that has the NX-API feature enabled. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to perform a command-injection attack and execute arbitrary commands with root
  privileges. Note: NX-API is disabled by default. MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches are affected
  running software versions prior to 8.1(1b) and 8.2(3). Nexus 3000 Series Switches are affected
  running software versions prior to 7.0(3)I4(9) and 7.0(3)I7(4). Nexus 3500 Platform Switches
  are affected running software versions prior to 7.0(3)I7(4). Nexus 2000, 5500, 5600, and 6000
  Series Switches are affected running software versions prior to 7.3(4)N1(1). Nexus 9000 Series
  Switches in Standalone NX-OS Mode are affected running software versions prior to 7.0(3)I4(9)
  and 7.0(3)I7(4). Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches are affected running software versions
  prior to 7.3(3)D1(1) and 8.2(3).'
