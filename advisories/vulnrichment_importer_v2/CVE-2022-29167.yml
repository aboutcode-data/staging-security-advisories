aliases: []
summary: Hawk is an HTTP authentication scheme providing mechanisms for making authenticated
  HTTP requests with partial cryptographic verification of the request and response, covering
  the HTTP method, request URI, host, and optionally the request payload. Hawk used a regular
  expression to parse `Host` HTTP header (`Hawk.utils.parseHost()`), which was subject to regular
  expression DoS attack - meaning each added character in the attacker's input increases the
  computation time exponentially. `parseHost()` was patched in `9.0.1` to use built-in `URL`
  class to parse hostname instead. `Hawk.authenticate()` accepts `options` argument. If that
  contains `host` and `port`, those would be used instead of a call to `utils.parseHost()`.
