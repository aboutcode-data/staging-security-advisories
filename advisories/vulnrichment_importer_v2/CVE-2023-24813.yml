aliases: []
summary: Dompdf is an HTML to PDF converter written in php. Due to the difference in the attribute
  parser of Dompdf and php-svg-lib, an attacker can still call arbitrary URLs with arbitrary
  protocols. Dompdf parses the href attribute of `image` tags and respects `xlink:href` even
  if `href` is specified. However, php-svg-lib, which is later used to parse the svg file, parses
  the href attribute. Since `href` is respected if both `xlink:href` and `href` is specified,
  it's possible to bypass the protection on the Dompdf side by providing an empty `xlink:href`
  attribute. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to call arbitrary URLs with arbitrary
  protocols if they provide an SVG file to the Dompdf. In PHP versions before 8.0.0, it leads
  to arbitrary unserialize, which will lead, at the very least, to arbitrary file deletion and
  might lead to remote code execution, depending on available classes. This vulnerability has
  been addressed in commit `95009ea98` which has been included in release version 2.0.3. Users
  are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
