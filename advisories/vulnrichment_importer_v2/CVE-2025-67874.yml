aliases: []
summary: ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. Prior to version 6.5.0, the application
  echoes back plaintext passwords submitted by users in subsequent HTTP responses. This information
  disclosure significantly increases the risk of credential compromise and may amplify the impact
  of other vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, IDOR, session fixation), enabling attackers to harvest
  other users’ passwords. Version 6.5.0 fixes the issue.
