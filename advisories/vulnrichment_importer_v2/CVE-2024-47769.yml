aliases: []
summary: IDURAR is open source ERP CRM accounting invoicing software. The vulnerability exists
  in the corePublicRouter.js file. Using the reference usage here, it is identified that the
  public endpoint is accessible to an unauthenticated user. The user's input is directly appended
  to the join statement without additional checks. This allows an attacker to send URL encoded
  malicious payload. The directory structure can be escaped to read system files by adding an
  encoded string (payload) at subpath location.
