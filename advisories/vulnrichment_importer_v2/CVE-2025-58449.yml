summary: Maho is a free and open source ecommerce platform. In Maho prior to 25.9.0, an authenticated
  staff user with access to the `Dashboard` and `Catalog\Manage Products` permissions can create
  a custom option on a listing with a file input field. By allowing file uploads with a `.php`
  extension, the user can use the filed to upload malicious PHP files, gaining remote code execution.
  Version 25.9.0 fixes the issue.
