aliases: []
summary: Exiv2 is a C++ library and a command-line utility to read, write, delete and modify
  Exif, IPTC, XMP and ICC image metadata. A heap buffer overflow was found in Exiv2 versions
  v0.28.0 to v0.28.4. Versions prior to v0.28.0, such as v0.27.7, are **not** affected. Exiv2
  is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the
  metadata of image files. The heap overflow is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata
  into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain
  code execution, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note
  that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which is a less frequently used
  Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line
  application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as `fixiso`. The bug is fixed
  in version v0.28.5. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
  vulnerability.
