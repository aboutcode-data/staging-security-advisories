aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Image Verification feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow
  an authenticated, local attacker to install and boot a malicious software image or execute
  unsigned binaries on an affected device. The vulnerability exists because, under certain circumstances,
  an affected device can be configured to not verify the digital signatures of system image
  files during the boot process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by abusing a specific
  feature that is part of the device boot process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to install and boot a malicious software image or execute unsigned binaries on the targeted
  device.
