aliases: []
summary: The Book a Room plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in
  all versions up to, and including, 2.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the 'bookaroom_Settings' page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
  update the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
