aliases: []
summary: Http4s is a Scala interface for HTTP services. Starting with version 0.1.0 and prior
  to versions 0.21.34, 0.22.15, 0.23.17, and 1.0.0-M38, the `User-Agent` and `Server` header
  parsers are susceptible to a fatal error on certain inputs.  In http4s, modeled headers are
  lazily parsed, so this only applies to services that explicitly request these typed headers.
  Fixes are released in 0.21.34, 0.22.15, 0.23.17, and 1.0.0-M38. As a workaround, use the weakly
  typed header interface.
