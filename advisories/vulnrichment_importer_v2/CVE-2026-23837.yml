summary: 'MyTube is a self-hosted downloader and player for several video websites. A vulnerability
  present in version 1.7.65 and poetntially earlier versions allows unauthenticated users to
  bypass the mandatory authentication check in the roleBasedAuthMiddleware. By simply not providing
  an authentication cookie (making req.user undefined), a request is incorrectly passed through
  to downstream handlers. All users running MyTube with loginEnabled: true are impacted. This
  flaw allows an attacker to access and modify application settings via /api/settings, change
  administrative and visitor passwords, and access other protected routes that rely on this
  specific middleware. The problem is patched in v1.7.66. MyTube maintainers recommend all users
  upgrade to at least version v1.7.64 immediately to secure their instances. The fix ensures
  that the middleware explicitly blocks requests if a user is not authenticated, rather than
  defaulting to next(). Those who cannot upgrade immediately can mitigate risk by restricting
  network access by usi a firewall or reverse proxy (like Nginx) to restrict access to the /api/
  endpoints to trusted IP addresses only or, if they are comfortable editing the source code,
  manually patch by locating roleBasedAuthMiddleware and ensuring that the logic defaults to
  an error (401 Unauthorized) when req.user is undefined, instead of calling next().'
