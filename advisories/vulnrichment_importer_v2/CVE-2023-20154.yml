aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the external authentication mechanism of Cisco Modeling Labs could\
  \ allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access the web interface with administrative\
  \ privileges.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to the improper handling of certain messages\
  \ that are returned by the associated external authentication server. An attacker could exploit\
  \ this vulnerability by logging in to the web interface of an affected server. Under certain\
  \ conditions, the authentication mechanism would be bypassed and the attacker would be logged\
  \ in as an administrator. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain administrative\
  \ privileges on the web interface of an affected server, including the ability to access and\
  \ modify every simulation and all user-created data. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker\
  \ would need valid user credentials that are stored on the associated external authentication\
  \ server.\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are\
  \ workarounds that address this vulnerability."
