aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) feature of Cisco FXOS\
  \ Software and Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause\
  \ a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due\
  \ to improper handling of specific fields in an LLDP frame. An attacker could exploit this\
  \ vulnerability by sending a crafted LLDP packet to an interface of an affected device and\
  \ having an authenticated user retrieve LLDP statistics from the affected device through CLI\
  \ show commands or Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) requests. A successful exploit\
  \ could allow the attacker to cause the LLDP service to crash and stop running on the affected\
  \ device. In certain situations, the LLDP crash may result in a reload of the affected device.\r\
  \n\r Note: LLDP is a Layer 2 link protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would\
  \ need to be directly connected to an interface of an affected device, either physically or\
  \ logically (for example, through a Layer 2 Tunnel configured to transport the LLDP protocol)."
