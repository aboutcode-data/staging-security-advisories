aliases: []
summary: OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to OpenClaw version 2026.2.14, the Gateway
  tool accepted a tool-supplied `gatewayUrl` without sufficient restrictions, which could cause
  the OpenClaw host to attempt outbound WebSocket connections to user-specified targets. This
  requires the ability to invoke tools that accept `gatewayUrl` overrides (directly or indirectly).
  In typical setups this is limited to authenticated operators, trusted automation, or environments
  where tool calls are exposed to non-operators. In other words, this is not a drive-by issue
  for arbitrary internet users unless a deployment explicitly allows untrusted users to trigger
  these tool calls. Some tool call paths allowed `gatewayUrl` overrides to flow into the Gateway
  WebSocket client without validation or allowlisting. This meant the host could be instructed
  to attempt connections to non-gateway endpoints (for example, localhost services, private
  network addresses, or cloud metadata IPs). In the common case, this results in an outbound
  connection attempt from the OpenClaw host (and corresponding errors/timeouts). In environments
  where the tool caller can observe the results, this can also be used for limited network reachability
  probing. If the target speaks WebSocket and is reachable, further interaction may be possible.
  Starting in version 2026.2.14, tool-supplied `gatewayUrl` overrides are restricted to loopback
  (on the configured gateway port) or the configured `gateway.remote.url`. Disallowed protocols,
  credentials, query/hash, and non-root paths are rejected.
