summary: "Multiple stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the readOFF functionality\
  \ of libigl v2.5.0. A specially crafted .off file can lead to stack-based buffer overflow.\
  \ An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.This vulnerability\
  \ concerns the header parsing occuring while processing an `.off`  file via the `readOFF`\
  \ function. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe can see above that at [0] a stack-based buffer called `comment`\
  \ is defined with an hardcoded size of `1000 bytes`.  The call to `fscanf` at [1] is unsafe\
  \ and if the first line of the header of the `.off` files is longer than 1000 bytes it will\
  \ overflow the `header` buffer."
