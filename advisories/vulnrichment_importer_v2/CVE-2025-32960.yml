aliases: []
summary: The CUBA REST API add-on performs operations on data and entities. Prior to version
  7.2.7, the input parameter, which consists of a file path and name, can be manipulated to
  return the Content-Type header with text/html if the name part ends with .html. This could
  allow malicious JavaScript code to be executed in the browser. For a successful attack, a
  malicious file needs to be uploaded beforehand. This issue has been patched in version 7.2.7.
  A workaround is provided on the Jmix documentation website.
