summary: Mattermost versions 10.5.x <= 10.5.5, 9.11.x <= 9.11.15, 10.8.x <= 10.8.0, 10.7.x <=
  10.7.2, 10.6.x <= 10.6.5 fail to sanitize filenames in the archive extractor which allows
  authenticated users to write files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem via uploading
  archives with path traversal sequences in filenames, potentially leading to remote code execution.

  (FileSettings.EnableFileAttachments = true and FileSettings.ExtractContent = true). These
  configuration settings are enabled by default.
