aliases: []
summary: The WP Webhooks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file copy due to missing
  validation of user-supplied input in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.5. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to copy arbitrary files on the affected site's server
  to arbitrary locations. This can be used to copy the contents of wp-config.php into a text
  file which can then be accessed in a browser to reveal database credentials.
