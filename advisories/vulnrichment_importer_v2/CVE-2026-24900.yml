aliases: []
summary: MarkUs is a web application for the submission and grading of student assignments.
  Prior to 2.9.1, the courses/<:course_id>/assignments/<:assignment_id>/submissions/html_content
  accepted a select_file_id parameter to serve SubmissionFile objects containing a record of
  files submitted by students. This parameter was not correctly scoped to the requesting user,
  allowing users access arbitrary submission file contents by id. This vulnerability is fixed
  in 2.9.1.
