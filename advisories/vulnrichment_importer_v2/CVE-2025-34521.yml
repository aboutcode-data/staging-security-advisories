aliases: []
summary: A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the web interface of
  the Arcserve Unified Data Protection (UDP), where unsanitized user input is improperly reflected
  in HTTP responses. This flaw allows remote attackers with low privileges to craft malicious
  links that, when visited by another user, execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim’s browser.
  Successful exploitation may lead to session hijacking, credential theft, or other client-side
  impacts. The vulnerability requires user interaction and occurs within a shared browser context.
  This vulnerability affects all UDP versions prior to 10.2. UDP 10.2 includes the necessary
  patches and requires no action. Versions 8.0 through 10.1 are supported and require either
  patch application or upgrade to 10.2. Versions 7.x and earlier are unsupported or out of maintenance
  and must be upgraded to 10.2 to remediate the issue.
