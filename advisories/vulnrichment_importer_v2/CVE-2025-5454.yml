aliases: []
summary: An ACAP configuration file lacked sufficient input validation, which could allow a
  path traversal attack leading to potential privilege escalation. This vulnerability can only
  be exploited if the Axis device is configured to allow the installation of unsigned ACAP applications,
  and if an attacker convinces the victim to install a malicious ACAP application.
