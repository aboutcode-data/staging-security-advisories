aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco IoT Field Network Director (FND) could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access the back-end database of an affected system.
  The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not properly authenticate REST
  API calls. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by obtaining a cross-site request
  forgery (CSRF) token and then using the token with REST API requests. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to access the back-end database of the affected device and read,
  alter, or drop information.
