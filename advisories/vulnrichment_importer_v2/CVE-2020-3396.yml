aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the file system on the pluggable USB 3.0 Solid State Drive (SSD)
  for Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, physical attacker to remove the USB
  3.0 SSD and modify sensitive areas of the file system, including the namespace container protections.
  The vulnerability occurs because the USB 3.0 SSD control data is not stored on the internal
  boot flash. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by removing the USB 3.0 SSD, modifying
  or deleting files on the USB 3.0 SSD by using another device, and then reinserting the USB
  3.0 SSD on the original device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to remove container
  protections and perform file actions outside the namespace of the container with root privileges.
