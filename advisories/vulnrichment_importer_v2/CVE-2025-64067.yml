aliases: []
summary: 'Primakon Pi Portal 1.0.18 API endpoints responsible for retrieving object-specific
  or filtered data (e.g., user profiles, project records) fail to implement sufficient server-side
  validation to confirm that the requesting user is authorized to access the requested object
  or dataset. This vulnerability can be exploited in two ways: Direct ID manipulation and IDOR,
  by changing an ID parameter (e.g., user_id, project_id) in the request, an attacker can access
  the object and data belonging to another user; and filter Omission, by omitting the filtering
  parameter entirely, an attacker can cause the endpoint to return an entire unfiltered dataset
  of all stored records for all users. This flaw leads to the unauthorized exposure of sensitive
  personal and organizational information.'
