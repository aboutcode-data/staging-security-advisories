aliases: []
summary: DeepDiff is a project focused on Deep Difference and search of any Python data. Versions
  5.0.0 through 8.6.0 are vulnerable to class pollution via the Delta class constructor, and
  when combined with a gadget available in DeltaDiff, it can lead to Denial of Service and Remote
  Code Execution (via insecure Pickle deserialization) exploitation. The gadget available in
  DeepDiff allows `deepdiff.serialization.SAFE_TO_IMPORT` to be modified to allow dangerous
  classes such as posix.system, and then perform insecure Pickle deserialization via the Delta
  class. This potentially allows any Python code to be executed, given that the input to Delta
  is user-controlled. Depending on the application where DeepDiff is used, this can also lead
  to other vulnerabilities. This is fixed in version 8.6.1.
