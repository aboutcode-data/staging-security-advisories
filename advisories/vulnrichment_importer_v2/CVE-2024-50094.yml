summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  sfc: Don't invoke xdp_do_flush() from netpoll.

  Yury reported a crash in the sfc driver originated from
  netpoll_send_udp(). The netconsole sends a message and then netpoll
  invokes the driver's NAPI function with a budget of zero. It is
  dedicated to allow driver to free TX resources, that it may have used
  while sending the packet.

  In the netpoll case the driver invokes xdp_do_flush() unconditionally,
  leading to crash because bpf_net_context was never assigned.

  Invoke xdp_do_flush() only if budget is not zero.
