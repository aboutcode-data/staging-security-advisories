aliases: []
summary: Bref enable serverless PHP on AWS Lambda. When Bref is used with the Event-Driven Function
  runtime and the handler is a `RequestHandlerInterface`, then the Lambda event is converted
  to a PSR7 object. During the conversion process, if the request is a MultiPart, each part
  is parsed and its content added in the `$files` or `$parsedBody` arrays. The conversion process
  produces a different output compared to the one of plain PHP when keys ending with and open
  square bracket ([) are used. Based on the application logic the difference in the body parsing
  might lead to vulnerabilities and/or undefined behaviors. This vulnerability is patched in
  2.1.13.
