summary: The ImageRecycle pdf & image compression plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.13. This is due to missing or incorrect

  attackers to disable the image optimization setting via a forged request granted they can
  trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
