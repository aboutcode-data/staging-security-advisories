aliases: []
summary: The Colibri Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.253. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the apiCall() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to call a
  limited set of functions that can be used to import images, delete posts, or save theme data
  via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
  such as clicking on a link.
