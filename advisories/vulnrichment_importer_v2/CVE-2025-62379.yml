aliases: []
summary: Reflex is a library to build full-stack web apps in pure Python. In versions 0.5.4
  through 0.8.14, the /auth-codespace endpoint automatically assigns the redirect_to query parameter
  value directly to client-side links without any validation and triggers automatic clicks when
  the page loads in a GitHub Codespaces environment. This allows attackers to redirect users
  to arbitrary external URLs. The vulnerable route is only registered when a Codespaces environment
  is detected, and the detection is controlled by environment variables. The same behavior can
  be activated in production if the GITHUB_CODESPACES_PORT_FORWARDING_DOMAIN environment variable
  is set. The vulnerability occurs because the code assigns the redirect_to query parameter
  directly to a.href without any validation and immediately triggers a click (automatic navigation),
  allowing users to be sent to arbitrary external domains. The execution condition is based
  on the presence of a sessionStorage flag, meaning it triggers immediately on first visits
  or in incognito/private browsing windows, with no server-side origin/scheme whitelist or internal
  path enforcement defenses in place. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.15. As a workaround,
  users can ensure that GITHUB_CODESPACES_PORT_FORWARDING_DOMAIN is not set in a production
  environment.
