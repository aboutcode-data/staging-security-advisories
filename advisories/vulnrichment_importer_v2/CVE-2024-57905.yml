  iio: adc: ti-ads1119: fix information leak in triggered buffer

  The 'scan' local struct is used to push data to user space from a
  triggered buffer, but it has a hole between the sample (unsigned int)
  and the timestamp. This hole is never initialized.

  Initialize the struct to zero before using it to avoid pushing
  uninitialized information to userspace.
