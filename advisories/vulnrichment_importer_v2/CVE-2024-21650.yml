summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications
  built on top of it. XWiki is vulnerable to a remote code execution (RCE) attack through its
  user registration feature. This issue allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by crafting
  malicious payloads in the "first name" or "last name" fields during user registration. This
  impacts all installations that have user registration enabled for guests. This vulnerability
  has been patched in XWiki 14.10.17, 15.5.3 and 15.8 RC1.
