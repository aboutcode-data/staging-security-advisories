aliases: []
summary: A race condition vulnerability exists in zenml-io/zenml versions up to and including
  0.55.3, which allows for the creation of multiple users with the same username when requests
  are sent in parallel. This issue was fixed in version 0.55.5. The vulnerability arises due
  to insufficient handling of concurrent user creation requests, leading to data inconsistencies
  and potential authentication problems. Specifically, concurrent processes may overwrite or
  corrupt user data, complicating user identification and posing security risks. This issue
  is particularly concerning for APIs that rely on usernames as input parameters, such as PUT
  /api/v1/users/test_race, where it could lead to further complications.
