summary: The Community by PeepSo – Social Network, Membership, Registration, User Profiles plugin
  for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including,
  6.4.5.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts
  in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site
  installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
