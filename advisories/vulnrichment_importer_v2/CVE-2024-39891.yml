aliases: []
summary: In the Twilio Authy API, accessed by Authy Android before 25.1.0 and Authy iOS before
  26.1.0, an unauthenticated endpoint provided access to certain phone-number data, as exploited
  in the wild in June 2024. Specifically, the endpoint accepted a stream of requests containing
  phone numbers, and responded with information about whether each phone number was registered
  with Authy. (Authy accounts were not compromised, however.)
