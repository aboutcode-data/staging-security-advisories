aliases: []
summary: vLLM is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs.
  Versions starting from 0.8.0 and prior to 0.8.5 are affected by a critical performance vulnerability
  in the input preprocessing logic of the multimodal tokenizer. The code dynamically replaces
  placeholder tokens (e.g., <|audio_|>, <|image_|>) with repeated tokens based on precomputed
  lengths. Due to ​​inefficient list concatenation operations​​, the algorithm exhibits ​​quadratic
  time complexity (O(n²))​​, allowing malicious actors to trigger resource exhaustion via specially
  crafted inputs. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.5.
