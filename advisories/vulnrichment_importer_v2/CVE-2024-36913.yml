  Drivers: hv: vmbus: Leak pages if set_memory_encrypted() fails

  In CoCo VMs it is possible for the untrusted host to cause
  set_memory_encrypted() or set_memory_decrypted() to fail such that an
  error is returned and the resulting memory is shared. Callers need to
  take care to handle these errors to avoid returning decrypted (shared)
  memory to the page allocator, which could lead to functional or security
  issues.

  VMBus code could free decrypted pages if set_memory_encrypted()/decrypted()
  fails. Leak the pages if this happens.
