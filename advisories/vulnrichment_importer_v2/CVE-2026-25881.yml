summary: 'SandboxJS is a JavaScript sandboxing library. Prior to 0.8.31, a sandbox escape vulnerability
  allows sandboxed code to mutate host built-in prototypes by laundering the isGlobal protection
  flag through array literal intermediaries. When a global prototype reference (e.g., Map.prototype,
  Set.prototype) is placed into an array and retrieved, the isGlobal taint is stripped, permitting
  direct prototype mutation from within the sandbox. This results in persistent host-side prototype
  pollution and may enable RCE in applications that use polluted properties in sensitive sinks
  (example gadget: execSync(obj.cmd)). This vulnerability is fixed in 0.8.31.'
