aliases: []
summary: Apereo CAS is an open source multilingual single sign-on solution for the web. Apereo
  CAS can be configured to use authentication based on client X509 certificates. These certificates
  can be provided via TLS handshake or a special HTTP header, such as “ssl_client_cert”. When
  checking the validity of the provided client certificate, X509CredentialsAuthenticationHandler
  performs check that this certificate is not revoked. To do so, it fetches URLs provided in
  the “CRL Distribution Points” extension of the certificate, which are taken from the certificate
  itself and therefore can be controlled by a malicious user. If the CAS server is configured
  to use an LDAP server for x509 authentication with a password, for example by setting a “cas.authn.x509.ldap.ldap-url”
  and “cas.authn.x509.ldap.bind-credential” properties, X509CredentialsAuthenticationHandler
  fetches revocation URLs from the certificate, which can be LDAP urls. When making requests
  to this LDAP urls, Apereo CAS uses the same password as for initially configured LDAP server,
  which can lead to a password leak. An unauthenticated user can leak the password used to LDAP
  connection configured on server. This issue has been addressed in version 6.6.6. Users are
  advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
