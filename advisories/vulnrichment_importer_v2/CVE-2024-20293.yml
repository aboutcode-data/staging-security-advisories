aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the activation of an access control list (ACL) on Cisco Adaptive
  Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could
  allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the protection that is offered by a configured
  ACL on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to a logic error that occurs when an
  ACL changes from inactive to active in the running configuration of an affected device. An
  attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic through the affected device that
  should be denied by the configured ACL. The reverse condition is also true—traffic that should
  be permitted could be denied by the configured ACL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to bypass configured ACL protections on the affected device, allowing the attacker to access
  trusted networks that the device might be protecting. Note: This vulnerability applies to
  both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic as well as dual-stack ACL configurations in which both IPv4 and
  IPv6 ACLs are configured on an interface.'
