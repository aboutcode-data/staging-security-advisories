aliases: []
summary: Grav is an open-source, flat-file content management system. A file upload path traversal
  vulnerability has been identified in the application prior to version 1.7.45, enabling attackers
  to replace or create files with extensions like .json, .zip, .css, .gif, etc. This critical
  security flaw poses severe risks, that can allow attackers to inject arbitrary code on the
  server, undermine integrity of backup files by overwriting existing files or creating new
  ones, and exfiltrate sensitive data using CSS exfiltration techniques. Upgrading to patched
  version 1.7.45 can mitigate the issue.
