  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  usb: dwc3-am62: fix module unload/reload behavior

  As runtime PM is enabled, the module can be runtime
  suspended when .remove() is called.

  Do a pm_runtime_get_sync() to make sure module is active
  before doing any register operations.

  Doing a pm_runtime_put_sync() should disable the refclk
  so no need to disable it again.

  Fixes the below warning at module removel.

  [   39.705310] ------------[ cut here ]------------
  [   39.710004] clk:162:3 already disabled
  [   39.713941] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 921 at drivers/clk/clk.c:1090 clk_core_disable+0xb0/0xb8

  We called of_platform_populate() in .probe() so call the
  cleanup function of_platform_depopulate() in .remove().
  Get rid of the now unnnecessary dwc3_ti_remove_core().
  Without this, module re-load doesn't work properly.
