summary: "A vulnerability in the Wireless Network Control daemon (wncd) of Cisco IOS XE Software\
  \ for Wireless LAN Controllers could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause\
  \ a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper memory\
  \ management. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of network\
  \ requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the\
  \ wncd process to consume available memory and eventually cause the device to reload, resulting\
  \ in a DoS condition."
