aliases: []
summary: Argo Events is an event-driven workflow automation framework for Kubernetes. Prior
  to version 1.7.1, several `HandleRoute` endpoints make use of the deprecated `ioutil.ReadAll()`.
  `ioutil.ReadAll()` reads all the data into memory. As such, an attacker who sends a large
  request to the Argo Events server will be able to crash it and cause denial of service. A
  patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo Events version 1.7.1.
