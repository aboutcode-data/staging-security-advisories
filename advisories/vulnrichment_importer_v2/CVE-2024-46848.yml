  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  perf/x86/intel: Limit the period on Haswell

  Running the ltp test cve-2015-3290 concurrently reports the following
  warnings.

  Thanks to Thomas Gleixner's analysis, the issue is caused by the low
  initial period (1) of the frequency estimation algorithm, which triggers
  the defects of the HW, specifically erratum HSW11 and HSW143. (For the
  details, please refer https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/87plq9l5d2.ffs@tglx/)

  The HSW11 requires a period larger than 100 for the INST_RETIRED.ALL
  event, but the initial period in the freq mode is 1. The erratum is the
  same as the BDM11, which has been supported in the kernel. A minimum
  period of 128 is enforced as well on HSW.

  HSW143 is regarding that the fixed counter 1 may overcount 32 with the
  Hyper-Threading is enabled. However, based on the test, the hardware
  has more issues than it tells. Besides the fixed counter 1, the message
  'interrupt took too long' can be observed on any counter which was armed
  with a period < 32 and two events expired in the same NMI. A minimum
  period of 32 is enforced for the rest of the events.
  The recommended workaround code of the HSW143 is not implemented.
  Because it only addresses the issue for the fixed counter. It brings
  extra overhead through extra MSR writing. No related overcounting issue
  has been reported so far.
