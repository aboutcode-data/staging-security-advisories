  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  landlock: Fix d_parent walk

  The WARN_ON_ONCE() in collect_domain_accesses() can be triggered when
  trying to link a root mount point.  This cannot work in practice because
  this directory is mounted, but the VFS check is done after the call to
  security_path_link().

  Do not use source directory's d_parent when the source directory is the
  mount point.
