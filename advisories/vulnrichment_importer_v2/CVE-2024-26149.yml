aliases: []
summary: Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual machine. If an
  excessively large value is specified as the starting index for an array in `_abi_decode`,
  it can cause the read position to overflow. This results in the decoding of values outside
  the intended array bounds, potentially leading to exploitations in contracts that use arrays
  within `_abi_decode`. This vulnerability affects 0.3.10 and earlier versions.
