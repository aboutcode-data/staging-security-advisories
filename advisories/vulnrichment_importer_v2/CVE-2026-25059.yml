aliases: []
summary: OpenList Frontend is a UI component for OpenList. Prior to 4.1.10, the application
  contains path traversal vulnerability in multiple file operation handlers in server/handles/fsmanage.go.
  Filename components in req.Names are directly concatenated with validated directories using
  stdpath.Join. This allows ".." sequences to bypass path restrictions, enabling users to access
  other users' files within the same storage mount and perform unauthorized actions such as
  deletion, renaming, or copying of files. An authenticated attacker can bypass directory-level
  authorisation by injecting traversal sequences into filename components, enabling unauthorised
  file removal and copying across user boundaries within the same storage mount. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 4.1.10.
