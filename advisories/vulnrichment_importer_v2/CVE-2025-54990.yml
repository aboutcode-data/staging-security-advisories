aliases: []
summary: XWiki AdminTools integrates administrative tools for managing a running XWiki instance.
  Prior to version 1.1, users without admin rights have access to AdminTools.SpammedPages. View
  rights are not restricted only to admin users for AdminTools.SpammedPages. While no data is
  visible to non admin users, the page is still accessible. This issue has been patched in version
  1.1. A workaround involves setting the view rights for the AdminTools space to be only available
  for the XWikiAdminGroup.
