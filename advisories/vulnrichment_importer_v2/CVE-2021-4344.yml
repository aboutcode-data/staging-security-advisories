summary: The Frontend File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation
  in versions up to, and including, 18.2. This is due to lacking mishandling the use of user

  attackers to access the information and privileges of other users, including 'guest users',
  in their own category (authenticated, or unauthenticated guests).
