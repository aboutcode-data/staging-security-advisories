aliases: []
summary: fish-shop/syntax-check is a GitHub action for syntax checking fish shell files. Improper
  neutralization of delimiters in the `pattern` input (specifically the command separator `;`
  and command substitution characters `(` and `)`) mean that arbitrary command injection is
  possible by modification of the input value used in a workflow. This has the potential for
  exposure or exfiltration of sensitive information from the workflow runner, such as might
  be achieved by sending environment variables to an external entity. It is recommended that
  users update to the patched version `v1.6.12` or the latest release version `v2.0.0`, however
  remediation may be possible through careful control of workflows and the `pattern` input value
  used by this action.
