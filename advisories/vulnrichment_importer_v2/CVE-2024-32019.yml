aliases: []
summary: Netdata is an open source observability tool. In affected versions the `ndsudo` tool
  shipped with affected versions of the Netdata Agent allows an attacker to run arbitrary programs
  with root permissions. The `ndsudo` tool is packaged as a `root`-owned executable with the
  SUID bit set. It only runs a restricted set of external commands, but its search paths are
  supplied by the `PATH` environment variable. This allows an attacker to control where `ndsudo`
  looks for these commands, which may be a path the attacker has write access to. This may lead
  to local privilege escalation. This vulnerability has been addressed in versions 1.45.3 and
  1.45.2-169. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
