aliases: []
summary: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Easy File Sharing HTTP Server
  version 7.2. The flaw is triggered when a crafted POST request is sent to the /sendemail.ghp
  endpoint containing an overly long Email parameter. The application fails to properly validate
  the length of this field, resulting in a memory corruption condition. An unauthenticated remote
  attacker can exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the server process.
