  drm/panfrost: Fix GEM handle creation ref-counting

  panfrost_gem_create_with_handle() previously returned a BO but with the
  only reference being from the handle, which user space could in theory
  guess and release, causing a use-after-free. Additionally if the call to
  panfrost_gem_mapping_get() in panfrost_ioctl_create_bo() failed then
  a(nother) reference on the BO was dropped.

  The _create_with_handle() is a problematic pattern, so ditch it and
  instead create the handle in panfrost_ioctl_create_bo(). If the call to
  panfrost_gem_mapping_get() fails then this means that user space has
  indeed gone behind our back and freed the handle. In which case just
  return an error code.
