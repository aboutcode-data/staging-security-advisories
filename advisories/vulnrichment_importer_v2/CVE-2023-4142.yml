aliases: []
summary: The WP Ultimate CSV Importer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution
  in versions up to, and including, 7.9.8 via the '->cus1' parameter. This allows authenticated
  attackers with author-level permissions or above, if the administrator previously grants access
  in the plugin settings, to execute code on the server. The author resolved this vulnerability
  by removing the ability for authors and editors to import files, please note that this means
  remote code execution is still possible for site administrators, use the plugin with caution.
