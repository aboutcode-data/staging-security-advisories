aliases: []
summary: An unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability exists in the Kloxo web hosting control
  panel (developed by LXCenter) prior to version 6.1.12. The flaw resides in the login-name
  parameter passed to lbin/webcommand.php, which fails to properly sanitize input, allowing
  an attacker to extract the administrator’s password from the backend database. After recovering
  valid credentials, the attacker can authenticate to the Kloxo control panel and leverage the
  Command Center feature (display.php) to execute arbitrary operating system commands as root
  on the underlying host system. This vulnerability was reported to be exploited in the wild
  in January 2014.
