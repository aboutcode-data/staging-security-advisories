summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure
  Software (NFVIS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication
  and get limited access to the web-based management interface. The vulnerability is due to
  an incorrect implementation of authentication in the web-based management interface. An attacker

  management interface on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to view limited configuration details and potentially upload a virtual machine image.
