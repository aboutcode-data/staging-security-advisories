  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  btrfs: fix memory ordering between normal and ordered work functions

  Ordered work functions aren't guaranteed to be handled by the same thread
  which executed the normal work functions. The only way execution between
  normal/ordered functions is synchronized is via the WORK_DONE_BIT,
  unfortunately the used bitops don't guarantee any ordering whatsoever.

  This manifested as seemingly inexplicable crashes on ARM64, where
  async_chunk::inode is seen as non-null in async_cow_submit which causes
  submit_compressed_extents to be called and crash occurs because
  async_chunk::inode suddenly became NULL. The call trace was similar to:

      pc : submit_compressed_extents+0x38/0x3d0
      lr : async_cow_submit+0x50/0xd0
      sp : ffff800015d4bc20

      <registers omitted for brevity>

      Call trace:
       submit_compressed_extents+0x38/0x3d0
       async_cow_submit+0x50/0xd0
       run_ordered_work+0xc8/0x280
       btrfs_work_helper+0x98/0x250
       process_one_work+0x1f0/0x4ac
       worker_thread+0x188/0x504
       kthread+0x110/0x114
       ret_from_fork+0x10/0x18

  Fix this by adding respective barrier calls which ensure that all
  accesses preceding setting of WORK_DONE_BIT are strictly ordered before
  setting the flag. At the same time add a read barrier after reading of
  WORK_DONE_BIT in run_ordered_work which ensures all subsequent loads
  would be strictly ordered after reading the bit. This in turn ensures
  are all accesses before WORK_DONE_BIT are going to be strictly ordered
  before any access that can occur in ordered_func.
