aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol\
  \ of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent\
  \ attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r This\
  \ vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation when parsing an ingress IS-IS packet.\
  \ An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IS-IS packet to an affected\
  \ device after forming an adjacency. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause\
  \ the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r Note:\
  \ The IS-IS protocol is a routing protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must\
  \ be Layer 2-adjacent to the affected device and have formed an adjacency."
