aliases: []
summary: Langflow is a tool for building and deploying AI-powered agents and workflows. Prior
  to version 1.7.0.dev45, multiple critical API endpoints in Langflow are missing authentication
  controls. The issue allows any unauthenticated user to access sensitive user conversation
  data, transaction histories, and perform destructive operations including message deletion.
  This affects endpoints handling personal data and system operations that should require proper
  authorization. Version 1.7.0.dev45 contains a patch.
