aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Shell Access Filter feature of Cisco Firepower Management Center
  (FMC), when used in conjunction with remote authentication, could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to cause high disk utilization, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
  The vulnerability occurs because the configuration of the Shell Access Filter, when used with
  a specific type of remote authentication, can cause a system file to have unbounded writes.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a steady stream of remote authentication
  requests to the appliance when the specific configuration is applied. Successful exploitation
  could allow the attacker to increase the size of a system log file so that it consumes most
  of the disk space. The lack of available disk space could lead to a DoS condition in which
  the device functions could operate abnormally, making the device unstable.
