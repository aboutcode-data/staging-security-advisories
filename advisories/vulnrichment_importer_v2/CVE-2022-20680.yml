aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Service Catalog
  could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information on an affected
  device. This vulnerability is due to improper enforcement of Administrator privilege levels
  for low-value sensitive data. An attacker with read-only Administrator access to the web-based
  management interface could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious HTTP request
  to the page that contains the sensitive data. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to collect sensitive information about users of the system and orders that have been placed
  using the application.
