aliases: []
summary: The Breadcrumb NavXT plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass through
  user-controlled key in versions up to and including 7.5.0. This is due to the Gutenberg block
  renderer trusting the $_REQUEST['post_id'] parameter without verification in the includes/blocks/build/breadcrumb-trail/render.php
  file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to enumerate and view breadcrumb
  trails for draft or private posts by manipulating the post_id parameter, revealing post titles
  and hierarchy that should remain hidden.
