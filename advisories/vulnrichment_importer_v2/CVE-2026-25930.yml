aliases: []
summary: OpenEMR is a free and open source electronic health records and medical practice management
  application. Prior to version 8.0.0, the Layout-Based Form (LBF) printable view accepts `formid`
  and `visitid` (or `patientid`) from the request and does not verify that the form belongs
  to the current user’s authorized patient/encounter. An authenticated user with LBF access
  can enumerate form IDs and view or print any patient’s encounter forms. Version 8.0.0 fixes
  the issue.
