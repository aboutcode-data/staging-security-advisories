  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ASoC: SOF: amd: Fix memory leak in amd_sof_acp_probe()

  Driver uses kasprintf() to initialize fw_{code,data}_bin members of
  struct acp_dev_data, but kfree() is never called to deallocate the
  memory, which results in a memory leak.

  Fix the issue by switching to devm_kasprintf(). Additionally, ensure the
  allocation was successful by checking the pointer validity.
