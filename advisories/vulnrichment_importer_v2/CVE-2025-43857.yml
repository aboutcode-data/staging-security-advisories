aliases: []
summary: Net::IMAP implements Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) client functionality in
  Ruby. Prior to versions 0.5.7, 0.4.20, 0.3.9, and 0.2.5, there is a possibility for denial
  of service by memory exhaustion when net-imap reads server responses. At any time while the
  client is connected, a malicious server can send can send a "literal" byte count, which is
  automatically read by the client's receiver thread. The response reader immediately allocates
  memory for the number of bytes indicated by the server response. This should not be an issue
  when securely connecting to trusted IMAP servers that are well-behaved. It can affect insecure
  connections and buggy, untrusted, or compromised servers (for example, connecting to a user
  supplied hostname). This issue has been patched in versions 0.5.7, 0.4.20, 0.3.9, and 0.2.5.
