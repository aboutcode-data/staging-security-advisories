aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP)
  protocol component of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to
  improper input validation on fields within CAPWAP Discovery Request packets by the affected
  device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious CAPWAP Discovery
  Request packets to the Cisco WLC Software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
  cause the Cisco WLC Software to disconnect associated access points (APs). While the APs disconnect
  and reconnect, service will be unavailable for a brief period of time, resulting in a DoS
  condition.
