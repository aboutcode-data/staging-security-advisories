aliases: []
summary: drawnix is an all in one open-source whiteboard tool. In drawnix versions through 0.2.1,
  a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the debug logging functionality. User
  controlled content is inserted directly into the DOM via innerHTML without sanitization when
  the global function __drawnix__web__console is invoked, as shown in apps/web/src/app/app.tsx
  where div.innerHTML = value is executed. This can allow arbitrary JavaScript execution in
  the context of the application if an attacker can cause untrusted data to be passed to the
  debug logger (for example via a malicious extension or other injection vector), potentially
  exposing user data or enabling unauthorized actions. The issue is fixed in version 0.3.0.
  Updating to 0.3.0 or later is recommended. No known workarounds exist.
