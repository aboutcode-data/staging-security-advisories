aliases: []
summary: A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the JavaScript engine of Foxit Software's
  PDF Reader, version 12.0.1.12430. By prematurely destroying annotation objects, a specially-crafted
  PDF document can trigger the reuse of previously freed memory, which can lead to arbitrary
  code execution. An attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious file to trigger
  this vulnerability. Exploitation is also possible if a user visits a specially-crafted, malicious
  site if the browser plugin extension is enabled.
