  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ext4: check stripe size compatibility on remount as well

  We disable stripe size in __ext4_fill_super if it is not a multiple of
  the cluster ratio however this check is missed when trying to remount.
  This can leave us with cases where stripe < cluster_ratio after
  remount:set making EXT4_B2C(sbi->s_stripe) become 0 that can cause some
  unforeseen bugs like divide by 0.

  Fix that by adding the check in remount path as well.
