summary: Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) is an interactive video and image annotation
  tool for computer vision. Starting in version 2.2.0 and prior to version 2.14.3, if an attacker
  can trick a logged-in CVAT user into visiting a malicious URL, they can initiate a dataset
  export or a backup from a project, task or job that the victim user has permission to export
  into a cloud storage that the victim user has access to. The name of the resulting file can
  be chosen by the attacker. This implies that the attacker can overwrite arbitrary files in
  any cloud storage that the victim can access and, if the attacker has read access to the cloud
  storage used in the attack, they can obtain media files, annotations, settings and other information
  from any projects, tasks or jobs that the victim has permission to export. Version 2.14.3
  contains a fix for the issue. No known workarounds are available.
