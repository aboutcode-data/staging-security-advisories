aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Integrated Management
  Controller (IMC) Supervisor, Cisco UCS Director, and Cisco UCS Director Express for Big Data
  could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying
  Linux shell as the root user. Exploitation of this vulnerability requires privileged access
  to an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied
  input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by logging in to the web-based management interface with administrator privileges and then
  sending a malicious request to a certain part of the interface.
