  Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access a configuration file and
  the login page for an administrative console that they would not normally have authorization
  to access. This vulnerability is due to improper authorization checking for HTTP requests
  that are submitted to the affected web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit
