aliases: []
summary: 'Apache XML Security for C++ through 2.0.4 implements the XML Signature Syntax and
  Processing (XMLDsig) specification without protection against an SSRF payload in a KeyInfo
  element. NOTE: the project disputes this CVE Record on the grounds that any vulnerabilities
  are the result of a failure to configure XML Security for C++ securely. Even when avoiding
  this particular issue, any use of this library would need considerable additional code and
  a deep understanding of the standards and protocols involved to arrive at a secure implementation
  for any particular use case. We recommend against continued direct use of this library.'
