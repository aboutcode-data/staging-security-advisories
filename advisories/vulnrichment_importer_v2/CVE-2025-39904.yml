summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: kexec:\
  \ initialize kexec_buf struct in load_other_segments()\n\nPatch series \"kexec: Fix invalid\
  \ field access\".\n\nThe kexec_buf structure was previously declared without initialization.\
  \ \ncommit bf454ec31add (\"kexec_file: allow to place kexec_buf randomly\")\nadded a field\
  \ that is always read but not consistently populated by all\narchitectures.  This un-initialized\
  \ field will contain garbage.\n\nThis is also triggering a UBSAN warning when the uninitialized\
  \ data was\naccessed:\n\n\t------------[ cut here ]------------\n\tUBSAN: invalid-load in\
  \ ./include/linux/kexec.h:210:10\n\tload of value 252 is not a valid value for type '_Bool'\n\
  \nZero-initializing kexec_buf at declaration ensures all fields are cleanly\nset, preventing\
  \ future instances of uninitialized memory being used.\n\nAn initial fix was already landed\
  \ for arm64[0], and this patchset fixes\nthe problem on the remaining arm64 code and on riscv,\
  \ as raised by Mark.\n\nDiscussions about this problem could be found at[1][2].\n\n\nThis\
  \ patch (of 3):\n\nThe kexec_buf structure was previously declared without initialization.\n\
  commit bf454ec31add (\"kexec_file: allow to place kexec_buf randomly\")\nadded a field that\
