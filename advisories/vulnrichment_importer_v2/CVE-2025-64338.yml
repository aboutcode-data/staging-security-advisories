summary: 'ClipBucket v5 is an open source video sharing platform. In versions 5.5.2 - #156 and
  below, an authenticated regular user can create a photo collection whose Collection Name contains
  HTML/JavaScript payloads, which making ClipBucket’s Manage Photos feature vulnerable to Stored
  XSS. The payload is rendered unsafely in the Admin → Manage Photos interface, causing it to
  execute in the administrator’s browser, therefore allowing an attacker to target administrators
  and perform actions with elevated privileges. This issue is fixed in version 5.5.2 - #157.'
