summary: JavaCPP Presets is a project providing Java distributions of native C++ libraries.
  All the actions in the `bytedeco/javacpp-presets` use the `github.event.head_commit.message​`
  parameter in an insecure way. For example, the commit message is used in a run statement -
  resulting in a command injection vulnerability due to string interpolation. No exploitation
  has been reported. This issue has been addressed in version 1.5.9. Users of JavaCPP Presets
  are advised to upgrade as a precaution.
