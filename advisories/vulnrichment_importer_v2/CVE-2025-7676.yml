aliases: []
summary: DLL hijacking of all PE32 executables when run on Windows for ARM64 CPU architecture.
  This allows an attacker to execute code, if the attacker can plant a DLL in the same directory
  as the executable. Vulnerable versions of Windows 11 for ARM attempt to load Base DLLs that
  would ordinarily not be loaded from the application directory. Fixed in release 24H2, but
  present in all earlier versions of Windows 11 for ARM CPUs.
