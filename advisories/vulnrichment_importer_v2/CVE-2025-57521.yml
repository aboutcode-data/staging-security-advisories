aliases: []
summary: Bambu Studio 2.1.1.52 and earlier is affected by a vulnerability that allows arbitrary
  code execution during application startup. The application loads a network plugin without
  validating its digital signature or verifying its authenticity. A local attacker can exploit
  this behavior by placing a malicious component in the expected location, which is controllable
  by the attacker (e.g., under %APPDATA%), resulting in code execution within the context of
  the user. The main application is digitally signed, which may allow a malicious component
  to inherit trust and evade detection by security solutions that rely on signed parent processes.
