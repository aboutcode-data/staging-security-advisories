aliases: []
summary: libcontainer is a library for container control. Prior to libcontainer 0.5.3, while
  creating a tenant container, the tenant builder accepts a list of capabilities to be added
  in the spec of tenant container. The logic here adds the given capabilities to all capabilities
  of main container if present in spec, otherwise simply set provided capabilities as capabilities
  of the tenant container. However, setting inherited caps in any case for tenant container
  can lead to elevation of capabilities, similar to CVE-2022-29162. This does not affect youki
  binary itself. This is only applicable if you are using libcontainer directly and using the
  tenant builder.
