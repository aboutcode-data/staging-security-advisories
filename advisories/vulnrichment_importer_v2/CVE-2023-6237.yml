summary: |
  Issue summary: Checking excessively long invalid RSA public keys may take
  a long time.

  Impact summary: Applications that use the function EVP_PKEY_public_check()
  to check RSA public keys may experience long delays. Where the key that
  is being checked has been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead
  to a Denial of Service.

  When function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is called on RSA public keys,
  a computation is done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite.
  For valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more large primes and this
  computation completes quickly. However, if n is an overly large prime,
  then this computation would take a long time.

  An application that calls EVP_PKEY_public_check() and supplies an RSA key
  obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service
  attack.

  The function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is not called from other OpenSSL
  functions however it is called from the OpenSSL pkey command line
  application. For that reason that application is also vulnerable if used
  with the '-pubin' and '-check' options on untrusted data.

  The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

  The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.
