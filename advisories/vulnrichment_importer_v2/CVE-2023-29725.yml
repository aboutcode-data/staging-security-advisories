aliases: []
summary: The BT21 x BTS Wallpaper app 12 for Android allows unauthorized applications to actively
  request permission to insert data into the database that records information about a user's
  personal preferences and will be loaded into memory to be read and used when the application
  is opened. By injecting data, the attacker can force the application to load malicious image
  URLs and display them in the UI. As the amount of data increases, it will eventually cause
  the application to trigger an OOM error and crash, resulting in a persistent denial of service
  attack.
