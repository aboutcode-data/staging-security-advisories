aliases: []
summary: 'Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. All versions
  of Argo CD starting from version 2.6.0 have a bug where open web terminal sessions do not
  expire. This bug allows users to send any websocket messages even if the token has already
  expired. The most straightforward scenario is when a user opens the terminal view and leaves
  it open for an extended period. This allows the user to view sensitive information even when
  they should have been logged out already. A patch for this vulnerability has been released
  in the following Argo CD versions: 2.6.14, 2.7.12 and 2.8.1.'
