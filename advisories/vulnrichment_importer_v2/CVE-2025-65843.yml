aliases: []
summary: Aquarius Desktop 3.0.069 for macOS contains an insecure file handling vulnerability
  in its support data archive generation feature. The application follows symbolic links placed
  inside the ~/Library/Logs/Aquarius directory and treats them as regular files. When building
  the support ZIP, Aquarius recursively enumerates logs using a JUCE directory iterator configured
  to follow symlinks, and later writes file data without validating whether the target is a
  symbolic link. A local attacker can exploit this behavior by planting symlinks to arbitrary
  filesystem locations, resulting in unauthorized disclosure or modification of arbitrary files.
  When chained with the associated HelperTool privilege escalation issue, root-owned files may
  also be exposed.
