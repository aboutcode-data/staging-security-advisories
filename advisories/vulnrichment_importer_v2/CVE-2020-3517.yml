aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Cisco Fabric Services component of Cisco FXOS Software and Cisco
  NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated attacker to cause process crashes, which could
  result in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The attack vector is
  configuration dependent and could be remote or adjacent. For more information about the attack
  vector, see the Details section of this advisory. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  error handling when the affected software parses Cisco Fabric Services messages. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious Cisco Fabric Services messages to an
  affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of an affected
  device, which could result in a DoS condition.
