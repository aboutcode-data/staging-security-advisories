aliases: []
summary: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that
  can run Node.js. In versions prior to 4.10.15, or 5.0.0 and above prior to 5.2.6, a user can
  write to the session object of another user if the session object ID is known. For example,
  an attacker can assign the session object to their own user by writing to the `user` field
  and then read any custom fields of that session object. Note that assigning a session to another
  user does not usually change the privileges of either of the two users, and a user cannot
  assign their own session to another user. This issue is patched in version 4.10.15 and above,
  and 5.2.6 and above. To mitigate this issue in unpatched versions add a `beforeSave` trigger
  to the `_Session` class and prevent writing if the requesting user is different from the user
  in the session object.
