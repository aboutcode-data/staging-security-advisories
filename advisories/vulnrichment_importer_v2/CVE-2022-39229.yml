aliases: []
summary: Grafana is an open source data visualization platform for metrics, logs, and traces.
  Versions prior to 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 allow one user to block another user's login attempt by
  registering someone else'e email address as a username. A Grafana user’s username and email
  address are unique fields, that means no other user can have the same username or email address
  as another user. A user can have an email address as a username. However, the login system
  allows users to log in with either username or email address. Since Grafana allows a user
  to log in with either their username or email address, this creates an usual behavior where
  `user_1` can register with one email address and `user_2` can register their username as `user_1`’s
  email address. This prevents `user_1` logging into the application since `user_1`'s password
  won’t match with `user_2`'s email address. Versions 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 contain a patch. There
  are no workarounds for this issue.
