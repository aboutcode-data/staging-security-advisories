aliases: []
summary: containerd is an open-source container runtime. Versions 1.7.28 and below, 2.0.0-beta.0
  through 2.0.6, 2.1.0-beta.0 through 2.1.4, and 2.2.0-beta.0 through 2.2.0-rc.1 contain a bug
  in the CRI Attach implementation where a user can exhaust memory on the host due to goroutine
  leaks. This issue is fixed in versions 1.7.29, 2.0.7, 2.1.5 and 2.2.0. To workaround this
  vulnerability, users can set up an admission controller to control accesses to pods/attach
  resources.
