aliases: []
summary: A user endpoint didn't perform filtering on an incoming parameter, which was added
  directly to the application log. This could lead to an attacker injecting false log entries
  or corrupt the log file format. This has been fixed in the CKAN versions 2.9.11 and 2.10.4.
  Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should override the `/user/reset` endpoint
  to filter the `id` parameter in order to exclude newlines.
