aliases: []
summary: GitHub Workflow Updater is a VS Code extension that automatically pins GitHub Actions
  to specific commits for enhanced security. Before 0.0.7, any provided Github token would be
  stored in plaintext in the editor configuration as json on disk, rather than through the more
  secure "securestorage" api. An attacker with read only access to your home directory could
  have read this token and used it to perform actions with that token. Update to 0.0.7.
