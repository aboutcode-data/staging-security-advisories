summary: A vulnerability in the Layer 2 punt code of Cisco IOS XR Software running on Cisco
  ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker
  to cause the affected line card to reboot. This vulnerability is due to incorrect handling
  of specific Ethernet frames that cause a spin loop that can make the network processors unresponsive.
