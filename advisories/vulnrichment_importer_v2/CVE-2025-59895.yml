aliases: []
summary: Sync Breeze Enterprise Server v10.4.18 and Disk Pulse Enterprise v10.4.18 contain a
  remote denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability in the configuration restore functionality. The
  issue is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data during this process. An attacker
  could send malicious requests to alter the configuration file, causing the application to
  become unresponsive. In a successful scenario, the service may not recover on its own and
  require a complete reinstallation, as the configuration becomes corrupted and prevents the
  service from restarting, even manually.
