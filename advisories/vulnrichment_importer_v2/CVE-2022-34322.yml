aliases: []
summary: Multiple XSS issues were discovered in Sage Enterprise Intelligence 2021 R1.1 that
  allow an attacker to execute JavaScript code in the context of users' browsers. The attacker
  needs to be authenticated to reach the vulnerable features. An issue is present in the Notify
  Users About Modification menu and the Notifications feature. A user can send malicious notifications
  and execute JavaScript code in the browser of every user who has enabled notifications. This
  is a stored XSS, and can lead to privilege escalation in the context of the application. (Another
  issue is present in the Favorites tab. The name of a favorite or a folder of favorites is
  interpreted as HTML, and can thus embed JavaScript code, which is executed when displayed.
  This is a self-XSS.)
