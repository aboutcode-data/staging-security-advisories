  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  media: imon: fix access to invalid resource for the second interface

  imon driver probes two USB interfaces, and at the probe of the second
  interface, the driver assumes blindly that the first interface got
  bound with the same imon driver.  It's usually true, but it's still
  possible that the first interface is bound with another driver via a
  malformed descriptor.  Then it may lead to a memory corruption, as
  spotted by syzkaller; imon driver accesses the data from drvdata as
  struct imon_context object although it's a completely different one
  that was assigned by another driver.

  This patch adds a sanity check -- whether the first interface is
  really bound with the imon driver or not -- for avoiding the problem
  above at the probe time.
