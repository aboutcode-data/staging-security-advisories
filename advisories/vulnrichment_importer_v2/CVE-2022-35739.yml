aliases: []
summary: PRTG Network Monitor through 22.2.77.2204 does not prevent custom input for a device’s
  icon, which can be modified to insert arbitrary content into the style tag for that device.
  When the device page loads, the arbitrary Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) data is inserted into
  the style tag, loading malicious content. Due to PRTG Network Monitor preventing “characters,
  and from modern browsers disabling JavaScript support in style tags, this vulnerability could
  not be escalated into a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.
