aliases: []
summary: The Woodmart theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in
  all versions up to, and including, 8.0.3. This is due to the software allowing users to execute
  an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode through the
  woodmart_instagram_ajax_query AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to execute arbitrary shortcodes.
