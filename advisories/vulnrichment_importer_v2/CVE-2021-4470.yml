aliases: []
summary: TG8 Firewall contains a pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability in the
  runphpcmd.php endpoint. The syscmd POST parameter is passed directly to a system command without
  validation and executed with root privileges. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can supply
  crafted values to execute arbitrary operating system commands as root, resulting in full device
  compromise.
