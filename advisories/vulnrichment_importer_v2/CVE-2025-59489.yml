aliases: []
summary: 'Unity Runtime before 2025-10-02 on Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux allows argument
  injection that can result in loading of library code from an unintended location. If an application
  was built with a version of Unity Editor that had the vulnerable Unity Runtime code, then
  an adversary may be able to execute code on, and exfiltrate confidential information from,
  the machine on which that application is running. NOTE: product status is provided for Unity
  Editor because that is the information available from the Supplier. However, updating Unity
  Editor typically does not address the effects of the vulnerability; instead, it is necessary
  to rebuild and redeploy all affected applications.'
