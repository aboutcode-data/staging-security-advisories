summary: "A vulnerability in Cisco IOS Software for Cisco Catalyst 2960X, 2960XR, 2960CX, and\
  \ 3560CX Series Switches could allow an authenticated, local attacker with privilege level\
  \ 15 or an unauthenticated attacker with physical access to the device to execute persistent\
  \ code at boot time and break the chain of trust.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to missing\
  \ signature verification for specific files that may be loaded during the device boot process.\
  \ An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing a crafted file into a specific location\
  \ on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary\
  \ code at boot time.\r\n\r Because this allows the attacker to bypass a major security feature\
  \ of the device, Cisco has raised the Security Impact Rating (SIR) of this advisory from Medium\
  \ to High."
