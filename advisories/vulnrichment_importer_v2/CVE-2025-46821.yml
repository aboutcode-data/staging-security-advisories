aliases: []
summary: Envoy is a cloud-native edge/middle/service proxy. Prior to versions 1.34.1, 1.33.3,
  1.32.6, and 1.31.8, Envoy's URI template matcher incorrectly excludes the `*` character from
  a set of valid characters in the URI path. As a result URI path containing the `*` character
  will not match a URI template expressions. This can result in bypass of RBAC rules when configured
  using the `uri_template` permissions. This vulnerability is fixed in Envoy versions v1.34.1,
  v1.33.3, v1.32.6, v1.31.8. As a workaround, configure additional RBAC permissions using `url_path`
  with `safe_regex` expression.
