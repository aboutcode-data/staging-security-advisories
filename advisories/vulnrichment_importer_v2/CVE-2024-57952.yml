summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRevert \"libfs:\
  \ fix infinite directory reads for offset dir\"\n\nThe current directory offset allocator\
  \ (based on mtree_alloc_cyclic)\nstores the next offset value to return in octx->next_offset.\
  \ This\nmechanism typically returns values that increase monotonically over\ntime. Eventually,\
  \ though, the newly allocated offset value wraps\nback to a low number (say, 2) which is smaller\
  \ than other already-\nallocated offset values.\n\nYu Kuai <yukuai3@huawei.com> reports that,\
  \ after commit 64a7ce76fb90\n(\"libfs: fix infinite directory reads for offset dir\"), if\
  \ a\ndirectory's offset allocator wraps, existing entries are no longer\nvisible via readdir/getdents\
  \ because offset_readdir() stops listing\nentries once an entry's offset is larger than octx->next_offset.\n\
  These entries vanish persistently -- they can be looked up, but will\nnever again appear in\
  \ readdir(3) output.\n\nThe reason for this is that the commit treats directory offsets as\n\
  monotonically increasing integer values rather than opaque cookies,\nand introduces this comparison:\n\
  \n\tif (dentry2offset(dentry) >= last_index) {\n\nOn 64-bit platforms, the directory offset\
  \ value upper bound is\n2^63 - 1. Directory offsets will monotonically increase for millions\n\
  of years without wrapping.\n\nOn 32-bit platforms, however, LONG_MAX is 2^31 - 1. The allocator\n\
  can wrap after only a few weeks (at worst).\n\nRevert commit 64a7ce76fb90 (\"libfs: fix infinite\
  \ directory reads for\noffset dir\") to prepare for a fix that can work properly on 32-bit\n\
  systems and might apply to recent LTS kernels where shmem employs\nthe simple_offset mechanism."
