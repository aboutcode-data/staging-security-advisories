aliases: []
summary: Nextcloud Server is a self hosted personal cloud system. After setting up a user or
  administrator defined external storage with fixed credentials, the API returns them and adds
  them into the frontend again, allowing to read them in plain text when an attacker already
  has access to an active session of a user. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is
  upgraded to 28.0.12, 29.0.9 or 30.0.2 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server is upgraded to 25.0.13.14,
  26.0.13.10, 27.1.11.10, 28.0.12, 29.0.9 or 30.0.2.
