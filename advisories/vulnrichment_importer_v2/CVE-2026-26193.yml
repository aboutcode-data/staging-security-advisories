aliases: []
summary: Open WebUI is a self-hosted artificial intelligence platform designed to operate entirely
  offline. Prior to version 0.6.44, aanually modifying chat history allows setting the `embeds`
  property on a response message, the content of which is loaded into an iFrame with a sandbox
  that has `allow-scripts` and `allow-same-origin` set, ignoring the "iframe Sandbox Allow Same
  Origin" configuration. This enables stored XSS on the affected chat. This also triggers when
  the chat is in the shared format. The result is a shareable link containing the payload that
  can be distributed to any other users on the instance. Version 0.6.44 fixes the issue.
