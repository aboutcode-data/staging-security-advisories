aliases: []
summary: The WP-DownloadManager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
  due to missing file type validation in the download-add.php file in all versions up to, and
  including, 1.68.11. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level
  access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote
  code execution possible.
