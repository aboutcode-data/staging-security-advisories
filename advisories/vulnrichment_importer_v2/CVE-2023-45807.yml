aliases: []
summary: OpenSearch is a community-driven, open source fork of Elasticsearch and Kibana following
  the license change in early 2021. There is an issue with the implementation of tenant permissions
  in OpenSearch Dashboards where authenticated users with read-only access to a tenant can perform
  create, edit and delete operations on index metadata of dashboards and visualizations in that
  tenant, potentially rendering them unavailable. This issue does not affect index data, only
  metadata. Dashboards correctly enforces read-only permissions when indexing and updating documents.
  This issue does not provide additional read access to data users don’t already have. This
  issue can be mitigated by disabling the tenants functionality for the cluster. Versions 1.3.14
  and 2.11.0 contain a fix for this issue.
