  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  irqchip/gic-v4: Don't allow a VMOVP on a dying VPE

  Kunkun Jiang reported that there is a small window of opportunity for
  userspace to force a change of affinity for a VPE while the VPE has already
  been unmapped, but the corresponding doorbell interrupt still visible in
  /proc/irq/.

  Plug the race by checking the value of vmapp_count, which tracks whether
  the VPE is mapped ot not, and returning an error in this case.

  This involves making vmapp_count common to both GICv4.1 and its v4.0
  ancestor.
