aliases: []
summary: DPMAdirektPro 4.1.5 is vulnerable to DLL Hijacking. It happens by placing a malicious
  DLL in a directory (in the absence of a legitimate DLL), which is then loaded by the application
  instead of the legitimate DLL. This causes the malicious DLL to load with the same privileges
  as the application, thus causing a privilege escalation.
