summary: 'A vulnerability in DesktopServlet in the web-based management interface of Cisco Security
  Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a reflected cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based interface. The vulnerability is due
  to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of
  an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the
  interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute
  arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive
  browser-based information. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCuy79668.'
