aliases: []
summary: ZimaOS is a fork of CasaOS, an operating system for Zima devices and x86-64 systems
  with UEFI. In version 1.2.4 and all prior versions, the API endpoint `http://<Zima_Server_IP:PORT>/v2_1/file`
  in ZimaOS is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack, allowing authenticated users to list
  the contents of any directory on the server. By manipulating the path parameter, attackers
  can access sensitive system directories such as `/etc`, potentially exposing critical configuration
  files and increasing the risk of further attacks. As of time of publication, no known patched
  versions are available.
