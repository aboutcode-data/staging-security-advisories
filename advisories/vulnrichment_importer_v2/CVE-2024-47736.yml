  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  erofs: handle overlapped pclusters out of crafted images properly

  syzbot reported a task hang issue due to a deadlock case where it is
  waiting for the folio lock of a cached folio that will be used for
  cache I/Os.

  After looking into the crafted fuzzed image, I found it's formed with
  several overlapped big pclusters as below:

   Ext:   logical offset   |  length :     physical offset    |  length
     0:        0..   16384 |   16384 :     151552..    167936 |   16384
     1:    16384..   32768 |   16384 :     155648..    172032 |   16384
     2:    32768..   49152 |   16384 :  537223168.. 537239552 |   16384
  ...

  Here, extent 0/1 are physically overlapped although it's entirely
  _impossible_ for normal filesystem images generated by mkfs.

  First, managed folios containing compressed data will be marked as
  up-to-date and then unlocked immediately (unlike in-place folios) when
  compressed I/Os are complete.  If physical blocks are not submitted in
  the incremental order, there should be separate BIOs to avoid dependency
  issues.  However, the current code mis-arranges z_erofs_fill_bio_vec()
  and BIO submission which causes unexpected BIO waits.

  Second, managed folios will be connected to their own pclusters for
  efficient inter-queries.  However, this is somewhat hard to implement
  easily if overlapped big pclusters exist.  Again, these only appear in
  fuzzed images so let's simply fall back to temporary short-lived pages
  for correctness.

  Additionally, it justifies that referenced managed folios cannot be
  truncated for now and reverts part of commit 2080ca1ed3e4 ("erofs: tidy
  up `struct z_erofs_bvec`") for simplicity although it shouldn't be any
  difference.
