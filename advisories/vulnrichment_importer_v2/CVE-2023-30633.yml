aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in TrEEConfigDriver in Insyde InsydeH2O with kernel 5.0 through
  5.5. It can report false TPM PCR values, and thus mask malware activity. Devices use Platform
  Configuration Registers (PCRs) to record information about device and software configuration
  to ensure that the boot process is secure. (For example, Windows uses these PCR measurements
  to determine device health.) A vulnerable device can masquerade as a healthy device by extending
  arbitrary values into Platform Configuration Register (PCR) banks. This requires physical
  access to a target victim's device, or compromise of user credentials for a device. This issue
  is similar to CVE-2021-42299 (on Surface Pro devices).
