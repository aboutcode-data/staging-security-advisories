aliases: []
summary: The Enable SVG, WebP, and ICO Upload plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
  file upload in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.2. This is due to insufficient file
  type validation detecting ICO files, allowing double extension files with the appropriate
  magic bytes to bypass sanitization while being accepted as a valid ICO file. This makes it
  possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary
  files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
