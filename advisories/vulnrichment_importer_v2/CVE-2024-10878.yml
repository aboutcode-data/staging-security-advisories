aliases: []
summary: The Sugar Calendar – Simple Event Management plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg & remove_query_arg without
  appropriate escaping on the URL in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.0. This makes it
  possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute
  if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
