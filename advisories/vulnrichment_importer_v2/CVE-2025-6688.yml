aliases: []
summary: The Simple Payment plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in versions
  1.3.6 to 2.3.8. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a user's identity prior to
  logging them in through the create_user() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to log in as administrative users.
