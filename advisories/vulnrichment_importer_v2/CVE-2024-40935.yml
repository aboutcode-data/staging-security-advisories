summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  cachefiles: flush all requests after setting CACHEFILES_DEAD

  In ondemand mode, when the daemon is processing an open request, if the
  kernel flags the cache as CACHEFILES_DEAD, the cachefiles_daemon_write()
  will always return -EIO, so the daemon can't pass the copen to the kernel.
  Then the kernel process that is waiting for the copen triggers a hung_task.

  Since the DEAD state is irreversible, it can only be exited by closing
  /dev/cachefiles. Therefore, after calling cachefiles_io_error() to mark
  the cache as CACHEFILES_DEAD, if in ondemand mode, flush all requests to
  avoid the above hungtask. We may still be able to read some of the cached
  data before closing the fd of /dev/cachefiles.

  Note that this relies on the patch that adds reference counting to the req,
  otherwise it may UAF.
