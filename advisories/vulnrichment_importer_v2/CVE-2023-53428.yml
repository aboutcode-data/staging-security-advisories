  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  powercap: arm_scmi: Remove recursion while parsing zones

  Powercap zones can be defined as arranged in a hierarchy of trees and when
  registering a zone with powercap_register_zone(), the kernel powercap
  subsystem expects this to happen starting from the root zones down to the
  leaves; on the other side, de-registration by powercap_deregister_zone()
  must begin from the leaf zones.

  Available SCMI powercap zones are retrieved dynamically from the platform
  at probe time and, while any defined hierarchy between the zones is
  described properly in the zones descriptor, the platform returns the
  availables zones with no particular well-defined order: as a consequence,
  the trees possibly composing the hierarchy of zones have to be somehow
  walked properly to register the retrieved zones from the root.

  Currently the ARM SCMI Powercap driver walks the zones using a recursive
  algorithm; this approach, even though correct and tested can lead to kernel
  stack overflow when processing a returned hierarchy of zones composed by
  particularly high trees.

  Avoid possible kernel stack overflow by substituting the recursive approach
  with an iterative one supported by a dynamically allocated stack-like data
  structure.
