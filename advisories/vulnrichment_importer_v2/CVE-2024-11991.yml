aliases: []
summary: Motoko's incremental garbage collector is impacted by an uninitialized memory access
  bug, caused by incorrect use of write barriers in a few locations. This vulnerability could
  potentially allow unauthorized read or write access to a Canister's memory. However, exploiting
  this bug requires the Canister to enable the incremental garbage collector or enhanced orthogonal
  persistence, which are non-default features in Motoko.
