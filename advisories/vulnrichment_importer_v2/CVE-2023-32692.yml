aliases: []
summary: CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework. This vulnerability allows attackers
  to execute arbitrary code when you use Validation Placeholders. The vulnerability exists in
  the Validation library, and validation methods in the controller and in-model validation are
  also vulnerable because they use the Validation library internally. This issue is patched
  in version 4.3.5.
