summary: fastify is a fast and low overhead web framework, for Node.js. Affected versions of
  fastify are subject to a denial of service via malicious use of the Content-Type header. An
  attacker can send an invalid Content-Type header that can cause the application to crash.

  4.8.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may manually filter out http
  content with malicious Content-Type headers.
