aliases: []
summary: CI4MS is a CodeIgniter 4-based CMS skeleton that delivers a production-ready, modular
  architecture with RBAC authorization and theme support. Prior to version 0.28.5.0, the authentication
  implementation in CI4MS is vulnerable to email enumeration. An unauthenticated attacker can
  determine whether an email address is registered in the system by analyzing the application's
  response during the password reset process. This issue has been patched in version 0.28.5.0.
