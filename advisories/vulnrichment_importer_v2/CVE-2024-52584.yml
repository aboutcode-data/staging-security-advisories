aliases: []
summary: Autolab is a course management service that enables auto-graded programming assignments.
  There is a vulnerability in version 3.0.1 where CAs can view or edit the grade for any submission
  ID, even if they are not a CA for the class that has the submission. The endpoints only check
  that the CAs have the authorization level of a CA in the class in the endpoint, which is not
  necessarily the class the submission is attached to. Version 3.0.2 contains a patch. No known
  workarounds are available.
