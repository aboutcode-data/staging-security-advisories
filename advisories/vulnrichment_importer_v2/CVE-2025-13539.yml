aliases: []
summary: The FindAll Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.4. This is due to the plugin not properly logging
  in a user with the data that was previously verified through the 'findall_membership_check_facebook_user'
  and the 'findall_membership_check_google_user' functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to log in as administrative users, as long as they have an existing account on the
  site which can easily be created by default through the temp user functionality, and access
  to the administrative user's email.
