  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  binder: signal epoll threads of self-work

  In (e)poll mode, threads often depend on I/O events to determine when
  data is ready for consumption. Within binder, a thread may initiate a
  command via BINDER_WRITE_READ without a read buffer and then make use
  of epoll_wait() or similar to consume any responses afterwards.

  It is then crucial that epoll threads are signaled via wakeup when they
  queue their own work. Otherwise, they risk waiting indefinitely for an
  event leaving their work unhandled. What is worse, subsequent commands
  won't trigger a wakeup either as the thread has pending work.
