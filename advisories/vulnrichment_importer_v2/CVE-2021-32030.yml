aliases: []
summary: 'The administrator application on ASUS GT-AC2900 devices before 3.0.0.4.386.42643 and
  Lyra Mini before 3.0.0.4_384_46630 allows authentication bypass when processing remote input
  from an unauthenticated user, leading to unauthorized access to the administrator interface.
  This relates to handle_request in router/httpd/httpd.c and auth_check in web_hook.o. An attacker-supplied
  value of ''\0'' matches the device''s default value of ''\0'' in some situations. Note: All
  versions of Lyra Mini and earlier which are unsupported (End-of-Life, EOL) are also affected
  by this vulnerability, Consumers can mitigate this vulnerability by disabling the remote access
  features from WAN.'
