  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mm/hugetlb: do not call vma_add_reservation upon ENOMEM

  sysbot reported a splat [1] on __unmap_hugepage_range().  This is because
  vma_needs_reservation() can return -ENOMEM if
  allocate_file_region_entries() fails to allocate the file_region struct
  for the reservation.

  Check for that and do not call vma_add_reservation() if that is the case,
  otherwise region_abort() and region_del() will see that we do not have any
  file_regions.

  If we detect that vma_needs_reservation() returned -ENOMEM, we clear the
  hugetlb_restore_reserve flag as if this reservation was still consumed, so
  free_huge_folio() will not increment the resv count.
