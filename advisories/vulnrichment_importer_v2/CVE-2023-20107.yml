aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the deterministic random bit generator (DRBG), also known as pseudorandom
  number generator (PRNG), in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower
  Threat Defense (FTD) Software for Cisco ASA 5506-X, ASA 5508-X, and ASA 5516-X Firewalls could
  allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a cryptographic collision, enabling the
  attacker to discover the private key of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient
  entropy in the DRBG for the affected hardware platforms when generating cryptographic keys.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by generating a large number of cryptographic
  keys on an affected device and looking for collisions with target devices. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to impersonate an affected target device or to decrypt traffic secured
  by an affected key that is sent to or from an affected target device.
