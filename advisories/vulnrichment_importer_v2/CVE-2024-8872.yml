aliases: []
summary: The Store Hours for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
  Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg without appropriate escaping on the URL in all versions
  up to, and including, 4.3.20. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject
  arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing
  an action such as clicking on a link.
