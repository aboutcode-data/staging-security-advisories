  wifi: iwlwifi: fix double-free bug

  The storage for the TLV PC register data wasn't done like all
  the other storage in the drv->fw area, which is cleared at the
  end of deallocation. Therefore, the freeing must also be done
  differently, explicitly NULL'ing it out after the free, since
  otherwise there's a nasty double-free bug here if a file fails
  to load after this has been parsed, and we get another free
  later (e.g. because no other file exists.) Fix that by adding
  the missing NULL assignment.
