aliases: []
summary: n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. Prior to version 1.123.2, a Cross-Site
  Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in the handling of webhook responses and
  related HTTP endpoints. Under certain conditions, the Content Security Policy (CSP) sandbox
  protection intended to isolate HTML responses may not be applied correctly. An authenticated
  user with permission to create or modify workflows could abuse this to execute malicious scripts
  with same-origin privileges when other users interact with the crafted workflow. This could
  lead to session hijacking and account takeover. This issue has been patched in version 1.123.2.
