  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  fs: Pass AT_GETATTR_NOSEC flag to getattr interface function

  When vfs_getattr_nosec() calls a filesystem's getattr interface function
  then the 'nosec' should propagate into this function so that
  vfs_getattr_nosec() can again be called from the filesystem's gettattr
  rather than vfs_getattr(). The latter would add unnecessary security
  checks that the initial vfs_getattr_nosec() call wanted to avoid.
  Therefore, introduce the getattr flag GETATTR_NOSEC and allow to pass
  with the new getattr_flags parameter to the getattr interface function.
  In overlayfs and ecryptfs use this flag to determine which one of the
  two functions to call.

  In a recent code change introduced to IMA vfs_getattr_nosec() ended up
  calling vfs_getattr() in overlayfs, which in turn called
  security_inode_getattr() on an exiting process that did not have
  current->fs set anymore, which then caused a kernel NULL pointer
  dereference. With this change the call to security_inode_getattr() can
  be avoided, thus avoiding the NULL pointer dereference.
