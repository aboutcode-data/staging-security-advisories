summary: rails-html-sanitizer is responsible for sanitizing HTML fragments in Rails applications.
  There is a possible XSS vulnerability with certain configurations of Rails::HTML::Sanitizer
  1.6.0 when used with Rails >= 7.1.0. A possible XSS vulnerability with certain configurations
  of Rails::HTML::Sanitizer may allow an attacker to inject content if HTML5 sanitization is
  enabled and the application developer has overridden the sanitizer's allowed tags where the
  "math" and "style" elements are both explicitly allowed. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.6.1.
