aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Cisco Remote PHY Device Software could allow an authenticated, local
  attacker to execute commands on the underlying Linux shell of an affected device with root
  privileges. The vulnerability occurs because the affected software improperly sanitizes user-supplied
  input. An attacker who has valid administrator access to an affected device could exploit
  this vulnerability by supplying various CLI commands with crafted arguments. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands as the root user, allowing complete
  compromise of the system.
