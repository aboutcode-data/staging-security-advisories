aliases: []
summary: 'xmldom is a pure JavaScript W3C standard-based (XML DOM Level 2 Core) `DOMParser`
  and `XMLSerializer` module. xmldom parses XML that is not well-formed because it contains
  multiple top level elements, and adds all root nodes to the `childNodes` collection of the
  `Document`, without reporting any error or throwing. This breaks the assumption that there
  is only a single root node in the tree, which led to issuance of CVE-2022-39299 as it is a
  potential issue for dependents. Update to @xmldom/xmldom@~0.7.7, @xmldom/xmldom@~0.8.4 (dist-tag
  latest) or @xmldom/xmldom@>=0.9.0-beta.4 (dist-tag next). As a workaround, please one of the
  following approaches depending on your use case: instead of searching for elements in the
  whole DOM, only search in the `documentElement`or reject a document with a document that has
  more then 1 `childNode`.'
