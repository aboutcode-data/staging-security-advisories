aliases: []
summary: The Post Grid and Gutenberg Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege
  escalation in all versions 2.2.87 to 2.2.90. This is due to the plugin not properly restricting
  what user meta values can be updated and ensuring a form is active. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to update their user
  meta to become an administrator.
