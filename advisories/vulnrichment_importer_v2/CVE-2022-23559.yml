aliases: []
summary: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. An attacker can craft a TFLite
  model that would cause an integer overflow in embedding lookup operations. Both `embedding_size`
  and `lookup_size` are products of values provided by the user. Hence, a malicious user could
  trigger overflows in the multiplication. In certain scenarios, this can then result in heap
  OOB read/write. Users are advised to upgrade to a patched version.
