summary: 'DMA attacks on the parameter buffer used by a software SMI handler used by the driver
  PcdSmmDxe could lead to a TOCTOU attack on the SMI handler and lead to corruption of other
  ACPI fields and adjacent memory fields. DMA attacks on the parameter buffer used by a software
  SMI handler used by the driver PcdSmmDxe could lead to a TOCTOU attack on the SMI handler
  and lead to corruption of other ACPI fields and adjacent memory fields. The attack would require
  detailed knowledge of the PCD database contents on the current platform. This issue was discovered
  by Insyde engineering during a security review. This issue is fixed in Kernel 5.3: 05.36.23,
  Kernel 5.4: 05.44.23, Kernel 5.5: 05.52.23. Kernel 5.2 is unaffected. CWE-787 An issue was
  discovered in Insyde InsydeH2O with kernel 5.0 through 5.5. DMA attacks on the parameter buffer
  that is used by a software SMI handler (used by the PcdSmmDxe driver) could lead to a TOCTOU
  race-condition attack on the SMI handler, and lead to corruption of other ACPI fields and
  adjacent memory fields. The attack would require detailed knowledge of the PCD database contents
  on the current platform.'
