aliases: []
summary: The Shopwarden – Automated WooCommerce monitoring & testing plugin for WordPress is
  vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.11. This
  is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_setting() function. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary options and achieve privilege
  escalation via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
  an action such as clicking on a link.
