aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Kurmi Provisioning Suite 7.9.0.33. If an X-Forwarded-For
  header is received during authentication, the Kurmi application will record the (possibly
  forged) IP address mentioned in that header rather than the real IP address that the user
  logged in from. This fake IP address can later be displayed in the My Account popup that shows
  the IP address that was used to log in.
