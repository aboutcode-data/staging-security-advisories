aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business
  RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to
  conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against a user of the interface. The vulnerabilities
  are due to insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface. An attacker
  could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context
  of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit these
  vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have valid administrator credentials on the affected
  device.
