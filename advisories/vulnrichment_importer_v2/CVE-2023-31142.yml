aliases: []
summary: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.0.4 of the `stable`
  branch and version 3.1.0.beta5 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, if a site has modified
  their general category permissions, they could be set back to the default. This issue is patched
  in version 3.0.4 of the `stable` branch and version 3.1.0.beta5 of the `beta` and `tests-passed`
  branches. A workaround, only if you are modifying the general category permissions, is to
  use a new category for the same purpose.
