aliases: []
summary: Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. In versions below 1.3, an attacker
  can bypass the allow list in auto-run mode with a backtick (`) or $(cmd). If a user has swapped
  Cursor from its default settings (requiring approval for every terminal call) to an allowlist,
  an attacker can execute arbitrary command execution outside of the allowlist without user
  approval. An attacker can trigger this vulnerability if chained with indirect prompt injection.
  This is fixed in version 1.3.
