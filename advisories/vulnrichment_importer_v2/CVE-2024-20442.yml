summary: "A vulnerability in the REST API endpoints of Cisco Nexus Dashboard could allow an\
  \ authenticated, low-privileged, remote attacker to perform limited Administrator actions\
  \ on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization controls\
  \ on some REST API endpoints. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted\
  \ API requests to an affected endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform\
  \ limited Administrator functions such as viewing portions of the web UI, generating config\
  \ only or full backup files, and deleting tech support files. This vulnerability only affects\
  \ a subset of REST API endpoints and does not affect the web-based management interface."
