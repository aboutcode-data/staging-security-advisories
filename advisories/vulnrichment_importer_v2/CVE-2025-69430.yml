summary: An Incorrect Symlink Follow vulnerability exists in multiple Yottamaster NAS devices,
  including DM2 (version equal to or prior to V1.9.12), DM3 (version equal to or prior to V1.9.12),
  and DM200 (version equal to or prior to V1.2.23) that could be exploited by attackers to leak

  and tamper with those files.
