aliases: []
summary: Gin-vue-admin is a backstage management system based on vue and gin. Gin-vue-admin
  <= v2.6.5 has SQL injection vulnerability. The SQL injection vulnerabilities occur when a
  web application allows users to input data into SQL queries without sufficiently validating
  or sanitizing the input. Failing to properly enforce restrictions on user input could mean
  that even a basic form input field can be used to inject arbitrary and potentially dangerous
  SQL commands. This could lead to unauthorized access to the database, data leakage, data manipulation,
  or even complete compromise of the database server. This vulnerability has been addressed
  in commit `53d033821` which has been included in release version 2.6.6. Users are advised
  to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
