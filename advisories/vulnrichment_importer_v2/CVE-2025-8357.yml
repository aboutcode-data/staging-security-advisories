summary: The Media Library Assistant plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion
  in the /wp-content/uploads directory due to insufficient file path validation and user capability
  checking in the _process_mla_download_file function in all versions up to, and including,

  to delete arbitrary files on the server from the /wp-content/uploads/ directory.
