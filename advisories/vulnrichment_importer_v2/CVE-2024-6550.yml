aliases: []
summary: 'The Gravity Forms: Multiple Form Instances plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full
  Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.1. This is due to the plugin leaving
  test files with display_errors on. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
  retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The
  information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present
  for damage to an affected website.'
