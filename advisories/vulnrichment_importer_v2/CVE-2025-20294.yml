summary: "Multiple vulnerabilities in the CLI and web-based management interface of Cisco UCS\
  \ Manager Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges\
  \ to perform command injection attacks on an affected system and elevate privileges to root.\r\
  \n&nbsp;\r\nThese vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input validation of command arguments\
  \ supplied by the user. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by authenticating\
  \ to a device and submitting crafted input to the affected commands. A successful exploit\
  \ could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system\
  \ of the affected device with root-level privileges."
