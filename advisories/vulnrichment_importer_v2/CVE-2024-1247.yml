summary: Concrete CMS version 9 before 9.2.5 is vulnerable to  stored XSS via the Role Name
  field since there is insufficient validation of administrator provided data for that field. A
  rogue administrator could inject malicious code into the Role Name field which might be executed
  when users visit the affected page. The Concrete CMS Security team scored this 2 with CVSS
  v3 vector  AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator
  . Concrete versions below 9 do not include group types so they are not affected by this vulnerability.
