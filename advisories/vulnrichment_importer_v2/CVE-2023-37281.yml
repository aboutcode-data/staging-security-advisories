aliases: []
summary: 'Contiki-NG is an operating system for internet-of-things devices. In versions 4.9
  and prior, when processing the various IPv6 header fields during IPHC header decompression,
  Contiki-NG confirms the received packet buffer contains enough data as needed for that field.
  But no similar check is done before decompressing the IPv6 address. Therefore, up to 16 bytes
  can be read out of bounds on the line with the statement `memcpy(&ipaddr->u8[16 - postcount],
  iphc_ptr, postcount);`. The value of `postcount` depends on the address compression used in
  the received packet and can be controlled by the attacker. As a result, an attacker can inject
  a packet that causes an out-of-bound read. As of time of publication, a patched version is
  not available. As a workaround, one can apply the changes in Contiki-NG pull request #2509
  to patch the system.'
