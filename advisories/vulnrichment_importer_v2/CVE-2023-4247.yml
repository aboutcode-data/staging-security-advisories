summary: The GiveWP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions
  up to, and including, 2.33.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the

  the SendWP plugin via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
  an action such as clicking on a link.
