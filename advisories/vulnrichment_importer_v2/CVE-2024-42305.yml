  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ext4: check dot and dotdot of dx_root before making dir indexed

  Syzbot reports a issue as follows:
  ============================================
  BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffed11022e24fe

  ============================================

  The immediate cause of this problem is that there is only one valid dentry
  for the block to be split during do_split, so split==0 results in out of
  bounds accesses to the map triggering the issue.

      do_split
        unsigned split
        dx_make_map
         count = 1
        split = count/2 = 0;
        continued = hash2 == map[split - 1].hash;
         ---> map[4294967295]

  The maximum length of a filename is 255 and the minimum block size is 1024,
  so it is always guaranteed that the number of entries is greater than or
  equal to 2 when do_split() is called.

  But syzbot's crafted image has no dot and dotdot in dir, and the dentry
  distribution in dirblock is as follows:

    bus     dentry1          hole           dentry2           free
  |xx--|xx-------------|...............|xx-------------|...............|
  0   12 (8+248)=256  268     256     524 (8+256)=264 788     236     1024

  So when renaming dentry1 increases its name_len length by 1, neither hole
  nor free is sufficient to hold the new dentry, and make_indexed_dir() is
  called.

  In make_indexed_dir() it is assumed that the first two entries of the
  dirblock must be dot and dotdot, so bus and dentry1 are left in dx_root
  because they are treated as dot and dotdot, and only dentry2 is moved
  to the new leaf block. That's why count is equal to 1.

  Therefore add the ext4_check_dx_root() helper function to add more sanity
  checks to dot and dotdot before starting the conversion to avoid the above
  issue.
