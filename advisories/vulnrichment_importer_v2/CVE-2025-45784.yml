aliases: []
summary: D-Link DPH-400S/SE VoIP Phone v1.01 contains hardcoded provisioning variables, including
  PROVIS_USER_PASSWORD, which may expose sensitive user credentials. An attacker with access
  to the firmware image can extract these credentials using static analysis tools such as strings
  or xxd, potentially leading to unauthorized access to device functions or user accounts. This
  vulnerability exists due to insecure storage of sensitive information in the firmware binary.
