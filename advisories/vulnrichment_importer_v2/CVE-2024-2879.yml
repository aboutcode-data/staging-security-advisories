aliases: []
summary: The LayerSlider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the ls_get_popup_markup
  action in versions 7.9.11 and 7.10.0 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter
  and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for
  unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that
  can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
