aliases: []
summary: Matrix Media Repo (MMR) is a highly configurable multi-homeserver media repository
  for Matrix. MMR makes requests to other servers as part of normal operation, and these resource
  owners can return large amounts of JSON back to MMR for parsing. In parsing, MMR can consume
  large amounts of memory and exhaust available memory. This is fixed in MMR v1.3.8. Users are
  advised to upgrade. For users unable to upgrade; forward proxies can be configured to block
  requests to unsafe hosts. Alternatively, MMR processes can be configured with memory limits
  and auto-restart. Running multiple MMR processes concurrently can help ensure a restart does
  not overly impact users.
