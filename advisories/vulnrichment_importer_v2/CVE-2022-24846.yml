aliases: []
summary: GeoWebCache is a tile caching server implemented in Java. The GeoWebCache disk quota
  mechanism can perform an unchecked JNDI lookup, which in turn can be used to perform class
  deserialization and result in arbitrary code execution. While in GeoWebCache the JNDI strings
  are provided via local configuration file, in GeoServer a user interface is provided to perform
  the same, that can be accessed remotely, and requires admin-level login to be used. These
  lookup are unrestricted in scope and can lead to code execution. The lookups are going to
  be restricted in GeoWebCache 1.21.0, 1.20.2, 1.19.3.
