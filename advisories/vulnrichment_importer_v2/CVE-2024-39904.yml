aliases: []
summary: VNote is a note-taking platform. Prior to 3.18.1, a code execution vulnerability existed
  in VNote, which allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary programs on the victim's system.
  A crafted URI can be used in a note to perform this attack using file:/// as a link. For example,
  file:///C:/WINDOWS/system32/cmd.exe. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary programs by
  embedding a reference to a local executable file such as file:///C:/WINDOWS/system32/cmd.exe
  and file:///C:/WINDOWS/system32/calc.exe. This vulnerability can be exploited by creating
  and sharing specially crafted notes. An attacker could send a crafted note file and perform
  further attacks. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.18.1.
