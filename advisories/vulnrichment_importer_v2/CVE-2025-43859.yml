aliases: []
summary: h11 is a Python implementation of HTTP/1.1. Prior to version 0.16.0, a leniency in
  h11's parsing of line terminators in chunked-coding message bodies can lead to request smuggling
  vulnerabilities under certain conditions. This issue has been patched in version 0.16.0. Since
  exploitation requires the combination of buggy h11 with a buggy (reverse) proxy, fixing either
  component is sufficient to mitigate this issue.
