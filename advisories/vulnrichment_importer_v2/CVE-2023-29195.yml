aliases: []
summary: Vitess is a database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL through generalized
  sharding. Prior to version 16.0.2, users can either intentionally or inadvertently create
  a shard containing `/` characters from VTAdmin such that from that point on, anyone who tries
  to create a new shard from VTAdmin will receive an error. Attempting to view the keyspace(s)
  will also no longer work. Creating a shard using `vtctldclient` does not have the same problem
  because the CLI validates the input correctly. Version 16.0.2, corresponding to version 0.16.2
  of the `go` module, contains a patch for this issue. Some workarounds are available. Always
  use `vtctldclient` to create shards, instead of using VTAdmin; disable creating shards from
  VTAdmin using RBAC; and/or delete the topology record for the offending shard using the client
  for your topology server.
