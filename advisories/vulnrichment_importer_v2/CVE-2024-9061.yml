aliases: []
summary: 'The The WP Popup Builder – Popup Forms and Marketing Lead Generation plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution via the wp_ajax_nopriv_shortcode_Api_Add AJAX
  action in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.5. This is due to the software allowing users
  to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode.
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes. NOTE:
  This vulnerability was partially fixed in version 1.3.5 with a nonce check, which effectively
  prevented access to the affected function. However, version 1.3.6 incorporates the correct
  authorization check to prevent unauthorized access.'
