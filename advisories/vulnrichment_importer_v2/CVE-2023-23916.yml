aliases: []
summary: An allocation of resources without limits or throttling vulnerability exists in curl
  <v7.88.0 based on the "chained" HTTP compression algorithms, meaning that a server response
  can be compressed multiple times and potentially with differentalgorithms. The number of acceptable
  "links" in this "decompression chain" wascapped, but the cap was implemented on a per-header
  basis allowing a maliciousserver to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps
  simply byusing many headers. The use of such a decompression chain could result in a "malloc
  bomb", making curl end up spending enormous amounts of allocated heap memory, or trying to
  and returning out of memory errors.
