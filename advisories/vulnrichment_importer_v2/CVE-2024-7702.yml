aliases: []
summary: 'The Contact Form by Bit Form: Multi Step Form, Calculation Contact Form, Payment Contact
  Form & Custom Contact Form builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to generic SQL Injection
  via the entryID parameter in versions 2.0 to 2.13.9 due to insufficient escaping on the user-supplied
  parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to append additional
  SQL queries to already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information
  from the database.'
