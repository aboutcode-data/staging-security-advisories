aliases: []
summary: Race condition in the turbo-frame element handler in Hotwired Turbo before 8.0.x causes
  logout operations to fail when delayed frame responses reapply session cookies after logout.
  This can be exploited by remote attackers via selective network delays (e.g. delaying requests
  based on sequence or timing) or by physically proximate attackers when the race condition
  occurs naturally on shared computers.
