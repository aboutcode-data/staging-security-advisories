aliases: []
summary: The VK All in One Expansion Unit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the child page index widget in all versions up to, and including, 9.96.0.1 due
  to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes such as
  'className.' This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and
  above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses an injected page.
