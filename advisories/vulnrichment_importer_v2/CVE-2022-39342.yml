aliases: []
summary: OpenFGA is an authorization/permission engine. Versions prior to version 0.2.4 are
  vulnerable to authorization bypass under certain conditions. Users whose model has a relation
  defined as a tupleset (the right hand side of a ‘from’ statement) that involves anything other
  than a direct relationship (e.g. ‘as self’) are vulnerable. Version 0.2.4 contains a patch
  for this issue.
