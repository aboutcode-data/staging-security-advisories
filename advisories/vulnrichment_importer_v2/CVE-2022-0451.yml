aliases: []
summary: Dart SDK contains the HTTPClient in dart:io library whcih includes authorization headers
  when handling cross origin redirects. These headers may be explicitly set and contain sensitive
  information. By default, HttpClient handles redirection logic. If a request is sent to example.com
  with authorization header and it redirects to an attackers site, they might not expect attacker
  site to receive authorization header. We recommend updating the Dart SDK to version 2.16.0
  or beyond.
