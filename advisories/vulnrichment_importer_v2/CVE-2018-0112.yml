summary: 'A vulnerability in Cisco WebEx Business Suite clients, Cisco WebEx Meetings, and Cisco
  WebEx Meetings Server could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code
  on a targeted system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation by the Cisco
  WebEx clients. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing meeting attendees
  with a malicious Flash (.swf) file via the file-sharing capabilities of the client. Exploitation
  of this vulnerability could allow arbitrary code execution on the system of a targeted user.
  This affects the clients installed by customers when accessing a WebEx meeting. The following
  client builds of Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS30, WBS31, and WBS32), Cisco WebEx Meetings,
  and Cisco WebEx Meetings Server are impacted: Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS31) client builds
  prior to T31.23.2, Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS32) client builds prior to T32.10, Cisco
  WebEx Meetings with client builds prior to T32.10, Cisco WebEx Meetings Server builds prior
  to 2.8 MR2. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg19384, CSCvi10746.'
