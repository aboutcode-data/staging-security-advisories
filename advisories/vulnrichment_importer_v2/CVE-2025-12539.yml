aliases: []
summary: 'The TNC Toolbox: Web Performance plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information
  Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.2. This is due to the plugin storing cPanel
  API credentials (hostname, username, and API key) in files within the web-accessible wp-content
  directory without adequate protection in the "Tnc_Wp_Toolbox_Settings::save_settings" function.
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve these credentials and use
  them to interact with the cPanel API, which can lead to arbitrary file uploads, remote code
  execution, and full compromise of the hosting environment.'
