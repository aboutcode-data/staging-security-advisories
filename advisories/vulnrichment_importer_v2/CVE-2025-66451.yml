aliases: []
summary: LibreChat is a ChatGPT clone with additional features. In versions 0.8.0 and below,
  when creating prompts, JSON requests are sent to define and modify the prompts via PATCH endpoint
  for prompt groups (/api/prompts/groups/:groupId). However, the request bodies are not sufficiently
  validated for proper input, enabling users to modify prompts in a way that was not intended
  as part of the front end system. The patchPromptGroup function passes req.body directly to
  updatePromptGroup() without filtering sensitive fields. This issue is fixed in version 0.8.1.
