aliases: []
summary: The MStore API plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions
  up to, and including, 2.1.5. This is due to unrestricted access to the 'register' and 'update_user_profile'
  routes. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create new administrator accounts,
  delete existing administrator accounts, or escalate privileges on any account.
