aliases: []
summary: Jetty is a Java based web server and servlet engine. Versions 9.4.21 through 9.4.51,
  10.0.15, and 11.0.15 are vulnerable to weak authentication. If a Jetty `OpenIdAuthenticator`
  uses the optional nested `LoginService`, and that `LoginService` decides to revoke an already
  authenticated user, then the current request will still treat the user as authenticated. The
  authentication is then cleared from the session and subsequent requests will not be treated
  as authenticated. So a request on a previously authenticated session could be allowed to bypass
  authentication after it had been rejected by the `LoginService`. This impacts usages of the
  jetty-openid which have configured a nested `LoginService` and where that `LoginService` will
  is capable of rejecting previously authenticated users. Versions 9.4.52, 10.0.16, and 11.0.16
  have a patch for this issue.
