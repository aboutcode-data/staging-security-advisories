aliases: []
summary: The Shopper Approved Reviews plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification
  of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check on the ajax_callback_update_sa_option()
  function in versions 2.0 to 2.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
  Subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This
  can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user
  registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site.
