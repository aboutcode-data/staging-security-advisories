aliases: []
summary: The BA Book Everything plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.20. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the my_account_update() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to update a user's account details via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This can be leveraged to reset a user's
  password and gain access to their account.
