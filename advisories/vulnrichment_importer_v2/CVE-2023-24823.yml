aliases: []
summary: RIOT-OS, an operating system that supports Internet of Things devices, contains a network
  stack with the ability to process 6LoWPAN frames. Prior to version 2022.10, an attacker can
  send a crafted frame to the device resulting in a type confusion between IPv6 extension headers
  and a UDP header. This occurs while encoding a 6LoWPAN IPHC header. The type confusion manifests
  in an out of bounds write in the packet buffer. The overflow can be used to corrupt other
  packets and the allocator metadata. Corrupting a pointer will easily lead to denial of service.
  While carefully manipulating the allocator metadata gives an attacker the possibility to write
  data to arbitrary locations and thus execute arbitrary code. Version 2022.10 fixes this issue.
  As a workaround, apply the patches manually.
