aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the IPv6 DHCP (DHCPv6) client module of Cisco Adaptive Security
  Appliance (ASA) Software, Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software, Cisco IOS Software,
  and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial
  of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient
  validation of DHCPv6 messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted
  DHCPv6 messages to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause
  the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: To successfully exploit this vulnerability,
  the attacker would need to either control the DHCPv6 server or be in a man-in-the-middle position.'
