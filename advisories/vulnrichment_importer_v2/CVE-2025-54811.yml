aliases: []
summary: OpenPLC_V3 has a vulnerability in the enipThread function that occurs due to the lack
  of a return value. This leads to a crash when the server loop ends and execution hits an illegal
  ud2 instruction. This issue can be triggered remotely without authentication by starting the
  same server multiple times or if the server exits unexpectedly. The vulnerability allows an
  attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) against the PLC runtime, stopping any PC started
  remotely without authentication. This results in the PLC process crashing and halting all
  automation or control logic managed by OpenPLC.
