aliases: []
summary: The Event Manager, Events Calendar, Tickets, Registrations – Eventin plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.24 via the
  'style' parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level
  access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution
  of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive
  data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded
  and included.
