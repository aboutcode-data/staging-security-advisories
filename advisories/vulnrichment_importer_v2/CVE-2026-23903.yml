summary: |
  Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name vulnerability in Apache Shiro.

  This issue affects Apache Shiro: before 2.0.7.

  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.0.7, which fixes the issue.

  The issue only effects static files. If static files are served from a case-insensitive filesystem,
  such as default macOS setup, static files may be accessed by varying the case of the filename in the request.
  If only lower-case (common default) filters are present in Shiro, they may be bypassed this way.

  Shiro 2.0.7 and later has a new parameters to remediate this issue
  shiro.ini: filterChainResolver.caseInsensitive = true
  application.propertie: shiro.caseInsensitive=true

  Shiro 3.0.0 and later (upcoming) makes this the default.
