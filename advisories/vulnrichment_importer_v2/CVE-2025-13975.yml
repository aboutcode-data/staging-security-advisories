aliases: []
summary: The Contact Form 7 with ChatWork plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the 'api_token' and 'roomid' settings in all versions up to, and including,
  1.1.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
  authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts
  in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the settings page. This only affects multi-site
  installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
