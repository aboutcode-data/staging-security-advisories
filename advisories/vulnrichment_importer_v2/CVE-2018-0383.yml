aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the detection engine of Cisco FireSIGHT System Software could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a file policy that is configured to block the
  transfer of files to an affected system via FTP. The vulnerability exists because the affected
  software incorrectly handles FTP control connections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a maliciously crafted FTP connection to transfer a file to an affected device.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass a file policy that is configured to
  apply the Block upload with reset action to FTP traffic. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvh70130.'
