aliases: []
summary: The WordPress & WooCommerce Affiliate Program plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 8.4.1. This is due to the rtwwwap_login_request_callback()
  function not properly validating a user's identity prior to authenticating them to the site.
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any user, including administrators,
  granted they have access to the administrator's email.
