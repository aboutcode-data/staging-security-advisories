aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the FindMe feature of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence
  Video Communication Server (VCS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct
  a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack and perform arbitrary actions on an affected system.
  The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface
  of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user
  of the interface to follow a maliciously crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the
  attacker to perform arbitrary actions on an affected system with the privileges of the user.
  The arbitrary actions include adding an attacker-controlled device and redirecting calls intended
  for a specific user. For more information about CSRF attacks and potential mitigations, see
  Understanding Cross-Site Request Forgery Threat Vectors. This vulnerability is fixed in software
  version X12.5.1 and later.
