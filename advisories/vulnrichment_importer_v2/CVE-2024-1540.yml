aliases: []
summary: A command injection vulnerability exists in the deploy+test-visual.yml workflow of
  the gradio-app/gradio repository, due to improper neutralization of special elements used
  in a command. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute unauthorized commands, potentially
  leading to unauthorized modification of the base repository or secrets exfiltration. The issue
  arises from the unsafe handling of GitHub context information within a `run` operation, where
  expressions inside `${{ }}` are evaluated and substituted before script execution. Remediation
  involves setting untrusted input values to intermediate environment variables to prevent direct
  influence on script generation.
