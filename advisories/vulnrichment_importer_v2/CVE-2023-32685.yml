aliases: []
summary: Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology. Due
  to improper handling of elements under the `contentEditable` element, maliciously crafted
  clipboard content can inject arbitrary HTML tags into the DOM. A low-privileged attacker with
  permission to attach a document on a vulnerable Kanboard instance can trick the victim into
  pasting malicious screenshot data and achieve cross-site scripting if CSP is improperly configured.
  This issue has been patched in version 1.2.29.
