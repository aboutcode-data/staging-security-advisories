aliases: []
summary: The File Away plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to a
  missing capability check and missing file type validation in the upload() function in all
  versions up to, and including, 3.9.9.0.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution
  possible.
