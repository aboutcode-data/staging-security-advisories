aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the implementation of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Ethernet
  VPN (EVPN) functionality in Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerabilities are due to incorrect processing
  of BGP update messages that contain crafted EVPN attributes. An attacker could exploit these
  vulnerabilities by sending BGP EVPN update messages with malformed attributes to be processed
  by an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the BGP process
  to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. The Cisco implementation of BGP accepts
  incoming BGP traffic only from explicitly defined peers. To exploit these vulnerabilities,
  the malicious BGP update message would need to come from a configured, valid BGP peer, or
  would need to be injected by the attacker into the victim's BGP network on an existing, valid
  TCP connection to a BGP peer.
