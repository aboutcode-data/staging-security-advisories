datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2025/23xxx/CVE-2025-23167.json
aliases: []
summary: |
  A flaw in Node.js 20's HTTP parser allows improper termination of HTTP/1 headers using `\r\n\rX` instead of the required `\r\n\r\n`.
  This inconsistency enables request smuggling, allowing attackers to bypass proxy-based access controls and submit unauthorized requests.

  The issue was resolved by upgrading `llhttp` to version 9, which enforces correct header termination.

  Impact:
  * This vulnerability affects only Node.js 20.x users prior to the `llhttp` v9 upgrade.
