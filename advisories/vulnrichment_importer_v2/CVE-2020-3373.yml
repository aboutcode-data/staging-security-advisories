aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the IP fragment-handling implementation of Cisco Adaptive Security
  Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an
  unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak on an affected device. This memory
  leak could prevent traffic from being processed through the device, resulting in a denial
  of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper error handling when specific
  failures occur during IP fragment reassembly. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending crafted, fragmented IP traffic to a targeted device. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to continuously consume memory on the affected device and eventually impact
  traffic, resulting in a DoS condition. The device could require a manual reboot to recover
  from the DoS condition. Note: This vulnerability applies to both IP Version 4 (IPv4) and IP
  Version 6 (IPv6) traffic.'
