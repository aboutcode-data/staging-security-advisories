aliases: []
summary: Turms AI-Serving module v0.10.0-SNAPSHOT and earlier contains an improper file type
  validation vulnerability in the OCR image upload functionality. The OcrController in turms-ai-serving/src/main/java/im/turms/ai/domain/ocr/controller/OcrController.java
  uses the @FormData(contentType = MediaTypeConst.IMAGE) annotation to restrict uploads to image
  files, but this constraint is not properly enforced. The system relies solely on client-provided
  Content-Type headers and file extensions without validating actual file content using magic
  bytes (file signatures). An attacker can upload arbitrary file types including executables,
  scripts, HTML, or web shells by setting the Content-Type header to "image/*" or using an image
  file extension. This bypass enables potential server-side code execution, stored XSS, or information
  disclosure depending on how uploaded files are processed and served.
