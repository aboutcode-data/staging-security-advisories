datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2026-27146

aliases: []
summary: GetSimple CMS is a content management system. All versions of GetSimple CMS do not
  implement CSRF protection on the administrative file upload endpoint. As a result, an attacker
  can craft a malicious web page that silently triggers a file upload request from an authenticated
  victim’s browser. The request is accepted without requiring a CSRF token or origin validation.
  This allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files to the application without the victim’s
  knowledge or consent. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the victim must be authenticated
  to GetSimple CMS (e.g., admin user), and visit an attacker-controlled webpage. This issue
  does not have a fix at the time of publication.
