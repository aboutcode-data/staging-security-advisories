aliases: []
summary: An Execution with Unnecessary Privileges vulnerability has been identified in Moxa’s
  network security appliances and routers. A flaw in broken access control has been identified
  in the /api/v1/setting/data endpoint of the affected device. This flaw allows a low-privileged
  authenticated user to call the API without the required permissions, thereby gaining the ability
  to access or modify system configuration data. Successful exploitation may lead to privilege
  escalation, allowing the attacker to access or modify sensitive system settings. While the
  overall impact is high, there is no loss of confidentiality or integrity within any subsequent
  systems.
