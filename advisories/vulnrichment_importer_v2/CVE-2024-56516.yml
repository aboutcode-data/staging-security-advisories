aliases: []
summary: free-one-api allows users to access large language model reverse engineering libraries
  through the standard OpenAI API format. In versions up to and including 1.0.1, MD5 is used
  to hash passwords before sending them to the backend. MD5 is a cryptographically broken hashing
  algorithm and is no longer considered secure for password storage or transmission. It is vulnerable
  to collision attacks and can be easily cracked using modern hardware, exposing user credentials
  to potential compromise. As of time of publication, a replacement for MD5 has not been committed
  to the free-one-api GitHub repository.
