  firewire: fix memory leak for payload of request subaction to IEC 61883-1 FCP region

  This patch is fix for Linux kernel v2.6.33 or later.

  For request subaction to IEC 61883-1 FCP region, Linux FireWire subsystem
  have had an issue of use-after-free. The subsystem allows multiple
  user space listeners to the region, while data of the payload was likely
  released before the listeners execute read(2) to access to it for copying
  to user space.

  The issue was fixed by a commit 281e20323ab7 ("firewire: core: fix
  use-after-free regression in FCP handler"). The object of payload is
  duplicated in kernel space for each listener. When the listener executes
  ioctl(2) with FW_CDEV_IOC_SEND_RESPONSE request, the object is going to
  be released.

  However, it causes memory leak since the commit relies on call of
  release_request() in drivers/firewire/core-cdev.c. Against the
  expectation, the function is never called due to the design of
  release_client_resource(). The function delegates release task
  to caller when called with non-NULL fourth argument. The implementation
  of ioctl_send_response() is the case. It should release the object
  explicitly.

  This commit fixes the bug.
