aliases: []
summary: Anthropic's MCP TypeScript SDK versions up to and including 1.25.1 contain a regular
  expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability in the UriTemplate class when processing
  RFC 6570 exploded array patterns. The dynamically generated regular expression used during
  URI matching contains nested quantifiers that can trigger catastrophic backtracking on specially
  crafted inputs, resulting in excessive CPU consumption. An attacker can exploit this by supplying
  a malicious URI that causes the Node.js process to become unresponsive, leading to a denial
  of service.
