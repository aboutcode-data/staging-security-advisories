aliases: []
summary: RedisBloom adds a set of probabilistic data structures to Redis. There is an integer
  overflow vulnerability in RedisBloom, which is a module used in Redis. The integer overflow
  vulnerability allows an attacker (a redis client which knows the password) to allocate memory
  in the heap lesser than the required memory due to wraparound. Then read and write can be
  performed beyond this allocated memory, leading to info leak and OOB write. The integer overflow
  is in CMS.INITBYDIM command, which initialize a Count-Min Sketch to dimensions specified by
  user. It accepts two values (width and depth) and uses them to allocate memory in NewCMSketch().
  This vulnerability is fixed in 2.2.19, 2.4.12, 2.6.14, and 2.8.2.
