aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability identified in the Tailscale Windows client allows a malicious website
  to reconfigure the Tailscale daemon `tailscaled`, which can then be used to remotely execute
  code. In the Tailscale Windows client, the local API was bound to a local TCP socket, and
  communicated with the Windows client GUI in cleartext with no Host header verification. This
  allowed an attacker-controlled website visited by the node to rebind DNS to an attacker-controlled
  DNS server, and then make local API requests in the client, including changing the coordination
  server to an attacker-controlled coordination server. An attacker-controlled coordination
  server can send malicious URL responses to the client, including pushing executables or installing
  an SMB share. These allow the attacker to remotely execute code on the node. All Windows clients
  prior to version v.1.32.3 are affected. If you are running Tailscale on Windows, upgrade to
  v1.32.3 or later to remediate the issue.
