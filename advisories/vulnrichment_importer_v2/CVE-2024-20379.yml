summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Secure Firewall Management\
  \ Center (FMC) Software, formerly Firepower Management Center Software, could allow an authenticated,\
  \ remote attacker to read arbitrary files from the underlying operating system.\r\n\r This\
  \ vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate\
  \ user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP\
  \ request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary\
  \ files on the underlying operating system of the affected device. The attacker would need\
  \ valid user credentials to exploit this vulnerability."
