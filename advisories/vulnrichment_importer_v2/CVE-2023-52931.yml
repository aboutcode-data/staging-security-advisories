  drm/i915: Avoid potential vm use-after-free

  Adding the vm to the vm_xa table makes it visible to userspace, which
  could try to race with us to close the vm.  So we need to take our extra
  reference before putting it in the table.

  (cherry picked from commit 99343c46d4e2b34c285d3d5f68ff04274c2f9fb4)
