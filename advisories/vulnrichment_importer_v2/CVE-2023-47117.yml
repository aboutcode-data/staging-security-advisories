aliases: []
summary: Label Studio is an open source data labeling tool. In all current versions of Label
  Studio prior to 1.9.2post0, the application allows users to insecurely set filters for filtering
  tasks. An attacker can construct a filter chain to filter tasks based on sensitive fields
  for all user accounts on the platform by exploiting Django's Object Relational Mapper (ORM).
  Since the results of query can be manipulated by the ORM filter, an attacker can leak these
  sensitive fields character by character. In addition, Label Studio had a hard coded secret
  key that an attacker can use to forge a session token of any user by exploiting this ORM Leak
  vulnerability to leak account password hashes. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit
  `f931d9d129` which is included in the 1.9.2post0 release. Users are advised to upgrade. There
  are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
