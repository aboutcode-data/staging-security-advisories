aliases: []
summary: The Social Streams plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all
  versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a
  user's identity prior to updating their user meta information in the update_user_meta() function.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above,
  to change their user type to that of an administrator.
