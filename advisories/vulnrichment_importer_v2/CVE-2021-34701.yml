aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications
  Manager (Unified CM), Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified
  CM SME), Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM &amp; Presence Service (Unified CM IM&amp;P),
  and Cisco Unity Connection could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive
  data on an affected device. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface
  does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains directory traversal character sequences to
  an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive files
  on the affected system.
