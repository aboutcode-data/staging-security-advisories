aliases: []
summary: Plane is open-source project management software. Prior to version 1.1.0, an open redirect
  vulnerability in the ?next_path query parameter allows attackers to supply arbitrary schemes
  (e.g., javascript:) that are passed directly to router.push. This results in a cross-site
  scripting (XSS) vulnerability, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim’s
  browser. The issue can be exploited without authentication and has severe impact, including
  information disclosure, and privilege escalation and modifications of administrative settings.
  This issue has been patched in version 1.1.0.
