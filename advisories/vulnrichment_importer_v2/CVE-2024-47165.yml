aliases: []
summary: Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability
  relates to **CORS origin validation accepting a null origin**. When a Gradio server is deployed
  locally, the `localhost_aliases` variable includes "null" as a valid origin. This allows attackers
  to make unauthorized requests from sandboxed iframes or other sources with a null origin,
  potentially leading to data theft, such as user authentication tokens or uploaded files. This
  impacts users running Gradio locally, especially those using basic authentication. Users are
  advised to upgrade to `gradio>=5.0` to address this issue. As a workaround, users can manually
  modify the `localhost_aliases` list in their local Gradio deployment to exclude "null" as
  a valid origin. By removing this value, the Gradio server will no longer accept requests from
  sandboxed iframes or sources with a null origin, mitigating the potential for exploitation.
