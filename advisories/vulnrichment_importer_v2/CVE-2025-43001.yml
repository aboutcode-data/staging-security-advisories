aliases: []
summary: SAPCAR allows an attacker logged in with high privileges to override the permissions
  of the current and parent directories of the user or process extracting the archive, leading
  to privilege escalation. On successful exploitation, an attacker could modify the critical
  files by tampering with signed archives without breaking the signature, but it has a low impact
  on the confidentiality and availability of the system.
