aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Cisco Fabric Services (CFS) component of Cisco FXOS Software
  and Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary
  code on an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the affected software insufficiently
  validates Cisco Fabric Services packet headers when the software processes packet data. An
  attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a maliciously crafted Cisco Fabric Services
  packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer
  overflow condition on the device, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code
  on the device. This vulnerability affects the following if configured to use Cisco Fabric
  Services: Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewalls, Firepower 9300 Security Appliance,
  MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches, Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders, Nexus 3000 Series
  Switches, Nexus 3500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5600 Platform
  Switches, Nexus 6000 Series Switches, Nexus 7000 Series Switches, Nexus 7700 Series Switches,
  Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode, Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric
  Modules, UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnects, UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects, UCS 6300
  Series Fabric Interconnects. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd69943, CSCve02429, CSCve02433, CSCve02435,
  CSCve02445, CSCve04859.'
