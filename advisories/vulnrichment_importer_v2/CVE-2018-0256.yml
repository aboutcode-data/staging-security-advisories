aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the peer-to-peer message processing functionality of Cisco Packet
  Data Network Gateway could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the Session
  Manager (SESSMGR) process on an affected device to restart, resulting in a denial of service
  (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incorrect validation of peer-to-peer packet headers.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted peer-to-peer packet through
  an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the SESSMGR process
  on the affected device to restart unexpectedly, which could briefly impact traffic while the
  SESSMGR process restarts and result in a DoS condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg88786.'
