summary: In Jenkins 2.423 and earlier, LTS 2.414.1 and earlier, processing file uploads using
  the Stapler web framework creates temporary files in the default system temporary directory
  with the default permissions for newly created files, potentially allowing attackers with
  access to the Jenkins controller file system to read and write the files before they are used.
