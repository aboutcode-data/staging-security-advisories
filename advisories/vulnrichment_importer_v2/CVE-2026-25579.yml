aliases: []
summary: Navidrome is an open source web-based music collection server and streamer. Prior to
  version 0.60.0, authenticated users can crash the Navidrome server by supplying an excessively
  large size parameter to /rest/getCoverArt or to a shared-image URL (/share/img/<token>). When
  processing such requests, the server attempts to create an extremely large resized image,
  causing uncontrolled memory growth. This triggers the Linux OOM killer, terminates the Navidrome
  process, and results in a full service outage. If the system has sufficient memory and survives
  the allocation, Navidrome then writes these extremely large resized images into its cache
  directory, allowing an attacker to rapidly exhaust server disk space as well. This issue has
  been patched in version 0.60.0.
