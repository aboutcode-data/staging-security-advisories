summary: "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Apache StreamPipes during installation\
  \ process of pipeline elements.\nPreviously, StreamPipes allowed users to configure custom\
  \ endpoints from which to install additional pipeline elements. \nThese endpoints were not\
  \ properly validated, allowing an attacker to get StreamPipes to send an HTTP GET request\
  \ to an arbitrary address.\nThis issue affects Apache StreamPipes: through 0.93.0.\n\nUsers\
  \ are recommended to upgrade to version 0.95.0, which fixes the issue."
