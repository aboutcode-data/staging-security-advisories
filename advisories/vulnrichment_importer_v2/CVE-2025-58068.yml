aliases: []
summary: Eventlet is a concurrent networking library for Python. Prior to version 0.40.3, the
  Eventlet WSGI parser is vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling due to improper handling of HTTP
  trailer sections. This vulnerability could enable attackers to, bypass front-end security
  controls, launch targeted attacks against active site users, and poison web caches. This problem
  has been patched in Eventlet 0.40.3 by dropping trailers which is a breaking change if a backend
  behind eventlet.wsgi proxy requires trailers. A workaround involves not using eventlet.wsgi
  facing untrusted clients.
