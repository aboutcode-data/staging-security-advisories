summary: The Host PHP Info plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data
  due to a missing capability check when including the 'phpinfo' function in all versions up

  settings and predefined variables on the site's server. The plugin does not need to be activated
  for the vulnerability to be exploited.
