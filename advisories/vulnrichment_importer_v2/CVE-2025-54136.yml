aliases: []
summary: Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. In versions 1.2.4 and below,
  attackers can achieve remote and persistent code execution by modifying an already trusted
  MCP configuration file inside a shared GitHub repository or editing the file locally on the
  target's machine. Once a collaborator accepts a harmless MCP, the attacker can silently swap
  it for a malicious command (e.g., calc.exe) without triggering any warning or re-prompt. If
  an attacker has write permissions on a user's active branches of a source repository that
  contains existing MCP servers the user has previously approved, or allows an attacker has
  arbitrary file-write locally, the attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution. This is fixed
  in version 1.3.
