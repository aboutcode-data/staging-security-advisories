summary: Concrete CMS version 9 before 9.2.5 is vulnerable to stored XSS in file tags and description
  attributes since administrator entered file attributes are not sufficiently sanitized in the
  Edit Attributes page. A rogue administrator could put malicious code into the file tags or
  description attributes and, when another administrator opens the same file for editing, the
  malicious code could execute. The Concrete CMS Security team scored this 2.4 with CVSS v3
  vector AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N.
