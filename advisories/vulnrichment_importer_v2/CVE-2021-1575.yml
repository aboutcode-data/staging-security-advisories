aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Virtualized Voice Browser
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
  against a user of the interface. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management
  interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by persuading a user of an affected interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface
  or access sensitive, browser-based information.
