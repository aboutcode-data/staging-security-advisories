aliases: []
summary: Rapid7 Velociraptor MSI Installer versions below 0.73.3 suffer from a vulnerability
  whereby it creates the installation directory with WRITE_DACL permission to the BUILTIN\\Users
  group. This allows local users who are not administrators to grant themselves the Full Control
  permission on Velociraptor's files. By modifying Velociraptor's files, local users can subvert
  the binary and cause the Velociraptor service to execute arbitrary code as the SYSTEM user,
  or to replace the Velociraptor binary completely.  This issue is fixed in version 0.73.3.
