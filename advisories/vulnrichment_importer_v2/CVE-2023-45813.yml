datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2023/45xxx/CVE-2023-45813.json
aliases: []
summary: Torbot is an open source tor network intelligence tool. In affected versions the `torbot.modules.validators.validate_link
  function` uses the python-validators URL validation regex. This particular regular expression
  has an exponential complexity which allows an attacker to cause an application crash using
  a well-crafted argument. An attacker can use a well-crafted URL argument to exploit the vulnerability
  in the regular expression and cause a Denial of Service on the system. The validators file
  has been removed in version 4.0.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
  for this vulnerability.
