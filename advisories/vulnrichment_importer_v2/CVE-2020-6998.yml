aliases: []
summary: The connection establishment algorithm found in Rockwell Automation CompactLogix 5370
  and ControlLogix 5570 versions 33 and prior does not sufficiently manage its control flow
  during execution, creating an infinite loop. This may allow an attacker to send specially
  crafted CIP packet requests to a controller, which may cause denial-of-service conditions
  in communications with other products.
