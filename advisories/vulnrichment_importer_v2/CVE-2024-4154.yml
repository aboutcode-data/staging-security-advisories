aliases: []
summary: In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an incorrect synchronization vulnerability allows
  unprivileged users to rename projects they do not have access to. Specifically, an unprivileged
  user can send a PATCH request to the project's endpoint with a new name for a project, despite
  not having the necessary permissions or being assigned to the project. This issue allows for
  unauthorized modification of project names, potentially leading to confusion or unauthorized
  access to project resources.
