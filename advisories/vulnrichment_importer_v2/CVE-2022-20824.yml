aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol feature of Cisco FXOS Software and
  Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary
  code with root privileges or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.
  This vulnerability is due to improper input validation of specific values that are within
  a Cisco Discovery Protocol message. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
  a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges or cause the Cisco Discovery
  Protocol process to crash and restart multiple times, which would cause the affected device
  to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: Cisco Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol.
  To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected
  device (Layer 2 adjacent).'
