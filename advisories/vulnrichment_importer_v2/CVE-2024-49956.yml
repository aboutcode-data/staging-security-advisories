  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  gfs2: fix double destroy_workqueue error

  When gfs2_fill_super() fails, destroy_workqueue() is called within
  gfs2_gl_hash_clear(), and the subsequent code path calls
  destroy_workqueue() on the same work queue again.

  This issue can be fixed by setting the work queue pointer to NULL after
  the first destroy_workqueue() call and checking for a NULL pointer
  before attempting to destroy the work queue again.
