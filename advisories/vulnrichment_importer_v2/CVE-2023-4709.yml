aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in TOTVS RM 12.1. Affected
  is an unknown function of the file Login.aspx of the component Portal. The manipulation of
  the argument VIEWSTATE leads to cross site scripting. It is possible to launch the attack
  remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult.
  It is possible to mitigate the problem by applying the configuration setting <pages validateRequest="true"
  [...] viewStateEncryptionMode="Always" />. It is recommended to change the configuration settings.
  The vendor was initially contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any
  way. In a later statement he explains, that "the behavior described [...] is related to specific
  configurations that are not part of the default application setup. In standard production
  environments, the relevant feature (VIEWSTATE) is disabled by default, which effectively mitigates
  the risk of exploitation."
