aliases: []
summary: Fess is a deployable Enterprise Search Server. Prior to version 14.19.2, the createTempFile()
  method in org.codelibs.fess.helper.SystemHelper creates temporary files without explicitly
  setting restrictive permissions. This could lead to potential information disclosure, allowing
  unauthorized local users to access sensitive data contained in these files. This issue primarily
  affects environments where Fess is deployed in a shared or multi-user context. Typical single-user
  or isolated deployments have minimal or negligible practical impact. This issue has been patched
  in version 14.19.2. A workaround for this issue involves ensuring local access to the environment
  running Fess is restricted to trusted users only.
