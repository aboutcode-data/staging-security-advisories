aliases: []
summary: A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the gradio-app/gradio
  repository, affecting the gr.Datetime component. The affected version is git commit 98cbcae.
  The vulnerability arises from the use of a regular expression `^(?:\s*now\s*(?:-\s*(\d+)\s*([dmhs]))?)?\s*$`
  to process user input. In Python's default regex engine, this regular expression can take
  polynomial time to match certain crafted inputs. An attacker can exploit this by sending a
  crafted HTTP request, causing the gradio process to consume 100% CPU and potentially leading
  to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition on the server.
