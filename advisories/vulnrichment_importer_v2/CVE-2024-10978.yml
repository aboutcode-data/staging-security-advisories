aliases: []
summary: Incorrect privilege assignment in PostgreSQL allows a less-privileged application user
  to view or change different rows from those intended.  An attack requires the application
  to use SET ROLE, SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION, or an equivalent feature.  The problem arises
  when an application query uses parameters from the attacker or conveys query results to the
  attacker.  If that query reacts to current_setting('role') or the current user ID, it may
  modify or return data as though the session had not used SET ROLE or SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION.  The
  attacker does not control which incorrect user ID applies.  Query text from less-privileged
  sources is not a concern here, because SET ROLE and SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION are not sandboxes
  for unvetted queries.  Versions before PostgreSQL 17.1, 16.5, 15.9, 14.14, 13.17, and 12.21
  are affected.
