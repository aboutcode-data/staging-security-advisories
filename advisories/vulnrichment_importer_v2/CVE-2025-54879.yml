aliases: []
summary: Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on ActivityPub Mastodon
  which facilitates LDAP configuration for authentication. In versions 3.1.5 through 4.2.24,
  4.3.0 through 4.3.11 and 4.4.0 through 4.4.3, Mastodon's rate-limiting system has a critical
  configuration error where the email-based throttle for confirmation emails incorrectly checks
  the password reset path instead of the confirmation path, effectively disabling per-email
  limits for confirmation requests. This allows attackers to bypass rate limits by rotating
  IP addresses and send unlimited confirmation emails to any email address, as only a weak IP-based
  throttle (25 requests per 5 minutes) remains active. The vulnerability enables denial-of-service
  attacks that can overwhelm mail queues and facilitate user harassment through confirmation
  email spam. This is fixed in versions 4.2.24, 4.3.11 and 4.4.3.
