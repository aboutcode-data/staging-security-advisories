aliases: []
summary: KubeVela is an application delivery platform Users using KubeVela's VelaUX APIServer
  could be affected by an authentication bypass vulnerability. In KubeVela prior to versions
  1.4.11 and 1.5.4, VelaUX APIServer uses the `PlatformID` as the signed key to generate the
  JWT tokens for users. Another API called `getSystemInfo` exposes the platformID. This vulnerability
  allows users to use the platformID to re-generate the JWT tokens to bypass the authentication.
  Versions 1.4.11 and 1.5.4 contain a patch for this issue.
