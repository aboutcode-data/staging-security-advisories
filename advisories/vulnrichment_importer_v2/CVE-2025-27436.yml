aliases: []
summary: The Manage Bank Statements in SAP S/4HANA does not perform required access control
  checks for an authenticated user to confirm whether a request to interact with a resource
  is legitimate, allowing the attacker to delete the attachment of a posted bank statement.
  This leads to a low impact on integrity, with no impact on the confidentiality of the data
  or the availability of the application.
