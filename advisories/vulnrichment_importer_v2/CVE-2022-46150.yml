summary: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 2.8.13 of the `stable`
  branch and version 2.9.0.beta14 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, unauthorized users
  may learn of the existence of hidden tags and that they have been applied to topics that they
  have access to. This issue is patched in version 2.8.13 of the `stable` branch and version
  2.9.0.beta14 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. As a workaround, use the `disable_email`
  site setting to disable all emails to non-staff users.
