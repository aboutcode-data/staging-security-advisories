summary: The WordPress Contact Forms by Cimatti plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.2. This is due to missing or incorrect

  attackers to delete forms via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
