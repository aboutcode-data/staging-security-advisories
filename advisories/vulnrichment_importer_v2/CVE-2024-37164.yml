aliases: []
summary: Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) is an interactive video and image annotation
  tool for computer vision. CVAT allows users to supply custom endpoint URLs for cloud storages
  based on Amazon S3 and Azure Blob Storage. Starting in version 2.1.0 and prior to version
  2.14.3, an attacker with a CVAT account can exploit this feature by specifying URLs whose
  host part is an intranet IP address or an internal domain name. By doing this, the attacker
  may be able to probe the network that the CVAT backend runs in for HTTP(S) servers. In addition,
  if there is a web server on this network that is sufficiently API-compatible with an Amazon
  S3 or Azure Blob Storage endpoint, and either allows anonymous access, or allows authentication
  with credentials that are known by the attacker, then the attacker may be able to create a
  cloud storage linked to this server. They may then be able to list files on the server; extract
  files from the server, if these files are of a type that CVAT supports reading from cloud
  storage (media data (such as images/videos/archives), importable annotations or datasets,
  task/project backups); and/or overwrite files on this server with exported annotations/datasets/backups.
  The exact capabilities of the attacker will depend on how the internal server is configured.
  Users should upgrade to CVAT 2.14.3 to receive a patch. In this release, the existing SSRF
  mitigation measures are applied to requests to cloud providers, with access to intranet IP
  addresses prohibited by default. Some workarounds are also available. One may use network
  security solutions such as virtual networks or firewalls to prohibit network access from the
  CVAT backend to unrelated servers on your internal network and/or require authentication for
  access to internal servers.
