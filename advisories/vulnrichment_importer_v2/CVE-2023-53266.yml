  arm64: acpi: Fix possible memory leak of ffh_ctxt

  Allocated 'ffh_ctxt' memory leak is possible if the SMCCC version
  and conduit checks fail and -EOPNOTSUPP is returned without freeing the
  allocated memory.

  Fix the same by moving the allocation after the SMCCC version and
  conduit checks.
