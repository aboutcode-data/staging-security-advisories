aliases: []
summary: The GetGenie plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in all versions
  up to, and including, 4.3.0. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user
  is authorized to delete a specific post. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Author-level access and above, to delete any post on the WordPress site, including posts
  authored by other users.
