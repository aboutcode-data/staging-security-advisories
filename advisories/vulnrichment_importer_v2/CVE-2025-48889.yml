aliases: []
summary: Gradio is an open-source Python package that allows quick building of demos and web
  application for machine learning models, API, or any arbitrary Python function. Prior to version
  5.31.0, an arbitrary file copy vulnerability in Gradio's flagging feature allows unauthenticated
  attackers to copy any readable file from the server's filesystem. While attackers can't read
  these copied files, they can cause DoS by copying large files (like /dev/urandom) to fill
  disk space. This issue has been patched in version 5.31.0.
