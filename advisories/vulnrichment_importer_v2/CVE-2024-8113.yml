aliases: []
summary: Stored XSS in organizer and event settings of pretix up to 2024.7.0 allows malicious
  event organizers to inject HTML tags into e-mail previews on settings page. The default Content
  Security Policy of pretix prevents execution of attacker-provided scripts, making exploitation
  unlikely. However, combined with a CSP bypass (which is not currently known) the vulnerability
  could be used to impersonate other organizers or staff users.
