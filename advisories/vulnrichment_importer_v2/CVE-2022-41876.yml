aliases: []
summary: ezplatform-graphql is a GraphQL server implementation for Ibexa DXP and Ibexa Open
  Source. Versions prior to 2.3.12 and 1.0.13 are subject to Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information.
  Unauthenticated GraphQL queries for user accounts can expose password hashes of users that
  have created or modified content, typically administrators and editors. This issue has been
  patched in versions 2.3.12, and 1.0.13 on the 1.X branch. Users unable to upgrade can remove
  the "passwordHash" entry from "src/bundle/Resources/config/graphql/User.types.yaml" in the
  GraphQL package, and other properties like hash type, email, login if you prefer.
