summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  io_uring: fix overflows checks in provide buffers

  Colin reported before possible overflow and sign extension problems in
  io_provide_buffers_prep(). As Linus pointed out previous attempt did nothing
  useful, see d81269fecb8ce ("io_uring: fix provide_buffers sign extension").

  Do that with help of check_<op>_overflow helpers. And fix struct
  io_provide_buf::len type, as it doesn't make much sense to keep it
  signed.
