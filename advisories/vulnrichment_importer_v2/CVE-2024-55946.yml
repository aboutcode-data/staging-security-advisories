aliases: []
summary: Playloom Engine is an open-source, high-performance game development engine. Engine
  Beta v0.0.1 has a security vulnerability related to data storage, specifically when using
  the collaboration features. When collaborating with another user, they may have access to
  personal information you have entered into the software. This poses a risk to user privacy.
  The maintainers of Playloom Engine have temporarily disabled the collaboration feature until
  a fix can be implemented. When Engine Beta v0.0.2 is released, it is expected to contain a
  patch addressing this issue. Users should refrain from using the collaboration feature in
  the meantime.
