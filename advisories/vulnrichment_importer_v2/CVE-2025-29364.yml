aliases: []
summary: spimsimulator spim v9.1.24 and before is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow in the READ_SYSCALL
  and WRITE_SYSCALL system calls. The application verifies the legitimacy of the starting and
  ending addresses for memory read/write operations. By configuring the starting and ending
  addresses for memory read/write to point to distinct memory segments within the virtual machine,
  it is possible to circumvent these checks.
