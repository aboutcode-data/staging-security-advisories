aliases: []
summary: OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. Starting
  in version 4.0.0 and prior to version 4.9.3, contracts using `ERC2771Context` along with a
  custom trusted forwarder may see `_msgSender` return `address(0)` in calls that originate
  from the forwarder with calldata shorter than 20 bytes. This combination of circumstances
  does not appear to be common, in particular it is not the case for `MinimalForwarder` from
  OpenZeppelin Contracts, or any deployed forwarder the team is aware of, given that the signer
  address is appended to all calls that originate from these forwarders. The problem has been
  patched in v4.9.3.
