summary: Flux is an open and extensible continuous delivery solution for Kubernetes. Path Traversal
  in the kustomize-controller via a malicious `kustomization.yaml` allows an attacker to cause
  a Denial of Service at the controller level. Workarounds include automated tooling in the
  user's CI/CD pipeline to validate `kustomization.yaml` files conform with specific policies.
  This vulnerability is fixed in kustomize-controller v0.24.0 and included in flux2 v0.29.0.
  Users are recommended to upgrade.
