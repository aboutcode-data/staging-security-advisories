aliases: []
summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications
  built on top of it. The office document viewer macro was allowing anyone to see any file content
  from the hosting server, provided that the office server was connected and depending on the
  permissions of the user running the servlet engine (e.g. tomcat) running XWiki. The same vulnerability
  also allowed to perform internal requests to resources from the hosting server. The problem
  has been patched in XWiki 13.10.11, 14.10.1, 14.4.8, 15.0-rc-1. Users are advised to upgrade.
  It might be possible to workaround this vulnerability by running XWiki in a sandbox with a
  user with very low privileges on the machine.
