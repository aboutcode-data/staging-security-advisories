aliases: []
summary: 'OpenWrt mishandles access control in /etc/config/rpcd and the /usr/share/rpcd/acl.d
  files, which allows remote authenticated users to call arbitrary methods (i.e., achieve ubus
  access over HTTP) that were only supposed to be accessible to a specific user, as demonstrated
  by the file, log, and service namespaces, potentially leading to remote Information Disclosure
  or Code Execution. NOTE: The developer disputes this as a vulnerability, indicating that rpcd
  functions appropriately'
