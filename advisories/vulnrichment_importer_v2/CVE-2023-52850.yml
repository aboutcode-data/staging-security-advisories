  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  media: hantro: Check whether reset op is defined before use

  The i.MX8MM/N/P does not define the .reset op since reset of the VPU is
  done by genpd. Check whether the .reset op is defined before calling it
  to avoid NULL pointer dereference.

  Note that the Fixes tag is set to the commit which removed the reset op
  from i.MX8M Hantro G2 implementation, this is because before this commit
  all the implementations did define the .reset op.
