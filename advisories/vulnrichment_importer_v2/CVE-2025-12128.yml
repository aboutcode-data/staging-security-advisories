aliases: []
summary: The Hide Categories Or Products On Shop Page plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.7. This is due to missing
  or incorrect nonce validation on the save_data_hcps() function. This makes it possible for
  unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they
  can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
