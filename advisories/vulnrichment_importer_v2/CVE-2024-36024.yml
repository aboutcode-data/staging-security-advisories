  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/amd/display: Disable idle reallow as part of command/gpint execution

  [Why]
  Workaroud for a race condition where DMCUB is in the process of
  committing to IPS1 during the handshake causing us to miss the
  transition into IPS2 and touch the INBOX1 RPTR causing a HW hang.

  [How]
  Disable the reallow to ensure that we have enough of a gap between entry
  and exit and we're not seeing back-to-back wake_and_executes.
