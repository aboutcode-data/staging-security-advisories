  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  nvme-multipath: defer partition scanning

  We need to suppress the partition scan from occuring within the
  controller's scan_work context. If a path error occurs here, the IO will
  wait until a path becomes available or all paths are torn down, but that
  action also occurs within scan_work, so it would deadlock. Defer the
  partion scan to a different context that does not block scan_work.
