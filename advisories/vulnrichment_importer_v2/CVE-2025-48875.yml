aliases: []
summary: FreeScout is a free self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. Prior to version 1.8.181,
  the system's incorrect validation of last_name and first_name during profile data updates
  allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code, which will be executed in a flesh-message
  when the data is deleted, potentially leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
  This issue has been patched in version 1.8.181.
