summary: A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow
  an authenticated, local attacker to view system files that should be restricted. This vulnerability
  is due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input in command-line parameters that describe

  to submit a path to a desired file location. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to view system files that may contain sensitive information.
