  \ through 8.5.95 did not correctly parse HTTP trailer headers. A trailer header that exceeded\
  \ the header size limit could cause Tomcat to treat a single \nrequest as multiple requests\
  \ leading to the possibility of request \nsmuggling when behind a reverse proxy.\n\n\nOlder,\
  \ EOL versions may also be affected.\n\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M11 onwards,\
  \ 10.1.16 onwards, 9.0.83 onwards or 8.5.96 onwards, which fix the issue."
