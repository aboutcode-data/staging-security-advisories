aliases: []
summary: Craft is a content management system (CMS). In versions 4.5.0-RC1 through 4.16.18 and
  5.0.0-RC1 through 5.8.22, a Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition exists in Craft
  CMS’s token validation service for tokens that explicitly set a limited usage. The `getTokenRoute()`
  method reads a token’s usage count, checks if it’s within limits, then updates the database
  in separate non-atomic operations. By sending concurrent requests, an attacker can use a single-use
  impersonation token multiple times before the database update completes. To make this work,
  an attacker needs to obtain a valid user account impersonation URL with a non-expired token
  via some other means and exploit a race condition while bypassing any rate-limiting rules
  in place. For this to be a privilege escalation, the impersonation URL must include a token
  for a user account with more permissions than the current user. Versions 4.16.19 and 5.8.23
  patch the issue.
