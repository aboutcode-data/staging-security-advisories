aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in which attackers could forge HTTP requests to manipulate the `charm`
  data directory to access or delete anything on the server. This has been patched and is available
  in release [v0.12.1](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/releases/tag/v0.12.1). We recommend
  that all users running self-hosted `charm` instances update immediately. This vulnerability
  was found in-house and we haven''t been notified of any potential exploiters. ### Additional
  notes * Encrypted user data uploaded to the Charm server is safe as Charm servers cannot decrypt
  user data. This includes filenames, paths, and all key-value data. * Users running the official
  Charm [Docker images](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/blob/main/docker.md) are at minimal
  risk because the exploit is limited to the containerized filesystem.'
