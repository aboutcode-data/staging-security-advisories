aliases: []
summary: Graylog is a free and open log management platform. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior
  to versions 5.1.11 and 5.2.4, arbitrary classes can be loaded and instantiated using a HTTP
  PUT request to the `/api/system/cluster_config/` endpoint. Graylog's cluster config system
  uses fully qualified class names as config keys. To validate the existence of the requested
  class before using them, Graylog loads the class using the class loader. If a user with the
  appropriate permissions performs the request, arbitrary classes with 1-arg String constructors
  can be instantiated. This will execute arbitrary code that is run during class instantiation.
  In the specific use case of `java.io.File`, the behavior of the internal web-server stack
  will lead to information exposure by including the entire file content in the response to
  the REST request. Versions 5.1.11 and 5.2.4 contain a fix for this issue.
