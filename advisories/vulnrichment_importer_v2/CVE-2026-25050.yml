aliases: []
summary: Vendure is an open-source headless commerce platform. Prior to version 3.5.3, the `NativeAuthenticationStrategy.authenticate()`
  method is vulnerable to a timing attack that allows attackers to enumerate valid usernames
  (email addresses). In `packages/core/src/config/auth/native-authentication-strategy.ts`, the
  authenticate method returns immediately if a user is not found. The significant timing difference
  (~200-400ms for bcrypt vs ~1-5ms for DB miss) allows attackers to reliably distinguish between
  existing and non-existing accounts. Version 3.5.3 fixes the issue.
