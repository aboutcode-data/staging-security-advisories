summary: A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) implementation in Cisco
  IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
  prevent IKEv2 from establishing new security associations. The vulnerability is due to incorrect
  handling of crafted IKEv2 SA-Init packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by

  to cause the affected device to reach the maximum incoming negotiation limits and prevent
  further IKEv2 security associations from being formed.
