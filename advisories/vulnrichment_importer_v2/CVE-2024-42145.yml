  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  IB/core: Implement a limit on UMAD receive List

  The existing behavior of ib_umad, which maintains received MAD
  packets in an unbounded list, poses a risk of uncontrolled growth.
  As user-space applications extract packets from this list, the rate
  of extraction may not match the rate of incoming packets, leading
  to potential list overflow.

  To address this, we introduce a limit to the size of the list. After
  considering typical scenarios, such as OpenSM processing, which can
  handle approximately 100k packets per second, and the 1-second retry
  timeout for most packets, we set the list size limit to 200k. Packets
  received beyond this limit are dropped, assuming they are likely timed
  out by the time they are handled by user-space.

  Notably, packets queued on the receive list due to reasons like
  timed-out sends are preserved even when the list is full.
