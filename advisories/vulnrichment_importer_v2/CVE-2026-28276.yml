aliases: []
summary: Initiative is a self-hosted project management platform. An access control vulnerability
  exists in Initiative versions prior to 0.32.2 where uploaded documents are served from a publicly
  accessible /uploads/ directory without any authentication or authorization checks. Any uploaded
  file can be accessed directly via its URL by unauthenticated users (e.g., in an incognito
  browser session), leading to potential disclosure of sensitive documents. The problem was
  patched in v0.32.2, and the patch was further improved on in 032.4.
