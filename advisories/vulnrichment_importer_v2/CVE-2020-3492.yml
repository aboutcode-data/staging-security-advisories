aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Flexible NetFlow Version 9 packet processor of Cisco IOS XE
  Software for Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controllers and Cisco AireOS Software for
  Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers (WLC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause
  a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  validation of certain parameters in a Flexible NetFlow Version 9 record. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by spoofing the address of an existing Access Point on the network
  and sending a Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) packet that includes
  a crafted Flexible NetFlow Version 9 record to an affected device. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to cause a process crash that would lead to a reload of the device.
