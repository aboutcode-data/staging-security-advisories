summary: In the latest version (20240628) of gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt, an issue exists in
  the /file endpoint that allows authenticated users to access the chat history of other users.
  When a user logs in, a directory is created in the history folder with the user's name. By
  manipulating the /file endpoint, an authenticated user can enumerate and access files in other
  users' directories, leading to unauthorized access to private chat histories. This vulnerability
  can be exploited to read any user's private chat history.
