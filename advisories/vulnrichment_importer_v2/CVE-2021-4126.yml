aliases: []
summary: When receiving an OpenPGP/MIME signed email message that contains an additional outer
  MIME message layer, for example a message footer added by a mailing list gateway, Thunderbird
  only considered the inner signed message for the signature validity. This gave the false impression
  that the additional contents were also covered by the digital signature. Starting with Thunderbird
  version 91.4.1, only the signature that belongs to the top level MIME part will be considered
  for the displayed status. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.4.1.
