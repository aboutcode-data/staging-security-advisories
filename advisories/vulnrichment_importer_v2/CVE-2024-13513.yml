aliases: []
summary: The Oliver POS – A WooCommerce Point of Sale (POS) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.2.3 via the logging
  functionality. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data
  including the plugin's clientToken, which in turn can be used to change user account information
  including emails and account type. This allows attackers to then change account passwords
  resulting in a complete site takeover. Version 2.4.2.3 disabled logging but left sites with
  existing log files vulnerable.
