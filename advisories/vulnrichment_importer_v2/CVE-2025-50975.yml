aliases: []
summary: IPFire 2.29 web-based firewall interface (firewall.cgi) fails to sanitize several rule
  parameters such as PROT, SRC_PORT, TGT_PORT, dnatport, key, ruleremark, src_addr, std_net_tgt,
  and tgt_addr, allowing an authenticated administrator to inject persistent JavaScript. This
  stored XSS payload is executed whenever another admin views the firewall rules page, enabling
  session hijacking, unauthorized actions within the interface, or further internal pivoting.
  Exploitation requires only high-privilege GUI access, and the complexity of the attack is
  low.
