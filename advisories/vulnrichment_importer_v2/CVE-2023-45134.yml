aliases: []
summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications
  built on top of it. `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web` starting in version 3.1-milestone-1
  and prior to 13.4-rc-1, `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web-templates` prior to versions
  14.10.2 and 15.5-rc-1, and `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-web-standard` starting in version 2.4-milestone-2
  and prior to version 3.1-milestone-1 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting. An attacker can
  create a template provider on any document that is part of the wiki (could be the attacker's
  user profile) that contains malicious code. This code is executed when this template provider
  is selected during document creation which can be triggered by sending the user to a URL.
  For the attacker, the only requirement is to have an account as by default the own user profile
  is editable. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary actions with the rights of the user
  opening the malicious link. Depending on the rights of the user, this may allow remote code
  execution and full read and write access to the whole XWiki installation. This has been patched
  in `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web` 13.4-rc-1, `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web-templates`
  14.10.2 and 15.5-rc-1, and `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-web-standard` 3.1-milestone-1 by adding
  the appropriate escaping. The vulnerable template file createinline.vm is part of XWiki's
  WAR and can be patched by manually applying the changes from the fix.
