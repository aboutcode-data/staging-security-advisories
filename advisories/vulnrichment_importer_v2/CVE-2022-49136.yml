  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  Bluetooth: hci_sync: Fix queuing commands when HCI_UNREGISTER is set

  hci_cmd_sync_queue shall return an error if HCI_UNREGISTER flag has
  been set as that means hci_unregister_dev has been called so it will
  likely cause a uaf after the timeout as the hdev will be freed.
