aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Web Services Management Agent (WSMA) feature of Cisco Industrial
  Network Director (IND) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized
  read access to sensitive data using an invalid X.509 certificate. The vulnerability is due
  to insufficient X.509 certificate validation when establishing a WSMA connection. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a crafted X.509 certificate during the WSMA
  connection setup phase. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct man-in-the-middle
  attacks to decrypt confidential information on WSMA connections to the affected software.
  At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco IND Software releases prior
  to 1.7.
