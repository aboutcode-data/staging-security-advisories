aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability was found in Moodle which exists due to insufficient validation of
  the HTTP request origin in course redirect URL. A user's CSRF token was unnecessarily included
  in the URL when being redirected to a course they have just restored. A remote attacker can
  trick the victim to visit a specially crafted web page and perform arbitrary actions on behalf
  of the victim on the vulnerable website. This flaw allows an attacker to perform cross-site
  request forgery attacks.
