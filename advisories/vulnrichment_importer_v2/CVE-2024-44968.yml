  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  tick/broadcast: Move per CPU pointer access into the atomic section

  The recent fix for making the take over of the broadcast timer more
  reliable retrieves a per CPU pointer in preemptible context.

  This went unnoticed as compilers hoist the access into the non-preemptible
  region where the pointer is actually used. But of course it's valid that
  the compiler keeps it at the place where the code puts it which rightfully
  triggers:

    BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code:
         caller is hotplug_cpu__broadcast_tick_pull+0x1c/0xc0

  Move it to the actual usage site which is in a non-preemptible region.
