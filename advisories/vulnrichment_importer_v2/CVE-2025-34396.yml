aliases: []
summary: MailEnable versions prior to 10.54 contain an unsafe DLL loading vulnerability that
  can lead to local arbitrary code execution. The MailEnable administrative executable attempts
  to load MEAINFY.DLL from its application directo without sufficient integrity validation or
  secure search order. If the DLL is missing or attacker-writable locations in the search path
  are used, a local attacker with write permissions to the directory can plant a malicious MEAINFY.DLL.
  When the executable is launched, it loads the attacker-controlled library and executes code
  with the privileges of the process, enabling local privilege escalation when run with elevated
  rights.
