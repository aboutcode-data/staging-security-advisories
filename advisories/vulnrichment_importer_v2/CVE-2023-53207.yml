summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ublk: fail to recover device if queue setup is interrupted

  In ublk_ctrl_end_recovery(), if wait_for_completion_interruptible() is
  interrupted by signal, queues aren't setup successfully yet, so we
  have to fail UBLK_CMD_END_USER_RECOVERY, otherwise kernel oops can be
  triggered.
