  \ attacker to cause a reload of the affected system or to remotely execute code. An attacker\
  \ could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP packet to the affected device.&nbsp;\r\
  \n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow in the affected code area. The\
  \ vulnerability affects all versions of SNMP (versions 1, 2c, and 3). The attacker must know\
  \ the SNMP read only community string (SNMP version 2c or earlier) or the user credentials\
  \ (SNMPv3). An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full\
  \ control of the system or to cause a reload of the affected system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly traffic\
  \ directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability."
