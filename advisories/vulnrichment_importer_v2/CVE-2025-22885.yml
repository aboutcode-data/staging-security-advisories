aliases: []
summary: Improper buffer restrictions in the firmware for the TDX Module may allow an escalation
  of privilege. System software adversary with a privileged user combined with a high complexity
  attack may enable escalation of privilege. This result may potentially occur via local access
  when attack requirements are not present without special internal knowledge and requires no
  user interaction. The potential vulnerability may impact the confidentiality (high), integrity
  (low) and availability (none) of the vulnerable system, resulting in subsequent system confidentiality
  (none), integrity (none) and availability (none) impacts.
