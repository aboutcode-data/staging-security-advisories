aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software CLI could allow an authenticated,
  local attacker to elevate privileges and execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating
  system as the root user. An attacker must be authenticated on an affected device as a PRIV15
  user. This vulnerability is due to insufficient file system protection and the presence of
  a sensitive file in the bootflash directory on an affected device. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by overwriting an installer file stored in the bootflash directory with
  arbitrary commands that can be executed with root-level privileges. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to read and write changes to the configuration database on the affected
  device.
