aliases: []
summary: Lychee is a free photo-management tool.  Prior to 5.0.2, Lychee is vulnerable to an
  SQL injection on any binding when using mysql/mariadb. This injection is only active for users
  with the `.env` settings set to DB_LOG_SQL=true and DB_LOG_SQL_EXPLAIN=true. The defaults
  settings of Lychee are safe.  The patch is provided on version 5.0.2.  To work around this
  issue, disable SQL EXPLAIN logging.
