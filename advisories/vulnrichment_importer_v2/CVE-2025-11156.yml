aliases: []
summary: Netskope was notified about a potential gap in its agent (NS Client) on Windows systems.  If
  this gap is successfully exploited, a local, authenticated user with Administrator privileges can
  improperly load the driver as a generic kernel service. This triggers the flaw, causing a
  system crash (Blue-Screen-of-Death) and resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) for the affected
  machine.
