aliases: []
summary: Grav is a file-based Web platform. Prior to 1.8.0-beta.27, A path traversal vulnerability
  has been identified in Grav CMS, allowing authenticated attackers with administrative privileges
  to read arbitrary files on the underlying server filesystem. This vulnerability arises due
  to insufficient input sanitization in the backup tool, where user-supplied paths are not properly
  restricted, enabling access to files outside the intended webroot directory. The impact of
  this vulnerability depends on the privileges of the user account running the application.
  This vulnerability is fixed in 1.8.0-beta.27.
