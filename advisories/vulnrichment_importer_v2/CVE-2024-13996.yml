aliases: []
summary: Nagios XI versions prior to 2024R1.1.3 did not invalidate all other active sessions
  for a user when that user's password was changed. As a result, any pre-existing sessions (including
  those potentially controlled by an attacker) remained valid after a credential update. This
  insufficient session expiration could allow continued unauthorized access to user data and
  actions even after a password change.
