aliases: []
summary: The SALESmanago plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Log Injection in versions up
  to, and including, 3.2.4. This is due to the use of a weak authentication token for the /wp-json/salesmanago/v1/callbackApiV3
  API endpoint which is simply a SHA1 hash of the site URL and client ID found in the page source
  of the website. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary content
  into the log files, and when combined with another vulnerability this could have significant
  consequences.
