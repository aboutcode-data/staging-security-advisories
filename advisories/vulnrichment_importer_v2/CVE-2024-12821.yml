aliases: []
summary: The Media Manager for UserPro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification
  of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check on the upm_upload_media()
  function in all versions up to, and including, 3.12.0. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress
  site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and
  enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable
  site.
