aliases: []
summary: Git LFS is a Git extension for versioning large files. When Git LFS requests credentials
  from Git for a remote host, it passes portions of the host's URL to the `git-credential(1)`
  command without checking for embedded line-ending control characters, and then sends any credentials
  it receives back from the Git credential helper to the remote host. By inserting URL-encoded
  control characters such as line feed (LF) or carriage return (CR) characters into the URL,
  an attacker may be able to retrieve a user's Git credentials. This problem exists in all previous
  versions and is patched in v3.6.1. All users should upgrade to v3.6.1. There are no workarounds
  known at this time.
