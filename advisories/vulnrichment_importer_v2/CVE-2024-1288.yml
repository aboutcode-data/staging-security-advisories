summary: The Schema & Structured Data for WP & AMP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
  modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'saswp_reviews_form_render'
  function in all versions up to, and including, 1.26. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with contributor access and above, to modify the plugin's stored reCaptcha site
  and secret keys, potentially breaking the reCaptcha functionality.
