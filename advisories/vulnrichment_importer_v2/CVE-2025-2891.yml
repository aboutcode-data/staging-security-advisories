aliases: []
summary: The Real Estate 7 WordPress theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
  due to missing file type validation via the 'template-submit-listing.php' file in all versions
  up to, and including, 3.5.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Seller-level
  access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote
  code execution possible if front-end listing submission has been enabled.
