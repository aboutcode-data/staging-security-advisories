aliases: []
summary: The SQL injection vulnerability in the Hide My WP WordPress plugin (versions <= 6.2.3)
  is possible because of how the IP address is retrieved and used inside a SQL query. The function
  "hmwp_get_user_ip" tries to retrieve the IP address from multiple headers, including IP address
  headers that the user can spoof, such as "X-Forwarded-For." As a result, the malicious payload
  supplied in one of these IP address headers will be directly inserted into the SQL query,
  making SQL injection possible.
