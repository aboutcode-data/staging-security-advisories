aliases: []
summary: ILIAS (2013-09-12 release) contains a medium-criticality Directory Traversal local
  file inclusion vulnerability in the ScormAicc module. An attacker with a privileged account,
  typically holding the tutor role, can exploit this to gain unauthorized access to and potentially
  retrieve confidential files stored on the web server. The attacker can access files that are
  readable by the web server user www-data; this may include sensitive configuration files and
  documents located outside the documentRoot. The vulnerability is exploited by an attacker
  who manipulates the file parameter in a URL, inserting directory traversal sequences in order
  to access unauthorized files. This manipulation allows the attacker to retrieve sensitive
  files, such as /etc/passwd, potentially compromising the system's security. This issue poses
  a significant risk to confidentiality and is remotely exploitable over the internet.
