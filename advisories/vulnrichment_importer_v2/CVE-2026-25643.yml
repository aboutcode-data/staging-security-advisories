aliases: []
summary: 'Frigate is a network video recorder (NVR) with realtime local object detection for
  IP cameras. Prior to 0.16.4, a critical Remote Command Execution (RCE) vulnerability has been
  identified in the Frigate integration with go2rtc. The application does not sanitize user
  input in the video stream configuration (config.yaml), allowing direct injection of system
  commands via the exec: directive. The go2rtc service executes these commands without restrictions.
  This vulnerability is only exploitable by an administrator or users who have exposed their
  Frigate install to the open internet with no authentication which allows anyone full administrative
  control. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.16.4.'
