aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the SSL/TLS session handler of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance
  (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability
  is due to a memory leak when closing SSL/TLS connections in a specific state. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by establishing several SSL/TLS sessions and ensuring they
  are closed under certain conditions. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust
  memory resources in the affected device, which would prevent it from processing new SSL/TLS
  connections, resulting in a DoS. Manual intervention is required to recover an affected device.
