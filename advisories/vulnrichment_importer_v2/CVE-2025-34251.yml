aliases: []
summary: Tesla Telematics Control Unit (TCU) firmware prior to v2025.14 contains an authentication
  bypass vulnerability. The TCU runs the Android Debug Bridge (adbd) as root and, despite a
  “lockdown” check that disables adb shell, still permits adb push/pull and adb forward. Because
  adbd is privileged and the device’s USB port is exposed externally, an attacker with physical
  access can write an arbitrary file to a writable location and then overwrite the kernel’s
  uevent_helper or /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug entries via ADB, causing the script to be executed
  with root privileges.
