aliases: []
summary: The kallyas theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions
  up to, and including, 4.24.0 via the  `TH_PhpCode` pagebuilder widget. This is due to the
  theme not restricting access to the code editor widget for non-administrators. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to execute
  code on the server.
