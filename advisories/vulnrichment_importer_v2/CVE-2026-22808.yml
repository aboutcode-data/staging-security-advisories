aliases: []
summary: fleetdm/fleet is open source device management software. Prior to versions 4.78.2,
  4.77.1, 4.76.2, 4.75.2, and 4.53.3, if Windows MDM is enabled, an unauthenticated attacker
  can exploit this XSS vulnerability to steal a Fleet administrator's authentication token (FLEET::auth_token)
  from localStorage. This could allow unauthorized access to Fleet, including administrative
  access, visibility into device data, and modification of configuration. Versions 4.78.2, 4.77.1,
  4.76.2, 4.75.2, and 4.53.3 fix the issue. If an immediate upgrade is not possible, affected
  Fleet users should temporarily disable Windows MDM.
