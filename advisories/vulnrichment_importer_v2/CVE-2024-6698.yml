aliases: []
summary: The FundEngine plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions
  up to, and including, 1.7.0. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying user meta updated
  through the update_user_meta function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with subscriber-level access and above, to update their user meta which can be leveraged to
  update their capabilities to gain administrator access.
