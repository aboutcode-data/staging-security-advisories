aliases: []
summary: Crossplane is a framework for building cloud native control planes without needing
  to write code. In versions prior to 1.11.5, 1.12.3, and 1.13.0, a high-privileged user could
  create a Package referencing an arbitrarily large image containing that Crossplane would then
  parse, possibly resulting in exhausting all the available memory and therefore in the container
  being OOMKilled. The impact is limited due to the high privileges required to be able to create
  the Package and the eventually consistency nature of controller. This issue is fixed in versions
  1.11.5, 1.12.3, and 1.13.0.
