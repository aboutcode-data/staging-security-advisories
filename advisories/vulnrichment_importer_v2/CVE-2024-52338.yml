aliases: []
summary: "Deserialization of untrusted data in IPC and Parquet readers in the Apache Arrow R\
  \ package versions 4.0.0 through 16.1.0 allows arbitrary code execution. An application is\
  \ vulnerable if it \nreads Arrow IPC, Feather or Parquet data from untrusted sources (for\
  \ \nexample, user-supplied input files). This vulnerability only affects the arrow R package,\
  \ not other Apache Arrow \nimplementations or bindings unless those bindings are specifically\
  \ used via the R package (for example, an R application that embeds a Python interpreter and\
  \ uses PyArrow to read files from untrusted sources is still vulnerable if the arrow R package\
  \ is an affected version). It is recommended that users of the arrow R package upgrade to\
  \ 17.0.0 or later. Similarly, it\n is recommended that downstream libraries upgrade their\
  \ dependency \nrequirements to arrow 17.0.0 or later. If using an affected\nversion of the\
  \ package, untrusted data can read into a Table and its internal to_data_frame() method can\
  \ be used as a workaround (e.g., read_parquet(..., as_data_frame = FALSE)$to_data_frame()).\n\
  \n\nThis issue affects the Apache Arrow R package: from 4.0.0 through 16.1.0.\n\n\nUsers are\
  \ recommended to upgrade to version 17.0.0, which fixes the issue."
