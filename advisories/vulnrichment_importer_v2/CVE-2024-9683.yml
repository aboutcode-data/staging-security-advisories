aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability was found in Quay, which allows successful authentication even when
  a truncated password version is provided. This flaw affects the authentication mechanism,
  reducing the overall security of password enforcement.  While the risk is relatively low due
  to the typical length of the passwords used (73 characters), this vulnerability can still
  be exploited to reduce the complexity of brute-force or password-guessing attacks. The truncation
  of passwords weakens the overall authentication process, thereby reducing the effectiveness
  of password policies and potentially increasing the risk of unauthorized access in the future.
