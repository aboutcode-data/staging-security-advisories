aliases: []
summary: 'Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host versions prior to 22.0.893
  and Application versions prior to 20.0.2140 (macOS/Linux client deployments) are built against
  OpenSSL 1.0.2h-fips (released May 2016), which has been end-of-life since 2019 and is no longer
  supported by the OpenSSL project. Continued use of this outdated cryptographic library exposes
  deployments to known vulnerabilities that are no longer patched, weakening the overall security
  posture. Affected daemons may emit deprecation warnings and rely on cryptographic components
  with unresolved security flaws, potentially enabling attackers to exploit weaknesses in TLS/SSL
  processing or cryptographic operations. This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor
  as: V-2023-021 — Out-of-Date OpenSSL Library.'
