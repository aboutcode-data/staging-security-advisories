aliases: []
summary: CVAT is an open source interactive video and image annotation tool for computer vision.
  In versions 2.2.0 through 2.54.0, an attacker is able to execute arbitrary JavaScript in a
  victim user's CVAT UI session, provided that they are able to create a maliciously crafted
  label in a CVAT task or project, then get the victim user to either edit that label, or view
  a shape that refers to that label; and/or get the victim user to upload a maliciously crafted
  SVG image when configuring a skeleton. This gives the attacker temporary access to all CVAT
  resources that the victim user can access. Version 2.55.0 fixes the issue.
