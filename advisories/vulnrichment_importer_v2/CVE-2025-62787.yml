aliases: []
summary: Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and
  response. Prior to 4.10.2, a buffer over-read occurs in DecodeWinevt() when child_attr[p]->attributes[j]
  is accessed, because the corresponding index (j) is incorrect. A compromised agent can cause
  a READ operation beyond the end of the allocated buffer (which may contain sensitive information)
  by sending a specially crafted message to the wazuh manager. An attacker who is able to craft
  and send an agent message to the wazuh manager can cause a buffer over-read and potentially
  access sensitive data. While the buffer over-read is always triggered while resolving the
  arguments of mdebug2, specific configuration options (analysisd.debug=2) need to be in place
  for the respective data to be leaked. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.10.2.
