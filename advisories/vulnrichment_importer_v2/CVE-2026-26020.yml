aliases: []
summary: AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create, deploy, and manage continuous artificial
  intelligence agents that automate complex workflows. Prior to 0.6.48, an authenticated user
  could achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the backend server by embedding a disabled block
  inside a graph. The BlockInstallationBlock — a development tool capable of writing and importing
  arbitrary Python code — was marked disabled=True, but graph validation did not enforce this
  flag. This allowed any authenticated user to bypass the restriction by including the block
  as a node in a graph, rather than calling the block's execution endpoint directly (which did
  enforce the flag). This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.48.
