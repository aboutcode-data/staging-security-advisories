aliases: []
summary: The Campay Woocommerce Payment Gateway plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated
  Payment Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.2. This is due to the plugin not
  properly validating that a transaction has occurred through the payment gateway. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass payments and mark orders as successfully
  completed resulting in a loss of income.
