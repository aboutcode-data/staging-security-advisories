aliases: []
summary: Adobe Experience Manager versions 6.5.21 and earlier are affected by a DOM-based Cross-Site
  Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary
  code in the context of the victim's browser session. By manipulating a DOM element through
  a crafted URL or user input, the attacker can inject malicious scripts that run when the page
  is rendered. This type of attack requires user interaction, as the victim would need to access
  the manipulated URL or input the malicious data themselves.
