aliases: []
summary: The AS Password Field In Default Registration Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.0.
  This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their
  password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's
  passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.
