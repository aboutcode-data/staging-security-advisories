summary: The LB-Link BL-CPE300M AX300 4G LTE Router firmware version BL-R8800_B10_ALK_SL_V01.01.02P42U14_06
  does not implement proper session handling. After a user authenticates from a specific IP
  address, the router grants access to any other client using that same IP, without requiring
  credentials or verifying client identity. There are no session tokens, cookies, or unique
  identifiers in place. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain full administrative access simply
  by configuring their device to use the same IP address as a previously authenticated user.
  This results in a complete authentication bypass.
