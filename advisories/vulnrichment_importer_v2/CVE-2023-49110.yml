aliases: []
summary: "When the Kiuwan Local Analyzer uploads the scan results to the Kiuwan SAST web \n\
  application (either on-premises or cloud/SaaS solution), the transmitted data \nconsists of\
  \ a ZIP archive containing several files, some of them in the \nXML file format. During Kiuwan's\
  \ server-side processing of these XML \nfiles, it resolves external XML entities, resulting\
  \ in a XML external \nentity injection attack. An attacker with privileges to scan \nsource\
  \ code within the \"Code Security\" module is able to extract any \nfiles of the operating\
  \ system with the rights of the application server \nuser and is potentially able to gain\
  \ sensitive files, such as \nconfiguration and passwords. Furthermore, this vulnerability\
  \ also allows\n an attacker to initiate connections to internal systems, e.g. for port \n\
  scans or accessing other internal functions / applications such as the \nWildfly admin console\
  \ of Kiuwan.\n\nThis issue affects Kiuwan SAST: <master.1808.p685.q13371"
