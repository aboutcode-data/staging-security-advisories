  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/panfrost: Job should reference MMU not file_priv

  For a while now it's been allowed for a MMU context to outlive it's
  corresponding panfrost_priv, however the job structure still references
  panfrost_priv to get hold of the MMU context. If panfrost_priv has been
  freed this is a use-after-free which I've been able to trigger resulting
  in a splat.

  To fix this, drop the reference to panfrost_priv in the job structure
  and add a direct reference to the MMU structure which is what's actually
  needed.
