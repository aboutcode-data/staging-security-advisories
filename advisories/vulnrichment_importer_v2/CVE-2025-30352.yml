aliases: []
summary: Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting
  in version 9.0.0-alpha.4 and prior to version 11.5.0, the `search` query parameter allows
  users with access to a collection to filter items based on fields they do not have permission
  to view. This allows the enumeration of unknown field contents. The searchable columns (numbers
  & strings) are not checked against permissions when injecting the `where` clauses for applying
  the search query. This leads to the possibility of enumerating those un-permitted fields.
  Version 11.5.0 fixes the issue.
