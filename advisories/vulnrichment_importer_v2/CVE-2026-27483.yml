aliases: []
summary: MindsDB is a platform for building artificial intelligence from enterprise data. Prior
  to version 25.9.1.1, there is a path traversal vulnerability in Mindsdb's /api/files interface,
  which an authenticated attacker can exploit to achieve remote command execution. The vulnerability
  exists in the "Upload File" module, which corresponds to the API endpoint /api/files. Since
  the multipart file upload does not perform security checks on the uploaded file path, an attacker
  can perform path traversal by using `../` sequences in the filename field. The file write
  operation occurs before calling clear_filename and save_file, meaning there is no filtering
  of filenames or file types, allowing arbitrary content to be written to any path on the server.
  Version 25.9.1.1 patches the issue.
