aliases: []
summary: 'The Aquarius HelperTool (1.0.003) privileged XPC service on macOS contains multiple
  flaws that allow local privilege escalation. The service accepts XPC connections from any
  local process without validating the client''s identity, and its authorization logic incorrectly
  calls AuthorizationCopyRights with a NULL reference, causing all authorization checks to succeed.
  The executeCommand:authorization:withReply: method then interpolates attacker-controlled input
  into NSTask and executes it with root privileges. A local attacker can exploit these weaknesses
  to run arbitrary commands as root, create persistent backdoors, or obtain a fully interactive
  root shell.'
