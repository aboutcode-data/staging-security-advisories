aliases: []
summary: The LA-Studio Element Kit for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local
  File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.2 via the _load_template function.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above,
  to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code
  in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve
  code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included.
