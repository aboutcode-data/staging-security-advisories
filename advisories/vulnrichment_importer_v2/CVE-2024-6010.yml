aliases: []
summary: 'The Cost Calculator Builder PRO plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to price manipulation
  in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.1. This is due to the plugin allowing the price
  field to be manipulated prior to processing via the ''create_cc_order'' function, called from
  the Cost Calculator Builder plugin. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
  manipulate the price of orders submitted via the calculator. Note: this vulnerability was
  partially patched with the release of Cost Calculator Builder version 3.2.17.'
