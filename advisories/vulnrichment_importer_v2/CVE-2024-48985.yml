aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in MBed OS 6.16.0. During processing of HCI packets, the software
  dynamically determines the length of the packet data by reading 2 bytes from the packet data.
  A buffer is then allocated to contain the entire packet, the size of which is calculated as
  the length of the packet body determined earlier and the header length. If the allocate fails
  because the specified packet is too large, no exception handling occurs and hciTrSerialRxIncoming
  continues to write bytes into the 4-byte large temporary header buffer, leading to a buffer
  overflow. This can be leveraged into an arbitrary write by an attacker. It is possible to
  overwrite the pointer to the buffer that is supposed to receive the contents of the packet
  body but which couldn't be allocated. One can then overwrite the state variable used by the
  function to determine which step of the parsing process is currently being executed. This
  advances the function to the next state, where it proceeds to copy data to that arbitrary
  location. The packet body is then written wherever the corrupted data pointer is pointing.
