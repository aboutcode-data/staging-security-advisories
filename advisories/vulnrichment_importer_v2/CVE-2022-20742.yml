aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in an IPsec VPN library of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA)
  Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to read or modify data within an IPsec IKEv2 VPN tunnel. This vulnerability
  is due to an improper implementation of Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) ciphers. An attacker in
  a man-in-the-middle position could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting a sufficient
  number of encrypted messages across an affected IPsec IKEv2 VPN tunnel and then using cryptanalytic
  techniques to break the encryption. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to decrypt,
  read, modify, and re-encrypt data that is transmitted across an affected IPsec IKEv2 VPN tunnel.
