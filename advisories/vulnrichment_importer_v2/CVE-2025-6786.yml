aliases: []
summary: The DocCheck Login plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized post access in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.1.5. This is due to plugin redirecting a user to login
  on a password protected post after the page has loaded. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to read posts they should not have access to.
