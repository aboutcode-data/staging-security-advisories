  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ptp: ocp: fix use-after-free bugs causing by ptp_ocp_watchdog

  The ptp_ocp_detach() only shuts down the watchdog timer if it is
  pending. However, if the timer handler is already running, the
  timer_delete_sync() is not called. This leads to race conditions
  where the devlink that contains the ptp_ocp is deallocated while
  the timer handler is still accessing it, resulting in use-after-free
  bugs. The following details one of the race scenarios.

  (thread 1)                           | (thread 2)
  ptp_ocp_remove()                     |
    ptp_ocp_detach()                   | ptp_ocp_watchdog()
      if (timer_pending(&bp->watchdog))|   bp = timer_container_of()
        timer_delete_sync()            |
                                       |
    devlink_free(devlink) //free       |
                                       |   bp-> //use

  Resolve this by unconditionally calling timer_delete_sync() to ensure
  the timer is reliably deactivated, preventing any access after free.
