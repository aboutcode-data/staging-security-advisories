aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  protect the fetch of ->fd[fd] in do_dup2() from mispredictions

  both callers have verified that fd is not greater than ->max_fds;
  however, misprediction might end up with
          tofree = fdt->fd[fd];
  being speculatively executed.  That's wrong for the same reasons
  why it's wrong in close_fd()/file_close_fd_locked(); the same
  solution applies - array_index_nospec(fd, fdt->max_fds) could differ
  from fd only in case of speculative execution on mispredicted path.
