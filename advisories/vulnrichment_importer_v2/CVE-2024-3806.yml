aliases: []
summary: The Porto theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions
  up to, and including, 7.1.0 via the 'porto_ajax_posts' function. This makes it possible for
  unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the
  execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain
  sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where php file type can be uploaded and
  included.
