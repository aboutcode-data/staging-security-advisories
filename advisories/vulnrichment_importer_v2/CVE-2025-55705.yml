aliases: []
summary: "This vulnerability occurs when the system permits multiple simultaneous \nconnections\
  \ to the backend using the same charging station ID. This can \nresult in unauthorized access,\
  \ data inconsistency, or potential \nmanipulation of charging sessions. The lack of proper\
  \ session management\n and expiration control allows attackers to exploit this weakness by\
  \ \nreusing valid charging station IDs to establish multiple sessions \nconcurrently."
