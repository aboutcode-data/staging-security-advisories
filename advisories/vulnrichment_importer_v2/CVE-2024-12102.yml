aliases: []
summary: The Typer Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions
  up to, and including, 1.9.6 via the 'elementor-template' shortcode due to insufficient restrictions
  on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level
  access and above, to extract data from private or draft posts created by Elementor that they
  should not have access to.
