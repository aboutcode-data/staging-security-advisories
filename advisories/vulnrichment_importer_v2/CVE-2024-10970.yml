aliases: []
summary: The The Motors – Car Dealer, Classifieds & Listing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.43. This is due
  to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value
  before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
  access and above, to execute arbitrary shortcodes.
