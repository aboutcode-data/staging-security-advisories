aliases: []
summary: Discourse-calendar is a plugin for the Discourse messaging platform which adds the
  ability to create a dynamic calendar in the first post of a topic. Members of private groups
  or public groups with private members can be listed by users, who can create and edit post
  events. This vulnerability only affects sites which have discourse post events enabled. This
  issue has been patched in commit `ca5ae3e7e` which will be included in future releases. Users
  unable to upgrade should disable the `discourse_post_event_enabled` setting to fully mitigate
  the issue. Also, it's possible to prevent regular users from using this vulnerability by removing
  all groups from the `discourse_post_event_allowed_on_groups` but note that moderators will
  still be able to use it.
