aliases: []
summary: MajorDoMo (aka Major Domestic Module) is vulnerable to unauthenticated OS command injection
  via rc/index.php. The $param variable from user input is interpolated into a command string
  within double quotes without sanitization via escapeshellarg(). The command is inserted into
  a database queue by safe_exec(), which performs no sanitization. The cycle_execs.php script,
  which is web-accessible without authentication, retrieves queued commands and passes them
  directly to exec(). An attacker can exploit a race condition by first triggering cycle_execs.php
  (which purges the queue and enters a polling loop), then injecting a malicious command via
  the rc endpoint while the worker is polling. The injected shell metacharacters expand inside
  double quotes, achieving remote code execution within one second.
