  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  can: ucan: fix out of bound read in strscpy() source

  Commit 7fdaf8966aae ("can: ucan: use strscpy() to instead of strncpy()")
  unintentionally introduced a one byte out of bound read on strscpy()'s
  source argument (which is kind of ironic knowing that strscpy() is meant
  to be a more secure alternative :)).

  Let's consider below buffers:

    dest[len + 1]; /* will be NUL terminated */
    src[len]; /* may not be NUL terminated */

  When doing:

    strncpy(dest, src, len);
    dest[len] = '\0';

  strncpy() will read up to len bytes from src.

  On the other hand:

    strscpy(dest, src, len + 1);

  will read up to len + 1 bytes from src, that is to say, an out of bound
  read of one byte will occur on src if it is not NUL terminated. Note
  that the src[len] byte is never copied, but strscpy() still needs to
  read it to check whether a truncation occurred or not.

  This exact pattern happened in ucan.

  The root cause is that the source is not NUL terminated. Instead of
  doing a copy in a local buffer, directly NUL terminate it as soon as
  usb_control_msg() returns. With this, the local firmware_str[] variable
  can be removed.

  On top of this do a couple refactors:

    - ucan_ctl_payload->raw is only used for the firmware string, so
      rename it to ucan_ctl_payload->fw_str and change its type from u8 to
      char.

    - ucan_device_request_in() is only used to retrieve the firmware
      string, so rename it to ucan_get_fw_str() and refactor it to make it
      directly handle all the string termination logic.
