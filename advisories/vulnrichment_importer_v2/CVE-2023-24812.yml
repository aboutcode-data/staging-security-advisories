summary: Misskey is an open source, decentralized social media platform. In versions prior to
  13.3.3 SQL injection is possible due to insufficient parameter validation in the note search
  API by tag (notes/search-by-tag). This has been fixed in version 13.3.3. Users are advised
  to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should block access to the `api/notes/search-by-tag` endpoint.
