aliases: []
summary: GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An integer
  underflow has been detected in extract_cc_from_data function within qtdemux.c. In the FOURCC_c708
  case, the subtraction atom_length - 8 may result in an underflow if atom_length is less than
  8. When that subtraction underflows, *cclen ends up being a large number, and then cclen is
  passed to g_memdup2 leading to an out-of-bounds (OOB) read. This vulnerability is fixed in
  1.24.10.
