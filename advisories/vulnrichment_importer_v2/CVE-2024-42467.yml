aliases: []
summary: openHAB, a provider of open-source home automation software, has add-ons including
  the visualization add-on CometVisu. Prior to version 4.2.1, the proxy endpoint of openHAB's
  CometVisu add-on can be accessed without authentication. This proxy-feature can be exploited
  as Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to induce GET HTTP requests to internal-only servers,
  in case openHAB is exposed in a non-private network. Furthermore, this proxy-feature can also
  be exploited as a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, as an attacker is able to re-route
  a request to their server and return a page with malicious JavaScript code. Since the browser
  receives this data directly from the openHAB CometVisu UI, this JavaScript code will be executed
  with the origin of the CometVisu UI. This allows an attacker to exploit call endpoints on
  an openHAB server even if the openHAB server is located in a private network. (e.g. by sending
  an openHAB admin a link that proxies malicious JavaScript.) This issue may lead up to Remote
  Code Execution (RCE) when chained with other vulnerabilities. Users should upgrade to version
  4.2.1 of the CometVisu add-on of openHAB to receive a patch.
