aliases: []
summary: Kirby is a Content Management System. Prior to versions 3.5.8.2, 3.6.6.2, 3.7.5.1,
  and 3.8.1, a user enumeration vulnerability affects all Kirby sites with user accounts unless
  Kirby's API and Panel are disabled in the config. It can only be exploited for targeted attacks
  because the attack does not scale to brute force. The problem has been patched in Kirby 3.5.8.2,
  Kirby 3.6.6.2, Kirby 3.7.5.1, and Kirby 3.8.1. In all of the mentioned releases, the maintainers
  have rewritten the affected code so that the delay is also inserted after the brute force
  limit is reached.
