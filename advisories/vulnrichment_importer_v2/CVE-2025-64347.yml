aliases: []
summary: Apollo Router Core is a configurable Rust graph router written to run a federated supergraph
  using Apollo Federation 2. Versions 1.61.12-rc.0 and below and 2.8.1-rc.0 allow unauthorized
  access to protected data through schema elements with access control directives (@authenticated,
  @requiresScopes, and @policy) that were renamed via @link imports. Router did not enforce
  renamed access control directives on schema elements (e.g. fields and types), allowing queries
  to bypass those element-level access controls. This issue is fixed in versions 1.61.12 and
  2.8.1.
