aliases: []
summary: Umbraco Forms is a form builder that integrates with the Umbraco content management
  system. It's possible for an authenticated backoffice-user to enumerate and traverse paths/files
  on the systems filesystem and read their contents, on Mac/Linux Umbraco installations using
  Forms. As Umbraco Cloud runs in a Windows environment, Cloud users aren't affected. This issue
  affects versions 16 and 17 of Umbraco Forms and is patched in 16.4.1 and 17.1.1. If upgrading
  is not immediately possible, users can mitigate this vulnerability by configuring a WAF or
  reverse proxy to block requests containing path traversal sequences (`../`, `..\`) in the
  `fileName` parameter of the export endpoint, restricting network access to the Umbraco backoffice
  to trusted IP ranges, and/or blocking the `/umbraco/forms/api/v1/export` endpoint entirely
  if the export feature is not required. However, upgrading to the patched version is strongly
  recommended.
