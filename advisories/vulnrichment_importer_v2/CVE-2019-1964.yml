aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the IPv6 traffic processing of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an unexpected restart of the netstack process
  on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of IPv6 traffic sent
  through an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed
  IPv6 packet through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause
  a denial of service (DoS) condition while the netstack process restarts. A sustained attack
  could lead to a reboot of the device.
