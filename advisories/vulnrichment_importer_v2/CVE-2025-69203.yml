summary: 'Signal K Server is a server application that runs on a central hub in a boat. Versions
  prior to 2.19.0 of the access request system have two related features that when combined
  by themselves and with an information disclosure vulnerability enable convincing social engineering
  attacks against administrators. When a device creates an access request, it specifies three
  fields: `clientId`, `description`, and `permissions`. The SignalK admin UI displays the `description`
  field prominently to the administrator when showing pending requests, but the actual `permissions`
  field (which determines the access level granted) is less visible or displayed separately.
  This allows an attacker to request `admin` permissions while providing a description that
  suggests readonly access. The access request handler trusts the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header
  without validation to determine the client''s IP address. This header is intended to preserve
  the original client IP when requests pass through reverse proxies, but when trusted unconditionally,
  it allows attackers to spoof their IP address. The spoofed IP is displayed to administrators
  in the access request approval interface, potentially making malicious requests appear to
  originate from trusted internal network addresses. Since device/source names can be enumerated
  via the information disclosure vulnerability, an attacker can impersonate a legitimate device
  or source, craft a convincing description, spoof a trusted internal IP address, and request
  elevated permissions, creating a highly convincing social engineering scenario that increases
  the likelihood of administrator approval. Users should upgrade to version 2.19.0 to fix this
  issue.'
