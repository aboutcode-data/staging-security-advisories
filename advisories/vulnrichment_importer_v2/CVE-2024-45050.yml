aliases: []
summary: Ringer server is the server code for the Ringer messaging app. Prior to version 1.3.1,
  there is an issue with the messages loading route where Ringer Server does not check to ensure
  that the user loading the conversation is actually a member of that conversation. This allows
  any user with a Lif Account to load any conversation between two users without permission.
  This issue had been patched in version 1.3.1. There is no action required for users. Lif Platforms
  will update their servers with the patch.
