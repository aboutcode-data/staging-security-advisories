aliases: []
summary: The ContentStudio plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to
  a missing capability check on several functions in versions up to, and including, 1.2.5. This
  makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to obtain the blog metadata (via the function
  cstu_get_metadata) that includes the plugin's contentstudio_token. Knowing this token allows
  for other interactions with the plugin such as creating posts in versions prior to 1.2.5,
  which added other requirements to posting and updating.
