  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  xprtrdma: Fix cwnd update ordering

  After a reconnect, the reply handler is opening the cwnd (and thus
  enabling more RPC Calls to be sent) /before/ rpcrdma_post_recvs()
  can post enough Receive WRs to receive their replies. This causes an
  RNR and the new connection is lost immediately.

  The race is most clearly exposed when KASAN and disconnect injection
  are enabled. This slows down rpcrdma_rep_create() enough to allow
  the send side to post a bunch of RPC Calls before the Receive
  completion handler can invoke ib_post_recv().
