aliases: []
summary: PHP-Fusion 9.03.50 panels.php is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) via the 'panel_content'
  POST parameter. The application fails to properly sanitize user input before rendering it
  in the browser, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript. This can be exploited by
  submitting crafted input to the 'panel_content' field in panels.php, resulting in execution
  of malicious scripts in the context of the affected site.
