summary: 'Mozilla developers Gabriele Svelto, Yulia Startsev, Andrew McCreight and the Mozilla
  Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 106. Some of these bugs showed
  evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have
  been exploited to run arbitrary code.<br />*Note*: This advisory was added on December 13th,
  2022 after discovering it was inadvertently left out of the original advisory. The fix was
  included in the original release of Firefox 107. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 107.'
