aliases: []
summary: 'Due to the Improper Handling of an Unexpected Data Type in the processing of EVPN
  routes on Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved, an attacker in direct control of
  a BGP client connected to a route reflector, or via a machine in the middle (MITM) attack,
  can send a specific EVPN route contained within a BGP Update, triggering a routing protocol
  daemon (RPD) crash, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Continued receipt and
  processing of these specific EVPN routes could create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS)
  condition. This issue only occurs on BGP route reflectors, only within a BGP EVPN multicast
  environment, and only when one or more BGP clients have ''leave-sync-route-oldstyle'' enabled.
  This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S2; 21.4 versions
  prior to 21.4R2-S2, 21.4R3; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R1-S2, 22.1R3; 22.2 versions prior
  to 22.2R2. Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved 21.3 version 21.3R1-EVO and later versions prior
  to 21.4R3-EVO; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R1-S2-EVO, 22.1R3-EVO; 22.2 versions prior to 22.2R2-EVO.
  This issue does not affect: Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 21.3R1. Juniper Networks
  Junos OS Evolved versions prior to 21.3R1-EVO.'
