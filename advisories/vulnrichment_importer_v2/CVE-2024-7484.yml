summary: The CRM Perks Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due
  to insufficient file validation on the 'handle_uploaded_files' function in versions up to,

  capabilities or above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make
  remote code execution possible.
