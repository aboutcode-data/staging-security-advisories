aliases: []
summary: 'A potential attacker can write one byte by arbitrary address at the time of the PEI
  phase (only during S3 resume boot mode) and influence the subsequent boot stages. This can
  lead to the mitigations bypassing, physical memory contents disclosure, discovery of any secrets
  from any Virtual Machines (VMs) and bypassing memory isolation and confidential computing
  boundaries. Additionally, an attacker can build a payload which can be injected into the SMRAM
  memory. This issue affects: Module name: SbPei SHA256: d827182e5f9b7a9ff0b9d3e232f7cfac43b5237e2681e11f005be627a49283a9
