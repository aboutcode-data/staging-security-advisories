aliases: []
summary: sudo-rs is a memory safe implementation of sudo and su written in Rust. Prior to version
  0.2.6, users with limited sudo privileges (e.g. execution of a single command) can list sudo
  privileges of other users using the `-U` flag. This vulnerability allows users with limited
  sudo privileges to enumerate the sudoers file, revealing sensitive information about other
  users' permissions. Attackers can collect information that can be used to more targeted attacks.
  Systems where users either do not have sudo privileges or have the ability to run all commands
  as root through sudo (the default configuration on most systems) are not affected by this
  advisory. Version 0.2.6 fixes the vulnerability.
