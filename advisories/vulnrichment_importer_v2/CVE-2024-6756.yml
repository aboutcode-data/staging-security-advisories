aliases: []
summary: The Social Auto Poster plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
  due to missing file type validation in the 'wpw_auto_poster_get_image_path' function in all
  versions up to, and including, 5.3.14. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Contributor-level and above permissions, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's
  server which may make remote code execution possible. An attacker can use CVE-2024-6754 to
  exploit with subscriber-level access.
