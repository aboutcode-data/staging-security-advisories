aliases: []
summary: dom-expressions is a Fine-Grained Runtime for Performant DOM Rendering. In affected
  versions the use of javascript's `.replace()` opens up to potential Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
  vulnerabilities with the special replacement patterns beginning with `$`. Particularly, when
  the attributes of `Meta` tag from solid-meta are user-defined, attackers can utilise the special
  replacement patterns, either `$'` or `$\`` to achieve XSS. The solid-meta package has this
  issue since it uses `useAffect` and context providers, which injects the used assets in the
  html header. "dom-expressions" uses `.replace()` to insert the assets, which is vulnerable
  to the special replacement patterns listed above.  This effectively means that if the attributes
  of an asset tag contained user-controlled data, it would be vulnerable to XSS. For instance,
  there might be meta tags for the open graph protocol in a user profile page, but if attackers
  set the user query to some payload abusing `.replace()`, then they could execute arbitrary
  javascript in the victim's web browser. Moreover, it could be stored and cause more problems.
  This issue has been addressed in version 0.39.5 and all users are advised to upgrade. There
  are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
