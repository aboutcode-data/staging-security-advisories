aliases: []
summary: The Premium Age Verification / Restriction for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to arbitrary file read and write due to the existence of an insufficiently protected remote
  support functionality in remote_tunnel.php in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.2. This
  makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read from or write to arbitrary files on
  the affected site's server which may make the exposure of sensitive information or remote
  code execution possible.
