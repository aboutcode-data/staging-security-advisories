aliases: []
summary: OpenProject is an open-source, web-based project management software. Versions prior
  to 16.6.6 and 17.0.2 have an arbitrary file write vulnerability in OpenProject’s repository
  diff download endpoint (`/projects/:project_id/repository/diff.diff`) when rendering a single
  revision via git show. By supplying a specially crafted rev value (for example, `rev=--output=/tmp/poc.txt)`,
  an attacker can inject git show command-line options. When OpenProject executes the SCM command,
  Git interprets the attacker-controlled rev as an option and writes the output to an attacker-chosen
  path. As a result, any user with the `:browse_repository` permission on the project can create
  or overwrite arbitrary files that the OpenProject process user is permitted to write. The
  written contents consist of git show output (commit metadata and patch), but overwriting application
  or configuration files still leads to data loss and denial of service, impacting integrity
  and availability. The issue has been fixed in OpenProject 17.0.2 and 16.6.6.
