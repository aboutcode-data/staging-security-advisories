aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the management access list configuration of Cisco Firepower Threat
  Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured
  management interface access list on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to the configuration
  of different management access lists, with ports allowed in one access list and denied in
  another. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted remote management
  traffic to the local IP address of an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the
  attacker to bypass the configured management access list policies, and traffic to the management
  interface would not be properly denied.
