aliases: []
summary: Azure RTOS USBx is a USB host, device, and on-the-go (OTG) embedded stack, fully integrated
  with Azure RTOS ThreadX and available for all Azure RTOS ThreadX–supported processors. Azure
  RTOS USBX implementation of host support for USB CDC ECM includes an integer underflow and
  a buffer overflow in the `_ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get` function which may be potentially
  exploited to achieve remote code execution or denial of service. Setting mac address string
  descriptor length to a `0` or `1` allows an attacker to introduce an integer underflow followed
  (string_length) by a buffer overflow of the `cdc_ecm -> ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_node_id` array.
  This may allow one to redirect the code execution flow or introduce a denial of service. The
  fix has been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel).
  Improved mac address string descriptor length validation to check for unexpectedly small values
  may be used as a workaround.
