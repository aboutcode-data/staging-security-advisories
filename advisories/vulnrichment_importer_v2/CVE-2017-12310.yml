summary: 'A vulnerability in the auto discovery phase of Cisco Spark Hybrid Calendar Service
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to view sensitive information in the unencrypted
  headers of an HTTP method request. The attacker could use this information to conduct additional
  reconnaissance attacks leading to the disclosure of sensitive customer data. The vulnerability
  exists in the auto discovery phase because an unencrypted HTTP request is made due to requirements
  for implementing the Hybrid Calendar service. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by monitoring the unencrypted traffic on the network. An exploit could allow the attacker
  to access sensitive customer data belonging to Office365 users, such as email and calendar
  events. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg35593.'
