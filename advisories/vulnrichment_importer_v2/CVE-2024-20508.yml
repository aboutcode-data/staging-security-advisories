aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in Cisco Unified Threat Defense (UTD) Snort Intrusion Prevention System\
  \ (IPS) Engine for Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to\
  \ bypass configured security policies or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected\
  \ device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of HTTP requests when\
  \ they are processed by Cisco UTD Snort IPS Engine. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by sending a crafted HTTP request through an affected device. A successful exploit could\
  \ allow the attacker to trigger a reload of the Snort process.  If the action in case of Cisco\
  \ UTD Snort IPS Engine failure is set to the default, fail-open, successful exploitation of\
  \ this vulnerability could allow the attacker to bypass configured security policies. If the\
  \ action in case of Cisco UTD Snort IPS Engine failure is set to fail-close, successful exploitation\
  \ of this vulnerability could cause traffic that is configured to be inspected by Cisco UTD\
  \ Snort IPS Engine to be dropped."
