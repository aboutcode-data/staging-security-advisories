aliases: []
summary: A Stored HTML Injection vulnerability was discovered in the Time Machine Snapshot Diff
  functionality due to improper validation of network traffic data. An unauthenticated attacker
  can send specially crafted network packets at two different times to inject HTML tags into
  asset attributes across two snapshots. Exploitation requires a victim to use the Time Machine
  Snapshot Diff feature on those specific snapshots and perform specific GUI actions, at which
  point the injected HTML renders in their browser, enabling phishing and open redirect attacks.
  Full XSS exploitation is prevented by input validation and Content Security Policy. Attack
  complexity is high due to multiple required conditions.
