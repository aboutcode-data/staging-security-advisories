aliases: []
summary: The LifterLMS – WordPress LMS Plugin for eLearning plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to SQL Injection via the orderBy attribute of the lifterlms_favorites shortcode in all versions
  up to, and including, 7.6.2 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and
  lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into
  already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
