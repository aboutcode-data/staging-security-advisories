aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Unidirectional Link Detection (UDLD) feature of Cisco FXOS
  Software, Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, and Cisco NX-OS
  Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause an affected device to
  reload. This vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the UDLD packets. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending specifically crafted UDLD packets to an affected
  device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload,
  resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Note: The UDLD feature is disabled by default,
  and the conditions to exploit this vulnerability are strict. An attacker must have full control
  of a directly connected device. On Cisco IOS XR devices, the impact is limited to the reload
  of the UDLD process.'
