aliases: []
summary: 'The Angular SSR is a server-rise rendering tool for Angular applications. Versions
  prior to 21.2.0-rc.1, 21.1.5, 20.3.17, and 19.2.21 have a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  vulnerability in the Angular SSR request handling pipeline. The vulnerability exists because
  Angular’s internal URL reconstruction logic directly trusts and consumes user-controlled HTTP
  headers specifically the Host and `X-Forwarded-*` family to determine the application''s base
  origin without any validation of the destination domain. Specifically, the framework didn''t
  have checks for the host domain, path and character sanitization, and port validation. This
  vulnerability manifests in two primary ways: implicit relative URL resolution and explicit
  manual construction. When successfully exploited, this vulnerability allows for arbitrary
  internal request steering. This can lead to credential exfiltration, internal network probing,
  and a confidentiality breach. In order to be vulnerable, the victim application must use Angular
  SSR (Server-Side Rendering), the application must perform `HttpClient` requests using relative
  URLs OR manually construct URLs using the unvalidated `Host` / `X-Forwarded-*` headers using
  the `REQUEST` object, the application server must be reachable by an attacker who can influence
  these headers without strict validation from a front-facing proxy, and the infrastructure
  (Cloud, CDN, or Load Balancer) must not sanitize or validate incoming headers. Versions 21.2.0-rc.1,
  21.1.5, 20.3.17, and 19.2.21 contain a patch. Some workarounds are available. Avoid using
  `req.headers` for URL construction. Instead, use trusted variables for base API paths. Those
  who cannot upgrade immediately should implement a middleware in their `server.ts` to enforce
  numeric ports and validated hostnames.'
