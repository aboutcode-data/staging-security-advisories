aliases: []
summary: The Inpersttion For Theme plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.0 via the theme_section_shortcode() function. This
  is due to the plugin not restricting what functions can be called. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to execute code on the
  server which is limited to arbitrary functions without any user supplied parameters.
