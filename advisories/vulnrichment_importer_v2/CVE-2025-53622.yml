aliases: []
summary: DSpace open source software is a repository application which provides durable access
  to digital resources. Prior to versions 7.6.4, 8.2, and 9.1, a path traversal vulnerability
  is possible during the import of an archive (in Simple Archive Format), either from command-line
  (`./dspace import` command) or from the "Batch Import (Zip)" user interface feature. An attacker
  may craft a malicious Simple Archive Format (SAF) package where the `contents` file references
  any system files (using relative traversal sequences) which are readable by the Tomcat user.  If
  such a package is imported, this will result in sensitive content disclose, including retrieving
  arbitrary files or configurations from the server where DSpace is running. The Simple Archive
  Format (SAF) importer / Batch Import (Zip) is only usable by site administrators (from user
  interface / REST API) or system administrators (from command-line). Therefore, to exploit
  this vulnerability, the malicious payload would have to be provided by an attacker and trusted
  by an administrator (who would trigger the import). The fix is included in DSpace 7.6.4, 8.2
  and 9.1. For those who cannot upgrade immediately, it is possible to manually patch the DSpace
  backend. (No changes are necessary to the frontend.)  A pull request exists which can be used
  to patch systems running DSpace 7.6.x, 8.x or 9.0. Although it is not possible to fully protect
  the system via workarounds, one may can apply a best practice. Administrators must carefully
  inspect any SAF archives (they did not construct themselves) before importing, paying close
  attention to the `contents` file to validate it does not reference files outside of the SAF
  archives.
