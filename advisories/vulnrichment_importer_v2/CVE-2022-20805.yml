aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the automatic decryption process in Cisco Umbrella Secure Web Gateway
  (SWG) could allow an authenticated, adjacent attacker to bypass the SSL decryption and content
  filtering policies on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to how the decryption
  function uses the TLS Sever Name Indication (SNI) extension of an HTTP request to discover
  the destination domain and determine if the request needs to be decrypted. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request over TLS from a client to an unknown
  or controlled URL. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to bypass the decryption process
  of Cisco Umbrella SWG and allow malicious content to be downloaded to a host on a protected
  network. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.
