aliases: []
summary: n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. Prior to versions 2.10.1, 2.9.3,
  and 1.123.22, an authenticated user with permission to create or modify workflows could use
  the Python Code node to escape the sandbox. The sandbox did not sufficiently restrict access
  to certain built-in Python objects, allowing an attacker to exfiltrate file contents or achieve
  RCE. On instances using internal Task Runners (default runner mode), this could result in
  full compromise of the n8n host. On instances using external Task Runners, the attacker might
  gain access to or impact other task executed on the Task Runner. Task Runners must be enabled
  using `N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true`. The issue has been fixed in n8n versions 2.10.1, 2.9.3,
  and 1.123.22. Users should upgrade to this version or later to remediate the vulnerability.
  If upgrading is not immediately possible, administrators should consider the following temporary
  mitigations. Limit workflow creation and editing permissions to fully trusted users only.,
  and/or disable the Code node by adding `n8n-nodes-base.code` to the `NODES_EXCLUDE` environment
  variable. These workarounds do not fully remediate the risk and should only be used as short-term
  mitigation measures.
