aliases: []
summary: Pterodactyl is a free, open-source game server management panel. When a user disables
  two-factor authentication via the Panel, a `DELETE` request with their current password in
  a query parameter will be sent.  While query parameters are encrypted when using TLS, many
  webservers (including ones officially documented for use with Pterodactyl) will log query
  parameters in plain-text, storing a user's password in plain text. Prior to version 1.11.8,
  if a malicious user obtains access to these logs they could potentially authenticate against
  a user's account; assuming they are able to discover the account's email address or username
  separately. This problem has been patched in version 1.11.8. There are no workarounds at this
  time. There is not a direct vulnerability within the software as it relates to logs generated
  by intermediate components such as web servers or Layer 7 proxies. Updating to `v1.11.8` or
  adding the linked patch manually are the only ways to avoid this problem. As this vulnerability
  relates to historical logging of sensitive data, users who have ever disabled 2FA on a Panel
  (self-hosted or operated by a company) should change their passwords and consider enabling
  2FA if it was left disabled. While it's unlikely that their account swill be compromised by
  this vulnerability, it's not impossible. Panel administrators should consider clearing any
  access logs that may contain sensitive data.
