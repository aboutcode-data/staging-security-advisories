aliases: []
summary: Entrust Instant Financial Issuance (IFI) On Premise software (formerly referred to
  as CardWizard) versions 5.x, prior to 6.10.5, and prior to 6.11.1 contain an insecure .NET
  Remoting exposure in the SmartCardController service (DCG.SmartCardControllerService.exe).
  The service registers a TCP remoting channel with unsafe formatter/settings that permit untrusted
  remoting object invocation. A remote, unauthenticated attacker who can reach the remoting
  port can invoke exposed remoting objects to read arbitrary files from the server and coerce
  outbound authentication, and may achieve arbitrary file write and remote code execution via
  known .NET Remoting exploitation techniques. This can lead to disclosure of sensitive installation
  and service-account data and compromise of the affected host.
