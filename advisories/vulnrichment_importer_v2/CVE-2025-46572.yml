aliases: []
summary: passport-wsfed-saml2 provides passport strategy for both WS-fed and SAML2 protocol.
  A vulnerability present starting in version 3.0.5 up to and including version 4.6.3 allows
  an attacker to impersonate any user during SAML authentication by crafting a SAMLResponse.
  This can be done by using a valid SAML object that was signed by the configured IdP. Users
  are affected specifically when the service provider is using passport-wsfed-saml2 and a valid
  SAML document signed by the Identity Provider can be obtained. Version 4.6.4 contains a fix
  for the vulnerability.
