summary: The logic in place to facilitate the update process via the user interface lacks access
  control to verify if permission exists to perform the tasks. Prior to this patch being applied
  it might be possible for an attacker to access the Mautic version number or to execute parts
  of the upgrade process without permission. As upgrading in the user interface is deprecated,
  this functionality is no longer required.
