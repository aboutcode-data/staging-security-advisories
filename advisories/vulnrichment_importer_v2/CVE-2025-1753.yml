aliases: []
summary: LLama-Index CLI version v0.12.20 contains an OS command injection vulnerability. The
  vulnerability arises from the improper handling of the `--files` argument, which is directly
  passed into `os.system`. An attacker who controls the content of this argument can inject
  and execute arbitrary shell commands. This vulnerability can be exploited locally if the attacker
  has control over the CLI arguments, and remotely if a web application calls the LLama-Index
  CLI with a user-controlled filename. This issue can lead to arbitrary code execution on the
  affected system.
