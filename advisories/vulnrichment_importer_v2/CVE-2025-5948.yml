aliases: []
summary: The Service Finder Bookings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
  via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 6.0. This is due to the plugin
  not properly validating a user's identity prior to claiming a business when using the claim_business
  AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to login as any user including
  admins. Please note that subscriber privileges or brute-forcing are needed when completing
  the business takeover. The claim_id is needed to takeover the admin account, but brute-forcing
  is a practical approach to obtaining valid IDs.
