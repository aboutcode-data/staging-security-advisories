aliases: []
summary: The Windows Logon installer prior to 4.1.2 did not properly validate file installation
  paths. This allows an attacker with local user privileges to coerce the installer to write
  to arbitrary privileged directories. If successful, an attacker can manipulate files used
  by Windows Logon, cause Denial of Service (DoS) by deleting file(s), or replace system files
  to potentially achieve elevation of privileges. Note that this can only exploitable during
  new installations while the installer is running and is not exploitable once installation
  is finished. Versions 4.1.2 of Windows Logon addresses this issue.
