aliases: []
summary: Portainer Community Edition is a lightweight service delivery platform for containerized
  applications that can be used to manage Docker, Swarm, Kubernetes and ACI environments. Prior
  to STS version 2.31.0 and LTS version 2.27.7, if a Portainer administrator can be convinced
  to register a malicious container registry, or an existing container registry can be taken
  over, HTTP Headers (including registry authentication credentials or Portainer session tokens)
  may be leaked to that registry. This issue has been patched in STS version 2.31.0 and LTS
  version 2.27.7.
