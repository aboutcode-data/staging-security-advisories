aliases: []
summary: 'RISC Zero is a zero-knowledge verifiable general computing platform based on zk-STARKs
  and the RISC-V microarchitecture. In versions 2.0.2 and below of risc0-zkvm-platform, when
  the zkVM guest calls sys_read, the host is able to use a crafted response to write to an arbitrary
  memory location in the guest. This capability can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code within
  the guest. As sys_read is the mechanism by which input is requested by the guest, all guest
  programs built with the affected versions are vulnerable. This critically compromises the
  soundness guarantees of the guest program. Other affected packages include risc0-aggregation
  versions below 0.9,  risc0-zkos-v1compat below 2.1.0, risc0-zkvm versions between 3.0.0-rc.1
  and 3.0.1. This issue has been fixed in the following versions: risc0-zkvm-platform 2.1.0,
  risc0-zkos-v1compat 2.1.0, risc0-aggregation 0.9, and risc0-zkvm 2.3.2 and 3.0.3.'
