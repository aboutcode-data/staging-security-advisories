aliases: []
summary: python-jwt is a module for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens. Versions prior
  to 3.3.4 are subject to Authentication Bypass by Spoofing, resulting in identity spoofing,
  session hijacking or authentication bypass. An attacker who obtains a JWT can arbitrarily
  forge its contents without knowing the secret key. Depending on the application, this may
  for example enable the attacker to spoof other user's identities, hijack their sessions, or
  bypass authentication. Users should upgrade to version 3.3.4. There are no known workarounds.
