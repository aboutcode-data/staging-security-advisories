summary: 'A vulnerability in the Snort rule evaluation function of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense
  (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service
  (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of the
  DNS reputation enforcement rule. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted
  UDP packets through an affected device to force a buildup of UDP connections. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to cause traffic that is going through the affected device
  to be dropped, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: This vulnerability only affects Cisco FTD
  devices that are running Snort 3.'
