aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOx Application Framework of Cisco 809 Industrial Integrated
  Services Routers (Industrial ISRs), Cisco 829 Industrial ISRs, Cisco CGR 1000 Compute Module,
  and Cisco IC3000 Industrial Compute Gateway could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is
  due to insufficient error handling during packet processing. An attacker could exploit this
  vulnerability by sending a high and sustained rate of crafted TCP traffic to the IOx web server
  on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the IOx web
  server to stop processing requests, resulting in a DoS condition.
