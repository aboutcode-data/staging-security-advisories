  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  nilfs2: protect references to superblock parameters exposed in sysfs

  The superblock buffers of nilfs2 can not only be overwritten at runtime
  for modifications/repairs, but they are also regularly swapped, replaced
  during resizing, and even abandoned when degrading to one side due to
  backing device issues.  So, accessing them requires mutual exclusion using
  the reader/writer semaphore "nilfs->ns_sem".

  Some sysfs attribute show methods read this superblock buffer without the
  necessary mutual exclusion, which can cause problems with pointer
  dereferencing and memory access, so fix it.
