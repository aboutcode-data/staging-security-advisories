aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Cisco REST API virtual service container for Cisco IOS XE Software
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication on the managed Cisco
  IOS XE device. The vulnerability is due to an improper check performed by the area of code
  that manages the REST API authentication service. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by submitting malicious HTTP requests to the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to obtain the token-id of an authenticated user. This token-id could be used
  to bypass authentication and execute privileged actions through the interface of the REST
  API virtual service container on the affected Cisco IOS XE device. The REST API interface
  is not enabled by default and must be installed and activated separately on IOS XE devices.
  See the Details section for more information.
