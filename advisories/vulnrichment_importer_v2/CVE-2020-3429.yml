aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the WPA2 and WPA3 security implementation of Cisco IOS XE Wireless
  Controller Software for the Cisco Catalyst 9000 Family could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent
  attacker to cause denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability
  is due to incorrect packet processing during the WPA2 and WPA3 authentication handshake when
  configured for dot1x or pre-shared key (PSK) authentication key management (AKM) with 802.11r
  BSS Fast Transition (FT) enabled. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
  a crafted authentication packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could cause an
  affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.
