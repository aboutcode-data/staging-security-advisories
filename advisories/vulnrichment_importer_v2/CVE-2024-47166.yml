aliases: []
summary: Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability
  involves a **one-level read path traversal** in the `/custom_component` endpoint. Attackers
  can exploit this flaw to access and leak source code from custom Gradio components by manipulating
  the file path in the request. Although the traversal is limited to a single directory level,
  it could expose proprietary or sensitive code that developers intended to keep private. This
  impacts users who have developed custom Gradio components and are hosting them on publicly
  accessible servers. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>=4.44` to address this issue.
  As a workaround, developers can sanitize the file paths and ensure that components are not
  stored in publicly accessible directories.
