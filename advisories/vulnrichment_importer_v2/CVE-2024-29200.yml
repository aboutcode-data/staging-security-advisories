aliases: []
summary: Kimai is a web-based multi-user time-tracking application. The permission `view_other_timesheet`
  performs differently for the Kimai UI and the API, thus returning unexpected data through
  the API. When setting the `view_other_timesheet` permission to true, on the frontend, users
  can only see timesheet entries for teams they are a part of. When requesting all timesheets
  from the API, however, all timesheet entries are returned, regardless of whether the user
  shares team permissions or not. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.13.0.
