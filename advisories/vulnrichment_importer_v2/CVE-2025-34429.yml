aliases: []
summary: 1Panel versions 1.10.33 - 2.0.15 contain a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability
  in the web port configuration functionality. The port-change endpoint lacks CSRF defenses
  such as anti-CSRF tokens or Origin/Referer validation. An attacker can craft a malicious webpage
  that submits a port-change request; when a victim visits it while authenticated, the browser
  includes valid session cookies and the request succeeds. This allows an attacker to change
  the port on which the 1Panel web service listens, causing loss of access on the original port
  and resulting in service disruption or denial of service, and may unintentionally expose the
  service on an attacker-chosen port.
