aliases: []
summary: This admin plugin for Grav is an HTML user interface that provides a convenient way
  to configure Grav and easily create and modify pages. Prior to 1.11.0-beta.1, a user enumeration
  and email disclosure vulnerability exists in Grav. The "Forgot Password" functionality at
  /admin/forgot leaks information about valid usernames and their associated email addresses
  through distinct server responses. This allows an attacker to enumerate users and disclose
  sensitive email addresses, which can be leveraged for targeted attacks such as password spraying,
  phishing, or social engineering. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.11.0-beta.1.
