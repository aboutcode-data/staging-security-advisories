aliases: []
summary: FUXA is a web-based Process Visualization (SCADA/HMI/Dashboard) software. An authorization
  bypass vulnerability in FUXA allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to modify device tags
  via WebSockets. Exploitation allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass role-based
  access controls and overwrite arbitrary device tags or disable communication drivers, exposing
  connected ICS/SCADA environments to follow-on actions. This may allow an attacker to manipulate
  physical processes and disconnected devices from the HMI. This affects FUXA through version
  1.2.9. This issue has been patched in FUXA version 1.2.10.
