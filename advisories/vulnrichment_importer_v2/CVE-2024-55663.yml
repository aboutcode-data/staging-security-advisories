aliases: []
summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 6.3-milestone-2 and
  prior to versions 13.10.5 and 14.3-rc-1, in `getdocument.vm`; the ordering of the returned
  documents is defined from an unsanitized request parameter (request.sort) and can allow any
  user to inject HQL. Depending on the used database backend, the attacker may be able to not
  only obtain confidential information such as password hashes from the database, but also execute
  UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE queries. This has been patched in 13.10.5 and 14.3-rc-1. There is no
  known workaround, other than upgrading XWiki.
