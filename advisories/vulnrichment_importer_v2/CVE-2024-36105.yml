aliases: []
summary: 'dbt enables data analysts and engineers to transform their data using the same practices
  that software engineers use to build applications. Prior to versions 1.6.15, 1.7.15, and 1.8.1,
  Binding to `INADDR_ANY (0.0.0.0)` or `IN6ADDR_ANY (::)` exposes an application on all network
  interfaces, increasing the risk of unauthorized access. As stated in the Python docs, a special
  form for address is accepted instead of a host address: `''''` represents `INADDR_ANY`, equivalent
  to `"0.0.0.0"`. On systems with IPv6, '''' represents `IN6ADDR_ANY`, which is equivalent to
  `"::"`. A user who serves docs on an unsecured public network, may unknowingly be hosting
  an unsecured (http) web site for any remote user/system to access on the same network. The
  issue has has been mitigated in dbt-core v1.6.15, dbt-core v1.7.15, and dbt-core v1.8.1 by
  binding to localhost explicitly by default in `dbt docs serve`.'
