summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  userfaultfd: fix a race between writeprotect and exit_mmap()

  A race is possible when a process exits, its VMAs are removed by
  exit_mmap() and at the same time userfaultfd_writeprotect() is called.

  The race was detected by KASAN on a development kernel, but it appears
  to be possible on vanilla kernels as well.

  Use mmget_not_zero() to prevent the race as done in other userfaultfd
  operations.
