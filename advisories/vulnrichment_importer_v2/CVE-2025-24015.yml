aliases: []
summary: Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime. Versions 1.46.0 through
  2.1.6 have an issue that affects AES-256-GCM and AES-128-GCM in Deno in which the authentication
  tag is not being validated. This means tampered ciphertexts or incorrect keys might not be
  detected, which breaks the guarantees expected from AES-GCM. Older versions of Deno correctly
  threw errors in such cases, as does Node.js. Without authentication tag verification, AES-GCM
  degrades to essentially CTR mode, removing integrity protection. Authenticated data set with
  set_aad is also affected, as it is incorporated into the GCM hash (ghash) but this too is
  not validated, rendering AAD checks ineffective. Version 2.1.7 includes a patch that addresses
  this issue.
