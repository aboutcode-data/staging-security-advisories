summary: A vulnerability in the interprocess communication (IPC) channel of Cisco AnyConnect
  Secure Mobility Client for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform
  a DLL hijacking attack. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid
  credentials on the Windows system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of
  resources that are loaded by the application at run time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a crafted IPC message to the AnyConnect process. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected machine with SYSTEM privileges. To
  exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials on the Windows
  system.
