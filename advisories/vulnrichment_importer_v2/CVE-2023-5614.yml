aliases: []
summary: The Theme Switcha plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the plugin's 'theme_switcha_list' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 3.3
  due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This
  makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions
  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page.
