aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the update process of Docker Desktop for Windows versions prior
  to 4.41.0 could allow a local, low-privileged attacker to escalate privileges to SYSTEM. During
  an update, Docker Desktop attempts to delete files and subdirectories under the path C:\ProgramData\Docker\config
  with high privileges. However, this directory often does not exist by default, and C:\ProgramData\
  allows normal users to create new directories. By creating a malicious Docker\config folder
  structure at this location, an attacker can force the privileged update process to delete
  or manipulate arbitrary system files, leading to Elevation of Privilege.
