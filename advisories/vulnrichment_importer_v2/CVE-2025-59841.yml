aliases: []
summary: Flag Forge is a Capture The Flag (CTF) platform. In versions from 2.2.0 to before 2.3.1,
  the FlagForge web application improperly handles session invalidation. Authenticated users
  can continue to access protected endpoints, such as /api/profile, even after logging out.
  CSRF tokens are also still valid post-logout, which can allow unauthorized actions. This issue
  has been patched in version 2.3.1.
