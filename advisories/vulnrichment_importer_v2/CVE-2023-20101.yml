summary: "A vulnerability in Cisco Emergency Responder could allow an unauthenticated, remote\
  \ attacker to log in to an affected device using the root account, which has default, static\
  \ credentials that cannot be changed or deleted.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to the presence\
  \ of static user credentials for the root account that are typically reserved for use during\
  \ development. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the account to log in\
  \ to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to log in to the affected\
  \ system and execute arbitrary commands as the root user."
