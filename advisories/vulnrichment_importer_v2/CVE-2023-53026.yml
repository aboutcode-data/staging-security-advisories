  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  RDMA/core: Fix ib block iterator counter overflow

  When registering a new DMA MR after selecting the best aligned page size
  for it, we iterate over the given sglist to split each entry to smaller,
  aligned to the selected page size, DMA blocks.

  In given circumstances where the sg entry and page size fit certain
  sizes and the sg entry is not aligned to the selected page size, the
  total size of the aligned pages we need to cover the sg entry is >= 4GB.
  Under this circumstances, while iterating page aligned blocks, the
  counter responsible for counting how much we advanced from the start of
  the sg entry is overflowed because its type is u32 and we pass 4GB in
  size. This can lead to an infinite loop inside the iterator function
  because the overflow prevents the counter to be larger
  than the size of the sg entry.

  Fix the presented problem by changing the advancement condition to
  eliminate overflow.
