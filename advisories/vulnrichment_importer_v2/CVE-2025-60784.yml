aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the XiaozhangBang Voluntary Like System V8.8 allows remote attackers
  to manipulate the zhekou parameter in the /topfirst.php Pay module, enabling unauthorized
  discounts. By sending a crafted HTTP POST request with zhekou set to an abnormally low value,
  an attacker can purchase votes at a reduced cost. Furthermore, by modifying the zid parameter,
  attackers can influence purchases made by other users, amplifying the impact. This issue stems
  from insufficient server-side validation of these parameters, potentially leading to economic
  loss and unfair manipulation of vote counts.
