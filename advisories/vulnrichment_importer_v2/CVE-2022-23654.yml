aliases: []
summary: Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. In affected versions an authenticated user
  with write access on a restricted set of paths can update a page outside the allowed paths
  by specifying a different target page ID while keeping the path intact. The access control
  incorrectly check the path access against the user-provided values instead of the actual path
  associated to the page ID. Commit https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/commit/411802ec2f654bb5ed1126c307575b81e2361c6b
  fixes this vulnerability by checking access control on the path associated with the page ID
  instead of the user-provided value. When the path is different than the current value, a second
  access control check is then performed on the user-provided path before the move operation.
