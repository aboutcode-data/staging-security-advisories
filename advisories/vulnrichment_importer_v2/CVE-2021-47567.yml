  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  powerpc/32: Fix hardlockup on vmap stack overflow

  Since the commit c118c7303ad5 ("powerpc/32: Fix vmap stack - Do not
  activate MMU before reading task struct") a vmap stack overflow
  results in a hard lockup. This is because emergency_ctx is still
  addressed with its virtual address allthough data MMU is not active
  anymore at that time.

  Fix it by using a physical address instead.
