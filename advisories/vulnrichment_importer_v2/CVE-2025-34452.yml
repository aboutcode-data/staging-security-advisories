aliases: []
summary: Streama versions 1.10.0 through 1.10.5 and prior to commit b7c8767 contain a combination
  of path traversal and server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities in that allow an
  authenticated attacker to write arbitrary files to the server filesystem. The issue exists
  in the subtitle download functionality, where user-controlled parameters are used to fetch
  remote content and construct file paths without proper validation. By supplying a crafted
  subtitle download URL and a path traversal sequence in the file name, an attacker can write
  files to arbitrary locations on the server, potentially leading to remote code execution.
