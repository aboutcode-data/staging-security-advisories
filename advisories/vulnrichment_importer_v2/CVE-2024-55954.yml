aliases: []
summary: OpenObserve is a cloud-native observability platform. A vulnerability in the user management
  endpoint `/api/{org_id}/users/{email_id}` allows an "Admin" role user to remove a "Root" user
  from the organization. This violates the intended privilege hierarchy, enabling a non-root
  user to remove the highest-privileged account. Due to insufficient role checks, the `remove_user_from_org`
  function does not prevent an "Admin" user from removing a "Root" user. As a result, an attacker
  with an "Admin" role can remove critical "Root" users, potentially gaining effective full
  control by eliminating the highest-privileged accounts. The `DELETE /api/{org_id}/users/{email_id}`
  endpoint is affected. This issue has been addressed in release version `0.14.1` and all users
  are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
