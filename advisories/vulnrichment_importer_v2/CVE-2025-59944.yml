aliases: []
summary: Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. Versions 1.6.23 and below contain
  case-sensitive checks in the way Cursor IDE protects its sensitive files (e.g., */.cursor/mcp.json),
  which allows attackers to modify the content of these files through prompt injection and achieve
  remote code execution. A prompt injection can lead to full RCE through modifying sensitive
  files on case-insensitive fileystems. This issue is fixed in version 1.7.
