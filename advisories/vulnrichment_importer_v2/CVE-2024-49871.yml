  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  Input: adp5589-keys - fix NULL pointer dereference

  We register a devm action to call adp5589_clear_config() and then pass
  the i2c client as argument so that we can call i2c_get_clientdata() in
  order to get our device object. However, i2c_set_clientdata() is only
  being set at the end of the probe function which means that we'll get a
  NULL pointer dereference in case the probe function fails early.
