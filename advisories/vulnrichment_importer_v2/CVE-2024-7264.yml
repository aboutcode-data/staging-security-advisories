aliases: []
summary: |
  libcurl's ASN1 parser code has the `GTime2str()` function, used for parsing an
  ASN.1 Generalized Time field. If given an syntactically incorrect field, the
  parser might end up using -1 for the length of the *time fraction*, leading to
  a `strlen()` getting performed on a pointer to a heap buffer area that is not
  (purposely) null terminated.

  This flaw most likely leads to a crash, but can also lead to heap contents
  getting returned to the application when
  [CURLINFO_CERTINFO](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLINFO_CERTINFO.html) is used.
