aliases: []
summary: node-jose is a JavaScript implementation of the JSON Object Signing and Encryption
  (JOSE) for web browsers and node.js-based servers. Prior to version 2.2.0, when using the
  non-default "fallback" crypto back-end, ECC operations in `node-jose` can trigger a Denial-of-Service
  (DoS) condition, due to a possible infinite loop in an internal calculation.  For some ECC
  operations, this condition is triggered randomly; for others, it can be triggered by malicious
  input. The issue has been patched in version 2.2.0. Since this issue is only present in the
  "fallback" crypto implementation, it can be avoided by ensuring that either WebCrypto or the
  Node `crypto` module is available in the JS environment where `node-jose` is being run.
