aliases: []
summary: Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool with topic-based threading that combines
  email and chat. When displaying messages with embedded remote images, Zulip normally loads
  the image preview via a go-camo proxy server. However, an attacker who can send messages could
  include a crafted URL that tricks the server into embedding a remote image reference directly.
  This could allow the attacker to infer the viewer’s IP address and browser fingerprinting
  information. This vulnerability is fixed in Zulip Server 5.6. Zulip organizations with image
  and link previews [disabled](https://zulip.com/help/allow-image-link-previews) are not affected.
