aliases: []
summary: The OMGF | GDPR/DSGVO Compliant, Faster Google Fonts. Easy. plugin for WordPress is
  vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data and Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to a missing
  capability check on the update_settings() function hooked via admin_init in all versions up
  to, and including, 5.7.9. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the
  plugin's settings which can be used to inject Cross-Site Scripting payloads and delete entire
  directories. PLease note there were several attempted patched, and we consider 5.7.10 to be
  the most sufficiently patched.
