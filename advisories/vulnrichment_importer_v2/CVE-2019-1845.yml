aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the authentication service of the Cisco Unified Communications Manager
  IM and Presence (Unified CM IM&amp;P) Service, Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server
  (VCS), and Cisco Expressway Series could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause
  a service outage for users attempting to authenticate, resulting in a denial of service (DoS)
  condition. The vulnerability is due to insufficient controls for specific memory operations.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed Extensible Messaging and
  Presence Protocol (XMPP) authentication request to an affected system. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected restart of the authentication service, preventing
  users from successfully authenticating. Exploitation of this vulnerability does not impact
  users who were authenticated prior to an attack.
