aliases: []
summary: Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance proxy. In versions prior to 1.22.1 secompressors
  accumulate decompressed data into an intermediate buffer before overwriting the body in the
  decode/encodeBody. This may allow an attacker to zip bomb the decompressor by sending a small
  highly compressed payload. Maliciously constructed zip files may exhaust system memory and
  cause a denial of service. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may consider
  disabling decompression.
