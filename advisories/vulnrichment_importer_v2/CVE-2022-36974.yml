aliases: []
summary: This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations
  of Ivanti Avalanche 6.3.2.3490. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability,
  the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the
  Web File Server service. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied
  data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this
  vulnerability to execute code in the context of the service account. Was ZDI-CAN-15330.
