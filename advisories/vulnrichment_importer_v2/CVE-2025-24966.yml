aliases: []
summary: reNgine is an automated reconnaissance framework for web applications. HTML Injection
  occurs when an application improperly validates or sanitizes user inputs, allowing attackers
  to inject arbitrary HTML code. In this scenario, the vulnerability exists in the "Add Target"
  functionality of the application, where the Target Organization and Target Description fields
  accept HTML payloads. The injected HTML is rendered and executed in the target area, potentially
  leading to malicious actions. Exploitation of HTML Injection can compromise the application's
  integrity and user trust. Attackers can execute unauthorized actions, steal sensitive information,
  or trick users into performing harmful actions. The organization's reputation, customer trust,
  and regulatory compliance could be negatively affected. This issue affects all versions up
  to and including 2.2.0. Users are advised to monitor the project for future releases which
  address this issue. There are no known workarounds.
