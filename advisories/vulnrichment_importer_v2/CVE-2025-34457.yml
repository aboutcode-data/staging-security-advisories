aliases: []
summary: wb2osz/direwolf (Dire Wolf) versions up to and including 1.8, prior to commit 694c954,
  contain a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the function kiss_rec_byte() located
  in src/kiss_frame.c. When processing crafted KISS frames that reach the maximum allowed frame
  length (MAX_KISS_LEN), the function appends a terminating FEND byte without reserving sufficient
  space in the stack buffer. This results in an out-of-bounds write followed by an out-of-bounds
  read during the subsequent call to kiss_unwrap(), leading to stack memory corruption or application
  crashes. This vulnerability may allow remote unauthenticated attackers to trigger a denial-of-service
  condition.
