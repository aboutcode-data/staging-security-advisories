aliases: []
summary: Discourse is an option source discussion platform. Prior to version 2.8.14 on the `stable`
  branch and version 3.0.0.beta16 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, pending post titles
  can be used for cross-site scripting attacks. Pending posts can be created by unprivileged
  users when a category has the "require moderator approval of all new topics" setting set.
  This vulnerability can lead to a full XSS on sites which have modified or disabled Discourse’s
  default Content Security Policy. A patch is available in versions 2.8.14 and 3.0.0.beta16.
