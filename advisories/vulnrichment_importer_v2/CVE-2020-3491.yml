aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage
  Director could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges to conduct
  a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface on an affected device.
  The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate
  user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious data
  into a specific data field in the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based
  information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have administrative
  privileges on the affected device.
