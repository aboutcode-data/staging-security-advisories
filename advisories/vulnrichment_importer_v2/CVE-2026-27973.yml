summary: Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. A stored cross-site scripting
  (XSS) vulnerability exists in versions prior to 0.12.0-beta of the Audiobookshelf mobile application
  that allows arbitrary JavaScript execution through malicious library metadata. Attackers with
  library modification privileges can execute code in victim users' browsers/WebViews, potentially
  leading to session hijacking, data exfiltration, and unauthorized access to native device
  APIs. The issue is fixed in audiobookshelf-app version 0.12.0-beta, corresponding to audiobookshelf
  version 2.12.0.
