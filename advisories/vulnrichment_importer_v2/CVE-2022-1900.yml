summary: The Copify plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions
  up to, and including, 1.3.0. This is due to missing nonce validation on the CopifySettings
  page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugins settings
  and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
