  usb: isp1760: Fix out-of-bounds array access

  Running the driver through kasan gives an interesting splat:

    BUG: KASAN: global-out-of-bounds in isp1760_register+0x180/0x70c
    Read of size 20 at addr f1db2e64 by task swapper/0/1
    (...)
    isp1760_register from isp1760_plat_probe+0x1d8/0x220
    (...)

  This happens because the loop reading the regmap fields for the
  different ISP1760 variants look like this:

    for (i = 0; i < HC_FIELD_MAX; i++) { ... }

  Meaning it expects the arrays to be at least HC_FIELD_MAX - 1 long.

  However the arrays isp1760_hc_reg_fields[], isp1763_hc_reg_fields[],
  isp1763_hc_volatile_ranges[] and isp1763_dc_volatile_ranges[] are
  dynamically sized during compilation.

  Fix this by putting an empty assignment to the [HC_FIELD_MAX]
  and [DC_FIELD_MAX] array member at the end of each array.
  This will make the array one member longer than it needs to be,
  but avoids the risk of overwriting whatever is inside
  [HC_FIELD_MAX - 1] and is simple and intuitive to read. Also
  add comments explaining what is going on.
