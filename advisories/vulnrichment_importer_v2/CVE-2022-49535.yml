  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  scsi: lpfc: Fix null pointer dereference after failing to issue FLOGI and PLOGI

  If lpfc_issue_els_flogi() fails and returns non-zero status, the node
  reference count is decremented to trigger the release of the nodelist
  structure. However, if there is a prior registration or dev-loss-evt work
  pending, the node may be released prematurely.  When dev-loss-evt
  completes, the released node is referenced causing a use-after-free null
  pointer dereference.

  Similarly, when processing non-zero ELS PLOGI completion status in
  lpfc_cmpl_els_plogi(), the ndlp flags are checked for a transport
  registration before triggering node removal.  If dev-loss-evt work is
  pending, the node may be released prematurely and a subsequent call to
  lpfc_dev_loss_tmo_handler() results in a use after free ndlp dereference.

  Add test for pending dev-loss before decrementing the node reference count
  for FLOGI, PLOGI, PRLI, and ADISC handling.
