aliases: []
summary: HyperKit is a toolkit for embedding hypervisor capabilities in an application. In versions
  0.20210107, function `pci_vtsock_proc_tx` in `virtio-sock` can lead to to uninitialized memory
  use. In this situation, there is a check for the return value to be less or equal to `VTSOCK_MAXSEGS`,
  but that check is not sufficient because the function can return `-1` if it finds an error
  it cannot recover from. Moreover, the negative return value will be used by `iovec_pull` in
  a while condition that can further lead to more corruption because the function is not designed
  to handle a negative `iov_len`. This issue may lead to a guest crashing the host causing a
  denial of service and, under certain circumstance, memory corruption. This issue is fixed
  in commit af5eba2360a7351c08dfd9767d9be863a50ebaba.
