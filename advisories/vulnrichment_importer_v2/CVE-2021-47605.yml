  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  vduse: fix memory corruption in vduse_dev_ioctl()

  The "config.offset" comes from the user.  There needs to a check to
  prevent it being out of bounds.  The "config.offset" and
  "dev->config_size" variables are both type u32.  So if the offset if
  out of bounds then the "dev->config_size - config.offset" subtraction
  results in a very high u32 value.  The out of bounds offset can result
  in memory corruption.
