aliases: []
summary: Pimcore is an Open Source Data & Experience Management Platform. Pimcore offers developers
  listing classes to make querying data easier. This listing classes also allow to order or
  group the results based on one or more columns which should be quoted by default. The actual
  issue is that quoting is not done properly in both cases, so there's the theoretical possibility
  to inject custom SQL if the developer is using this methods with input data and not doing
  proper input validation in advance and so relies on the auto-quoting being done by the listing
  classes. This issue has been resolved in version 10.4.4. Users are advised to upgrade or to
  apple the patch manually. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
