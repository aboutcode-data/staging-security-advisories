aliases: []
summary: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. Under certain scenarios, Grappler
  component of TensorFlow can trigger a null pointer dereference. There are 2 places where this
  can occur, for the same malicious alteration of a `SavedModel` file (fixing the first one
  would trigger the same dereference in the second place). First, during constant folding, the
  `GraphDef` might not have the required nodes for the binary operation. If a node is missing,
  the correposning `mul_*child` would be null, and the dereference in the subsequent line would
  be incorrect. We have a similar issue during `IsIdentityConsumingSwitch`. The fix will be
  included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow
  2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
