  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  fbdev: Fix invalid page access after closing deferred I/O devices

  When a fbdev with deferred I/O is once opened and closed, the dirty
  pages still remain queued in the pageref list, and eventually later
  those may be processed in the delayed work.  This may lead to a
  corruption of pages, hitting an Oops.

  This patch makes sure to cancel the delayed work and clean up the
  pageref list at closing the device for addressing the bug.  A part of
  the cleanup code is factored out as a new helper function that is
  called from the common fb_release().
