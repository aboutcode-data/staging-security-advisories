aliases: []
summary: 'OpenTelemetry dotnet is a dotnet telemetry framework. In affected versions of `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http`
  and `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` the `url.full` writes attribute/tag on spans
  (`Activity`) when tracing is enabled for outgoing http requests and `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore`
  writes the `url.query` attribute/tag on spans (`Activity`) when tracing is enabled for incoming
  http requests. These attributes are defined by the Semantic Conventions for HTTP Spans. Up
  until version `1.8.1` the values written by `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` & `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore`
  will pass-through the raw query string as was sent or received (respectively). This may lead
  to sensitive information (e.g. EUII - End User Identifiable Information, credentials, etc.)
  being leaked into telemetry backends (depending on the application(s) being instrumented)
  which could cause privacy and/or security incidents. Note: Older versions of `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http`
  & `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` may use different tag names but have the same
  vulnerability. The `1.8.1` versions of `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` & `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore`
  will now redact by default all values detected on transmitted or received query strings. Users
  are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.'
