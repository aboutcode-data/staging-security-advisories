aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based user interface (web UI) of Cisco IOS XE Software could
  allow an authenticated, remote attacker with read-only privileges to inject IOS commands to
  an affected device. The injected commands should require a higher privilege level in order
  to be executed. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of specific HTTP
  requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to
  a specific web UI endpoint on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to inject IOS commands to the affected device, which could allow the attacker to alter the
  configuration of the device or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.
