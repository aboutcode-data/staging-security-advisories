summary: The commit 3730880 (April 2023) and v.0.9-beta1 of gugoan Economizzer has a user enumeration
  vulnerability in the login and forgot password functionalities. The app reacts differently
  when a user or email address is valid, and when it's not. This may allow an attacker to determine
  whether a user or email address is valid, or brute force valid usernames and email addresses.
