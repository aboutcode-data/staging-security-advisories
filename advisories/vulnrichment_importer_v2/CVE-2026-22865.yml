aliases: []
summary: Gradle is a build automation tool, and its native-platform tool provides Java bindings
  for native APIs. When resolving dependencies in versions before 9.3.0, some exceptions were
  not treated as fatal errors and would not cause a repository to be disabled. If a build encountered
  one of these exceptions, Gradle would continue to the next repository in the list and potentially
  resolve dependencies from a different repository. An exception like NoHttpResponseException
  can indicate transient errors. If the errors persist after a maximum number of retries, Gradle
  would continue to the next repository. This behavior could allow an attacker to disrupt the
  service of a repository and leverage another repository to serve malicious artifacts. This
  attack requires the attacker to have control over a repository after the disrupted repository.
  Gradle has introduced a change in behavior in Gradle 9.3.0 to stop searching other repositories
  when encountering these errors.
