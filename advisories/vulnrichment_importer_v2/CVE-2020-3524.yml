aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS XE ROM Monitor (ROMMON) Software for Cisco 4000 Series
  Integrated Services Routers, Cisco ASR 920 Series Aggregation Services Routers, Cisco ASR
  1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers, and Cisco cBR-8 Converged Broadband Routers could
  allow an unauthenticated, physical attacker to break the chain of trust and load a compromised
  software image on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to the presence of a debugging
  configuration option in the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by connecting to an affected device through the console, forcing the device into ROMMON mode,
  and writing a malicious pattern using that specific option on the device. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to break the chain of trust and load a compromised software image
  on the affected device. A compromised software image is any software image that has not been
  digitally signed by Cisco.
