datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2025-55130
datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2025/55xxx/CVE-2025-55130.json
aliases: []
summary: |
  A flaw in Node.js’s Permissions model allows attackers to bypass `--allow-fs-read` and `--allow-fs-write` restrictions using crafted relative symlink paths. By chaining directories and symlinks, a script granted access only to the current directory can escape the allowed path and read sensitive files. This breaks the expected isolation guarantees and enables arbitrary file read/write, leading to potential system compromise.
  This vulnerability affects users of the permission model on Node.js v20,  v22,  v24, and v25.
