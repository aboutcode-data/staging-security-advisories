summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  PCI: endpoint: pci-epf-test: Make use of cached 'epc_features' in pci_epf_test_core_init()

  Instead of getting the epc_features from pci_epc_get_features() API, use
  the cached pci_epf_test::epc_features value to avoid the NULL check. Since
  the NULL check is already performed in pci_epf_test_bind(), having one more
  check in pci_epf_test_core_init() is redundant and it is not possible to
  hit the NULL pointer dereference.

  Also with commit a01e7214bef9 ("PCI: endpoint: Remove "core_init_notifier"
  flag"), 'epc_features' got dereferenced without the NULL check, leading to
  the following false positive Smatch warning:

    drivers/pci/endpoint/functions/pci-epf-test.c:784 pci_epf_test_core_init() error: we previously assumed 'epc_features' could be null (see line 747)

  Thus, remove the redundant NULL check and also use the epc_features::
  {msix_capable/msi_capable} flags directly to avoid local variables.
