aliases: []
summary: A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in the parisneo/lollms-webui, specifically
  within the 'open_file' module, version 9.5. The vulnerability arises due to improper neutralization
  of special elements used in a command within the 'open_file' function. An attacker can exploit
  this vulnerability by crafting a malicious file path that, when processed by the 'open_file'
  function, executes arbitrary system commands or reads sensitive file content. This issue is
  present in the code where subprocess.Popen is used unsafely to open files based on user-supplied
  paths without adequate validation, leading to potential command injection.
