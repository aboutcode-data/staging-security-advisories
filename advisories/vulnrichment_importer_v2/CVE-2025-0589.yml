aliases: []
summary: In affected versions of Octopus Deploy where customers are using Active Directory for
  authentication it was possible for an unauthenticated user to make an API request against
  two endpoints which would retrieve some data from the associated Active Directory. The requests
  when crafted correctly would return specific information from user profiles (Email address/UPN
  and Display name) from one endpoint and group information ( Group ID and Display name) from
  the other. This vulnerability does not expose data within the Octopus Server product itself.
