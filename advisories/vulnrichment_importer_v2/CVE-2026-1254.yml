aliases: []
summary: The Modula Image Gallery – Photo Grid & Video Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to authorization bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.13.6. This is due to the plugin
  not properly verifying that a user is authorized to modify specific posts before updating
  them via the REST API. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor
  level access and above, to update the title, excerpt, and content of arbitrary posts by passing
  post IDs in the modulaImages field when editing a gallery.
