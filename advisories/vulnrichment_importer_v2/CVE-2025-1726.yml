aliases: []
summary: There is a SQL injection issue in Esri ArcGIS Monitor versions 2023.0 through 2024.x
  on Windows and Linux that allows a remote, authenticated attacker with low privileges to improperly
  read limited database schema information by passing crafted queries. While it is possible
  to enumerate some internal database identifiers, the impact to the confidentiality vector
  is "LOW' because any sensitive data returned in a response is encrypted. There is no evidence
  of impact to the integrity or availability vectors. This issue is addressed in ArcGIS Monitor
  2024.1.
