aliases: []
summary: The Paid Memberships Pro – Content Restriction, User Registration, & Paid Subscriptions
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and
  including, 2.12.10. This is due to missing nonce validation on the pmpro_lifter_save_streamline_option()
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to enable the streamline setting
  with Lifter LMS via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
  an action such as clicking on a link.
