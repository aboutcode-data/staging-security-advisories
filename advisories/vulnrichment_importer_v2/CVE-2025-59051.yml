summary: The FreePBX Endpoint Manager module includes a Network Scanning feature that provides
  web-based access to nmap functionality for network device discovery. In Endpoint Manager 16
  before 16.0.92 and 17 before 17.0.6, insufficiently sanitized user-supplied input allows authenticated
  OS command execution as the asterisk user. Authentication with a known username is required.
