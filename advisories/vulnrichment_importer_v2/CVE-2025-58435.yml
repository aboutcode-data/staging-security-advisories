aliases: []
summary: Open OnDemand is an open-source HPC portal. Prior to versions 3.1.15 and 4.0.7, noVNC
  interactive applications did not correctly rotate the password when TurboVNC was higher than
  version 3.1.2. The likelihood of exploitation is low as a user would need to share their link
  to an active desktop session and the other user would need to be authenticated to the portal.
  But obtaining the link would allow that user to perform any actions as the original user and
  access their data. Open OnDemand 3.1.15 and 4.0.7 have patched this vulnerability and correctly
  rotate passwords for any version of TurboVNC. As a workaround, downgrade TurboVNC to a version
  lower than 3.1.2.
