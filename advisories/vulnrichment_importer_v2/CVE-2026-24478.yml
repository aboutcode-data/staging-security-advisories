aliases: []
summary: AnythingLLM is an application that turns pieces of content into context that any LLM
  can use as references during chatting. Prior to version 1.10.0, a critical Path Traversal
  vulnerability in the DrupalWiki integration allows a malicious admin (or an attacker who can
  convince an admin to configure a malicious DrupalWiki URL) to write arbitrary files to the
  server. This can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) by overwriting configuration files or
  writing executable scripts. Version 1.10.0 fixes the issue.
