aliases: []
summary: Zulip is an open source team chat tool. Due to an incorrect authorization check in
  Zulip Server 5.4 and earlier, a member of an organization could craft an API call that grants
  organization administrator privileges to one of their bots. The vulnerability is fixed in
  Zulip Server 5.5. Members who don’t own any bots, and lack permission to create them, can’t
  exploit the vulnerability. As a workaround for the vulnerability, an organization administrator
  can restrict the `Who can create bots` permission to administrators only, and change the ownership
  of existing bots.
