summary: 'Serv-U web login screen to LDAP authentication was allowing characters that were not
  sufficiently sanitized. SolarWinds has updated the input mechanism to perform additional validation
  and sanitization. Please Note: No downstream affect has been detected as the LDAP servers
  ignored improper characters. To insure proper input validation is completed in all environments.
