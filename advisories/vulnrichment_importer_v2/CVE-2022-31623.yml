aliases: []
summary: 'MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. In extra/mariabackup/ds_compress.cc,
  when an error occurs (i.e., going to the err label) while executing the method create_worker_threads,
  the held lock thd->ctrl_mutex is not released correctly, which allows local users to trigger
  a denial of service due to the deadlock. Note: The vendor argues this is just an improper
  locking bug and not a vulnerability with adverse effects.'
