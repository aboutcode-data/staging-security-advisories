aliases: []
summary: A buffer overflow was discovered in Progress DataDirect Connect for ODBC before 08.02.2770
  for Oracle. An overly large value for certain options of a connection string may overrun the
  buffer allocated to process the string value. This allows an attacker to execute code of their
  choice on an affected host by copying carefully selected data that will be executed as code.
