aliases: []
summary: strongSwan before 5.9.8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service in the
  revocation plugin by sending a crafted end-entity (and intermediate CA) certificate that contains
  a CRL/OCSP URL that points to a server (under the attacker's control) that doesn't properly
  respond but (for example) just does nothing after the initial TCP handshake, or sends an excessive
  amount of application data.
