aliases: []
summary: Fastify is a web framework with minimal overhead and plugin architecture. The attacker
  can use the incorrect `Content-Type` to bypass the `Pre-Flight` checking of `fetch`. `fetch()`
  requests with Content-Type’s essence as "application/x-www-form-urlencoded", "multipart/form-data",
  or "text/plain", could potentially be used to invoke routes that only accepts `application/json`
  content type, thus bypassing any CORS protection, and therefore they could lead to a Cross-Site
  Request Forgery attack. This issue has been patched in version 4.10.2 and 3.29.4. As a workaround,
  implement Cross-Site Request Forgery protection using `@fastify/csrf'.
