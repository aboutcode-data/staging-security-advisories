aliases: []
summary: The WCFM Membership – WooCommerce Memberships for Multivendor Marketplace plugin for
  WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object References in versions up to, and including,
  2.10.7. This is due to the plugin providing user-controlled access to objects, letting a user
  bypass authorization and access system resources. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to change user passwords and potentially take over administrator accounts.
