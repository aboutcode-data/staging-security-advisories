aliases: []
summary: The Blocksy theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the
  plugin's blocks in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.26 due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping on user supplied attributes like 'className' and 'radius'. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject
  arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
