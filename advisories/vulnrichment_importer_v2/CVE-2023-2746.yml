aliases: []
summary: "The Rockwell Automation Enhanced HIM software contains \n\nan API that the application\
  \ uses that is not protected sufficiently and uses incorrect Cross-Origin Resource Sharing\
  \ (CORS) settings and, as a result, is vulnerable to a Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack.\
  \ To exploit this vulnerability, a malicious user would have to convince a user to click on\
  \ an untrusted link through a social engineering attack or successfully perform a Cross Site\
  \ Scripting Attack (XSS). Exploitation of a CSRF could potentially lead to sensitive information\
  \ disclosure and full remote access to the affected products."
