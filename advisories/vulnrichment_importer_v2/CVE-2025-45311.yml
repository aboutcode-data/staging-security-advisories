summary: 'Insecure permissions in fail2ban-client v0.11.2 allows attackers with limited sudo
  privileges to perform arbitrary operations as root. NOTE: this is disputed by multiple parties
  because the action for a triggered rule can legitimately be an arbitrary operation as root.
  Thus, the software is behaving in accordance with its intended privilege model.'
