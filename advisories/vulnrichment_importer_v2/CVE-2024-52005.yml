aliases: []
summary: Git is a source code management tool. When cloning from a server (or fetching, or pushing),
  informational or error messages are transported from the remote Git process to the client
  via the so-called "sideband channel". These messages will be prefixed with "remote:" and printed
  directly to the standard error output. Typically, this standard error output is connected
  to a terminal that understands ANSI escape sequences, which Git did not protect against. Most
  modern terminals support control sequences that can be used by a malicious actor to hide and
  misrepresent information, or to mislead the user into executing untrusted scripts. As requested
  on the git-security mailing list, the patches are under discussion on the public mailing list.
  Users are advised to update as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade should avoid recursive
  clones unless they are from trusted sources.
