datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2025-62786

aliases: []
summary: Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and
  response. A heap-based out-of-bounds WRITE occurs in decode_win_permissions, resulting in
  writing a NULL byte 2 bytes before the start of the buffer allocated to decoded_it. A compromised
  agent can potentially leverage this issue to perform remote code execution, by sending a specially
  crafted message to the wazuh manager. An attacker who is able to craft and send an agent message
  to the wazuh manager can leverage this issue to potentially achieve remote code execution
  on the wazuh manager (the exploitability of this vulnerability depends on the specifics of
  the respective heap allocator). This vulnerability is fixed in 4.10.2.
