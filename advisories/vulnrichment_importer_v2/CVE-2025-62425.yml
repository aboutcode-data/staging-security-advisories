summary: MAS (Matrix Authentication Service) is a user management and authentication service
  for Matrix homeservers, written and maintained by Element. A logic flaw in matrix-authentication-service

  sensitive operations without entering the current password. These include changing the current
  password, adding or removing an e-mail address and deactivating the account. The vulnerability
  only affects instances which have the local password database feature enabled (passwords section
  in the config). Patched in matrix-authentication-service 1.4.1.
