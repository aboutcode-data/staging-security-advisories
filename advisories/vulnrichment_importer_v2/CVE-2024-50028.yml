aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  thermal: core: Reference count the zone in thermal_zone_get_by_id()

  There are places in the thermal netlink code where nothing prevents
  the thermal zone object from going away while being accessed after it
  has been returned by thermal_zone_get_by_id().

  To address this, make thermal_zone_get_by_id() get a reference on the
  thermal zone device object to be returned with the help of get_device(),
  under thermal_list_lock, and adjust all of its callers to this change
  with the help of the cleanup.h infrastructure.
