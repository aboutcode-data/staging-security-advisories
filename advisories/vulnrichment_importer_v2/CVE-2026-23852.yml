aliases: []
summary: SiYuan is a personal knowledge management system. Versions prior to 3.5.4 have a stored
  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML
  attributes into the `icon` attribute of a block via the `/api/attr/setBlockAttrs` API. The
  payload is later rendered in the dynamic icon feature in an unsanitized context, leading to
  stored XSS and, in the desktop environment, potential remote code execution (RCE). This issue
  bypasses the previous fix for issue `#15970` (XSS → RCE via dynamic icons). Version 3.5.4
  contains an updated fix.
