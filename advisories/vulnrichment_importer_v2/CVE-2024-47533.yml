aliases: []
summary: Cobbler, a Linux installation server that allows for rapid setup of network installation
  environments, has an improper authentication vulnerability starting in version 3.0.0 and prior
  to versions 3.2.3 and 3.3.7. `utils.get_shared_secret()` always returns `-1`, which allows
  anyone to connect to cobbler XML-RPC as user `''` password `-1` and make any changes. This
  gives anyone with network access to a cobbler server full control of the server. Versions
  3.2.3 and 3.3.7 fix the issue.
