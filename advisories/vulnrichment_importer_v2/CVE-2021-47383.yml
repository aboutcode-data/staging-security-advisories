  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  tty: Fix out-of-bound vmalloc access in imageblit

  This issue happens when a userspace program does an ioctl
  FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO passing the fb_var_screeninfo struct
  containing only the fields xres, yres, and bits_per_pixel
  with values.

  If this struct is the same as the previous ioctl, the
  vc_resize() detects it and doesn't call the resize_screen(),
  leaving the fb_var_screeninfo incomplete. And this leads to
  the updatescrollmode() calculates a wrong value to
  fbcon_display->vrows, which makes the real_y() return a
  wrong value of y, and that value, eventually, causes
  the imageblit to access an out-of-bound address value.

  To solve this issue I made the resize_screen() be called
  even if the screen does not need any resizing, so it will
  "fix and fill" the fb_var_screeninfo independently.
