summary: The Elementor Website Builder Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the plugin's Media Carousel widget in all versions up to, and including, 3.20.1

  makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions
  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page.
