aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the configuration and monitoring service of the Cisco SD-WAN Solution
  could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges
  or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due
  to incomplete bounds checks for data that is provided by the configuration and monitoring
  service of the affected solution. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
  malicious data to the vDaemon listening service on an affected device. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow condition on the affected device, which
  could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the device or cause
  the vDaemon listening service to reload and result in a DoS condition on the device. This
  vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a release of the Cisco
  SD-WAN Solution prior to Release 18.3.0: vBond Orchestrator Software, vEdge 100 Series Routers,
  vEdge 1000 Series Routers, vEdge 2000 Series Routers, vEdge 5000 Series Routers, vEdge Cloud
  Router Platform, vManage Network Management Software, vSmart Controller Software. Cisco Bug
