summary: Nextcloud server is an open source, self hosted cloud style services platform. In affected
  versions an attacker can cause a denial of service by uploading specially crafted files which
  will cause the server to allocate too much memory / CPU. It is recommended that the Nextcloud
  Server is upgraded to 21.0.8 , 22.2.4 or 23.0.1. Users unable to upgrade should disable preview
  generation with the `'enable_previews'` config flag.
