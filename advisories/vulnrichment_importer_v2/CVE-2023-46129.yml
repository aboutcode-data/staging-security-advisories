aliases: []
summary: "NATS.io is a high performance open source pub-sub distributed communication technology,\
  \ built for the cloud, on-premise, IoT, and edge computing. The cryptographic key handling\
  \ library, nkeys, recently gained support for encryption, not just for signing/authentication.\
  \ This is used in nats-server 2.10 (Sep 2023) and newer for authentication callouts. In nkeys\
  \ versions 0.4.0 through 0.4.5, corresponding with NATS server versions 2.10.0 through 2.10.3,\
  \ the nkeys library's `xkeys` encryption handling logic mistakenly passed an array by value\
  \ into an internal function, where the function mutated that buffer to populate the encryption\
  \ key to use. As a result, all encryption was actually to an all-zeros key. This affects encryption\
  \ only, not signing.  \nFIXME: FILL IN IMPACT ON NATS-SERVER AUTH CALLOUT SECURITY. nkeys\
  \ Go library 0.4.6, corresponding with NATS Server 2.10.4, has a patch for this issue. No\
  \ known workarounds are available. For any application handling auth callouts in Go, if using\
  \ the nkeys library, update the dependency, recompile and deploy that in lockstep."
