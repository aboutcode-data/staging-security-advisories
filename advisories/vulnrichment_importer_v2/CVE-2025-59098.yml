aliases: []
summary: "The Access Manager is offering a trace functionality to debug errors and issues with\
  \ the device. The trace functionality is implemented as a simple TCP socket. A tool called\
  \ TraceClient.exe, provided by dormakaba via the Access Manager web interface, is used to\
  \ connect to the socket and receive debug information. The data is permanently broadcasted\
  \ on the TCP socket. The socket can be accessed without any authentication or encryption.\
  \ \n\nThe transmitted data is based on the set verbosity level. The verbosity level can be\
  \ set using the http(s) endpoint with the service interface password or with the guessable\
  \ identifier of the device via the SOAP interface.\n\nThe transmitted data contains sensitive\
  \ data like the Card ID as well as all button presses on Registration units. This allows an\
  \ attacker with network level access to retrieve all entered PINs on a registration unit."
