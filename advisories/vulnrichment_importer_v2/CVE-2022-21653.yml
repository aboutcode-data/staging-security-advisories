aliases: []
summary: Jawn is an open source JSON parser. Extenders of the `org.typelevel.jawn.SimpleFacade`
  and `org.typelevel.jawn.MutableFacade` who don't override `objectContext()` are vulnerable
  to a hash collision attack which may result in a denial of service. Most applications do not
  implement these traits directly, but inherit from a library. `jawn-parser-1.3.1` fixes this
  issue and users are advised to upgrade. For users unable to upgrade override `objectContext()`
  to use a collision-safe collection.
