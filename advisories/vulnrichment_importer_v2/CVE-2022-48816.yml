summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  SUNRPC: lock against ->sock changing during sysfs read

  ->sock can be set to NULL asynchronously unless ->recv_mutex is held.
  So it is important to hold that mutex.  Otherwise a sysfs read can
  trigger an oops.
  Commit 17f09d3f619a ("SUNRPC: Check if the xprt is connected before
  handling sysfs reads") appears to attempt to fix this problem, but it
  only narrows the race window.
