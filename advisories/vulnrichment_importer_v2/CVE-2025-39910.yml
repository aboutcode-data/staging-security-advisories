summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mm/vmalloc, mm/kasan: respect gfp mask in kasan_populate_vmalloc()

  kasan_populate_vmalloc() and its helpers ignore the caller's gfp_mask and
  always allocate memory using the hardcoded GFP_KERNEL flag.  This makes
  them inconsistent with vmalloc(), which was recently extended to support
  GFP_NOFS and GFP_NOIO allocations.

  Page table allocations performed during shadow population also ignore the
  external gfp_mask.  To preserve the intended semantics of GFP_NOFS and
  GFP_NOIO, wrap the apply_to_page_range() calls into the appropriate
  memalloc scope.

  xfs calls vmalloc with GFP_NOFS, so this bug could lead to deadlock.

  There was a report here
  https://lkml.kernel.org/r/686ea951.050a0220.385921.0016.GAE@google.com

  This patch:
   - Extends kasan_populate_vmalloc() and helpers to take gfp_mask;
   - Passes gfp_mask down to alloc_pages_bulk() and __get_free_page();
   - Enforces GFP_NOFS/NOIO semantics with memalloc_*_save()/restore()
     around apply_to_page_range();
   - Updates vmalloc.c and percpu allocator call sites accordingly.
