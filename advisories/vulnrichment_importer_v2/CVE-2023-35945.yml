aliases: []
summary: Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. Envoy’s HTTP/2
  codec may leak a header map and bookkeeping structures upon receiving `RST_STREAM` immediately
  followed by the `GOAWAY` frames from an upstream server. In nghttp2, cleanup of pending requests
  due to receipt of the `GOAWAY` frame skips de-allocation of the bookkeeping structure and
  pending compressed header. The error return [code path] is taken if connection is already
  marked for not sending more requests due to `GOAWAY` frame. The clean-up code is right after
  the return statement, causing memory leak. Denial of service through memory exhaustion. This
  vulnerability was patched in versions(s) 1.26.3, 1.25.8, 1.24.9, 1.23.11.
