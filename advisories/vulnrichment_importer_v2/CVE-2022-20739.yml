aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated,
  local attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system as the root
  user. The attacker must be authenticated on the affected system as a low-privileged user to
  exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability exists because a file leveraged by a root user
  is executed when a low-privileged user runs specific commands on an affected system. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary commands to a specific file as a lower-privileged
  user and then waiting until an admin user executes specific commands. The commands would then
  be executed on the device by the root user. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to escalate their privileges on the affected system from a low-privileged user to the root
  user.
