aliases: []
summary: Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. In versions 1.7.44 and below,
  various NTFS path quirks allow a prompt injection attacker to circumvent sensitive file protections
  and overwrite files which Cursor requires human approval to overwrite. Modification of some
  of the protected files can lead to RCE. Must be chained with a prompt injection or malicious
  model attach. Only affects systems supporting NTFS. This issue is fixed in version 2.0.
