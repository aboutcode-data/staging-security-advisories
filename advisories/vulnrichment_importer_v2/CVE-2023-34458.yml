aliases: []
summary: mx-chain-go is the official implementation of the MultiversX blockchain protocol, written
  in golang. When executing a relayed transaction, if the inner transaction failed, it would
  have increased the inner transaction's sender account nonce. This could have contributed to
  a limited DoS attack on a targeted account. The fix is a breaking change so a new flag `RelayedNonceFixEnableEpoch`
  was needed. This was a strict processing issue while validating blocks on a chain. This vulnerability
  has been patched in version 1.4.17.
