aliases: []
summary: The Email Verification, Email OTP, Block Spam Email, Passwordless login, Hide Login,
  Magic Login – User Verification plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass
  in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.39. This is due to the plugin not properly validating
  that an OTP was generated before comparing it to user input in the "user_verification_form_wrap_process_otpLogin"
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any user with
  a verified email address, such as an administrator, by submitting an empty OTP value.
