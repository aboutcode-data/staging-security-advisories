aliases: []
summary: Advantech WISE-DeviceOn Server versions prior to 5.4 contain a stored cross-site scripting
  (XSS) vulnerability in the /rmm/v1/devicegroups/ endpoint. When an authenticated user creates
  a device group, the name and description values are stored and later rendered in device group
  listings without proper HTML sanitation. An attacker can inject malicious script into either
  field, which is then executed in the browser context of users who view or interact with the
  affected device group, potentially enabling session compromise and unauthorized actions as
  the victim.
