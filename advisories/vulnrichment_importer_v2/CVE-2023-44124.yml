aliases: []
summary: The vulnerability is to theft of arbitrary files with system privilege in the Screen
  recording ("com.lge.gametools.gamerecorder") app in the "com/lge/gametools/gamerecorder/settings/ProfilePreferenceFragment.java"
  file. The main problem is that the app launches implicit intents that can be intercepted by
  third-party apps installed on the same device. They also can return arbitrary data that will
  be passed to the "onActivityResult()" method. The Screen recording app saves contents of arbitrary
  URIs to SD card which is a world-readable storage.
