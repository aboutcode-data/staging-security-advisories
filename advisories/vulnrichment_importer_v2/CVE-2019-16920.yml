aliases: []
summary: 'Unauthenticated remote code execution occurs in D-Link products such as DIR-655C,
  DIR-866L, DIR-652, and DHP-1565. The issue occurs when the attacker sends an arbitrary input
  to a "PingTest" device common gateway interface that could lead to common injection. An attacker
  who successfully triggers the command injection could achieve full system compromise. Later,
  it was independently found that these are also affected: DIR-855L, DAP-1533, DIR-862L, DIR-615,
  DIR-835, and DIR-825.'
