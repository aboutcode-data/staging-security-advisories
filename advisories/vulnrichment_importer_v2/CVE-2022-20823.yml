aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the OSPF version 3 (OSPFv3) feature of Cisco NX-OS Software could
  allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on
  an affected device. This vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of specific OSPFv3
  packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious OSPFv3 link-state
  advertisement (LSA) to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
  cause the OSPFv3 process to crash and restart multiple times, causing the affected device
  to reload and resulting in a DoS condition. Note: The OSPFv3 feature is disabled by default.
  To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to establish a full OSPFv3 neighbor
  state with an affected device. For more information about exploitation conditions, see the
  Details section of this advisory.'
