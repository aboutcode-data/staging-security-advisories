  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  libfs: fix infinite directory reads for offset dir

  After we switch tmpfs dir operations from simple_dir_operations to
  simple_offset_dir_operations, every rename happened will fill new dentry
  to dest dir's maple tree(&SHMEM_I(inode)->dir_offsets->mt) with a free
  key starting with octx->newx_offset, and then set newx_offset equals to
  free key + 1. This will lead to infinite readdir combine with rename
  happened at the same time, which fail generic/736 in xfstests(detail show
  as below).

  1. create 5000 files(1 2 3...) under one dir
  2. call readdir(man 3 readdir) once, and get one entry
  3. rename(entry, "TEMPFILE"), then rename("TEMPFILE", entry)
  4. loop 2~3, until readdir return nothing or we loop too many
     times(tmpfs break test with the second condition)

  We choose the same logic what commit 9b378f6ad48cf ("btrfs: fix infinite
  directory reads") to fix it, record the last_index when we open dir, and
  do not emit the entry which index >= last_index. The file->private_data
  now used in offset dir can use directly to do this, and we also update
  the last_index when we llseek the dir file.

  [brauner: only update last_index after seek when offset is zero like Jan suggested]
