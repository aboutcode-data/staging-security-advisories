aliases: []
summary: The The Special Text Boxes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode
  execution in all versions up to, and including, 6.2.2. This is due to the plugin adding the
  filter add_filter('comment_text', 'do_shortcode'); which will run all shortcodes in comments.
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.
