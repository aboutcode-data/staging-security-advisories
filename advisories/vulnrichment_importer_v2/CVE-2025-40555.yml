aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability has been identified in APOGEE PXC+TALON TC Series (BACnet) (All versions).
  Affected devices start sending unsolicited BACnet broadcast messages after processing a specific
  BACnet createObject request. This could allow an attacker residing in the same BACnet network
  to send a specially crafted message that results in a partial denial of service condition
  of the targeted device, and potentially reduce the availability of BACnet network. A power
  cycle is required to restore the device's normal operation.
