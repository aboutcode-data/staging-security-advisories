aliases: []
summary: The Front End Users plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due
  to missing file type validation in the file uploads field of the registration form in all
  versions up to, and including, 3.2.32. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution
  possible.
