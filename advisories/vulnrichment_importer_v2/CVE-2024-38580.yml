summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  epoll: be better about file lifetimes

  epoll can call out to vfs_poll() with a file pointer that may race with
  the last 'fput()'. That would make f_count go down to zero, and while
  the ep->mtx locking means that the resulting file pointer tear-down will
  be blocked until the poll returns, it means that f_count is already
  dead, and any use of it won't actually get a reference to the file any
  more: it's dead regardless.

  Make sure we have a valid ref on the file pointer before we call down to
  vfs_poll() from the epoll routines.
