aliases: []
summary: |
  Nokia Single RAN baseband software earlier than 24R1-SR 1.0 MP contains administrative shell input validation fault, which authenticated admin user can, in theory, potentially use for injecting arbitrary commands for unprivileged baseband OAM service process execution via special characters added to baseband internal COMA_config.xml file.

  This issue has been corrected starting from release 24R1-SR 1.0 MP and later, by adding proper input validation to OAM service process which prevents injecting special characters via baseband internal COMA_config.xml file.
