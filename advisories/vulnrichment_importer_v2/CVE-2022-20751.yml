aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Snort detection engine integration for Cisco Firepower Threat
  Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause unlimited
  memory consumption, which could lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected
  device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient memory management for certain Snort events.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted IP packets that
  would generate specific Snort events on an affected device. A sustained attack could cause
  an out of memory condition on the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to interrupt all traffic flowing through the affected device. In some circumstances, the attacker
  may be able to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.
