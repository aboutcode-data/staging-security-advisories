aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security
  (EAP-TLS) certificate validation during EAP authentication for the Cisco Identity Services
  Engine (ISE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the ISE application
  server to restart unexpectedly, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected
  system. The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of the client EAP-TLS certificate.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by initiating EAP authentication over TLS to
  the ISE with a crafted EAP-TLS certificate. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to restart the ISE application server, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected system.
  The ISE application could continue to restart while the client attempts to establish the EAP
  authentication connection. If an attacker attempted to import the same EAP-TLS certificate
  to the ISE trust store, it could trigger a DoS condition on the affected system. This exploit
  vector would require the attacker to have valid administrator credentials. The vulnerability
  affects Cisco ISE, Cisco ISE Express, and Cisco ISE Virtual Appliance. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve31857.'
