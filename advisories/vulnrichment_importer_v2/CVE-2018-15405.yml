aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web interface for specific feature sets of Cisco Integrated
  Management Controller (IMC) Supervisor and Cisco UCS Director could allow an authenticated,
  remote attacker to access sensitive information. The vulnerability is due to an authorization
  check that does not properly include the access level of the web interface user. An attacker
  who has valid application credentials could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted
  HTTP request to the web interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive
  information that belongs to other users. The attacker could then use this information to conduct
  additional reconnaissance attacks.
