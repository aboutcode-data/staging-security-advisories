summary: |
  Apache Superset utilizes a configurable dictionary, DISALLOWED_SQL_FUNCTIONS, to restrict the execution of potentially sensitive SQL functions within SQL Lab and charts. While this feature included restrictions for engines like PostgreSQL, a vulnerability was reported where the default list for the ClickHouse engine was incomplete.

  This issue affects Apache Superset: before 4.1.2.

  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.1.2, which fixes the issue.
