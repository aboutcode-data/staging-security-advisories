  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  smb: client: guarantee refcounted children from parent session

  Avoid potential use-after-free bugs when walking DFS referrals,
  mounting and performing DFS failover by ensuring that all children
  from parent @tcon->ses are also refcounted.  They're all needed across
  the entire DFS mount.  Get rid of @tcon->dfs_ses_list while we're at
  it, too.
