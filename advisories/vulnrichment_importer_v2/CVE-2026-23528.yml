aliases: []
summary: Dask distributed is a distributed task scheduler for Dask. Prior to 2026.1.0, when
  Jupyter Lab, jupyter-server-proxy, and Dask distributed are all run together, it is possible
  to craft a URL which will result in code being executed by Jupyter due to a cross-side-scripting
  (XSS) bug in the Dask dashboard. It is possible for attackers to craft a phishing URL that
  assumes Jupyter Lab and Dask may be running on localhost and using default ports. If a user
  clicks on the malicious link it will open an error page in the Dask Dashboard via the Jupyter
  Lab proxy which will cause code to be executed by the default Jupyter Python kernel. This
  vulnerability is fixed in 2026.1.0.
