aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) implementation of Cisco Adaptive
  Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could
  allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a reload of an affected device, resulting
  in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability exists because the affected software
  improperly parses certain options in OSPF link-state advertisement (LSA) type 11 packets.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted LSA type 11 OSPF packet
  to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of
  the affected device, resulting in a DoS condition for client traffic that is traversing the
  device.
