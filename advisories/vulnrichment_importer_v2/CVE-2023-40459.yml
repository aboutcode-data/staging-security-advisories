summary: |
  The
  ACEManager component of ALEOS 4.16 and earlier does not adequately perform
  input sanitization during authentication, which could potentially result in a
  Denial of Service (DoS) condition for ACEManager without impairing other router
  functions. ACEManager recovers from the DoS condition by restarting within ten
  seconds of becoming unavailable.
