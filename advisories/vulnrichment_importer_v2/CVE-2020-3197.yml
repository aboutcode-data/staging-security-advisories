aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the API subsystem of Cisco Meetings App could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to retain and reuse the Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN) server credentials
  that are configured in an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient protection
  mechanisms for the TURN server credentials. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
  intercepting the legitimate traffic that is generated by an affected system. An exploit could
  allow the attacker to obtain the TURN server credentials, which the attacker could use to
  place audio/video calls and forward packets through the configured TURN server. The attacker
  would not be able to take control of the TURN server unless the same credentials were used
  in multiple systems.
