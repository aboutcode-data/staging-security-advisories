  idpf: fix memory leaks and crashes while performing a soft reset

  The second tagged commit introduced a UAF, as it removed restoring
  q_vector->vport pointers after reinitializating the structures.
  This is due to that all queue allocation functions are performed here
  with the new temporary vport structure and those functions rewrite
  the backpointers to the vport. Then, this new struct is freed and
  the pointers start leading to nowhere.

  But generally speaking, the current logic is very fragile. It claims
  to be more reliable when the system is low on memory, but in fact, it
  consumes two times more memory as at the moment of running this
  function, there are two vports allocated with their queues and vectors.
  Moreover, it claims to prevent the driver from running into "bad state",
  but in fact, any error during the rebuild leaves the old vport in the
  partially allocated state.
  Finally, if the interface is down when the function is called, it always
  allocates a new queue set, but when the user decides to enable the
  interface later on, vport_open() allocates them once again, IOW there's
  a clear memory leak here.

  Just don't allocate a new queue set when performing a reset, that solves
  crashes and memory leaks. Readd the old queue number and reopen the
  interface on rollback - that solves limbo states when the device is left
  disabled and/or without HW queues enabled.
