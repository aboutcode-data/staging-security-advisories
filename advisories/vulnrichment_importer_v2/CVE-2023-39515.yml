aliases: []
summary: Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management framework. Affected
  versions are subject to a Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability allows an authenticated
  user to poison data stored in the cacti's database. These data will be viewed by administrative
  cacti accounts and execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser at view-time. The script
  under `data_debug.php` displays data source related debugging information such as _data source
  paths, polling settings, meta-data on the data source_. _CENSUS_ found that an adversary that
  is able to configure a malicious data-source path, can deploy a stored XSS attack against
  any user that has privileges related to viewing the `data_debug.php` information. A user that
  possesses the _General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data_ permissions can configure the data
  source path in _cacti_. This configuration occurs through `http://<HOST>/cacti/data_sources.php`.
  This vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. Users
  unable to update should manually filter HTML output.
