aliases: []
summary: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the /srvs/membersrv/getCashiers endpoint
  of the Aptsys gemscms backend platform thru 2025-05-28. This unauthenticated endpoint returns
  a list of cashier accounts, including names, email addresses, usernames, and passwords hashed
  using MD5. As MD5 is a broken cryptographic function, the hashes can be easily reversed using
  public tools, exposing user credentials in plaintext. This allows remote attackers to perform
  unauthorized logins and potentially gain access to sensitive POS operations or backend functions.
