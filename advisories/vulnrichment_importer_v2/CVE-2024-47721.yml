  wifi: rtw89: remove unused C2H event ID RTW89_MAC_C2H_FUNC_READ_WOW_CAM to prevent out-of-bounds reading

  The handler of firmware C2H event RTW89_MAC_C2H_FUNC_READ_WOW_CAM isn't
  implemented, but driver expects number of handlers is
  NUM_OF_RTW89_MAC_C2H_FUNC_WOW causing out-of-bounds access. Fix it by
  removing ID.
