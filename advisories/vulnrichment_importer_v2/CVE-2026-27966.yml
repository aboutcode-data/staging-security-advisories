aliases: []
summary: Langflow is a tool for building and deploying AI-powered agents and workflows. Prior
  to version 1.8.0, the CSV Agent node in Langflow hardcodes `allow_dangerous_code=True`, which
  automatically exposes LangChain’s Python REPL tool (`python_repl_ast`). As a result, an attacker
  can execute arbitrary Python and OS commands on the server via prompt injection, leading to
  full Remote Code Execution (RCE). Version 1.8.0 fixes the issue.
