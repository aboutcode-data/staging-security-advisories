aliases: []
summary: Command injection vulnerability in Nexxt Solutions NCM-X1800 Mesh Router versions UV1.2.7
  and below, allowing authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the device. The
  vulnerability is present in the web management interface's ping and traceroute functionality,
  specifically in the /web/um_ping_set.cgi endpoint. The application fails to properly sanitize
  user input in the `Ping_host_text` parameter before passing it to the underlying system command,
  allowing attackers to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands as the root user.
