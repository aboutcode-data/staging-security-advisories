aliases: []
summary: Zoom Rooms for macOS clients before version 5.11.4 contain an insecure key generation
  mechanism. The encryption key used for IPC between the Zoom Rooms daemon service and the Zoom
  Rooms client was generated using parameters that could be obtained by a local low-privileged
  application. That key can then be used to interact with the daemon service to execute privileged
  functions and cause a local denial of service.
