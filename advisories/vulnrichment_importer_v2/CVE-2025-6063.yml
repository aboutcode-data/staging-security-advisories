aliases: []
summary: The XiSearch bar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in
  all versions up to, and including, 2.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the 'xisearch-key-config' page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
  update settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick
  a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
