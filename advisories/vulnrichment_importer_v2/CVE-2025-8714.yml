aliases: []
summary: Untrusted data inclusion in pg_dump in PostgreSQL allows a malicious superuser of the
  origin server to inject arbitrary code for restore-time execution as the client operating
  system account running psql to restore the dump, via psql meta-commands.  pg_dumpall is also
  affected.  pg_restore is affected when used to generate a plain-format dump.  This is similar
  to MySQL CVE-2024-21096.  Versions before PostgreSQL 17.6, 16.10, 15.14, 14.19, and 13.22
  are affected.
