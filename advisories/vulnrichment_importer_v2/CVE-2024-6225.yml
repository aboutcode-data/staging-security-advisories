aliases: []
summary: The Booking for Appointments and Events Calendar – Amelia plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.5
  (and 7.5.1 for the Pro version) due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and
  above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
  an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
  has been disabled.
