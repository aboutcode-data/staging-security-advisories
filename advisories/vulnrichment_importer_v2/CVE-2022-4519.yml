aliases: []
summary: The WP User plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via its
  settings parameters in versions up to, and including, 7.0 due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level
  permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
  a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations
  where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
