aliases: []
summary: The Plus Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
  in versions up to, and including 4.1.9 (pro) and 2.0.6 (free). The plugin adds a registration
  form to the Elementor page builders functionality. As part of the registration form, users
  can choose which role to set as the default for users upon registration. This field is not
  hidden for lower-level users so any user with access to the Elementor page builder, such as
  contributors, can set the default role to administrator. Since contributors can not publish
  posts, only author+ users can elevate privileges without interaction via a site administrator
  (to approve a post).
