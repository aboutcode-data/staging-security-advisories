aliases: []
summary: The unified WEBUI application of the ONT/Beacon device contains an input handling flaw
  that allows authenticated users to trigger unintended system-level command execution. Due
  to insufficient validation of user-supplied data, a low-privileged authenticated attacker
  may be able to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying ONT/Beacon operating system, potentially
  impacting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the device.
