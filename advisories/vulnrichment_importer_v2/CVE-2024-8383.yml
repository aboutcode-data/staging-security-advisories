aliases: []
summary: 'Firefox normally asks for confirmation before asking the operating system to find
  an application to handle a scheme that the browser does not support. It did not ask before
  doing so for the Usenet-related schemes news: and snews:. Since most operating systems don''t
  have a trusted newsreader installed by default, an unscrupulous program that the user downloaded
  could register itself as a handler. The website that served the application download could
  then launch that application at will. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 130, Firefox ESR
  < 128.2, and Firefox ESR < 115.15.'
