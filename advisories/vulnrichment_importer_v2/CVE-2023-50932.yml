aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in savignano S/Notify before 4.0.2 for Confluence. While an
  administrative user is logged on, the configuration settings of S/Notify can be modified via
  a CSRF attack. The injection could be initiated by the administrator clicking a malicious
  link in an email or by visiting a malicious website. If executed while an administrator is
  logged on to Confluence, an attacker could exploit this to modify the configuration of the
  S/Notify app on that host. This can, in particular, lead to email notifications being no longer
  encrypted when they should be.
