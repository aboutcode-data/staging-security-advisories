aliases: []
summary: mod_auth_openidc is an OpenID Certified authentication and authorization module for
  the Apache 2.x HTTP server that implements the OpenID Connect Relying Party functionality.
  Prior to 2.4.16.11, a bug in a mod_auth_openidc results in disclosure of protected content
  to unauthenticated users. The conditions for disclosure are an OIDCProviderAuthRequestMethod
  POST, a valid account, and there mustn't be any application-level gateway (or load balancer
  etc) protecting the server. When you request a protected resource, the response includes the
  HTTP status, the HTTP headers, the intended response (the self-submitting form), and the protected
  resource (with no headers). This is an example of a request for a protected resource, including
  all the data returned. In the case where mod_auth_openidc returns a form, it has to return
  OK from check_userid so as not to go down the error path in httpd. This means httpd will try
  to issue the protected resource. oidc_content_handler is called early, which has the opportunity
  to prevent the normal output being issued by httpd. oidc_content_handler has a number of checks
  for when it intervenes, but it doesn't check for this case, so the handler returns DECLINED.
  Consequently, httpd appends the protected content to the response. The issue has been patched
  in mod_auth_openidc versions >= 2.4.16.11.
