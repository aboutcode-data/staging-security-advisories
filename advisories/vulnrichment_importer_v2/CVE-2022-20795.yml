aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the implementation of the Datagram TLS (DTLS) protocol in Cisco
  Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause high CPU utilization, resulting in
  a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to suboptimal processing that
  occurs when establishing a DTLS tunnel as part of an AnyConnect SSL VPN connection. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending a steady stream of crafted DTLS traffic to an
  affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust resources on the
  affected VPN headend device. This could cause existing DTLS tunnels to stop passing traffic
  and prevent new DTLS tunnels from establishing, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: When the
  attack traffic stops, the device recovers gracefully.'
