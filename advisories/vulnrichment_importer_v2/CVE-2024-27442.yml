aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) 9.0 and 10.0. The zmmailboxdmgr
  binary, a component of ZCS, is intended to be executed by the zimbra user with root privileges
  for specific mailbox operations. However, an attacker can escalate privileges from the zimbra
  user to root, because of improper handling of input arguments. An attacker can execute arbitrary
  commands with elevated privileges, leading to local privilege escalation.
