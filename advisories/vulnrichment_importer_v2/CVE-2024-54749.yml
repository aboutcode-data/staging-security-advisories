summary: 'Ubiquiti U7-Pro 7.0.35 was discovered to contain a hardcoded password vulnerability
  in /etc/shadow, which allows attackers to log in as root. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier
  because the observation only established that a password is present in a firmware image; however,
  the device cannot be deployed without setting a new password during installation.'
