aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the configuration management of Cisco AsyncOS for Cisco Web Security
  Appliance (WSA) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform command injection
  and elevate privileges to root. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied
  XML input for the web interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading
  crafted XML configuration files that contain scripting code to a vulnerable device. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating
  system and elevate privileges to root. An attacker would need a valid user account with the
  rights to upload configuration files to exploit this vulnerability.
