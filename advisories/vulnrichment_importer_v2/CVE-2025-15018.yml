aliases: []
summary: The Optional Email plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation via Account
  Takeover in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.11. This is due to the plugin not restricting
  its 'random_password' filter to registration contexts, allowing the filter to affect password
  reset key generation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to set a known
  password reset key when initiating a password reset, reset the password of any user including
  administrators, and gain access to their accounts.
