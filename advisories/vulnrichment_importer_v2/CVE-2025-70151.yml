aliases: []
summary: code-projects Scholars Tracking System 1.0 allows an authenticated attacker to achieve
  remote code execution via unrestricted file upload. The endpoints update_profile_picture.php
  and upload_picture.php store uploaded files in a web-accessible uploads/ directory using the
  original, user-supplied filename without validating the file type or extension. By uploading
  a PHP file and then requesting it from /uploads/, an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code
  as the web server user.
