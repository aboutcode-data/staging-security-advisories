aliases: []
summary: In jenkins/ssh-agent Docker images 6.11.1 and earlier, SSH host keys are generated
  on image creation for images based on Debian, causing all containers based on images of the
  same version use the same SSH host keys, allowing attackers able to insert themselves into
  the network path between the SSH client (typically the Jenkins controller) and SSH build agent
  to impersonate the latter.
