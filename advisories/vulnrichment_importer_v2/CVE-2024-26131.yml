aliases: []
summary: Element Android is an Android Matrix Client. Element Android version 1.4.3 through
  1.6.10 is vulnerable to intent redirection, allowing a third-party malicious application to
  start any internal activity by passing some extra parameters. Possible impact includes making
  Element Android display an arbitrary web page, executing arbitrary JavaScript; bypassing PIN
  code protection; and account takeover by spawning a login screen to send credentials to an
  arbitrary home server. This issue is fixed in Element Android 1.6.12. There is no known workaround
  to mitigate the issue.
