  ksmbd: fix reference count leak in smb_check_perm_dacl()

  The issue happens in a specific path in smb_check_perm_dacl(). When
  "id" and "uid" have the same value, the function simply jumps out of
  the loop without decrementing the reference count of the object
  "posix_acls", which is increased by get_acl() earlier. This may
  result in memory leaks.

  Fix it by decreasing the reference count of "posix_acls" before
  jumping to label "check_access_bits".
