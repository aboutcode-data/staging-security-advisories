aliases: []
summary: "The vulnerability affects Ignition SCADA applications where Python \nscripting is\
  \ utilized for automation purposes. The vulnerability arises \nfrom the absence of proper\
  \ security controls that restrict which Python \nlibraries can be imported and executed within\
  \ the scripting environment.\n The core issue lies in the Ignition service account having\
  \ system \npermissions beyond what an Ignition privileged user requires. When an \nauthenticated\
  \ administrator uploads a malicious project file containing \nPython scripts with bind shell\
  \ capabilities, the application executes \nthese scripts with the same privileges as the Ignition\
  \ Gateway process, \nwhich typically runs with SYSTEM-level permissions on Windows. \nAlternative\
  \ code execution patterns could lead to similar results."
