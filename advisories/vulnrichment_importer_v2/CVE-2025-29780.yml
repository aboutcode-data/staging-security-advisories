summary: Post-Quantum Secure Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing provides a Python implementation
  of Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) scheme. In versions 0.8.0b2 and prior, the `feldman_vss`
  library contains timing side-channel vulnerabilities in its matrix operations, specifically
  within the `_find_secure_pivot` function and potentially other parts of `_secure_matrix_solve`.
  These vulnerabilities are due to Python's execution model, which does not guarantee constant-time
  execution. An attacker with the ability to measure the execution time of these functions (e.g.,
  through repeated calls with carefully crafted inputs) could potentially recover secret information
  used in the Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) scheme. The `_find_secure_pivot` function, used
  during Gaussian elimination in `_secure_matrix_solve`, attempts to find a non-zero pivot element.
  However, the conditional statement `if matrix[row][col] != 0 and row_random < min_value:`
  has execution time that depends on the value of `matrix[row][col]`. This timing difference
  can be exploited by an attacker. The `constant_time_compare` function in this file also does
  not provide a constant-time guarantee. The Python implementation of matrix operations in the
  _find_secure_pivot and _secure_matrix_solve functions cannot guarantee constant-time execution,
  potentially leaking information about secret polynomial coefficients. An attacker with the
  ability to make precise timing measurements of these operations could potentially extract
  secret information through statistical analysis of execution times, though practical exploitation
  would require significant expertise and controlled execution environments. Successful exploitation
  of these timing side-channels could allow an attacker to recover secret keys or other sensitive
  information protected by the VSS scheme. This could lead to a complete compromise of the shared
  secret. As of time of publication, no patched versions of Post-Quantum Secure Feldman's Verifiable
  Secret Sharing exist, but other mitigations are available. As acknowledged in the library's
  documentation, these vulnerabilities cannot be adequately addressed in pure Python. In the
  short term, consider using this library only in environments where timing measurements by
  attackers are infeasible. In the medium term, implement your own wrappers around critical
  operations using constant-time libraries in languages like Rust, Go, or C. In the long term,
  wait for the planned Rust implementation mentioned in the library documentation that will
  properly address these issues.
