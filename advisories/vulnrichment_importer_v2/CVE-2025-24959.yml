aliases: []
summary: zx is a tool for writing better scripts. An attacker with control over environment
  variable values can inject unintended environment variables into `process.env`. This can lead
  to arbitrary command execution or unexpected behavior in applications that rely on environment
  variables for security-sensitive operations. Applications that process untrusted input and
  pass it through `dotenv.stringify` are particularly vulnerable. This issue has been patched
  in version 8.3.2. Users should immediately upgrade to this version to mitigate the vulnerability.
  If upgrading is not feasible, users can mitigate the vulnerability by sanitizing user-controlled
  environment variable values before passing them to `dotenv.stringify`. Specifically, avoid
  using `"`, `'`, and backticks in values, or enforce strict validation of environment variables
  before usage.
