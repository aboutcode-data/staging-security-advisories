summary: 'The Internal Link Juicer: SEO Auto Linker for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings such as ''ilj_settings_field_links_per_page''  in
  all versions up to, and including, 2.23.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output

  page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has
