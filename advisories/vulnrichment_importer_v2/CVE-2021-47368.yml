  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  enetc: Fix illegal access when reading affinity_hint

  irq_set_affinity_hit() stores a reference to the cpumask_t
  parameter in the irq descriptor, and that reference can be
  accessed later from irq_affinity_hint_proc_show(). Since
  the cpu_mask parameter passed to irq_set_affinity_hit() has
  only temporary storage (it's on the stack memory), later
  accesses to it are illegal. Thus reads from the corresponding
  procfs affinity_hint file can result in paging request oops.

  The issue is fixed by the get_cpu_mask() helper, which provides
  a permanent storage for the cpumask_t parameter.
