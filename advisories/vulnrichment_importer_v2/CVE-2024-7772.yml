aliases: []
summary: The Jupiter X Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due
  to a mishandled file type validation in the 'validate' function in all versions up to, and
  including, 4.6.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary
  files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
