summary: Vyper is the Pythonic Programming Language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. In versions
  up to and including 0.4.2rc1, `concat()` may skip evaluation of side effects when the length
  of an argument is zero. This is due to a fastpath in the implementation which skips evaluation
  of argument expressions when their length is zero. In practice, it would be very unusual in
  user code to construct zero-length bytestrings using an expression with side-effects, since
  zero-length bytestrings are typically constructed with the empty literal `b""`; the only way
  to construct an empty bytestring which has side effects would be with the ternary operator
  introduced in v0.3.8, e.g. `b"" if self.do_some_side_effect() else b""`. The fix is available
  in pull request 4644 and expected to be part of the 0.4.2 release. As a workaround, don't
  have side effects in expressions which construct zero-length bytestrings.
