aliases: []
summary: 'typed-rest-client is a library for Node Rest and Http Clients with typings for use
  with TypeScript. Users of the typed-rest-client library version 1.7.3 or lower are vulnerable
  to leak authentication data to 3rd parties. The flow of the vulnerability is as follows: First,
  send any request with `BasicCredentialHandler`, `BearerCredentialHandler` or `PersonalAccessTokenCredentialHandler`.
  Second, the target host may return a redirection (3xx), with a link to a second host. Third,
  the next request will use the credentials to authenticate with the second host, by setting
  the `Authorization` header. The expected behavior is that the next request will *NOT* set
  the `Authorization` header. The problem was fixed in version 1.8.0. There are no known workarounds.'
