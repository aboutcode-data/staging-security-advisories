aliases: []
summary: Mezzanine CMS, in versions prior to 6.1.1, contains a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  vulnerability in the admin interface. The vulnerability exists in the "displayable_links_js"
  function, which fails to properly sanitize blog post titles before including them in JSON
  responses served via "/admin/displayable_links.js". An authenticated admin user can create
  a blog post with a malicious JavaScript payload in the title field, then trick another admin
  user into clicking a direct link to the "/admin/displayable_links.js" endpoint, causing the
  malicious script to execute in their browser.
