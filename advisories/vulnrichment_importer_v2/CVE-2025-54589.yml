aliases: []
summary: Copyparty is a portable file server. In versions 1.18.6 and below, when accessing the
  recent uploads page at `/?ru`, users can filter the results using an input field at the top.
  This field appends a filter parameter to the URL, which reflects its value directly into a
  `<script>` block without proper escaping, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  and can be exploited against both authenticated and unauthenticated users. This is fixed in
  version 1.18.7.
