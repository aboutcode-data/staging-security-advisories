aliases: []
summary: A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the way Foxit Reader 12.1.2.15356 handles
  a signature field. A specially crafted Javascript code inside a malicious PDF document can
  trigger reuse of a previously freed object, which can lead to memory corruption and result
  in arbitrary code execution. An attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious
  file to trigger this vulnerability. Exploitation is also possible if a user visits a specially
  crafted, malicious site if the browser plugin extension is enabled.
