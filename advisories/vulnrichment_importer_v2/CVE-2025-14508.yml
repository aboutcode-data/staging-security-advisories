aliases: []
summary: The MediaCommander – Bring Folders to Media, Posts, and Pages plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to unauthorized data deletion due to a missing capability check on the import-csv
  REST API endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.1. This is due to the endpoint
  using `upload_files` capability check (Author level) for a destructive operation that can
  delete all folders. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level
  access and above, to delete all folder organization data created by Administrators and other
  users.
