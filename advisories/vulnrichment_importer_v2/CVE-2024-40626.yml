aliases: []
summary: Outline is an open source, collaborative document editor. A type confusion issue was
  found in ProseMirror’s rendering process that leads to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  vulnerability in Outline. An authenticated user can create a document containing a malicious
  JavaScript payload. When other users view this document, the malicious Javascript can execute
  in the origin of Outline. Outline includes CSP rules to prevent third-party code execution,
  however in the case of self-hosting and having your file storage on the same domain as Outline
  a malicious payload can be uploaded as a file attachment and bypass those CSP restrictions.
  This issue has been addressed in release version 0.77.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There
  are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
