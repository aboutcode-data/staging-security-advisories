aliases: []
summary: The Football Pool plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 2.12.4 due to insufficient input
  sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
  administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
  execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations
  and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
