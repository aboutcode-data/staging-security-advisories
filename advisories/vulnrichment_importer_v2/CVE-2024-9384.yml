aliases: []
summary: The Quantity Dynamic Pricing & Bulk Discounts for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg without appropriate
  escaping on the URL in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.0. This makes it possible for
  unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can
  successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
