summary: Netis ADSL Router DL4322D firmware RTK 2.1.1 contains a buffer overflow vulnerability
  in the embedded FTP service that allows an authenticated remote user to trigger a denial of
  service. After logging in to the FTP service, sending an FTP command such as ABOR with an
  excessively long argument causes the service, and in practice the router, to crash or become
  unresponsive, resulting in a loss of availability for the device and connected users.
