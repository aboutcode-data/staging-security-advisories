aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the DNS application layer gateway (ALG) functionality that is used
  by Network Address Translation (NAT) in Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload. This vulnerability is due to a logic
  error that occurs when an affected device inspects certain TCP DNS packets. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted DNS packets through the affected device that
  is performing NAT for DNS packets. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause
  the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.
  Note: This vulnerability can be exploited only by sending IPv4 TCP packets through an affected
  device. This vulnerability cannot be exploited by sending IPv6 traffic.'
