  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  debugfs: fix wait/cancellation handling during remove

  Ben Greear further reports deadlocks during concurrent debugfs
  remove while files are being accessed, even though the code in
  question now uses debugfs cancellations. Turns out that despite
  all the review on the locking, we missed completely that the
  logic is wrong: if the refcount hits zero we can finish (and
  need not wait for the completion), but if it doesn't we have
  to trigger all the cancellations. As written, we can _never_
  get into the loop triggering the cancellations. Fix this, and
  explain it better while at it.
