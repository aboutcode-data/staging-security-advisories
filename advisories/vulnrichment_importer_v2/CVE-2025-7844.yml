aliases: []
summary: Exporting a TPM based RSA key larger than 2048 bits from the TPM could overrun a stack
  buffer if the default `MAX_RSA_KEY_BITS=2048` is used. If your TPM 2.0 module supports RSA
  key sizes larger than 2048 bit and your applications supports creating or importing an RSA
  private or public key larger than 2048 bits and your application calls `wolfTPM2_RsaKey_TpmToWolf`
  on that key, then a stack buffer could be overrun. If the `MAX_RSA_KEY_BITS` build-time macro
  is set correctly (RSA bits match what TPM hardware is capable of) for the hardware target,
  then a stack overrun is not possible.
