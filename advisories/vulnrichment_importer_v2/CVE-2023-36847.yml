summary: "A Missing Authentication for Critical Function vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos\
  \ OS on EX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause limited impact\
  \ to the file system integrity.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a specific request to installAppPackage.php\
  \ that doesn't require authentication an attacker is able to upload arbitrary files via J-Web,\
  \ leading to a loss of \n\nintegrity\n\nfor a certain \n\npart of the file system, which may\
  \ allow chaining to other vulnerabilities.\n\n\nThis issue affects Juniper Networks Junos\
  \ OS on EX Series:\n\n\n\n  *  All versions prior to 20.4R3-S8;\n  *  21.1 versions 21.1R1\
  \ and later;\n  *  21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S6;\n  *  21.3 versions \n\nprior to \n\n\
  \ 21.3R3-S5;\n  *  21.4 versions \n\nprior to \n\n21.4R3-S4;\n  *  22.1 versions \n\nprior\
