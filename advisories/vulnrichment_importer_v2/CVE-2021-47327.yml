  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  iommu/arm-smmu: Fix arm_smmu_device refcount leak when arm_smmu_rpm_get fails

  arm_smmu_rpm_get() invokes pm_runtime_get_sync(), which increases the
  refcount of the "smmu" even though the return value is less than 0.

  The reference counting issue happens in some error handling paths of
  arm_smmu_rpm_get() in its caller functions. When arm_smmu_rpm_get()
  fails, the caller functions forget to decrease the refcount of "smmu"
  increased by arm_smmu_rpm_get(), causing a refcount leak.

  Fix this issue by calling pm_runtime_resume_and_get() instead of
  pm_runtime_get_sync() in arm_smmu_rpm_get(), which can keep the refcount
  balanced in case of failure.
