aliases: []
summary: The Category and Taxonomy Image plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the '_category_image' parameter in versions up to, and including, 1.0.0 due
  to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers with editor-level and above permissions to inject
  arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
  This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been
  disabled.
