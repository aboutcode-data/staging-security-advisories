summary: |
  Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow.

  Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_check(), DH_check_ex()
  or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long
  delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained
  from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.

  The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. After fixing
  CVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger
  an overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value,
  if present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is
  unnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p.

  An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained
  from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.

  The function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.
  An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.
  The other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and
  EVP_PKEY_param_check().

  Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications
  when using the "-check" option.

  The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

  The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.
