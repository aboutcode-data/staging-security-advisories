aliases: []
summary: Pimcore's Admin Classic Bundle provides a Backend UI for Pimcore. An HTML injection
  issue allows users with access to the email sending functionality to inject arbitrary HTML
  code into emails sent via the admin interface, potentially leading to session cookie theft
  and the alteration of page content. The vulnerability was discovered in the /admin/email/send-test-email
  endpoint using the POST method. The vulnerable parameter is content, which permits the injection
  of arbitrary HTML code during the email sending process. While JavaScript code injection is
  blocked through filtering, HTML code injection remains possible. This vulnerability is fixed
  in 1.7.6.
