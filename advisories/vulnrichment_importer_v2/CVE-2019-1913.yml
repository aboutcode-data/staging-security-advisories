aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web management interface of Cisco Small Business 220
  Series Smart Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to overflow a buffer,
  which then allows the execution of arbitrary code with root privileges on the underlying operating
  system. The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input and
  improper boundary checks when reading data into an internal buffer. An attacker could exploit
  these vulnerabilities by sending malicious requests to the web management interface of an
  affected device. Depending on the configuration of the affected switch, the malicious requests
  must be sent via HTTP or HTTPS.
