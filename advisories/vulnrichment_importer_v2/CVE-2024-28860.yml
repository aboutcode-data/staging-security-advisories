datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2024-28860

aliases: []
summary: Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane.
  Users of IPsec transparent encryption in Cilium may be vulnerable to cryptographic attacks
  that render the transparent encryption ineffective. In particular, Cilium is vulnerable to
  chosen plaintext, key recovery, replay attacks by a man-in-the-middle attacker. These attacks
  are possible due to an ESP sequence number collision when multiple nodes are configured with
  the same key. Fixed versions of Cilium use unique keys for each IPsec tunnel established between
  nodes, resolving all of the above attacks. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.13.13, 1.14.9,
  and 1.15.3.
