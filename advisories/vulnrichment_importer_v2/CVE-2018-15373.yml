summary: A vulnerability in the implementation of Cisco Discovery Protocol functionality in
  Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker
  to exhaust memory on an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
  The vulnerability is due to improper memory handling by the affected software when the software
  processes high rates of Cisco Discovery Protocol packets that are sent to a device. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of Cisco Discovery Protocol packets
  to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust memory on
  the affected device, resulting in a DoS condition.
