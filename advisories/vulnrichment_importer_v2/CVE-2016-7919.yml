aliases: []
summary: 'Moodle 3.1.2 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via unspecified
  vectors, related to a "SQL Injection" issue affecting the Administration panel function in
  the installation process component.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the relevance of this report,
  noting that "the person who is installing Moodle must know database access credentials and
  they can access the database directly; there is no need for them to create a SQL injection
  in one of the installation dialogue fields.'
