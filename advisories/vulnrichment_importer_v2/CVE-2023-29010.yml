aliases: []
summary: Budibase is a low code platform for creating internal tools, workflows, and admin panels.
  Versions prior to 2.4.3 (07 March 2023) are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery. This
  can lead to an attacker gaining access to a Budibase AWS secret key. Users of Budibase cloud
  need to take no action. Self-host users who run Budibase on the public internet and are using
  a cloud provider that allows HTTP access to metadata information should ensure that when they
  deploy Budibase live, their internal metadata endpoint is not exposed.
