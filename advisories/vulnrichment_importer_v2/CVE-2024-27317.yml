summary: "In Pulsar Functions Worker, authenticated users can upload functions in jar or nar\
  \ files. These files, essentially zip files, are extracted by the Functions Worker. However,\
  \ if a malicious file is uploaded, it could exploit a directory traversal vulnerability. This\
  \ occurs when the filenames in the zip files, which aren't properly validated, contain special\
  \ elements like \"..\", altering the directory path. This could allow an attacker to create\
  \ or modify files outside of the designated extraction directory, potentially influencing\
  \ system behavior. This vulnerability also applies to the Pulsar Broker when it is configured\
  \ with \"functionsWorkerEnabled=true\".\n\nThis issue affects Apache Pulsar versions from\
  \ 2.4.0 to 2.10.5, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.3, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.2, from 3.1.0 to 3.1.2, and 3.2.0.\
  \ \n\n2.10 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.10.6.\n2.11 Pulsar Function\
  \ Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.11.4.\n3.0 Pulsar Function Worker users should\
  \ upgrade to at least 3.0.3.\n3.1 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least\
  \ 3.1.3.\n3.2 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.2.1.\n\nUsers operating\
  \ versions prior to those listed above should upgrade to the aforementioned patched versions\
  \ or newer versions."
