aliases: []
summary: request-filtering-agent is an http(s).Agent implementation that blocks requests to
  Private/Reserved IP addresses. Versions 1.x.x and earlier contain a vulnerability where HTTPS
  requests to 127.0.0.1 bypass IP address filtering, while HTTP requests are correctly blocked.
  This allows attackers to potentially access internal HTTPS services running on localhost,
  bypassing the library's SSRF protection. The vulnerability is particularly dangerous when
  the application accepts user-controlled URLs and internal services are only protected by network-level
  restrictions. This vulnerability has been fixed in request-filtering-agent version 2.0.0.
  Users should upgrade to version 2.0.0 or later.
