aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Cisco access points (AP) software could allow an authenticated,
  local attacker to inject arbitrary commands and execute them with root privileges. This vulnerability
  is due to improper input validation of commands that are issued from a wireless controller
  to an AP. An attacker with Administrator access to the CLI of the controller could exploit
  this vulnerability by issuing a command with crafted arguments. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to gain full root access on the AP.
