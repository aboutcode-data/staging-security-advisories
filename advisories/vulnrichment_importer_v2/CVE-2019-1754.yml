summary: A vulnerability in the authorization subsystem of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow
  an authenticated but unprivileged (level 1), remote attacker to run privileged Cisco IOS commands
  by using the web UI. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user privileges of

  attacker to execute arbitrary commands with higher privileges on the affected device.
