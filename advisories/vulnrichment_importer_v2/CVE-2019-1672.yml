aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Decryption Policy Default Action functionality of the Cisco
  Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured
  drop policy and allow traffic onto the network that should have been denied. The vulnerability
  is due to the incorrect handling of SSL-encrypted traffic when Decrypt for End-User Notification
  is disabled in the configuration. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
  a SSL connection through the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to bypass a configured drop policy to block specific SSL connections. Releases 10.1.x and
  10.5.x are affected.
