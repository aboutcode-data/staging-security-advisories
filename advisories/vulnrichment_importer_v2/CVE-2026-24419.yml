summary: OpenSTAManager is an open source management software for technical assistance and invoicing.
  OpenSTAManager v2.9.8 and earlier contain a critical Error-Based SQL Injection vulnerability
  in the Prima Nota (Journal Entry) module's add.php file. The application fails to validate
  that comma-separated values from the id_documenti GET parameter are integers before using
  them in SQL IN() clauses, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL commands and extract
  sensitive data through XPATH error messages.
