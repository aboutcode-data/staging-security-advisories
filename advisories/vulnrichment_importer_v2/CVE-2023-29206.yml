summary: XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top level XWiki projects.
  There was no check in the author of a JavaScript xobject or StyleSheet xobject added in a
  XWiki document, so until now it was possible for a user having only Edit Right to create such
  object and to craft a script allowing to perform some operations when executing by a user
  with appropriate rights. This has been patched in XWiki 14.9-rc-1 by only executing the script
  if the author of it has Script rights.
