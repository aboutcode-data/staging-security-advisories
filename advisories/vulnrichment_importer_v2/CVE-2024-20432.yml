summary: "A vulnerability in the REST API and web UI of Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller\
  \ (NDFC) could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, remote attacker to perform a command\
  \ injection attack against an affected device.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper\
  \ user authorization and insufficient validation of command arguments. An attacker could exploit\
  \ this vulnerability by submitting crafted commands to an affected REST API endpoint or through\
  \ the web UI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands\
  \ on the CLI of a Cisco NDFC-managed device with network-admin privileges.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nNote:\
  \ This vulnerability does not affect Cisco NDFC when it is configured for storage area network\
  \ (SAN) controller deployment."
