summary: "A vulnerability in the Out-of-Band Access Point (AP) Image Download, the Clean Air\
  \ Spectral Recording, and the client debug bundles features of Cisco IOS XE Software for Wireless\
  \ LAN Controllers (WLCs) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to upload arbitrary\
  \ files to an affected system.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to the presence of a hard-coded\
  \ JSON Web Token (JWT) on an affected system.  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by sending crafted HTTPS requests to the AP file upload interface. A successful exploit\
  \ could allow the attacker to upload files, perform path traversal, and execute arbitrary\
  \ commands with root privileges."
