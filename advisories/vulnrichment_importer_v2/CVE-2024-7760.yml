aliases: []
summary: aimhubio/aim version 3.22.0 contains a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability
  in the tracking server. The vulnerability is due to overly permissive CORS settings, allowing
  cross-origin requests from all origins. This enables CSRF attacks on all endpoints of the
  tracking server, which can be chained with other existing vulnerabilities such as remote code
  execution, denial of service, and arbitrary file read/write.
