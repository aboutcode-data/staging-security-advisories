aliases: []
summary: An OS command injection vulnerability exists in the OptiLink ONT1GEW GPON router firmware
  version V2.1.11_X101 Build 1127.190306 and earlier. The router’s web management interface
  fails to properly sanitize user input in the target_addr parameter of the formTracert and
  formPing administrative endpoints. An authenticated attacker can inject arbitrary operating
  system commands, which are executed with root privileges, leading to remote code execution.
  Successful exploitation enables full compromise of the device. Exploitation evidence was observed
  by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2025-02-04 UTC.
