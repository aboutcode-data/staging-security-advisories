aliases: []
summary: The affected Bachmann Electronic M-Base Controllers of version MSYS v1.06.14 and later
  use weak cryptography to protect device passwords. Affected controllers that are actively
  supported include MX207, MX213, MX220, MC206, MC212, MC220, and MH230 hardware controllers,
  and affected end-of-life controller include MC205, MC210, MH212, ME203, CS200, MP213, MP226,
  MPC240, MPC265, MPC270, MPC293, MPE270, and CPC210 hardware controllers. Security Level 0
  is set at default from the manufacturer, which could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker
  to gain access to the password hashes. Security Level 4 is susceptible if an authenticated
  remote attacker or an unauthenticated person with physical access to the device reads and
  decrypts the password to conduct further attacks.
