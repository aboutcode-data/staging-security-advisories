summary: Contao is an Open Source CMS. From version 4.0.0 to before 4.13.57, before 5.3.42,
  and before 5.6.5, back end users with precise control over the contents of template closures
  can execute arbitrary PHP functions that do not have required parameters. This issue has been
  patched in versions 4.13.57, 5.3.42, and 5.6.5. A workaround for this issue involves manually
  patching the Contao\Template::once() method.
