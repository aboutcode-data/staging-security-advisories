  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  char: xillybus: Don't destroy workqueue from work item running on it

  Triggered by a kref decrement, destroy_workqueue() may be called from
  within a work item for destroying its own workqueue. This illegal
  situation is averted by adding a module-global workqueue for exclusive
  use of the offending work item. Other work items continue to be queued
  on per-device workqueues to ensure performance.
