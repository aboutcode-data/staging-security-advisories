aliases: []
summary: Botan before 3.6.0, when certain GCC versions are used, has a compiler-induced secret-dependent
  operation in lib/utils/donna128.h in donna128 (used in Chacha-Poly1305 and x25519). An addition
  can be skipped if a carry is not set. This was observed for GCC 11.3.0 with -O2 on MIPS, and
  GCC on x86-i386. (Only 32-bit processors can be affected.)
