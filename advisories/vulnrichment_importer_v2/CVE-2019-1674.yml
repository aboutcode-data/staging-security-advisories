aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the update service of Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App and Cisco
  Webex Productivity Tools for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute
  arbitrary commands as a privileged user. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation
  of user-supplied parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by invoking the
  update service command with a crafted argument. An exploit could allow the attacker to run
  arbitrary commands with SYSTEM user privileges. While the CVSS Attack Vector metric denotes
  the requirement for an attacker to have local access, administrators should be aware that
  in Active Directory deployments, the vulnerability could be exploited remotely by leveraging
  the operating system remote management tools. This vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Webex Meetings
  Desktop App Release 33.6.6 and 33.9.1 releases. This vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Webex
  Productivity Tools Release 33.0.7.
