aliases: []
summary: Craft is a platform for creating digital experiences. Versions 5.0.0-RC1 through 5.8.20
  and 4.0.0-RC1 through 4.16.16 are vulnerable to potential authenticated Remote Code Execution
  via Twig SSTI. For this to work, users must have administrator access to the Craft Control
  Panel, and allowAdminChanges must be enabled, which is against Craft CMS' recommendations
  for any non-dev environment. Alternatively, a non-administrator account with allowAdminChanges
  disabled can be used, provided access to the System Messages utility is available. It is possible
  to craft a malicious payload using the Twig `map` filter in text fields that accept Twig input
  under Settings in the Craft control panel or using the System Messages utility, which could
  lead to a RCE. Users should update to the patched versions (5.8.21 and 4.16.17) to mitigate
  the issue.
