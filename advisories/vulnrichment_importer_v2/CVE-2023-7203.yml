summary: The Smart Forms WordPress plugin before 2.6.87 does not have authorisation in various
  AJAX actions, which could allow users with a role as low as subscriber to call them and perform
  unauthorised actions such as deleting entries. The plugin also lacks CSRF checks in some places
  which could allow attackers to make logged in users perform unwanted actions via CSRF attacks
  such as deleting entries.
