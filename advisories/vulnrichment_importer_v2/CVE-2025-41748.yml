aliases: []
summary: An XSS vulnerability in pxc_Dot1xCfg.php can be used by an unauthenticated remote attacker
  to trick an authenticated user to click on the link provided by the attacker in order to change
  parameters available via web based management (WBM). The vulnerability does not provide access
  to system-level resources such as operating system internals or privileged functions. Access
  is limited to device configuration parameters that are available in the context of the web
  application. The session cookie is secured by the httpOnly Flag. Therefore an attacker is
  not able to take over the session of an authenticated user.
