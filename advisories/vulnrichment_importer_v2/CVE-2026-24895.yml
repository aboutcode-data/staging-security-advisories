aliases: []
summary: FrankenPHP is a modern application server for PHP. Prior to 1.11.2, FrankenPHP’s CGI
  path splitting logic improperly handles Unicode characters during case conversion. The logic
  computes the split index (for finding .php) on a lowercased copy of the request path but applies
  that byte index to the original path. Because strings.ToLower() in Go can increase the byte
  length of certain UTF-8 characters (e.g., Ⱥ expands when lowercased), the computed index may
  not align with the correct position in the original string. This results in an incorrect SCRIPT_NAME
  and SCRIPT_FILENAME, potentially causing FrankenPHP to execute a file other than the one intended
  by the URI. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.11.2.
