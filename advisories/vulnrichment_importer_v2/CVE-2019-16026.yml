aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the implementation of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)
  on Cisco Mobility Management Entity (MME) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an eNodeB that is connected to an affected
  device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of SCTP traffic. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by leveraging a man-in-the-middle position between the eNodeB
  and the MME and then sending a crafted SCTP message to the MME. A successful exploit would
  cause the MME to stop sending SCTP messages to the eNodeB, triggering a DoS condition.
