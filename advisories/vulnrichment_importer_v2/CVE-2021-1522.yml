aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the change password API of Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX)
  could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to alter their own password to a value that
  does not comply with the strong authentication requirements that are configured on an affected
  device. This vulnerability exists because a password policy check is incomplete at the time
  a password is changed at server side using the API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a specially crafted API request to the affected device. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to change their own password to a value that does not comply with the configured
  strong authentication requirements.
