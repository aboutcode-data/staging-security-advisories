summary: |
  An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX10000 Series allows a network based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

  If a specific valid IP packet is received and that packet needs to be routed over a VXLAN tunnel, this will result in a PFE wedge condition due to which traffic gets impacted. As this is not a crash and restart scenario, this condition will persist until the system is rebooted to recover.

  This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX10000:
  20.3 version 20.3R1 and later versions;
  20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S5;
  21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S5;
  21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S5;
  21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S4;
