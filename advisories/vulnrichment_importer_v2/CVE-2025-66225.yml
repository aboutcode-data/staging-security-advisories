aliases: []
summary: OrangeHRM is a comprehensive human resource management (HRM) system. From version 5.0
  to 5.7, the password reset workflow does not enforce that the username submitted in the final
  reset request matches the account for which the reset process was originally initiated. After
  obtaining a valid reset link for any account they can receive email for, an attacker can alter
  the username parameter in the final reset request to target a different user. Because the
  system accepts the supplied username without verification, the attacker can set a new password
  for any chosen account, including privileged accounts, resulting in full account takeover.
  This issue has been patched in version 5.8.
