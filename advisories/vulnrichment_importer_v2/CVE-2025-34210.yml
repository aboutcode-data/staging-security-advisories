aliases: []
summary: Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host and Application (VA/SaaS
  deployments) store a large number of sensitive credentials (database passwords, MySQL root
  password, SaaS keys, Portainer admin password, etc.) in cleartext files that are world-readable.
  Any local user - or any process that can read the host filesystem - can retrieve all of these
  secrets in plain text, leading to credential theft and full compromise of the appliance. The
  vendor does not consider this to be a security vulnerability as this product "follows a shared
  responsibility model, where administrators are expected to configure persistent storage encryption."
