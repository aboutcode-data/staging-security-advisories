aliases: []
summary: n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. Prior to versions 1.123.9 and 2.2.1,
  a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability existed in a markdown rendering component used
  in n8n's interface, including workflow sticky notes and other areas that support markdown
  content. An authenticated user with permission to create or modify workflows could abuse this
  to execute scripts with same-origin privileges when other users interact with a maliciously
  crafted workflow. This could lead to session hijacking and account takeover. This issue has
  been patched in versions 1.123.9 and 2.2.1.
