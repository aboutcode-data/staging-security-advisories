summary: Uncontrolled Search Path Element Vulnerability in Setting and Operation Application
  for Lighting Control System MILCO.S Setting Application all versions, MILCO.S Setting Application
  (IR) all versions, MILCO.S Easy Setting Application (IR) all versions, and MILCO.S Easy Switch
  Application (IR) all versions allows a local attacker to execute malicious code by having
  installer to load a malicious DLL. However, if the signer name "Mitsubishi Electric Lighting"
  appears on the "Digital Signatures" tab of the properties for "MILCO.S Lighting Control.exe",
  the application is a fixed one. This vulnerability only affects when the installer is run,
  not after installation. If a user downloads directly from Mitsubishi Electric website and
  installs the affected product, there is no risk of malicious code being introduced.
