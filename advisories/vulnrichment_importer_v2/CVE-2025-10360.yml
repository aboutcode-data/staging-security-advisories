aliases: []
summary: 'In Puppet Enterprise versions 2025.4.0 and 2025.5, the encryption key used for encrypting
  content in the Infra Assistant database was not excluded from the files gathered by Puppet
  backup. The key is only present on the system if the user has a Puppet Enterprise Advanced
  license and has enabled the Infra Assistant feature. The key is used for encrypting one particular
  bit of data in the Infra Assistant database: the API key for their AI provider account. This
  has been fixed in Puppet Enterprise version 2025.6, and release notes for 2025.6 have remediation
  steps for users of affected versions who can''t update to the latest version.'
