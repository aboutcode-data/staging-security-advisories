  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  fgraph: Add READ_ONCE() when accessing fgraph_array[]

  In __ftrace_return_to_handler(), a loop iterates over the fgraph_array[]
  elements, which are fgraph_ops. The loop checks if an element is a
  fgraph_stub to prevent using a fgraph_stub afterward.

  However, if the compiler reloads fgraph_array[] after this check, it might
  race with an update to fgraph_array[] that introduces a fgraph_stub. This
  could result in the stub being processed, but the stub contains a null
  "func_hash" field, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

  To ensure that the gops compared against the fgraph_stub matches the gops
  processed later, add a READ_ONCE(). A similar patch appears in commit
  63a8dfb ("function_graph: Add READ_ONCE() when accessing fgraph_array[]").
