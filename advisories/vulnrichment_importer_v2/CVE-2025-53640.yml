aliases: []
summary: Indico is an event management system that uses Flask-Multipass, a multi-backend authentication
  system for Flask. Starting in version 2.2 and prior to version 3.3.7, an endpoint used to
  display details of users listed in certain fields (such as ACLs) could be misused to dump
  basic user details (such as name, affiliation and email) in bulk. Version 3.3.7 fixes the
  issue. Owners of instances that allow everyone to create a user account, who wish to truly
  restrict access to these user details, should consider restricting user search to managers.
  As a workaround, it is possible to restrict access to the affected endpoints (e.g. in the
  webserver config), but doing so would break certain form fields which could no longer show
  the details of the users listed in those fields, so upgrading instead is highly recommended.
