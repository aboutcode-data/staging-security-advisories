aliases: []
summary: Magento Long Term Support (LTS) is an unofficial, community-driven project provides
  an alternative to the Magento Community Edition e-commerce platform with a high level of backward
  compatibility. Versions prior to 20.12.3 and 20.13.0 contain a vulnerability that allows script
  execution in the admin panel which could lead to cross-site scripting against authenticated
  admin users. The attack requires an admin user with configuration access, so in practicality
  it is not very likely to be useful given that a user with this level of access is probably
  already a full admin. Versions 20.12.3 and 20.13.0 contain a patch for the issue.
