aliases: []
summary: "If an attacker gains write access to the Apache Superset metadata database, they could\
  \ persist a specifically crafted Python object that may lead to remote code execution on Superset's\
  \ web backend.\n\nThe Superset metadata db is an 'internal' component that is typically \n\
  only accessible directly by the system administrator and the superset \nprocess itself. Gaining\
  \ access to that database should\n be difficult and require significant privileges.\n\nThis\
  \ vulnerability impacts Apache Superset versions 1.5.0 up to and including 2.1.0. Users are\
  \ recommended to upgrade to version 2.1.1 or later."
