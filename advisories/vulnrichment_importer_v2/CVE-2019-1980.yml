aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the protocol detection component of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense
  Software, Cisco FirePOWER Services Software for ASA, and Cisco Firepower Management Center
  Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass filtering protections.
  The vulnerability is due to improper detection of the initial use of a protocol on a nonstandard
  port. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic on a nonstandard port
  for the protocol in use through an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to
  bypass filtering and deliver malicious requests to protected systems that would otherwise
  be blocked. Once the initial protocol flow on the nonstandard port is detected, future flows
  on the nonstandard port will be successfully detected and handled as configured by the applied
  policy.
