summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  regulator: dummy: force synchronous probing

  Sometimes I get a NULL pointer dereference at boot time in kobject_get()
  with the following call stack:

  anatop_regulator_probe()
   devm_regulator_register()
    regulator_register()
     regulator_resolve_supply()
      kobject_get()

  By placing some extra BUG_ON() statements I could verify that this is
  raised because probing of the 'dummy' regulator driver is not completed
  ('dummy_regulator_rdev' is still NULL).

  In the JTAG debugger I can see that dummy_regulator_probe() and
  anatop_regulator_probe() can be run by different kernel threads
  (kworker/u4:*).  I haven't further investigated whether this can be
  changed or if there are other possibilities to force synchronization
  between these two probe routines.  On the other hand I don't expect much
  boot time penalty by probing the 'dummy' regulator synchronously.
