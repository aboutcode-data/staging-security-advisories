aliases: []
summary: The Opal Estate Pro – Property Management and Submission plugin for WordPress, used
  by the FullHouse - Real Estate Responsive WordPress Theme, is vulnerable to privilege escalation
  via in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.5. This is due to a lack of role restriction
  during registration in the 'on_regiser_user' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to arbitrarily choose the role, including the Administrator role, assigned when
  registering.
