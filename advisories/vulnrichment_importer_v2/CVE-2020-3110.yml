aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol implementation for the Cisco Video
  Surveillance 8000 Series IP Cameras could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute
  code remotely or cause a reload of an affected IP Camera. The vulnerability is due to missing
  checks when processing Cisco Discovery Protocol messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to the targeted IP Camera. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to expose the affected IP Camera for remote code execution
  or cause it to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Cisco
  Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must
  be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent). This vulnerability
  is fixed in Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP Camera Firmware Release 1.0.7 and later.
