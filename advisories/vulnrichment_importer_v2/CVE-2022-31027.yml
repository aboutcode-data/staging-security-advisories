aliases: []
summary: OAuthenticator is an OAuth token library for the JupyerHub login handler. CILogonOAuthenticator
  is provided by the OAuthenticator package, and lets users log in to a JupyterHub via CILogon.
  This is primarily used to restrict a JupyterHub only to users of a given institute. The allowed_idps
  configuration trait of CILogonOAuthenticator is documented to be a list of domains that indicate
  the institutions whose users are authorized to access this JupyterHub. This authorization
  is validated by ensuring that the *email* field provided to us by CILogon has a *domain* that
  matches one of the domains listed in `allowed_idps`.If `allowed_idps` contains `berkeley.edu`,
  you might expect only users with valid current credentials provided by University of California,
  Berkeley to be able to access the JupyterHub. However, CILogonOAuthenticator does *not* verify
  which provider is used by the user to login, only the email address provided. So a user can
  login with a GitHub account that has email set to `<something>@berkeley.edu`, and that will
  be treated exactly the same as someone logging in using the UC Berkeley official Identity
  Provider. The patch fixing this issue makes a *breaking change* in how `allowed_idps` is interpreted.
  It's no longer a list of domains, but configuration representing the `EntityID` of the IdPs
  that are allowed, picked from the [list maintained by CILogon](https://cilogon.org/idplist/).
  Users are advised to upgrade.
