aliases: []
summary: Vickey is a Misskey-based microblogging platform. A vulnerability exists in Vickey
  prior to version 2025.10.0 where unexpired email confirmation links can be reused multiple
  times to send repeated confirmation emails to a verified email address. Under certain conditions,
  a verified email address could receive repeated confirmation messages if the verification
  link was accessed multiple times. This issue may result in unintended email traffic but does
  not expose user data. The issue was addressed in version 2025.10.0 by improving validation
  logic to ensure verification links behave as expected after completion.
