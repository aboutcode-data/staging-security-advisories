aliases: []
summary: Tauri is a framework for building binaries for all major desktop platforms. The filesystem
  glob pattern wildcards `*`, `?`, and `[...]` match file path literals and leading dots by
  default, which unintentionally exposes sub folder content of allowed paths. Scopes without
  the wildcards are not affected. As `**` allows for sub directories the behavior there is also
  as expected. The issue has been patched in the latest release and was backported into the
  currently supported 1.x branches. There are no known workarounds at the time of publication.
