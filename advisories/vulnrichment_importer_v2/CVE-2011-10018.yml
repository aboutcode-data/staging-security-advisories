summary: myBB version 1.6.4 was distributed with an unauthorized backdoor embedded in the source
  code. The backdoor allowed remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code by injecting payloads

  and was not part of the intended application logic. Exploitation requires no authentication
  and results in full compromise of the web server under the context of the web application.
