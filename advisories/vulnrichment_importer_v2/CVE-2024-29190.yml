aliases: []
summary: Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) is a pen-testing, malware analysis and security assessment
  framework capable of performing static and dynamic analysis. In version 3.9.5 Beta and prior,
  MobSF does not perform any input validation when extracting the hostnames in `android:host`,
  so requests can also be sent to local hostnames. This can lead to server-side request forgery.
  An attacker can cause the server to make a connection to internal-only services within the
  organization's infrastructure. Commit 5a8eeee73c5f504a6c3abdf2a139a13804efdb77 has a hotfix
  for this issue.
