datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2020/3xxx/CVE-2020-3275.json
aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business
  RV320 and RV325 Series Routers and Cisco Small Business RV016, RV042, and RV082 Routers could
  allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges to execute arbitrary
  commands on an affected device. The vulnerabilities exist because the web-based management
  interface does not properly validate user-supplied input to scripts. An attacker with administrative
  privileges that are sufficient to log in to the web-based management interface could exploit
  each vulnerability by sending malicious requests to an affected device. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the underlying
  operating system.
