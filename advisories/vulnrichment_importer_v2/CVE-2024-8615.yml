aliases: []
summary: The JobSearch WP Job Board plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
  due to missing file type validation in the jobsearch_location_load_excel_file_callback() function
  in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution
  possible.
