summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Integrated Management
  Controller (IMC) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary
  commands that are executed with root privileges on an affected device. An attacker would need
  to have valid administrator credentials on the device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  validation of user-supplied input by the affected software. An attacker with elevated privileges
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted commands to the administrative web management
  interface of the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject
  and execute arbitrary, system-level commands with root privileges on an affected device.
