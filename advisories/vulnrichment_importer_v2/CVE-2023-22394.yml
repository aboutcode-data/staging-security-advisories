summary: 'An Improper Handling of Unexpected Data Type vulnerability in the handling of SIP
  calls in Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series and MX Series platforms allows an attacker
  to cause a memory leak leading to Denial of Services (DoS). This issue occurs on all MX Series
  platforms with MS-MPC or MS-MIC card and all SRX Series platforms where SIP ALG is enabled.
  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability prevents additional SIP calls and applications
  from succeeding. The SIP ALG needs to be enabled, either implicitly / by default or by way
  of configuration. To confirm whether SIP ALG is enabled on SRX use the following command:
  user@host> show security alg status | match sip SIP : Enabled This issue affects Juniper Networks
  Junos OS on SRX Series and on MX Series: All versions prior to 19.3R3-S7; 19.4 versions prior
  to 19.4R2-S8, 19.4R3-S10; 20.1 versions 20.1R1 and later versions; 20.2 versions prior to
  20.2R3-S6; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S6; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S5; 21.1 versions
