aliases: []
summary: sprintf in the GNU C Library (glibc) 2.37 has a buffer overflow (out-of-bounds write)
  in some situations with a correct buffer size. This is unrelated to CWE-676. It may write
  beyond the bounds of the destination buffer when attempting to write a padded, thousands-separated
  string representation of a number, if the buffer is allocated the exact size required to represent
  that number as a string. For example, 1,234,567 (with padding to 13) overflows by two bytes.
