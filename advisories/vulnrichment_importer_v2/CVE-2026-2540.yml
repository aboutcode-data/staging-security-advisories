aliases: []
summary: The Micca KE700 system contains flawed resynchronization logic and is vulnerable to
  replay attacks. This attack requires sending two previously captured codes in a specific sequence.
  As a result, the system can be forced to accept previously used (stale) rolling codes and
  execute a command. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to clone the alarm key. This
  grants the attacker unauthorized access to the vehicle to unlock or lock the doors.
