  drm/buddy: Fix alloc_range() error handling code

  Few users have observed display corruption when they boot
  the machine to KDE Plasma or playing games. We have root
  caused the problem that whenever alloc_range() couldn't
  find the required memory blocks the function was returning
  SUCCESS in some of the corner cases.

  The right approach would be if the total allocated size
  is less than the required size, the function should
  return -ENOSPC.
