aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  Drivers: vmbus: Check for channel allocation before looking up relids

  relid2channel() assumes vmbus channel array to be allocated when called.
  However, in cases such as kdump/kexec, not all relids will be reset by the host.
  When the second kernel boots and if the guest receives a vmbus interrupt during
  vmbus driver initialization before vmbus_connect() is called, before it finishes,
  or if it fails, the vmbus interrupt service routine is called which in turn calls
  relid2channel() and can cause a null pointer dereference.

  Print a warning and error out in relid2channel() for a channel id that's invalid
  in the second kernel.
