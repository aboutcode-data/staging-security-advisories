aliases: []
summary: In Rhonabwy through 1.1.13, HMAC signature verification uses a strcmp function that
  is vulnerable to side-channel attacks, because it stops the comparison when the first difference
  is spotted in the two signatures. (The fix uses gnutls_memcmp, which has constant-time execution.)
