datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2025/20xxx/CVE-2025-20366.json
aliases: []
summary: In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.4.4, 9.3.6, and 9.2.8, and Splunk Cloud Platform
  versions below 9.3.2411.111, 9.3.2408.119, and 9.2.2406.122, a low-privileged user that does
  not hold the admin or power Splunk roles could access sensitive search results if Splunk Enterprise
  runs an administrative search job in the background. If the low privileged user guesses the
  search job’s unique Search ID (SID), the user could retrieve the results of that job, potentially
  exposing sensitive search results. For more information see https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/search/search-manual/10.0/manage-jobs/about-jobs-and-job-management
  and https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/search/search-manual/10.0/manage-jobs/manage-search-jobs.
