aliases: []
summary: An unauthorized file deletion vulnerability exists in the latest version of the Polyaxon
  platform, which can lead to denial of service by terminating critical containers. An attacker
  can delete important files within the containers, such as `polyaxon.sock`, causing the API
  container to exit unexpectedly. This disrupts related services and prevents the system from
  functioning normally, without requiring authentication or UUID parameters.
