aliases: []
summary: HTTP.jl provides HTTP client and server functionality for Julia, and URIs.jl parses
  and works with Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). URIs.jl prior to version 1.6.0 and HTTP.jl
  prior to version 1.10.17 allows the construction of URIs containing CR/LF characters. If user
  input was not otherwise escaped or protected, this can lead to a CRLF injection attack. Users
  of HTTP.jl should upgrade immediately to HTTP.jl v1.10.17, and users of URIs.jl should upgrade
  immediately to URIs.jl v1.6.0. The check for valid URIs is now in the URI.jl package, and
  the latest version of HTTP.jl incorporates that fix. As a workaround, manually validate any
  URIs before passing them on to functions in this package.
