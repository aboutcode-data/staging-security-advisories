aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/amd/display: fix a NULL pointer dereference in amdgpu_dm_i2c_xfer()

  When ddc_service_construct() is called, it explicitly checks both the
  link type and whether there is something on the link which will
  dictate whether the pin is marked as hw_supported.

  If the pin isn't set or the link is not set (such as from
  unloading/reloading amdgpu in an IGT test) then fail the
  amdgpu_dm_i2c_xfer() call.
