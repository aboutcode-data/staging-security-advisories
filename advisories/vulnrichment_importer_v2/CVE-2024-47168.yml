aliases: []
summary: Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability
  involves data exposure due to the enable_monitoring flag not properly disabling monitoring
  when set to False. Even when monitoring is supposedly disabled, an attacker or unauthorized
  user can still access the monitoring dashboard by directly requesting the /monitoring endpoint.
  This means that sensitive application analytics may still be exposed, particularly in environments
  where monitoring is expected to be disabled. Users who set enable_monitoring=False to prevent
  unauthorized access to monitoring data are impacted. Users are advised to upgrade to gradio>=4.44
  to address this issue. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
