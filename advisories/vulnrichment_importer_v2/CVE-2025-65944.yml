summary: 'Sentry-Javascript is an official Sentry SDKs for JavaScript. From version 10.11.0
  to before 10.27.0, when a Node.js application using the Sentry SDK has sendDefaultPii: true
  it is possible to inadvertently send certain sensitive HTTP headers, including the Cookie
  header, to Sentry. Those headers would be stored within a Sentry organization as part of the
  associated trace. A person with access to the Sentry organization could then view and use
  these sensitive values to impersonate or escalate their privileges within the application.
  This issue has been patched in version 10.27.0.'
