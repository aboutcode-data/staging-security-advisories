aliases: []
summary: OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to version 2026.2.15, OpenClaw embedded
  the current working directory (workspace path) into the agent system prompt without sanitization.
  If an attacker can cause OpenClaw to run inside a directory whose name contains control/format
  characters (for example newlines or Unicode bidi/zero-width markers), those characters could
  break the prompt structure and inject attacker-controlled instructions. Starting in version
  2026.2.15, the workspace path is sanitized before it is embedded into any LLM prompt output,
  stripping Unicode control/format characters and explicit line/paragraph separators. Workspace
  path resolution also applies the same sanitization as defense-in-depth.
