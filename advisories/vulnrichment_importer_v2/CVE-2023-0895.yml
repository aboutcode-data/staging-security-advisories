aliases: []
summary: The WP Coder – add custom html, css and js code plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to time-based SQL Injection via the ‘id’ parameter in versions up to, and including, 2.5.3
  due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation
  on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrative
  privileges to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used
  to extract sensitive information from the database.
