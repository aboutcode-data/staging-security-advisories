summary: The WP Activity Log Premium plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.5.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce
  validation on the ajax_switch_db function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to make changes to the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site
  administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
