summary: The BSP applications allow an unauthenticated user to inject malicious script content
  via user-controlled URL parameters that are not sufficiently sanitized. When a victim accesses
  a crafted URL, the injected script is executed in the victim�s browser, leading to a low impact
  on confidentiality and integrity, and no impact on the availability of the application.
