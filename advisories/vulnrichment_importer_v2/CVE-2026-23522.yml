aliases: []
summary: LobeChat is an open source chat application platform. Prior to version 2.0.0-next.193,
  `knowledgeBase.removeFilesFromKnowledgeBase` tRPC ep allows authenticated users to delete
  files from any knowledge base without verifying ownership. `userId` filter in the database
  query is commented out, so it's enabling attackers to delete other users' KB files if they
  know the knowledge base ID and file ID. While the vulnerability is confirmed, practical exploitation
  requires knowing target's KB ID and target's file ID. These IDs are random and not easily
  enumerable. However, IDs may leak through shared links, logs, referrer headers and so on.
  Missing authorization check is a critical security flaw regardless. Users should upgrade to
  version 2.0.0-next.193 to receive a patch.
