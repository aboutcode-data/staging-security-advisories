aliases: []
summary: vscode-spell-checker is a basic spell checker that works well with code and documents.
  Prior to v4.5.4, DocumentSettings._determineIsTrusted treats the configuration value cSpell.trustedWorkspace
  as the authoritative trust flag. The value defaults to true (package.json) and is read from
  workspace configuration each time settings are fetched. The code coerces any truthy value
  to true and forwards it to ConfigLoader.setIsTrusted , which in turn allows JavaScript/TypeScript
  configuration files ( .cspell.config.js/.mjs/.ts , etc.) to be located and executed. Because
  no VS Code workspace-trust state is consulted, an untrusted workspace can keep the flag true
  and place a malicious .cspell.config.js ; opening the workspace causes the extension host
  to execute attacker-controlled Node.js code with the user’s privileges. This vulnerability
  is fixed in v4.5.4.
