summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV340,\
  \ RV340W, RV345, and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote\
  \ attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device. In order to exploit this vulnerability,\
  \ the attacker must have valid admin credentials.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because\
  \ the web-based management interface does not sufficiently validate user-supplied input. An\
  \ attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP input to an affected device.\

  \ on the underlying operating system."
