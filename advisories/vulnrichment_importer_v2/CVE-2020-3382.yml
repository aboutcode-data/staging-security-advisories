aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary actions
  with administrative privileges on an affected device. The vulnerability exists because different
  installations share a static encryption key. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by using the static key to craft a valid session token. A successful exploit could allow the
  attacker to perform arbitrary actions through the REST API with administrative privileges.
