aliases: []
summary: Cosign provides code signing and transparency for containers and binaries. Prior to
  version 2.2.4, maliciously-crafted software artifacts can cause denial of service of the machine
  running Cosign thereby impacting all services on the machine. The root cause is that Cosign
  creates slices based on the number of signatures, manifests or attestations in untrusted artifacts.
  As such, the untrusted artifact can control the amount of memory that Cosign allocates. The
  exact issue is Cosign allocates excessive memory on the lines that creates a slice of the
  same length as the manifests. Version 2.2.4 contains a patch for the vulnerability.
