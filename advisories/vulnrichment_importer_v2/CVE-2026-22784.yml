aliases: []
summary: Lychee is a free, open-source photo-management tool. Prior to 7.1.0, an authorization
  vulnerability exists in Lychee's album password unlock functionality that allows users to
  gain possibly unauthorized access to other users' password-protected albums. When a user unlocks
  a password-protected public album, the system automatically unlocks ALL other public albums
  that share the same password, resulting in a complete authorization bypass. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 7.1.0.
