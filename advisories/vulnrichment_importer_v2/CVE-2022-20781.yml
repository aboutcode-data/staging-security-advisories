aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco AsyncOS Software for
  Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct
  a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface of an affected
  device. The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly
  validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious
  data into a specific data field in an affected interface. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface.
