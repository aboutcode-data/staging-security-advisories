aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the implementation of the PROFINET Discovery and Configuration
  Protocol (PN-DCP) for Cisco IOS 12.2 through 15.6 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The
  vulnerability is due to the improper parsing of ingress PN-DCP Identify Request packets destined
  to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PN-DCP
  Identify Request packet to an affected device and then continuing to send normal PN-DCP Identify
  Request packets to the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the
  affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects Cisco
  devices that are configured to process PROFINET messages. Beginning with Cisco IOS Software
  Release 12.2(52)SE, PROFINET is enabled by default on all the base switch module and expansion-unit
  Ethernet ports. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCuz47179.'
