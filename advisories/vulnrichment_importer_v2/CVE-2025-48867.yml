aliases: []
summary: Horilla is a free and open source Human Resource Management System (HRMS). A stored
  cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Horilla HRM 1.3.0 allows authenticated admin or
  privileged users to inject malicious JavaScript payloads into multiple fields in the Project
  and Task modules. These payloads persist in the database and are executed when viewed by an
  admin or other privileged users through the web interface. Although the issue is not exploitable
  by unauthenticated users, it still poses a high risk of session hijacking and unauthorized
  action within high-privilege accounts. At time of publication there is no known patch.
