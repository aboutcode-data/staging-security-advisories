aliases: []
summary: The UserPro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Security Feature Bypass in all versions
  up to, and including, 5.1.6. This is due to the use of client-side restrictions to enforce
  the 'Disabled registration' Membership feature within the plugin's General settings. This
  makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register an account even when account registration
  has been disabled by an administrator.
