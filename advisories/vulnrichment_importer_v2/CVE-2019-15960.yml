summary: A vulnerability in the Webex Network Recording Admin page of Cisco Webex Meetings could
  allow an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate privileges in the context of the affected
  page. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be logged in as a low-level administrator.
  The vulnerability is due to insufficient access control validation. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by submitting a crafted URL request to gain privileged access in the context

  they would not normally be able to access.
