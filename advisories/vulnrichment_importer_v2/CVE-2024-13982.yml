aliases: []
summary: SPON IP Network Broadcast System, a digital audio transmission platform developed by
  SPON Communications, contains an arbitrary file read vulnerability in the rj_get_token.php
  endpoint. The flaw arises from insufficient input validation on the jsondata[url] parameter,
  which allows attackers to perform directory traversal and access sensitive files on the server.
  An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted POST
  request to read arbitrary files, potentially exposing system configuration, credentials, or
  internal logic. An affected version range is undefined.
