aliases: []
summary: 'AiKaan Cloud Controller uses a single hardcoded SSH private key and the username `proxyuser`
  for remote terminal access to all managed IoT/edge devices. When an administrator initiates
  "Open Remote Terminal" from the AiKaan dashboard, the controller sends this same static private
  key to the target device. The device then uses it to establish a reverse SSH tunnel to a remote
  access server, enabling browser-based SSH access for the administrator. Because the same `proxyuser`
  account and SSH key are reused across all customer environments: - An attacker who obtains
  the key (e.g., by intercepting it in transit, extracting it from the remote access server,
  or from a compromised admin account) can impersonate any managed device. - They can establish
  unauthorized reverse SSH tunnels and interact with devices without the owner''s consent. This
  is a design flaw in the authentication model: compromise of a single key compromises the trust
  boundary between the controller and devices.'
