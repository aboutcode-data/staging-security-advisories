summary: 'In UsbCoreDxe, tampering with the contents of the USB working buffer using DMA while
  certain USB transactions are in process leads to a TOCTOU problem that could be used by an
  attacker to cause SMRAM corruption and escalation of privileges The UsbCoreDxe module creates
  a working buffer for USB transactions outside of SMRAM. The code which uses can be inside
  of SMM, making the working buffer untrusted input. The buffer can be corrupted by DMA transfers.
  The SMM code code attempts to sanitize pointers to ensure all pointers refer to the working
  buffer, but when a pointer is not found in the list of pointers to sanitize, the current action
  is not aborted, leading to undefined behavior. This issue was discovered by Insyde engineering
  based on the general description provided by Intel''s iSTARE group. Fixed in: Kernel 5.0:
