aliases: []
summary: openITCOCKPIT is an open source monitoring tool built for different monitoring engines
  like Nagios, Naemon and Prometheus. openITCOCKPIT Community Edition 5.3.1 and earlier contains
  an unsafe PHP deserialization pattern in the processing of changelog entries. Serialized changelog
  data derived from attacker-influenced application state is unserialized without restricting
  allowed classes. Although no current application endpoint was found to introduce PHP objects
  into this data path, the presence of an unrestricted unserialize() call constitutes a latent
  PHP object injection vulnerability. If future code changes, plugins, or refactors introduce
  object values into this path, the vulnerability could become immediately exploitable with
  severe impact, including potential remote code execution.
