aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the IPv6 packet processing engine of Cisco Small Business Smart
  and Managed Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of
  service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation
  of incoming IPv6 traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted
  IPv6 packet through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause
  the switch management CLI to stop responding, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability
  is specific to IPv6 traffic. IPv4 traffic is not affected.
