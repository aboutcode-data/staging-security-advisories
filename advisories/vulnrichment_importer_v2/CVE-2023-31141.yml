aliases: []
summary: OpenSearch is open-source software suite for search, analytics, and observability applications.
  Prior to versions 1.3.10 and 2.7.0, there is an issue with the implementation of fine-grained
  access control rules (document-level security, field-level security and field masking) where
  they are not correctly applied to the queries during extremely rare race conditions potentially
  leading to incorrect access authorization. For this issue to be triggered, two concurrent
  requests need to land on the same instance exactly when query cache eviction happens, once
  every four hours. OpenSearch 1.3.10 and 2.7.0 contain a fix for this issue.
