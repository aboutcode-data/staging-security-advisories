summary: 'Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. In affected
  versions if a Next.js application is performing authorization in middleware based on pathname,
  it was possible for this authorization to be bypassed for pages directly under the application''s
  root directory. For example: * [Not affected] `https://example.com/` * [Affected] `https://example.com/foo`
  * [Not affected] `https://example.com/foo/bar`. This issue is patched in Next.js `14.2.15`
  and later. If your Next.js application is hosted on Vercel, this vulnerability has been automatically
  mitigated, regardless of Next.js version. There are no official workarounds for this vulnerability.'
