summary: The AuthorSure plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in
  all versions up to, and including, 2.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation

  and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
