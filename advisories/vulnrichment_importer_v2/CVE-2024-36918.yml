  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  bpf: Check bloom filter map value size

  This patch adds a missing check to bloom filter creating, rejecting
  values above KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE. This brings the bloom map in line with
  many other map types.

  The lack of this protection can cause kernel crashes for value sizes
  that overflow int's. Such a crash was caught by syzkaller. The next
  patch adds more guard-rails at a lower level.
