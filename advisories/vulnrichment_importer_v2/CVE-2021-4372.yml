aliases: []
summary: The WooCommerce Dynamic Pricing and Discounts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 2.4.1. This is due to missing
  sanitization on the settings imported via the import() function. This makes it possible for
  unauthenticated attackers to import a settings file containing malicious JavaScript that would
  execute when an administrator accesses the settings area of the site.
