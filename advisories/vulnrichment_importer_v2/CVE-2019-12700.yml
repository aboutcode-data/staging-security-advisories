aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the configuration of the Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) used
  in Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software, Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC)
  Software, and Cisco FXOS Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a
  denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper resource management
  in the context of user session management. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
  connecting to an affected system and performing many simultaneous successful Secure Shell
  (SSH) logins. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust system resources and
  cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. To exploit this vulnerability, the
  attacker needs valid user credentials on the system.
