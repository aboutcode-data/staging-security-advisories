aliases: []
summary: 'OpenFGA is an authorization/permission engine. OpenFGA versions 1.8.0 through 1.8.12
  (corresponding to Helm chart openfga-0.2.16 through openfga-0.2.30 and docker 1.8.0 through
  1.8.12) are vulnerable to authorization bypass when certain Check and ListObject calls are
  executed. Users are affected under four specific conditions: First, calling Check API or ListObjects
  with an authorization model that has a relationship directly assignable by both type bound
  public access and userset; second, there are check or list object queries with contextual
  tuples for the relationship that can be directly assignable by both type bound public access
  and userset; third, those contextual tuples’s user field is an userset; and finally, type
  bound public access tuples are not assigned to the relationship. Users should upgrade to version
  1.8.13 to receive a patch. The upgrade is backwards compatible.'
