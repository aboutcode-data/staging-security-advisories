aliases: []
summary: PolarLearn is a free and open-source learning program. In 0-PRERELEASE-15 and earlier,
  the OAuth 2.0 implementation for GitHub and Google login providers is vulnerable to Login
  Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The application fails to implement and verify the state
  parameter during the authentication flow. This allows an attacker to pre-authenticate a session
  and trick a victim into logging into the attacker's account. Any data the victim then enters
  or academic progress they make is stored on the attacker's account, leading to data loss for
  the victim and information disclosure to the attacker.
