aliases: []
summary: Directus is a free and open-source data platform for headless content management. The
  Directus process can be aborted by having an authorized user update the `filename_disk` value
  to a folder and accessing that file through the `/assets` endpoint. This vulnerability has
  been patched and release v9.15.0 contains the fix. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable
  to upgrade may prevent this problem by making sure no (untrusted) non-admin users have permissions
  to update the `filename_disk` field on `directus_files`.
