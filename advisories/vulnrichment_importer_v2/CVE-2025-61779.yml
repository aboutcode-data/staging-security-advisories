aliases: []
summary: Confidential Containers's Trustee project contains tools and components for attesting
  confidential guests and providing secrets to them. In versions prior to 0.15.0, the attestation-policy
  endpoint didn't check if the kbs-client submitting the request was actually authenticated
  (had the right key). This allowed any kbs-client to actually change the attestation policy.
  Version 0.15.0 fixes the issue.
