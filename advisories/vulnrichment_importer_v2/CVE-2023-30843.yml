aliases: []
summary: Payload is a free and open source headless content management system. In versions prior
  to 1.7.0, if a user has access to documents that contain hidden fields or fields they do not
  have access to, the user could reverse-engineer those values via brute force. Version 1.7.0
  contains a patch. As a workaround, write a `beforeOperation` hook to remove `where` queries
  that attempt to access hidden field data.
