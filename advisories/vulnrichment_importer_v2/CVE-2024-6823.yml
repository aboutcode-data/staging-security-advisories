aliases: []
summary: The Media Library Assistant plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
  due to missing file type validation involving the mla-inline-edit-upload-scripts AJAX action
  in all versions up to, and including, 3.18. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server
  which may make remote code execution possible.
