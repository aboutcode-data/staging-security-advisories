summary: The Post Form – Registration Form – Profile Form for User Profiles – Frontend Content
  Forms for User Submissions (UGC) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
  in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.11. This is due to plugin not properly restricting
  what users have access to set the default role on registration forms. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to create a registration
  form with a custom role that allows them to register as administrators.
