  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  userfaultfd: release page in error path to avoid BUG_ON

  Consider the following sequence of events:

  1. Userspace issues a UFFD ioctl, which ends up calling into
     shmem_mfill_atomic_pte(). We successfully account the blocks, we
     shmem_alloc_page(), but then the copy_from_user() fails. We return
     -ENOENT. We don't release the page we allocated.
  2. Our caller detects this error code, tries the copy_from_user() after
     dropping the mmap_lock, and retries, calling back into
     shmem_mfill_atomic_pte().
  3. Meanwhile, let's say another process filled up the tmpfs being used.
  4. So shmem_mfill_atomic_pte() fails to account blocks this time, and
     immediately returns - without releasing the page.

  This triggers a BUG_ON in our caller, which asserts that the page
  should always be consumed, unless -ENOENT is returned.

  To fix this, detect if we have such a "dangling" page when accounting
  fails, and if so, release it before returning.
