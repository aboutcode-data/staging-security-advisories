  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/msm/dpu: move dpu_encoder's connector assignment to atomic_enable()

  For cases where the crtc's connectors_changed was set without enable/active
  getting toggled , there is an atomic_enable() call followed by an
  atomic_disable() but without an atomic_mode_set().

  This results in a NULL ptr access for the dpu_encoder_get_drm_fmt() call in
  the atomic_enable() as the dpu_encoder's connector was cleared in the
  atomic_disable() but not re-assigned as there was no atomic_mode_set() call.

  Fix the NULL ptr access by moving the assignment for atomic_enable() and also
  use drm_atomic_get_new_connector_for_encoder() to get the connector from
  the atomic_state.
