  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ext4: make sure the first directory block is not a hole

  The syzbot constructs a directory that has no dirblock but is non-inline,
  i.e. the first directory block is a hole. And no errors are reported when
  creating files in this directory in the following flow.

      ext4_mknod
       ...
        ext4_add_entry
          // Read block 0
          ext4_read_dirblock(dir, block, DIRENT)
            bh = ext4_bread(NULL, inode, block, 0)
            if (!bh && (type == INDEX || type == DIRENT_HTREE))
            // The first directory block is a hole
            // But type == DIRENT, so no error is reported.

  After that, we get a directory block without '.' and '..' but with a valid
  dentry. This may cause some code that relies on dot or dotdot (such as
  make_indexed_dir()) to crash.

  Therefore when ext4_read_dirblock() finds that the first directory block
  is a hole report that the filesystem is corrupted and return an error to
  avoid loading corrupted data from disk causing something bad.
