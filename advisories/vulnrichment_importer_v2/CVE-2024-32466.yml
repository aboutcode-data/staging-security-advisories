aliases: []
summary: Tolgee is an open-source localization platform. For the `/v2/projects/translations`
  and `/v2/projects/{projectId}/translations` endpoints, translation data was returned even
  when API key was missing `translation.view` scope. However, it was impossible to fetch the
  data when user was missing this scope. So this is only relevant for API keys generated by
  users permitted to `translation.view`. This vulnerability is fixed in v3.57.2
