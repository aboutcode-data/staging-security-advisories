aliases: []
summary: JumpServer is an open source bastion host and an operation and maintenance security
  audit system. Attackers can bypass the input validation mechanism in JumpServer's Ansible
  to execute arbitrary code within the Celery container. Since the Celery container runs with
  root privileges and has database access, attackers could steal sensitive information from
  all hosts or manipulate the database. This vulnerability is fixed in v3.10.7.
