aliases: []
summary: 'Synapse is a Matrix protocol homeserver written in Python with the Twisted framework.
  A discovered oEmbed or image URL can bypass the `url_preview_url_blacklist` setting potentially
  allowing server side request forgery or bypassing network policies. Impact is limited to IP
  addresses allowed by the `url_preview_ip_range_blacklist` setting (by default this only allows
  public IPs) and by the limited information returned to the client: 1. For discovered oEmbed
  URLs, any non-JSON response or a JSON response which includes non-oEmbed information is discarded.
  2. For discovered image URLs, any non-image response is discarded. Systems which have URL
  preview disabled (via the `url_preview_enabled` setting) or have not configured a `url_preview_url_blacklist`
  are not affected. This issue has been addressed in version 1.85.0. Users are advised to upgrade.
  User unable to upgrade may also disable URL previews.'
