summary: The Login Manager – Design Login Page, View Login Activity, Limit Login Attempts plugin
  for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Custom logo and background
  URLs in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and
  output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level

  a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations
  where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
