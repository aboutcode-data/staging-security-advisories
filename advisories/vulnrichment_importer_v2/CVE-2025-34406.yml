aliases: []
summary: MailEnable versions prior to 10.54 contain a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
  in the Id parameter of /Mobile/ContactDetails.aspx. The Id value is not properly sanitized
  when processed via a GET request and is reflected within a <script> block in the response.
  By supplying a crafted payload that terminates an existing JavaScript function, inserts attacker-controlled
  script, and comments out remaining code, a remote attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript
  in a victim’s browser when the victim opens a malicious link. Successful exploitation can
  redirect victims to malicious sites, steal cookies not protected by HttpOnly, inject arbitrary
  HTML or CSS, and perform actions as the authenticated user.
