aliases: []
summary: The WP-Recall – Registration, Profile, Commerce & More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'public-form' shortcode in all versions up
  to, and including, 16.26.10 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on
  user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses an injected page.
