  vhost-vdpa: fix vm_flags for virtqueue doorbell mapping

  The virtqueue doorbell is usually implemented via registeres but we
  don't provide the necessary vma->flags like VM_PFNMAP. This may cause
  several issues e.g when userspace tries to map the doorbell via vhost
  IOTLB, kernel may panic due to the page is not backed by page
  structure. This patch fixes this by setting the necessary
  vm_flags. With this patch, try to map doorbell via IOTLB will fail
  with bad address.
