aliases: []
summary: Unitree Go2 firmware versions 1.1.7 through 1.1.11, when used with the Unitree Go2
  Android application (com.unitree.doggo2), are vulnerable to remote code execution due to missing
  integrity protection and validation of user-created programmes. The Android application stores
  programs in a local SQLite database (unitree_go2.db, table dog_programme) and transmits the
  programme_text content, including the pyCode field, to the robot. The robot's actuator_manager.py
  executes the supplied Python as root without integrity verification or content validation.
  An attacker with local access to the Android device can tamper with the stored programme record
  to inject arbitrary Python that executes when the user triggers the program via a controller
  keybinding, and the malicious binding persists across reboots. Additionally, a malicious program
  shared through the application's community marketplace can result in arbitrary code execution
  on any robot that imports and runs it.
