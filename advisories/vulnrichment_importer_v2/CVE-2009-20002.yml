aliases: []
summary: Millenium MP3 Studio versions up to and including 2.0 is vulnerable to a stack-based
  buffer overflow when parsing .pls playlist files. The application fails to properly validate
  the length of the File1 field within the playlist, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious
  .pls file that overwrites the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) and executes arbitrary code.
  Exploitation requires the victim to open the file locally, though remote execution may be
  possible if the .pls extension is registered to the application and opened via a browser.
