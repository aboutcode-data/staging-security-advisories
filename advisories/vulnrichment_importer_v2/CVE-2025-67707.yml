aliases: []
summary: |
  ArcGIS Server versions 11.5 and earlier on Windows and Linux do not sufficiently validate uploaded files, enabling a remote unauthenticated attacker to upload arbitrary files to the server’s designated upload directories.

  However, the server’s architecture enforces controls that restrict uploaded files to non‑executable storage locations and prevent modification or replacement of existing application components or system configurations. Uploaded files cannot be executed, leveraged to escalate privileges, or used to access sensitive data.

  Because the issue does not enable execution, service disruption, unauthorized access, or integrity compromise, its impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability is low. Note that race conditions, secret values, or man‑in‑the‑middle conditions are required for exploitation.
