aliases: []
summary: The SMTP by BestWebSoft plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
  due to missing file type validation in the 'save_options' function in all versions up to,
  and including, 1.1.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level
  access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote
  code execution possible.
