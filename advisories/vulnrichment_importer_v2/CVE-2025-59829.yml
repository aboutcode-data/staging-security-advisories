aliases: []
summary: Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. Versions below 1.0.120 failed to account for
  symlinks when checking permission deny rules. If a user explicitly denied Claude Code access
  to a file and Claude Code had access to a symlink pointing to that file, it was possible for
  Claude Code to access the file. Users on standard Claude Code auto-update will have received
  this fix automatically. Users performing manual updates are advised to update to the latest
  version. This issue is fixed in version 1.0.120.
