  Server (SRMS) at any node, when an Area Border Router (ABR) leaks the SRMS entries having
  "S" flag set from IS-IS Level 2 to Level 1, an rpd core might be observed when a specific
  low privileged CLI command is issued. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS 21.4 versions
  prior to 21.4R1-S2, 21.4R2-S1, 21.4R3; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R2. Juniper Networks Junos
  OS Evolved 21.4-EVO versions prior to 21.4R1-S2-EVO, 21.4R2-S1-EVO, 21.4R3-EVO; 22.1-EVO versions
  prior to 22.1R2-EVO. This issue does not affect: Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior
