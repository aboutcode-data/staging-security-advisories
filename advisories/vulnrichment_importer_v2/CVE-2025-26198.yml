aliases: []
summary: CloudClassroom-PHP-Project v1.0 contains a critical SQL Injection vulnerability in
  the loginlinkadmin.php component. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in
  the admin login form before directly including it in SQL queries. This allows unauthenticated
  attackers to inject arbitrary SQL payloads and bypass authentication, gaining unauthorized
  administrative access. The vulnerability is triggered when an attacker supplies specially
  crafted input in the username field, such as ' OR '1'='1, leading to complete compromise of
  the login mechanism and potential exposure of sensitive backend data.
