aliases: []
summary: JATOS 3.9.4 contains a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability in the authentication
  system, where an attacker can prevent legitimate users from accessing their accounts by repeatedly
  sending multiple failed login attempts. Specifically, by submitting 3 incorrect login attempts
  every minute, the attacker can trigger the account lockout mechanism on the account level,
  effectively locking the user out indefinitely. Since the lockout is applied to the user account
  and not based on the IP address, any attacker can trigger the lockout on any user account,
  regardless of their privileges.
