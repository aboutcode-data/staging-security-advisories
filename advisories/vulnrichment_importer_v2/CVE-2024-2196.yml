aliases: []
summary: aimhubio/aim is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), allowing attackers
  to perform actions such as deleting runs, updating data, and stealing data like log records
  and notes without the user's consent. The vulnerability stems from the lack of CSRF and CORS
  protection in the aim dashboard. An attacker can exploit this by tricking a user into executing
  a malicious script that sends unauthorized requests to the aim server, leading to potential
  data loss and unauthorized data manipulation.
