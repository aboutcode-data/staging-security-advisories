aliases: []
summary: Ilevia EVE X1/X5 Server version ≤ 4.7.18.0.eden contains a vulnerability in its authentication
  mechanism. Unsanitized input is passed to a system() call for authentication, allowing attackers
  to inject special characters and manipulate command parsing. Due to the binary's interpretation
  of non-zero exit codes as successful authentication, remote attackers can bypass authentication
  and gain full access to the system.
