summary: |
  An Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling vulnerability in the PFE management daemon (evo-pfemand) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an authenticated, network-based attacker to cause an FPC crash leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).When specific SNMP GET operations or specific low-priviledged CLI commands are executed, a GUID resource leak will occur, eventually leading to exhaustion and resulting in FPCs to hang. Affected FPCs need to be manually restarted to recover.

  GUID exhaustion will trigger a syslog message like one of the following:

  evo-pfemand[<pid>]: get_next_guid: Ran out of Guid Space ...
  evo-aftmand-zx[<pid>]: get_next_guid: Ran out of Guid Space ...
  The leak can be monitored by running the following command and taking note of the values in the rightmost column labeled Guids:





  user@host> show platform application-info allocations app evo-pfemand/evo-pfemand



  In case one or more of these values are constantly increasing the leak is happening.

  This issue affects Junos OS Evolved:



    *  All versions before 21.4R2-EVO,
    *  22.1 versions before 22.1R2-EVO.





  Please note that this issue is similar to, but different from CVE-2024-47505 and CVE-2024-47508.
