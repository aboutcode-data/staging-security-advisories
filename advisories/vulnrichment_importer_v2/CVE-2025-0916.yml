aliases: []
summary: 'The YaySMTP and Email Logs: Amazon SES, SendGrid, Outlook, Mailgun, Brevo, Google
  and Any SMTP Service plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in
  versions 2.4.9 to 2.6.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
  execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. Note: The vulnerability has been initially
  patched in version 2.4.8 and was reintroduced in version 2.4.9 with the removal of the wp_kses_post()
  built-in WordPress sanitization function.'
