aliases: []
summary: The User Registration & Membership – Custom Registration Form, Login Form, and User
  Profile plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions
  up to, and including, 4.2.1 via the create_stripe_subscription() function, due to missing
  validation on the 'member_id' user controlled key. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to delete arbitrary user accounts that have registered through the plugin.
