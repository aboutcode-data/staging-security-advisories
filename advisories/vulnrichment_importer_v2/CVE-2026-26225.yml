aliases: []
summary: Intego Personal Backup, a macOS backup utility that allows users to create scheduled
  backups and bootable system clones, contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability. Backup
  task definitions are stored in a location writable by non-privileged users while being processed
  with elevated privileges. By crafting a malicious serialized task file, a local attacker can
  trigger arbitrary file writes to sensitive system locations, leading to privilege escalation
  to root.
