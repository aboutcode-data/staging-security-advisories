aliases: []
summary: |
  An Improper Neutralization of Equivalent Special Elements vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on PTX Series allows a unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

  When MPLS packets are meant to be sent to a flexible tunnel interface (FTI) and if the FTI tunnel is down, these will hit the reject NH, due to which the packets get sent to the CPU and cause a host path wedge condition. This will cause the FPC to hang and requires a manual restart to recover.

  Please note that this issue specifically affects PTX1000, PTX3000, PTX5000 with FPC3, PTX10002-60C, and PTX10008/16 with LC110x. Other PTX Series devices and Line Cards (LC) are not affected.

  The following log message can be seen when the issue occurs:

  Cmerror Op Set: Host Loopback: HOST LOOPBACK WEDGE DETECTED IN PATH ID <id> (URI: /fpc/<fpc>/pfe/<pfe>/cm/<cm>/Host_Loopback/<cm>/HOST_LOOPBACK_MAKE_CMERROR_ID[<id>])
