aliases: []
summary: A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in mudler/LocalAI versions
  up to and including 2.15.0, which allows attackers to trick victims into deleting installed
  models. By crafting a malicious HTML page, an attacker can cause the deletion of a model,
  such as 'gpt-4-vision-preview', without the victim's consent. The vulnerability is due to
  insufficient CSRF protection mechanisms on the model deletion functionality.
