  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  can: j1939: implement NETDEV_UNREGISTER notification handler

  syzbot is reporting

    unregister_netdevice: waiting for vcan0 to become free. Usage count = 2

  problem, for j1939 protocol did not have NETDEV_UNREGISTER notification
  handler for undoing changes made by j1939_sk_bind().

  Commit 25fe97cb7620 ("can: j1939: move j1939_priv_put() into sk_destruct
  callback") expects that a call to j1939_priv_put() can be unconditionally
  delayed until j1939_sk_sock_destruct() is called. But we need to call
  j1939_priv_put() against an extra ref held by j1939_sk_bind() call
  (as a part of undoing changes made by j1939_sk_bind()) as soon as
  NETDEV_UNREGISTER notification fires (i.e. before j1939_sk_sock_destruct()
  is called via j1939_sk_release()). Otherwise, the extra ref on "struct
  j1939_priv" held by j1939_sk_bind() call prevents "struct net_device" from
  dropping the usage count to 1; making it impossible for
  unregister_netdevice() to continue.
