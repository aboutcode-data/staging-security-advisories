aliases: []
summary: The Snow Monkey Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion
  due to insufficient file path validation in the 'generate_user_dirpath' function in all versions
  up to, and including, 12.0.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete
  arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right
  file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
