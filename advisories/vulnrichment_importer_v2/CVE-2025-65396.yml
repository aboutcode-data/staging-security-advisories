aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the boot process of Blurams Flare Camera version 24.1114.151.929
  and earlier allows a physically proximate attacker to hijack the boot mechanism and gain a
  bootloader shell via the UART interface. This is achieved by inducing a read error from the
  SPI flash memory during the boot, by shorting a data pin of the IC to ground. An attacker
  can then dump the entire firmware, leading to the disclosure of sensitive information including
  cryptographic keys and user configurations.
