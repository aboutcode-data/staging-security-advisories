  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  platform/x86: lenovo-yoga-tab2-pro-1380-fastcharger: fix serdev race

  The yt2_1380_fc_serdev_probe() function calls devm_serdev_device_open()
  before setting the client ops via serdev_device_set_client_ops(). This
  ordering can trigger a NULL pointer dereference in the serdev controller's
  receive_buf handler, as it assumes serdev->ops is valid when
  SERPORT_ACTIVE is set.

  This is similar to the issue fixed in commit 5e700b384ec1
  ("platform/chrome: cros_ec_uart: properly fix race condition") where
  devm_serdev_device_open() was called before fully initializing the
  device.

  Fix the race by ensuring client ops are set before enabling the port via
  devm_serdev_device_open().

  Note, serdev_device_set_baudrate() and serdev_device_set_flow_control()
  calls should be after the devm_serdev_device_open() call.
