summary: The CLEVER - HTML5 Radio Player With History - Shoutcast and Icecast - Elementor Widget
  Addon plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file read due to insufficient file path
  validation in the 'history.php' file in all versions up to, and including, 2.4. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files on the affected site's server,
  which may contain sensitive information including database credentials. The vulnerability
  was partially patched in version 2.4.
