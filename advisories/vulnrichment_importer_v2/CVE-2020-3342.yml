aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the software update feature of Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App
  for Mac could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected
  system. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of cryptographic protections on files
  that are downloaded by the application as part of a software update. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by persuading a user to go to a website that returns files to the client
  that are similar to files that are returned from a valid Webex website. The client may fail
  to properly validate the cryptographic protections of the provided files before executing
  them as part of an update. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
  code on the affected system with the privileges of the user.
