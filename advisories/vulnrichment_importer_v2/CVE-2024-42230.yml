  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  powerpc/pseries: Fix scv instruction crash with kexec

  kexec on pseries disables AIL (reloc_on_exc), required for scv
  instruction support, before other CPUs have been shut down. This means
  they can execute scv instructions after AIL is disabled, which causes an
  interrupt at an unexpected entry location that crashes the kernel.

  Change the kexec sequence to disable AIL after other CPUs have been
  brought down.

  As a refresher, the real-mode scv interrupt vector is 0x17000, and the
  fixed-location head code probably couldn't easily deal with implementing
  such high addresses so it was just decided not to support that interrupt
  at all.
