aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm prior to version 1.2.2 allows for Prisma
  injection. The issue exists in the API endpoint "/embed/:embedId/stream-chat" where user-provided
  JSON is directly taken to the Prisma library's where clause. An attacker can exploit this
  by providing a specially crafted JSON object, such as {"sessionId":{"not":"a"}}, causing Prisma
  to return all data from the table. This can lead to unauthorized access to all user queries
  in embedded chat mode.
