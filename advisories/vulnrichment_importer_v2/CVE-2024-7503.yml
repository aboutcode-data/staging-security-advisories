aliases: []
summary: The WooCommerce - Social Login plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication
  bypass in versions up to, and including, 2.7.5. This is due to the use of loose comparison
  of the activation code in the 'woo_slg_confirm_email_user' function. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator,
  if they have access to the userID. This requires the email module to be enabled.
