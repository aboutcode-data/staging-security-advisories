aliases: []
summary: A CSRF vulnerability exists in comfyanonymous/comfyui versions up to v0.2.2. This vulnerability
  allows attackers to host malicious websites that, when visited by authenticated ComfyUI users,
  can perform arbitrary API requests on behalf of the user. This can be exploited to perform
  actions such as uploading arbitrary files via the `/upload/image` endpoint. The lack of CSRF
  protections on API endpoints like `/upload/image`, `/prompt`, and `/history` leaves users
  vulnerable to unauthorized actions, which could be combined with other vulnerabilities such
  as stored-XSS to further compromise user sessions.
