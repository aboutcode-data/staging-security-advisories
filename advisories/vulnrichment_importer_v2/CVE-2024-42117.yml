  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/amd/display: ASSERT when failing to find index by plane/stream id

  [WHY]
  find_disp_cfg_idx_by_plane_id and find_disp_cfg_idx_by_stream_id returns
  an array index and they return -1 when not found; however, -1 is not a
  valid index number.

  [HOW]
  When this happens, call ASSERT(), and return a positive number (which is
  fewer than callers' array size) instead.

  This fixes 4 OVERRUN and 2 NEGATIVE_RETURNS issues reported by Coverity.
