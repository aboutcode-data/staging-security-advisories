aliases: []
summary: reNgine is an automated reconnaissance framework for web applications. Versions 2.1.2
  and prior are susceptible to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This vulnerability
  occurs when scanning a domain, and if the target domain's DNS record contains an XSS payload,
  it leads to the execution of malicious scripts in the reNgine's dashboard view when any user
  views the scan results. The XSS payload is directly fetched from the DNS record of the remote
  target domain. Consequently, an attacker can execute the attack without requiring any additional
  input from the target or the reNgine user. A patch is available and expected to be part of
  version 2.1.3.
