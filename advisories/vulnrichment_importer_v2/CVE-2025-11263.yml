summary: The Link Whisper Free plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  via the type parameter in all versions up to, and including, 0.8.8 due to insufficient input

  inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into
  performing an action such as clicking on a link.
