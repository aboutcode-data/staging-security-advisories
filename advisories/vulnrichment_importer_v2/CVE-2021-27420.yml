summary: GE UR firmware versions prior to version 8.1x web server task does not properly handle
  receipt of unsupported HTTP verbs, resulting in the web server becoming temporarily unresponsive
  after receiving a series of unsupported HTTP requests. When unresponsive, the web server is
  inaccessible. By itself, this is not particularly significant as the relay remains effective
  in all other functionality and communication channels.
