  gve: guard XSK operations on the existence of queues

  This patch predicates the enabling and disabling of XSK pools on the
  existence of queues. As it stands, if the interface is down, disabling
  or enabling XSK pools would result in a crash, as the RX queue pointer
  would be NULL. XSK pool registration will occur as part of the next
  interface up.

  Similarly, xsk_wakeup needs be guarded against queues disappearing
  while the function is executing, so a check against the
  GVE_PRIV_FLAGS_NAPI_ENABLED flag is added to synchronize with the
  disabling of the bit and the synchronize_net() in gve_turndown.
