aliases: []
summary: Vite is a frontend tooling framework for javascript. Prior to versions 6.3.4, 6.2.7,
  6.1.6, 5.4.19, and 4.5.14, the contents of files in the project root that are denied by a
  file matching pattern can be returned to the browser. Only apps explicitly exposing the Vite
  dev server to the network (using --host or server.host config option) are affected. Only files
  that are under project root and are denied by a file matching pattern can be bypassed. `server.fs.deny`
  can contain patterns matching against files (by default it includes .env, .env.*, *.{crt,pem}
  as such patterns). These patterns were able to bypass for files under `root` by using a combination
  of slash and dot (/.). This issue has been patched in versions 6.3.4, 6.2.7, 6.1.6, 5.4.19,
  and 4.5.14.
