aliases: []
summary: In Gradle Enterprise before 2023.1, a remote attacker may be able to gain access to
  a new installation (in certain installation scenarios) because of a non-unique initial system
  user password. Although this password must be changed upon the first login, it is possible
  that an attacker logs in before the legitimate administrator logs in.
