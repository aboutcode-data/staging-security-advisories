aliases: []
summary: The WP Project Manager – Task, team, and project management plugin featuring kanban
  board and gantt charts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'project_id'
  parameter of the /wp-json/pm/v2/projects/2/task-lists REST API endpoint in all versions up
  to, and including, 2.6.16 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and
  lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, who have been granted access to a project, to append additional SQL queries into
  already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
