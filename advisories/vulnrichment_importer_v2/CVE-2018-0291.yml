aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) input packet processor
  of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause the SNMP application
  on an affected device to restart unexpectedly. The vulnerability is due to improper validation
  of SNMP protocol data units (PDUs) in SNMP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the
  attacker to cause the SNMP application to restart multiple times, leading to a system-level
  restart and a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability affects Nexus 2000 Series
  Switches, Nexus 3000 Series Switches, Nexus 3500 Platform Switches, Nexus 3600 Platform Switches,
  Nexus 5500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5600 Platform Switches, Nexus 6000 Series Switches, Nexus
  7000 Series Switches, Nexus 7700 Series Switches, Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone
  NX-OS mode, Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules, UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnects,
  UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects, UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects. Cisco Bug IDs:
  CSCuw99630, CSCvg71290, CSCvj67977.'
