summary: A vulnerability was identified in SUR-FBD CMMS where hard-coded credentials were found
  within a compiled DLL file. These credentials correspond to a built-in administrative account
  of the software. An attacker with local access to the system or the application's installation
  directory could extract these credentials, potentially leading to a complete compromise of
  the application's administrative functions. This issue was fixed in version 2025.03.27 of
  the SUR-FBD CMMS software.
