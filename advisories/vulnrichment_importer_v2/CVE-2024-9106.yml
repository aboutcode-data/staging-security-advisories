aliases: []
summary: The Wechat Social login plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass
  in versions up to, and including, 1.3.0. This is due to insufficient verification on the user
  being supplied during the social login. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access
  to the user id. This is only exploitable if the app secret is not set, so it has a default
  empty value.
