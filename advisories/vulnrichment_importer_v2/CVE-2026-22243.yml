aliases: []
summary: EGroupware is a Web based groupware server written in PHP. A SQL Injection vulnerability
  exists in the core components of EGroupware prior to versions 23.1.20260113 and 26.0.20260113,
  specifically in the `Nextmatch` filter processing. The flaw allows authenticated attackers
  to inject arbitrary SQL commands into the `WHERE` clause of database queries. This is achieved
  by exploiting a PHP type juggling issue where JSON decoding converts numeric strings into
  integers, bypassing the `is_int()` security check used by the application. Versions 23.1.20260113
  and 26.0.20260113 patch the vulnerability.
