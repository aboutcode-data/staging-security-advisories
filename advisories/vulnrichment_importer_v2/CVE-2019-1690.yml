aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the management interface of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure
  Controller (APIC) software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to gain unauthorized
  access on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper access control
  mechanisms for IPv6 link-local connectivity imposed on the management interface of an affected
  device. An attacker on the same physical network could exploit this vulnerability by attempting
  to connect to the IPv6 link-local address on the affected device. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to bypass default access control restrictions on an affected device. Cisco
  Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) devices running versions prior to 4.2(0.21c)
  are affected.
