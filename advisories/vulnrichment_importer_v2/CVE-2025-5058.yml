aliases: []
summary: The eMagicOne Store Manager for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
  file uploads due to missing file type validation in the set_image() function in all versions
  up to, and including, 1.2.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload
  arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
  This is only exploitable by unauthenticated attackers in default configurations where the
  the default password is left as 1:1, or where the attacker gains access to the credentials.
