aliases: []
summary: Tauri is a framework for building binaries for all major desktop platforms. The 1.4.0
  release includes a regression on the Filesystem scope check for dotfiles on Unix. Previously
  dotfiles were not implicitly allowed by the glob wildcard scopes (eg. `$HOME/*`), but a regression
  was introduced when a configuration option for this behavior was implemented. Only Tauri applications
  using wildcard scopes in the `fs` endpoint are affected. The regression has been patched on
  version 1.4.1.
