summary: The Jetpack – WP Security, Backup, Speed, & Growth plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's wpvideo shortcode in all versions up to, and
  including, 13.3.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied
  attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access
  and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
  an injected page.
