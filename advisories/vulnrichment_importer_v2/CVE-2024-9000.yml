aliases: []
summary: In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.26, the checklists.post() endpoint allows users
  to create or modify checklists without validating whether the user has proper permissions.
  This missing access control permits unauthorized users to create checklists, bypassing intended
  permission checks. Additionally, the endpoint does not validate the uniqueness of the slug
  field when creating a new checklist, allowing an attacker to spoof existing checklists by
  reusing the slug of an already-existing checklist. This can lead to significant data integrity
  issues, as legitimate checklists can be replaced with malicious or altered data.
