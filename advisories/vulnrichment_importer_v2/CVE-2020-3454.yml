aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Call Home feature of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated,
  remote attacker to inject arbitrary commands that could be executed with root privileges on
  the underlying operating system (OS). The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation
  of specific Call Home configuration parameters when the software is configured for transport
  method HTTP. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying parameters within the
  Call Home configuration on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the underlying OS.
