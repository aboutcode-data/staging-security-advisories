summary: pypdf is a free and open-source pure-python PDF library. Prior to 6.7.1, an attacker
  who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to long runtimes and large memory
  consumption. This requires parsing the /ToUnicode entry of a font with unusually large values,
  for example during text extraction. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.7.1.
