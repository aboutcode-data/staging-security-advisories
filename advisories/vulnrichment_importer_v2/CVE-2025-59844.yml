aliases: []
summary: SonarQube Server and Cloud is a static analysis solution for continuous code quality
  and security inspection. A command injection vulnerability exists in SonarQube GitHub Action
  in version 4.0.0 to before version 6.0.0 when workflows pass user-controlled input to the
  args parameter on Windows runners without proper validation. This vulnerability bypasses a
  previous security fix and allows arbitrary command execution, potentially leading to exposure
  of sensitive environment variables and compromise of the runner environment. The vulnerability
  has been fixed in version 6.0.0. Users should upgrade to this version or later.
