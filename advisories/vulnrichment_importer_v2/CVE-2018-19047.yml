aliases: []
summary: 'mPDF through 7.1.6, if deployed as a web application that accepts arbitrary HTML,
  allows SSRF, as demonstrated by a ''<img src="http://192.168'' substring that triggers a call
  to getImage in Image/ImageProcessor.php. NOTE: the software maintainer disputes this, stating
  "If you allow users to pass HTML without sanitising it, you''re asking for trouble.'
