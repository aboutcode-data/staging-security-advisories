summary: The Premium Portfolio Features for Phlox theme plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'aux_recent_portfolios_grid' shortcode in all
  versions up to, and including, 2.3.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping
  on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level
  and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
  a user accesses an injected page.
