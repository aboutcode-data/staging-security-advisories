aliases: []
summary: OpenFGA, an authorization/permission engine, is vulnerable to a denial of service attack
  in versions prior to 1.4.3. In some scenarios that depend on the model and tuples used, a
  call to `ListObjects` may not  release memory properly. So when a sufficiently high number
  of those calls are executed, the OpenFGA server can create an `out of memory` error and terminate.
  Version 1.4.3 contains a patch for this issue.
