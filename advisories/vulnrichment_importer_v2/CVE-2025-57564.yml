aliases: []
summary: CubeAPM nightly-2025-08-01-1 allow unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary log
  entries into production systems via the /api/logs/insert/elasticsearch/_bulk endpoint. This
  endpoint accepts bulk log data without requiring authentication or input validation, allowing
  remote attackers to perform unauthorized log injection. Exploitation may lead to false log
  entries, log poisoning, alert obfuscation, and potential performance degradation of the observability
  pipeline. The issue is present in the core CubeAPM platform and is not limited to specific
  deployment configurations.
