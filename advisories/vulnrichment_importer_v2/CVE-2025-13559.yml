aliases: []
summary: The EduKart Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions
  up to, and including, 1.0.3. This is due to the 'edukart_pro_register_user_front_end' function
  not restricting what user roles a user can register with. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to supply the 'administrator' role during registration and gain administrator access
  to the site.
