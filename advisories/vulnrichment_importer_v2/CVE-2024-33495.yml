summary: A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780-0DA00)
  (All versions < V3.0.1.1), SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780-0DA10) (All versions < V3.0.1.1),
  SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780-0DA20) (All versions < V3.0.1.1), SIMATIC RTLS Locating
  Manager (6GT2780-0DA30) (All versions < V3.0.1.1), SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780-1EA10)
  (All versions < V3.0.1.1), SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780-1EA20) (All versions < V3.0.1.1),
  SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780-1EA30) (All versions < V3.0.1.1). The affected application
  does not properly limit the size of specific logs. This could allow an unauthenticated remote
  attacker to exhaust system resources by creating a great number of log entries which could
  potentially lead to a denial of service condition. A successful exploitation requires the
  attacker to have access to specific SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager Clients in the deployment.
