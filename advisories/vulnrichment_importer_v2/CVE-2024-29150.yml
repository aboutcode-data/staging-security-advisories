aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Alcatel-Lucent ALE NOE deskphones through 86x8_NOE-R300.1.40.12.4180
  and SIP deskphones through 86x8_SIP-R200.1.01.10.728. Because of improper privilege management,
  an authenticated attacker is able to create symlinks to sensitive and protected data in locations
  that are used for debugging files. Given that the process of gathering debug logs is carried
  out with root privileges, any file referenced in the symlink is consequently written to the
  debug archive, thereby granting accessibility to the attacker.
