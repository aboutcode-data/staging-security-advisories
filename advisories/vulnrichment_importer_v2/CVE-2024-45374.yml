aliases: []
summary: "The goTenna Pro ATAK plugin uses a weak password for sharing encryption \nkeys via\
  \ the key broadcast method. If the broadcasted encryption key is \ncaptured over RF, and password\
  \ is cracked via brute force attack, it is \npossible to decrypt it and use it to decrypt\
  \ all future and past \nmessages sent via encrypted broadcast with that particular key. This\
  \ \nonly applies when the key is broadcasted over RF. This is an optional \nfeature, so it\
  \ is advised to use local QR encryption key sharing for \nadditional security on this and\
  \ previous versions."
