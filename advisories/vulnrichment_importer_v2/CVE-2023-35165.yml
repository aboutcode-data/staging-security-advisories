aliases: []
summary: "AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open-source software development framework\
  \ to define cloud infrastructure in code and provision it through AWS CloudFormation. In the\
  \ packages `aws-cdk-lib` 2.0.0 until 2.80.0 and `@aws-cdk/aws-eks` 1.57.0 until 1.202.0, `eks.Cluster`\
  \ and `eks.FargateCluster` constructs create two roles, `CreationRole` and `default MastersRole`,\
  \ that have an overly permissive trust policy. \n \nThe first, referred to as the `CreationRole`,\
  \ is used by lambda handlers to create the cluster and deploy Kubernetes resources (e.g `KubernetesManifest`,\
  \ `HelmChart`, ...) onto it. Users with CDK version higher or equal to 1.62.0 (including v2\
  \ users) may be affected.\n \nThe second, referred to as the `default MastersRole`, is provisioned\
  \ only if the `mastersRole` property isn't provided and has permissions to execute `kubectl`\
  \ commands on the cluster. Users with CDK version higher or equal to 1.57.0 (including v2\
  \ users) may be affected.\n\nThe issue has been fixed in `@aws-cdk/aws-eks` v1.202.0 and `aws-cdk-lib`\
  \ v2.80.0. These versions no longer use the account root principal. Instead, they restrict\
  \ the trust policy to the specific roles of lambda handlers that need it. There is no workaround\
  \ available for CreationRole. To avoid creating the `default MastersRole`, use the `mastersRole`\
  \ property to explicitly provide a role."
