aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) offload implementation
  of Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series Switches and Cisco Catalyst 4500-X Series Switches could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a crash of the iosd process, causing a denial
  of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to insufficient error handling when the
  BFD header in a BFD packet is incomplete. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
  sending a crafted BFD message to or across an affected switch. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to trigger a reload of the system. This vulnerability affects Catalyst
  4500 Supervisor Engine 6-E (K5), Catalyst 4500 Supervisor Engine 6L-E (K10), Catalyst 4500
  Supervisor Engine 7-E (K10), Catalyst 4500 Supervisor Engine 7L-E (K10), Catalyst 4500E Supervisor
  Engine 8-E (K10), Catalyst 4500E Supervisor Engine 8L-E (K10), Catalyst 4500E Supervisor Engine
  9-E (K10), Catalyst 4500-X Series Switches (K10), Catalyst 4900M Switch (K5), Catalyst 4948E
  Ethernet Switch (K5). Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc40729.'
