aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the CLI console login authentication of Cisco Nexus 9300-FX3 Series
  Fabric Extender (FEX) when used in UCS Fabric Interconnect deployments could allow an unauthenticated
  attacker with physical access to bypass authentication. This vulnerability is due to the improper
  implementation of the password validation function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by logging in to the console port on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to bypass authentication and execute a limited set of commands local to the FEX,
  which could cause a device reboot and denial of service (DoS) condition.
