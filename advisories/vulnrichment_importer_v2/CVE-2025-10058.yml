aliases: []
summary: The WP Import – Ultimate CSV XML Importer for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the upload_function()
  function in all versions up to, and including, 7.27. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server,
  which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
