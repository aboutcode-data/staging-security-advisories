aliases: []
summary: Weblate is a web based localization tool. In versions prior to 5.15, it was possible
  to trigger repository updates for many repositories via a crafted webhook payload. Version
  5.15 fixes the issue. As a workaround, disabling webhooks completely using ENABLE_HOOKS avoids
  this vulnerability.
