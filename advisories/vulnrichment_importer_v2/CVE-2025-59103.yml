aliases: []
summary: The Access Manager 92xx in hardware revision K7 is based on Linux instead of Windows
  CE embedded in older hardware revisions. In this new hardware revision it was noticed that
  an SSH service is exposed on port 22. By analyzing the firmware of the devices, it was noticed
  that there are two users with hardcoded and weak passwords that can be used to access the
  devices via SSH. The passwords can be also guessed very easily. The password of at least one
  user is set to a random value after the first deployment, with the restriction that the password
  is only randomized if the configured date is prior to 2022. Therefore, under certain circumstances,
  the passwords are not randomized. For example, if the clock is never set on the device, the
  battery of the clock module has been changed, the Access Manager has been factory reset and
  has not received a time yet.
