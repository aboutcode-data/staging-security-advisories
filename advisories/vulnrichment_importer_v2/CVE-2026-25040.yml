aliases: []
summary: Budibase is a low code platform for creating internal tools, workflows, and admin panels.
  In versions up to and including 3.26.3, a Creator-level user, who normally has no UI permission
  to invite users, can manipulate API requests to invite new users with any role, including
  Admin, Creator, or App Viewer, and assign them to any group in the organization. This allows
  full privilege escalation, bypassing UI restrictions, and can lead to complete takeover of
  the workspace or organization. As of time of publication, no known fixed versions are available.
