aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based GUI of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Content
  Security Management Appliance (SMA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to redirect
  a user to a malicious web page. The vulnerabilities are due to improper input validation of
  the parameters of an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by intercepting
  an HTTP request and modifying it to redirect a user to a specific malicious URL. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to redirect a user to a malicious web page or to obtain sensitive
  browser-based information. This type of attack is commonly referred to as an open redirect
  attack and is used in phishing attacks to get users to unknowingly visit malicious sites.
