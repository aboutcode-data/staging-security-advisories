  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  media: v4l: async: Fix duplicated list deletion

  The list deletion call dropped here is already called from the
  helper function in the line before. Having a second list_del()
  call results in either a warning (with CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST=y):

  list_del corruption, c46c8198->next is LIST_POISON1 (00000100)

  If CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST is disabled the operation results in a
  kernel error due to NULL pointer dereference.
