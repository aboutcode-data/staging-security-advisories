summary: "A vulnerability in the interaction between the TCP Intercept feature and the Snort\
  \ 3 detection engine on Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated,\
  \ remote attacker to bypass configured policies on an affected system. Devices that are configured\
  \ with Snort 2 are not affected by this vulnerability. \r\n\r This vulnerability is due to\
  \ a logic error when handling embryonic (half-open) TCP connections. An attacker could exploit\
  \ this vulnerability by sending a crafted traffic pattern through an affected device. A successful\
  \ exploit could allow unintended traffic to enter the network protected by the affected device."
