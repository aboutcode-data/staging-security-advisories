aliases: []
summary: If Elastic Endpoint (v7.9.0 - v8.10.3) is configured to use a non-default option in
  which the logging level is explicitly set to debug, and when Elastic Agent is simultaneously
  configured to collect and send those logs to Elasticsearch, then Elastic Agent API keys can
  be viewed in Elasticsearch in plaintext. These API keys could be used to write arbitrary data
  and read Elastic Endpoint user artifacts.
