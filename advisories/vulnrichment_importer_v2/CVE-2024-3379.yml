aliases: []
summary: In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.6, an incorrect authorization vulnerability
  allows unprivileged users to re-generate the private key for projects they do not have access
  to. Specifically, a user with a 'Member' role can issue a request to regenerate the private
  key of a project without having the necessary permissions or being assigned to that project.
  This issue was fixed in version 1.2.7.
