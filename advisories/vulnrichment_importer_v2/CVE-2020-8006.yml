aliases: []
summary: The server in Circontrol Raption through 5.11.2 has a pre-authentication stack-based
  buffer overflow that can be exploited to gain run-time control of the device as root. The
  ocpp1.5 and pwrstudio binaries on the charging station do not use a number of common exploitation
  mitigations. In particular, there are no stack canaries and they do not use the Position Independent
  Executable (PIE) format.
