  or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the
  internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to
  Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed
  by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 8.3 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability
