aliases: []
summary: Concorde, formerly know as Nexkey, is a fork of the federated microblogging platform
  Misskey. Prior to version 12.25Q1.1, due to an improper implementation of the logout process,
  authentication credentials remain in cookies even after a user has explicitly logged out,
  which may allow an attacker to steal authentication tokens. This could have devastating consequences
  if a user with admin privileges is (or was) using a shared device. Users who have logged in
  on a shared device should go to Settings > Security and regenerate their login tokens. Version
  12.25Q1.1 fixes the issue. As a workaround, clear cookies and site data in the browser after
  logging out.
