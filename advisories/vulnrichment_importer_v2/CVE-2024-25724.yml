summary: In RTI Connext Professional 5.3.1 through 6.1.0 before 6.1.1, a buffer overflow in
  XML parsing from Routing Service, Recording Service, Queuing Service, and Cloud Discovery
  Service allows attackers to execute code with the affected service's privileges, compromise
  the service's integrity, leak sensitive information, or crash the service. These attacks could
  be done via a remote malicious RTPS message; a compromised call with malicious parameters
  to the RTI_RoutingService_new, rti::recording::Service, RTI_QueuingService_new, or RTI_CDS_Service_new
  public APIs; or a compromised local file system containing a malicious XML file.
