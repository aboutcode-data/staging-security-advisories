summary: FreeScout is a free, self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. A stored HTML Injection
  vulnerability has been identified in the Email Receival Module of the Freescout Application.
  The vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious HTML content into emails sent to the
  application's mailbox. This vulnerability arises from improper handling of HTML content within
  incoming emails, allowing attackers to embed malicious HTML code in the context of the application's
  domain. Unauthenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious HTML
  content into emails. This could lead to various attacks such as form hijacking, application
  defacement, or data exfiltration via CSS injection. Although unauthenticated attackers are
  limited to HTML injection, the consequences can still be severe. Version 1.8.139 implements
  strict input validation and sanitization mechanisms to ensure that any HTML content received
  via emails is properly sanitized to prevent malicious HTML injections.
