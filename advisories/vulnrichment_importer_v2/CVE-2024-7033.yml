aliases: []
summary: In version 0.3.8 of open-webui/open-webui, an arbitrary file write vulnerability exists
  in the download_model endpoint. When deployed on Windows, the application improperly handles
  file paths, allowing an attacker to manipulate the file path to write files to arbitrary locations
  on the server's filesystem. This can result in overwriting critical system or application
  files, causing denial of service, or potentially achieving remote code execution (RCE). RCE
  can allow an attacker to execute malicious code with the privileges of the user running the
  application, leading to a full system compromise.
