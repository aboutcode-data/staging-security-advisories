aliases: []
summary: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `FractionalAvgPoolGrad`
  does not consider cases where the input tensors are invalid allowing an attacker to read from
  outside of bounds of heap. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also
  affected and still in supported range.
