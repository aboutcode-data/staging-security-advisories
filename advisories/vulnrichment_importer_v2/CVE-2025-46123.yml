aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in CommScope Ruckus Unleashed prior to 200.15.6.212.14 and
  200.17.7.0.139, and in Ruckus ZoneDirector prior to 10.5.1.0.279, where the authenticated
  configuration endpoint `/admin/_conf.jsp` writes the Wi-Fi guest password to memory with snprintf
  using the attacker-supplied value as the format string; a crafted password therefore triggers
  uncontrolled format-string processing and enables remote code execution on the controller.
