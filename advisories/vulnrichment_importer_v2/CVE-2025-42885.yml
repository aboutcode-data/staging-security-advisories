aliases: []
summary: Due to missing authentication, SAP HANA 2.0 (hdbrss) allows an unauthenticated attacker
  to call a remote-enabled function that will enable them to view information. As a result,
  it has a low impact on the confidentiality but no impact on the integrity and availability
  of the system.
