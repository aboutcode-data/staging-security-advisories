aliases: []
summary: The Open eClass platform (formerly known as GUnet eClass) is a complete course management
  system. Prior to version 4.2, an insecure password reset mechanism allows local attackers
  to reuse a valid password reset token after it has already been used, enabling unauthorized
  password changes and potential account takeover. This issue has been patched in version 4.2.
