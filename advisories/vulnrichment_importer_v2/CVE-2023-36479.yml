aliases: []
summary: Eclipse Jetty Canonical Repository is the canonical repository for the Jetty project.
  Users of the CgiServlet with a very specific command structure may have the wrong command
  executed. If a user sends a request to a org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI Servlet for a binary
  with a space in its name, the servlet will escape the command by wrapping it in quotation
  marks. This wrapped command, plus an optional command prefix, will then be executed through
  a call to Runtime.exec. If the original binary name provided by the user contains a quotation
  mark followed by a space, the resulting command line will contain multiple tokens instead
  of one. This issue was patched in version 9.4.52, 10.0.16, 11.0.16 and 12.0.0-beta2.
