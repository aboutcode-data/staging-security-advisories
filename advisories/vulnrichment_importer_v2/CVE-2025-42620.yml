aliases: []
summary: "In affected versions, vulnerability-lookup handled user-controlled \ncontent in comments\
  \ and bundles in an unsafe way, which could lead to \nstored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).\n\
  \n\n\n\nOn the backend, the related_vulnerabilities field of bundles accepted \narbitrary\
  \ strings without format validation or proper sanitization. On \nthe frontend, comment and\
  \ bundle descriptions were converted from \nMarkdown to HTML and then injected directly into\
  \ the DOM using string \ntemplates and innerHTML. This combination allowed an attacker who\
  \ could \ncreate or edit comments or bundles to store crafted HTML/JavaScript \npayloads which\
  \ would later be rendered and executed in the browser of \nany user visiting the affected\
  \ profile page (user.html). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis issue affects Vulnerability-Lookup: before\
  \ 2.18.0."
