aliases: []
summary: stereoscope is a go library for processing container images and simulating a squash
  filesystem.  Prior to version 0.0.1, it is possible to craft an OCI tar archive that, when
  stereoscope attempts to unarchive the contents, will result in writing to paths outside of
  the unarchive temporary directory. Specifically, use of `github.com/anchore/stereoscope/pkg/file.UntarToDirectory()`
  function, the  `github.com/anchore/stereoscope/pkg/image/oci.TarballImageProvider` struct,
  or the higher level `github.com/anchore/stereoscope/pkg/image.Image.Read()` function express
  this vulnerability. As a workaround, if you are using the OCI archive as input into stereoscope
  then you can switch to using an OCI layout by unarchiving the tar archive and provide the
  unarchived directory to stereoscope.
