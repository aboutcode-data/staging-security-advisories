aliases: []
summary: ZwiiCMS versions prior to 13.7.00 contain a denial-of-service vulnerability in multiple
  administrative endpoints due to improper authorization checks combined with flawed resource
  state management. When an authenticated low-privilege user requests an administrative page,
  the application returns "404 Not Found" as expected, but incorrectly acquires and associates
  a temporary lock on the targeted resource with the attacker session prior to authorization.
  This lock prevents other users, including administrators, from accessing the affected functionality
  until the attacker navigates away or the session is terminated.
