aliases: []
summary: The JetElements plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via
  the 'id' and 'slide_id' parameters in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.20 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
  execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
