aliases: []
summary: Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications,
  and databases. Prior to version 4.0.0-beta.374, the missing authorization allows an authenticated
  user to retrieve any existing private keys on a coolify instance in plain text. If the server
  configuration of IP / domain, port (most likely 22) and user (root) matches with the victim's
  server configuration, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the remote server.
  Version 4.0.0-beta.374 fixes the issue.
