  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  xfrm: state: fix out-of-bounds read during lookup

  lookup and resize can run in parallel.

  The xfrm_state_hash_generation seqlock ensures a retry, but the hash
  functions can observe a hmask value that is too large for the new hlist
  array.

  rehash does:
    rcu_assign_pointer(net->xfrm.state_bydst, ndst) [..]
    net->xfrm.state_hmask = nhashmask;

  While state lookup does:
    h = xfrm_dst_hash(net, daddr, saddr, tmpl->reqid, encap_family);
    hlist_for_each_entry_rcu(x, net->xfrm.state_bydst + h, bydst) {

  This is only safe in case the update to state_bydst is larger than
  net->xfrm.xfrm_state_hmask (or if the lookup function gets
  serialized via state spinlock again).

  Fix this by prefetching state_hmask and the associated pointers.
  The xfrm_state_hash_generation seqlock retry will ensure that the pointer
  and the hmask will be consistent.

  The existing helpers, like xfrm_dst_hash(), are now unsafe for RCU side,
  add lockdep assertions to document that they are only safe for insert
  side.

  xfrm_state_lookup_byaddr() uses the spinlock rather than RCU.
  AFAICS this is an oversight from back when state lookup was converted to
  RCU, this lock should be replaced with RCU in a future patch.
