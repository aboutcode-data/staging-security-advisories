aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco Desk Phone 9800 Series, Cisco IP Phone 7800\
  \ and 8800 Series, and Cisco Video Phone 8875 running Cisco SIP Software could allow an unauthenticated,\
  \ remote attacker to conduct XSS attacks against a user of the web UI.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability\
  \ exists because the web UI of an affected device does not sufficiently validate user-supplied\
  \ input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted\
  \ link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in\
  \ the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.\r\n\
  Note: To exploit this vulnerability, the phone must be registered to Cisco Unified Communications\
  \ Manager and have Web Access enabled. Web Access is disabled by default."
