aliases: []
summary: A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in multiple file upload endpoints of
  parisneo/lollms-webui version V12 (Strawberry). The vulnerability can be exploited remotely
  via Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Despite CSRF protection preventing file uploads, the
  application still processes multipart boundaries, leading to resource exhaustion. By appending
  additional characters to the multipart boundary, an attacker can cause the server to parse
  each byte of the boundary, ultimately leading to service unavailability. This vulnerability
  is present in the `/upload_avatar`, `/upload_app`, and `/upload_logo` endpoints.
