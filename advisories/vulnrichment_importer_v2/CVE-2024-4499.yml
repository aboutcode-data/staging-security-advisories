aliases: []
summary: A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the XTTS server of parisneo/lollms
  version 9.6 due to a lax CORS policy. The vulnerability allows attackers to perform unauthorized
  actions by tricking a user into visiting a malicious webpage, which can then trigger arbitrary
  LoLLMS-XTTS API requests. This issue can lead to the reading and writing of audio files and,
  when combined with other vulnerabilities, could allow for the reading of arbitrary files on
  the system and writing files outside the permitted audio file location.
