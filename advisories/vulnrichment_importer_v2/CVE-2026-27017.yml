aliases: []
summary: uTLS is a fork of crypto/tls, created to customize ClientHello for fingerprinting resistance
  while still using it for the handshake. Versions 1.6.0 through 1.8.0 contain a fingerprint
  mismatch with Chrome when using GREASE ECH, related to cipher suite selection. When Chrome
  selects the preferred cipher suite in the outer ClientHello and for ECH, it does so consistently
  based on hardware support—for example, if it prefers AES for the outer cipher suite, it also
  uses AES for ECH. However, the Chrome parrot in uTLS hardcodes AES preference for outer cipher
  suites but selects the ECH cipher suite randomly between AES and ChaCha20. This creates a
  50% chance of selecting ChaCha20 for ECH while using AES for the outer cipher suite, a combination
  impossible in Chrome. This issue only affects GREASE ECH; in real ECH, Chrome selects the
  first valid cipher suite when AES is preferred, which uTLS handles correctly. This issue has
  been fixed in version 1.8.1.
