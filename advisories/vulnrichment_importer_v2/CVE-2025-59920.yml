aliases: []
summary: When hours are entered in time@work, version 7.0.5, it performs a query to display
  the projects assigned to the user. If the query URL is copied and opened in a new browser
  window, the ‘IDClient’ parameter is vulnerable to a blind authenticated SQL injection. If
  the request is made with the TWAdmin user with the sysadmin role enabled, exploiting the vulnerability
  will allow commands to be executed on the system; if the user does not belong to the sysadmin
  role, they will still be able to query data from the database.
