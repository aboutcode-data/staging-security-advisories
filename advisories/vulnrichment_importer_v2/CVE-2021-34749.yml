aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Server Name Identification (SNI) request filtering of Cisco Web
  Security Appliance (WSA), Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and the Snort detection engine
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass filtering technology on an affected
  device and exfiltrate data from a compromised host. This vulnerability is due to inadequate
  filtering of the SSL handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using data
  from the SSL client hello packet to communicate with an external server. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to execute a command-and-control attack on a compromised host and
  perform additional data exfiltration attacks.
