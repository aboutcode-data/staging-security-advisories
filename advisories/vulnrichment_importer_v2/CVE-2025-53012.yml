aliases: []
summary: MaterialX is an open standard for the exchange of rich material and look-development
  content across applications and renderers. In version 1.39.2, nested imports of MaterialX
  files can lead to a crash via stack memory exhaustion, due to the lack of a limit on the "import
  chain" depth. When parsing file imports, recursion is used to process nested files; however,
  there is no limit imposed to the depth of files that can be parsed by the library. By building
  a sufficiently deep chain of MaterialX files one referencing the next, it is possible to crash
  the process using the MaterialX library via stack exhaustion. This is fixed in version 1.39.3.
