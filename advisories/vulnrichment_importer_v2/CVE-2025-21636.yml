  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  sctp: sysctl: plpmtud_probe_interval: avoid using current->nsproxy

  As mentioned in a previous commit of this series, using the 'net'
  structure via 'current' is not recommended for different reasons:

  - Inconsistency: getting info from the reader's/writer's netns vs only
    from the opener's netns.

  - current->nsproxy can be NULL in some cases, resulting in an 'Oops'
    (null-ptr-deref), e.g. when the current task is exiting, as spotted by
    syzbot [1] using acct(2).

  The 'net' structure can be obtained from the table->data using
  container_of().

  Note that table->data could also be used directly, as this is the only
  member needed from the 'net' structure, but that would increase the size
  of this fix, to use '*data' everywhere 'net->sctp.probe_interval' is
  used.
