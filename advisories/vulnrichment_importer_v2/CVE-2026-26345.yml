aliases: []
summary: SPIP before 4.4.8 contains a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the
  public area triggered in certain edge-case usage patterns. The echapper_html_suspect() function
  does not adequately sanitize user-controlled content, allowing authenticated users with content-editing
  privileges (e.g., author-level roles and above) to inject malicious scripts. The injected
  payload may be rendered across multiple pages within the framework and execute in the browser
  context of other users, including administrators. Successful exploitation can allow attackers
  to perform actions in the security context of the victim user, including unauthorized modification
  of application state. This vulnerability is not mitigated by the SPIP security screen.
