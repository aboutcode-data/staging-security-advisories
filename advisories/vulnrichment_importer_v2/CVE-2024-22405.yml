summary: XADMaster is an objective-C library for archive and file unarchiving and extraction.
  When extracting a specially crafted zip archive XADMaster may not apply quarantine attribute
  correctly. Such behaviour may circumvent Gatekeeper checks on the system. Only macOS installations
  are affected. This issue was fixed in XADMaster 1.10.8. It is recommended to upgrade to the
  latest version. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
