aliases: []
summary: On most desktop platforms, Brave Browser versions 1.70.x-1.73.x included a feature
  to show a site's origin on the OS-provided file selector dialog when a site prompts the user
  to upload or download a file. However the origin was not correctly inferred in some cases.
  When combined with an open redirector vulnerability on a trusted site, this could allow a
  malicious site to initiate a download whose origin in the file select dialog appears as the
  trusted site which initiated the redirect.
