aliases: []
summary: The File Manager Advanced Shortcode WordPress plugin through 2.3.2 does not adequately
  prevent uploading files with disallowed MIME types when using the shortcode. This leads to
  RCE in cases where the allowed MIME type list does not include PHP files. In the worst case,
  this is available to unauthenticated users.
