aliases: []
summary: The CallRail Phone Call Tracking plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the 'callrail_form' shortcode in versions up to, and including, 0.5.2 due to
  insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the 'form_id' user supplied attribute.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor level and above permissions
  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page.
