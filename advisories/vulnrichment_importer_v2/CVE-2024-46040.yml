summary: IoT Haat Smart Plug IH-IN-16A-S IH-IN-16A-S v5.16.1 suffers from Insufficient Session
  Expiration. The lack of validation of the authentication token at the IoT Haat during the
  Access Point Pairing mode leads the attacker to replay the Wi-Fi packets and forcefully turn
  off the access point after the authentication token has expired.
