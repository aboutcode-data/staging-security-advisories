aliases: []
summary: Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host versions prior to 1.0.735
  and Application prior to 20.0.1330 (macOS/Linux client deployments) contain a vulnerability
  in the local logging mechanism. Authentication session tokens, including PHPSESSID, XSRF-TOKEN,
  and laravel_session, are stored in cleartext within world-readable log files. Any local user
  with access to the machine can extract these session tokens and use them to authenticate remotely
  to the SaaS environment, bypassing normal login credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized
  system access and exposure of sensitive information. This vulnerability has been identified
  by the vendor as: V-2022-008 — Secrets Leaked in Logs.
