aliases: []
summary: FOG is a free open-source cloning/imaging/rescue suite/inventory management system.
  There is a security issue with the NFS configuration in /etc/exports generated by the installer
  that allows an attacker to modify files outside the export in the default installation. The
  exports have the no_subtree_check option. The no_subtree_check option means that if a client
  performs a file operation, the server will only check if the requested file is on the correct
  filesystem, not if it is in the correct directory. This enables modifying files in /images,
  accessing other files on the same filesystem, and accessing files on other filesystems. This
  vulnerability is fixed in 1.5.10.30.
