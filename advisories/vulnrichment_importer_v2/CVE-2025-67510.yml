aliases: []
summary: 'Neuron is a PHP framework for creating and orchestrating AI Agents. In versions 2.8.11
  and below, the MySQLWriteTool executes arbitrary SQL provided by the caller using PDO::prepare()
  + execute() without semantic restrictions. This is consistent with the name (“write tool”),
  but in an LLM/agent context it becomes a high-risk capability: prompt injection or indirect
  prompt manipulation can cause execution of destructive queries such as DROP TABLE, TRUNCATE,
  DELETE, ALTER, or privilege-related statements (subject to DB permissions). Deployments that
  expose an agent with MySQLWriteTool enabled to untrusted input and/or run the tool with a
  DB user that has broad privileges are impacted. This issue is fixed in version 2.8.12.'
