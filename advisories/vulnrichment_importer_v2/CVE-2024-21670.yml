aliases: []
summary: Ursa is a cryptographic library for use with blockchains. The revocation schema that
  is part of the Ursa CL-Signatures implementations has a flaw that could impact the privacy
  guarantees defined by the AnonCreds verifiable credential model, allowing a malicious holder
  of a revoked credential to generate a valid Non-Revocation Proof for that credential as part
  of an AnonCreds presentation. A verifier may verify a credential from a holder as being "not
  revoked" when in fact, the holder's credential has been revoked. Ursa has moved to end-of-life
  status and no fix is expected.
