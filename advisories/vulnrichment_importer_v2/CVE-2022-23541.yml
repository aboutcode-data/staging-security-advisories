aliases: []
summary: jsonwebtoken is an implementation of JSON Web Tokens. Versions `<= 8.5.1` of `jsonwebtoken`
  library can be misconfigured so that passing a poorly implemented key retrieval function referring
  to the `secretOrPublicKey` argument from the readme link will result in incorrect verification
  of tokens. There is a possibility of using a different algorithm and key combination in verification,
  other than the one that was used to sign the tokens. Specifically, tokens signed with an asymmetric
  public key could be verified with a symmetric HS256 algorithm. This can lead to successful
  validation of  forged tokens. If your application is supporting usage of both symmetric key
  and asymmetric key in jwt.verify() implementation with the same key retrieval function. This
  issue has been patched, please update to version 9.0.0.
