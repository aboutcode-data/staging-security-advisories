aliases: []
summary: A path traversal vulnerability exists in mudler/localai version 2.14.0, where an attacker
  can exploit the `model` parameter during the model deletion process to delete arbitrary files.
  Specifically, by crafting a request with a manipulated `model` parameter, an attacker can
  traverse the directory structure and target files outside of the intended directory, leading
  to the deletion of sensitive data. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation
  and sanitization of the `model` parameter.
