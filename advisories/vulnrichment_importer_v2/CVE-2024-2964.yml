summary: The Pocket News Generator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 0.2.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce

  to update the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
