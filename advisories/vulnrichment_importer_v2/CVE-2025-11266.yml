aliases: []
summary: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the Grassroots DICOM library (GDCM).
  The issue is triggered during parsing of a malformed DICOM file containing encapsulated PixelData
  fragments (compressed image data stored as multiple fragments). This vulnerability leads to
  a segmentation fault caused by an out-of-bounds memory access due to unsigned integer underflow
  in buffer indexing. It is exploitable via file input, simply opening a crafted malicious DICOM
  file is sufficient to trigger the crash, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
