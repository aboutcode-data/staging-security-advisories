aliases: []
summary: On versions of Sage 300 2017 - 2022 (6.4.x - 6.9.x) which are setup in a "Windows Peer-to-Peer
  Network" or "Client Server Network" configuration, a low-privileged Sage 300 workstation user
  could abuse their access to the "SharedData" folder on the connected Sage 300 server to view
  and/or modify the credentials associated with Sage 300 users and SQL accounts to impersonate
  users and/or access the SQL database as a system administrator. With system administrator-level
  access to the Sage 300 MS SQL database it would be possible to create, update, and delete
  all records associated with the program and, depending on the configuration, execute code
  on the underlying database server.
