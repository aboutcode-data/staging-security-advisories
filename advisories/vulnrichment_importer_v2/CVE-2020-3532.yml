summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco&nbsp;Unified Communications\
  \ Manager, Cisco&nbsp;Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition, Cisco&nbsp;Unified\
  \ Communications Manager IM &amp; Presence Service, and Cisco&nbsp;Unity Connection could\
  \ allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack\
  \ against a user of the interface.\r\nThe vulnerability exists because the web-based management\
  \ interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this\
  \ vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful\
  \ exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the\
  \ affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.There are no workarounds\
  \ that address this vulnerability."
