aliases: []
summary: MyTube is a self-hosted downloader and player for several video websites. Versions
  1.7.78 and below have a Mass Assignment vulnerability in the settings management functionality
  due to insufficient input validation. The application's saveSettings() function accepts arbitrary
  key-value pairs without validating property names against allowed settings. The function uses
  Record<string, any> as input type and iterates over all entries using Object.entries() without
  filtering unauthorized properties. Any field sent by the attacker is directly persisted to
  the database, regardless of whether it corresponds to a legitimate application setting. This
  issue has been fixed in version 1.7.78.
