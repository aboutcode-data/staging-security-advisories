aliases: []
summary: PostgreSQL optimizer statistics allow a user to read sampled data within a view that
  the user cannot access.  Separately, statistics allow a user to read sampled data that a row
  security policy intended to hide.  PostgreSQL maintains statistics for tables by sampling
  data available in columns; this data is consulted during the query planning process.  Prior
  to this release, a user could craft a leaky operator that bypassed view access control lists
  (ACLs) and bypassed row security policies in partitioning or table inheritance hierarchies.  Reachable
  statistics data notably included histograms and most-common-values lists.  CVE-2017-7484 and
  CVE-2019-10130 intended to close this class of vulnerability, but this gap remained.  Versions
  before PostgreSQL 17.6, 16.10, 15.14, 14.19, and 13.22 are affected.
