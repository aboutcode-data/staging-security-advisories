aliases: []
summary: Stirling-PDF is a locally hosted web application that allows you to perform various
  operations on PDF files. Prior to version 0.45.0, Stirling-PDF is vulnerable to SSRF-induced
  arbitrary file read. WeasyPrint redefines a set of HTML tags, including img, embed, object,
  and others. The references to several files inside, allow the attachment of content from any
  webpage or local file to a PDF. This allows the attacker to read any file on the server, including
  sensitive files and configuration files. All users utilizing this feature will be affected.
  This issue has been patched in version 0.45.0.
