aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the chat feed feature of Cisco SocialMiner could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against a user of the web-based
  user interface of an affected system. This vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization
  of user-supplied input delivered to the chat feed as part of an HTTP request. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a link to attacker-controlled
  content. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in
  the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
