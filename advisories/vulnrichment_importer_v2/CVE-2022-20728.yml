aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the client forwarding code of multiple Cisco Access Points (APs)
  could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to inject packets from the native VLAN to
  clients within nonnative VLANs on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to a logic
  error on the AP that forwards packets that are destined to a wireless client if they are received
  on the native VLAN. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by obtaining access to the
  native VLAN and directing traffic directly to the client through their MAC/IP combination.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass VLAN separation and potentially also
  bypass any Layer 3 protection mechanisms that are deployed.
