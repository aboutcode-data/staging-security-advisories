datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2025/7xxx/CVE-2025-7825.json
aliases: []
summary: The Schema Plugin For Divi, Gutenberg & Shortcodes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Object Instantiation in all versions up to, and including, 4.3.2 via deserialization of
  untrusted input via the wpt_schema_breadcrumbs shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain
  is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless
  another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is
  present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the
  attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute
  code depending on the POP chain present.
