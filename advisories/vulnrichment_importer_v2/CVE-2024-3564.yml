aliases: []
summary: The Content Blocks (Custom Post Widget) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local
  File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.0 via the plugin's 'content_block'
  shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access
  and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of
  any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive
  data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded
  and included.
