aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol version 3 (SNMPv3) access
  control functionality of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower
  Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to query SNMP
  data. This vulnerability is due to ineffective access control. An attacker could exploit this
  vulnerability by sending an SNMPv3 query to an affected device from a host that is not permitted
  by the SNMPv3 access control list. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send an
  SNMP query to an affected device and retrieve information from the device. The attacker would
  need valid credentials to perform the SNMP query.
