aliases: []
summary: The Appointment Booking Calendar Plugin and Online Scheduling Plugin – BookingPress
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions 1.1.6 to 1.1.7. This
  is due to the plugin not properly verifying a user's identity prior to logging them in when
  completing a booking. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as registered
  users, including administrators, if they have access to that user's email.  This is only exploitable
  when the 'Auto login user after successful booking' setting is enabled.
