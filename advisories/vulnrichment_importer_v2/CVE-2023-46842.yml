summary: |
  Unlike 32-bit PV guests, HVM guests may switch freely between 64-bit and
  other modes.  This in particular means that they may set registers used
  to pass 32-bit-mode hypercall arguments to values outside of the range
  32-bit code would be able to set them to.

  When processing of hypercalls takes a considerable amount of time,
  the hypervisor may choose to invoke a hypercall continuation.  Doing so
  involves putting (perhaps updated) hypercall arguments in respective
  registers.  For guests not running in 64-bit mode this further involves
  a certain amount of translation of the values.

  Unfortunately internal sanity checking of these translated values
  assumes high halves of registers to always be clear when invoking a
  hypercall.  When this is found not to be the case, it triggers a
  consistency check in the hypervisor and causes a crash.
