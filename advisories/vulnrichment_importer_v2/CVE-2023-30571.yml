aliases: []
summary: Libarchive through 3.6.2 can cause directories to have world-writable permissions.
  The umask() call inside archive_write_disk_posix.c changes the umask of the whole process
  for a very short period of time; a race condition with another thread can lead to a permanent
  umask 0 setting. Such a race condition could lead to implicit directory creation with permissions
  0777 (without the sticky bit), which means that any low-privileged local user can delete and
  rename files inside those directories.
