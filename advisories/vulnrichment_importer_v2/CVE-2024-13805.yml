summary: The Advanced File Manager — Ultimate WordPress File Manager and Document Library Plugin
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in
  all versions up to, and including, 5.2.14 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
  escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access
  and above, and granted permissions by an Administrator, to inject arbitrary web scripts in
  pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.
