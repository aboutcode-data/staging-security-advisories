aliases: []
summary: The MultiLoca - WooCommerce Multi Locations Inventory Management plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due
  to a missing capability check on the 'wcmlim_settings_ajax_handler' function in all versions
  up to, and including, 4.2.8. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update
  arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the default role
  for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative
  user access to a vulnerable site.
