aliases: []
summary: svelte performance oriented web framework. Versions of svelte prior to 5.51.5 are vulnerable
  to cross-site scripting (XSS) during server-side rendering. When using spread syntax to render
  attributes from untrusted data, event handler properties are included in the rendered HTML
  output. If an application spreads user-controlled or external data as element attributes,
  an attacker can inject malicious event handlers that execute in victims' browsers. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 5.51.5.
