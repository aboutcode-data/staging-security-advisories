aliases: []
summary: The Forminator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via
  an uploaded file (e.g. 3gpp file) in all versions up to, and including, 1.29.0 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page.
