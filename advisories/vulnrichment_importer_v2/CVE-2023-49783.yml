aliases: []
summary: Silverstripe Admin provides a basic management interface for the Silverstripe Framework.
  In versions on the 1.x branch prior to 1.13.19 and on the 2.x branch prior to 2.1.8, users
  who don't have edit or delete permissions for records exposed in a `ModelAdmin` can still
  edit or delete records using the CSV import form, provided they have create permissions. The
  likelihood of a user having create permissions but not having edit or delete permissions is
  low, but it is possible. Note that this doesn't affect any `ModelAdmin` which has had the
  import form disabled via the `showImportForm` public property. Versions 1.13.19 and 2.1.8
  contain a patch for the issue. Those who have a custom implementation of `BulkLoader` should
  update their implementations to respect permissions when the return value of `getCheckPermissions()`
  is true. Those who use any `BulkLoader` in their own project logic, or maintain a module which
  uses it, should consider passing `true` to `setCheckPermissions()` if the data is provided
  by users.
