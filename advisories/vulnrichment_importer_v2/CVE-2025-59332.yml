aliases: []
summary: 3DAlloy is a lightWeight 3D-viewer for MediaWiki. From 1.0 through 1.8, the <3d> parser
  tag and the {{#3d}} parser function allow users to provide custom attributes that are then
  appended to the canvas HTML element that is being output by the extension. The attributes
  are not sanitized, which means that arbitrary JavaScript can be inserted and executed.
