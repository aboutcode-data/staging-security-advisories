aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the egress packet processing functionality of the Cisco StarOS
  operating system for Cisco Aggregation Services Router (ASR) 5700 Series devices and Virtualized
  Packet Core (VPC) System Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause
  an interface on the device to cease forwarding packets. The device may need to be manually
  reloaded to clear this Interface Forwarding Denial of Service condition. The vulnerability
  is due to the failure to properly check that the length of a packet to transmit does not exceed
  the maximum supported length of the network interface card (NIC). An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by sending a crafted IP packet or a series of crafted IP fragments through
  an interface on the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause
  the network interface to cease forwarding packets. This vulnerability could be triggered by
  either IPv4 or IPv6 network traffic. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products
  when they are running the StarOS operating system and a virtual interface card is installed
  on the device: Aggregation Services Router (ASR) 5700 Series, Virtualized Packet Core-Distributed
  Instance (VPC-DI) System Software, Virtualized Packet Core-Single Instance (VPC-SI) System
  Software. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf32385.'
