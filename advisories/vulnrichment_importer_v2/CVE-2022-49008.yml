  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  can: can327: can327_feed_frame_to_netdev(): fix potential skb leak when netdev is down

  In can327_feed_frame_to_netdev(), it did not free the skb when netdev
  is down, and all callers of can327_feed_frame_to_netdev() did not free
  allocated skb too. That would trigger skb leak.

  Fix it by adding kfree_skb() in can327_feed_frame_to_netdev() when netdev
  is down. Not tested, just compiled.
