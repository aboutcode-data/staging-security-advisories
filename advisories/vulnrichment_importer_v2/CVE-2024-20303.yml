aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the multicast DNS (mDNS) gateway feature of Cisco IOS XE Software\
  \ for Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs) could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to\
  \ cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper management\
  \ of mDNS client entries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the\
  \ wireless network and sending a continuous stream of specific mDNS packets. A successful\
  \ exploit could allow the attacker to cause the wireless controller to have high CPU utilization,\
  \ which could lead to access points (APs) losing their connection to the controller and result\
  \ in a DoS condition."
