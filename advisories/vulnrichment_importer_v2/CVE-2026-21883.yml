aliases: []
summary: Bokeh is an interactive visualization library written in Python. In versions 3.8.1
  and below, if a server is configured with an allowlist (e.g., dashboard.corp), an attacker
  can register a domain like dashboard.corp.attacker.com (or use a subdomain if applicable)
  and lure a victim to visit it. The malicious site can then initiate a WebSocket connection
  to the vulnerable Bokeh server. Since the Origin header (e.g., http://dashboard.corp.attacker.com/)
  matches the allowlist according to the flawed logic, the connection is accepted. Once connected,
  the attacker can interact with the Bokeh server on behalf of the victim, potentially accessing
  sensitive data, or modifying visualizations. This issue is fixed in version 3.8.2.
