aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the processing of Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points
  (CAPWAP) Mobility messages in Cisco IOS XE Wireless Controller Software for the Catalyst 9000
  Family could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS)
  condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to a logic error and improper management
  of resources related to the handling of CAPWAP Mobility messages. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by sending crafted CAPWAP Mobility packets to an affected device. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust resources on the affected device. This would cause
  the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.
