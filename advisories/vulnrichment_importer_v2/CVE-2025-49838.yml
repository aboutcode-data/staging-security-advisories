aliases: []
summary: GPT-SoVITS-WebUI is a voice conversion and text-to-speech webUI. In versions 20250228v3
  and prior, there is an unsafe deserialization vulnerability in vr.py AudioPreDeEcho. The model_choose
  variable takes user input (e.g. a path to a model) and passes it to the uvr function. In uvr,
  a new instance of AudioPreDeEcho class is created with the model_path attribute containing
  the aforementioned user input (here called locally model_name). Note that in this step the
  .pth extension is added to the path. In the AudioPreDeEcho class, the user input, here called
  model_path, is used to load the model on that path with torch.load, which can lead to unsafe
  deserialization. At time of publication, no known patched versions are available.
