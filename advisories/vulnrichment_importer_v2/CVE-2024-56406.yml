summary: "A heap buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in Perl. \n\nRelease branches\
  \ 5.34, 5.36, 5.38 and 5.40 are affected, including development versions from 5.33.1 through\
  \ 5.41.10.\n\nWhen there are non-ASCII bytes in the left-hand-side of the `tr` operator, `S_do_trans_invmap`\
  \ can overflow the destination pointer `d`.\n\n   $ perl -e '$_ = \"\\x{FF}\" x 1000000; tr/\\\
  xFF/\\x{100}/;' \n   Segmentation fault (core dumped)\n\nIt is believed that this vulnerability\
