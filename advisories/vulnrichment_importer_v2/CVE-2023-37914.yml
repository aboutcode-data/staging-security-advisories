summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications
  built on top of it. Any user who can view `Invitation.WebHome` can execute arbitrary script
  macros including Groovy and Python macros that allow remote code execution including unrestricted
  read and write access to all wiki contents. This vulnerability has been patched on XWiki 14.4.8,
  15.2-rc-1, and 14.10.6. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may manually
  apply the patch on `Invitation.InvitationCommon` and `Invitation.InvitationConfig`, but there
  are otherwise no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
