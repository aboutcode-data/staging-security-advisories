aliases: []
summary: In OpenClaw before 2026.2.23, tools.exec.safeBins validation for sort could be bypassed
  via GNU long-option abbreviations (such as --compress-prog) in allowlist mode, leading to
  approval-free execution paths that were intended to require approval. Only an exact string
  such as --compress-program was denied.
