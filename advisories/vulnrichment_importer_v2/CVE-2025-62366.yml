aliases: []
summary: mailgen is a Node.js package that generates responsive HTML e-mails for sending transactional
  mail. Mailgen versions through 2.0.30 contain an HTML injection vulnerability in plaintext
  emails produced by the generatePlaintext method when user‑generated content is supplied. The
  function attempts to remove HTML tags, but if tags are provided as encoded HTML entities they
  are not removed and are later decoded, resulting in active HTML (for example an img tag with
  an event handler) in the supposed plaintext output. In contexts where the generated plaintext
  string is subsequently rendered as HTML, this can allow execution of attacker‑controlled JavaScript.
  Versions 2.0.31 and later contain a fix. No known workarounds exist.
