datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2024-52577
datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2024/52xxx/CVE-2024-52577.json
aliases: []
summary: In Apache Ignite versions from 2.6.0 and before 2.17.0, configured Class Serialization
  Filters are ignored for some Ignite endpoints. The vulnerability could be exploited if an
  attacker manually crafts an Ignite message containing a vulnerable object whose class is present
  in the Ignite server classpath and sends it to Ignite server endpoints. Deserialization of
  such a message by the Ignite server may result in the execution of arbitrary code on the Apache
  Ignite server side.
