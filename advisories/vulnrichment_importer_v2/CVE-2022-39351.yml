aliases: []
summary: Dependency-Track is a Component Analysis platform that allows organizations to identify
  and reduce risk in the software supply chain. Prior to version 4.6.0, performing an API request
  using a valid API key with insufficient permissions causes the API key to be written to Dependency-Track's
  audit log in clear text. Actors with access to the audit log can exploit this flaw to gain
  access to valid API keys. The issue has been fixed in Dependency-Track 4.6.0. Instead of logging
  the entire API key, only the last 4 characters of the key will be logged. It is strongly recommended
  to check historic logs for occurrences of this behavior, and re-generating API keys in case
  of leakage.
