summary: The Versa Director GUI provides an option to customize the look and feel of the user
  interface. This option is only available for a user logged with Provider-Data-Center-Admin
  or Provider-Data-Center-System-Admin. (Tenant level users do not have this privilege). The
  “Change Favicon” (Favorite Icon) option can be mis-used to upload a malicious file ending
  with .png extension to masquerade as image file. This is possible only after a user with Provider-Data-Center-Admin
  or Provider-Data-Center-System-Admin has successfully authenticated and logged in.
