aliases: []
summary: go-cvss is a Go module to manipulate Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). In
  affected versions when a full CVSS v2.0 vector string is parsed using `ParseVector`, an Out-of-Bounds
  Read is possible due to a lack of tests. The Go module will then panic. The problem is patched
  in tag `v0.4.0`, by the commit `d9d478ff0c13b8b09ace030db9262f3c2fe031f4`. Users are advised
  to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may avoid this issue by parsing only CVSS v2.0 vector
  strings that do not have all attributes defined (e.g. `AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C/E:U/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:MH/TD:H/CR:M/IR:M/AR:M`).
  As stated in [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/pandatix/go-cvss/blob/master/SECURITY.md), the
  CPE v2.3 to refer to this Go module is `cpe:2.3:a:pandatix:go_cvss:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*`. The entry
  has already been requested to the NVD CPE dictionary.
