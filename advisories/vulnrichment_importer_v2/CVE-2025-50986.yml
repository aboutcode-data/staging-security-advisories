aliases: []
summary: diskover-web v2.3.0 Community Edition suffers from multiple stored cross-site scripting
  (XSS) vulnerabilities in its administrative settings interface. Various configuration fields
  such as ES_HOST, ES_INDEXREFRESH, ES_PORT, ES_SCROLLSIZE, ES_TRANSLOGSIZE, ES_TRANSLOGSYNCINT,
  EXCLUDES_FILES, FILE_TYPES[], INCLUDES_DIRS, INCLUDES_FILES, and TIMEZONE do not properly
  sanitize user-supplied input. Malicious payloads submitted via these parameters are persisted
  in the application and executed whenever an administrator views or edits the settings page.
