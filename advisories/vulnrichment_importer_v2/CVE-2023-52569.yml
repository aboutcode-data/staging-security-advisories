  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  btrfs: remove BUG() after failure to insert delayed dir index item

  Instead of calling BUG() when we fail to insert a delayed dir index item
  into the delayed node's tree, we can just release all the resources we
  have allocated/acquired before and return the error to the caller. This is
  fine because all existing call chains undo anything they have done before
  calling btrfs_insert_delayed_dir_index() or BUG_ON (when creating pending
  snapshots in the transaction commit path).

  So remove the BUG() call and do proper error handling.

  This relates to a syzbot report linked below, but does not fix it because
  it only prevents hitting a BUG(), it does not fix the issue where somehow
  we attempt to use twice the same index number for different index items.
