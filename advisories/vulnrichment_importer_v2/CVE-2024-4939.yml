summary: The Weaver Xtreme Theme Support plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the plugin's div shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 6.4 due to

  it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject
  arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
