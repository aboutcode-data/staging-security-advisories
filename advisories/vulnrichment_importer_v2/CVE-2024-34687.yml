aliases: []
summary: |
  SAP NetWeaver Application Server for ABAP and ABAP Platform do not sufficiently encode user controlled inputs, resulting in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
  An attacker can control code that is executed within a user’s browser, which could result in modification, deletion of data, including accessing or deleting files, or stealing session cookies which an attacker could use to hijack a user’s session. Hence, this could have impact on Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of the system.
