summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  spi: hisi-kunpeng: Add verification for the max_frequency provided by the firmware

  If the value of max_speed_hz is 0, it may cause a division by zero
  error in hisi_calc_effective_speed().
  The value of max_speed_hz is provided by firmware.
  Firmware is generally considered as a trusted domain. However, as
  division by zero errors can cause system failure, for defense measure,
  the value of max_speed is validated here. So 0 is regarded as invalid
  and an error code is returned.
