summary: The Download Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due
  to missing file type validation in the dpwap_plugin_locInstall function in all versions up

  access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote
  code execution possible.
