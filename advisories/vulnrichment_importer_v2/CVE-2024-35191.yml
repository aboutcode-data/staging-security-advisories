aliases: []
summary: Formie is a Craft CMS plugin for creating forms. Prior to 2.1.6, users with access
  to a form's settings can include malicious Twig code into fields that support Twig. These
  might be the Submission Title or the Success Message. This code will then be executed upon
  creating a submission, or rendering the text.  This has been fixed in Formie 2.1.6.
