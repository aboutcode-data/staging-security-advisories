summary: "Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Intersight Private Virtual Appliance could allow\
  \ an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands using root-level privileges.\
  \ The attacker would need to have Administrator privileges on the affected device to exploit\
  \ these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input validation\
  \ when extracting uploaded software packages. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities\
  \ by authenticating to an affected device and uploading a crafted software package. A successful\
  \ exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands on the underlying operating system\
  \ with root-level privileges."
