aliases: []
summary: Evmos is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Hub on the Cosmos Network. In versions
  of evmos prior to 2.0.1 attackers are able to drain unclaimed funds from user addresses. To
  do this an attacker must create a new chain which does not enforce signature verification
  and connects it to the target evmos instance. The attacker can use this joined chain to transfer
  unclaimed funds. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
