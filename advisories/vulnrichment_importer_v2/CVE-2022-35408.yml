aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Insyde InsydeH2O with kernel 5.0 through 5.5. An SMM callout
  vulnerability in the SMM driver in UsbLegacyControlSmm leads to possible arbitrary code execution
  in SMM and escalation of privileges. An attacker could overwrite the function pointers in
  the EFI_BOOT_SERVICES table before the USB SMI handler triggers. (This is not exploitable
  from code running in the operating system.)
