  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  NFSv4: Fix a deadlock when recovering state on a sillyrenamed file

  If the file is sillyrenamed, and slated for delete on close, it is
  possible for a server reboot to triggeer an open reclaim, with can again
  race with the application call to close(). When that happens, the call
  to put_nfs_open_context() can trigger a synchronous delegreturn call
  which deadlocks because it is not marked as privileged.

  Instead, ensure that the call to nfs4_inode_return_delegation_on_close()
  catches the delegreturn, and schedules it asynchronously.
