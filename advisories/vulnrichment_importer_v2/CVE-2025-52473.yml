aliases: []
summary: liboqs is a C-language cryptographic library that provides implementations of post-quantum
  cryptography algorithms. Multiple secret-dependent branches have been identified in the reference
  implementation of the HQC key encapsulation mechanism when it is compiled with Clang for optimization
  levels above -O0 (-O1, -O2, etc). A proof-of-concept local attack exploits this secret-dependent
  information to recover the entire secret key. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.14.0.
