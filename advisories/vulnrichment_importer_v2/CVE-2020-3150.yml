aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV110W
  and RV215W Series Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to download sensitive
  information from the device, which could include the device configuration. The vulnerability
  is due to improper authorization of an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by accessing a specific URI on the web-based management interface of the router, but only
  after any valid user has opened a specific file on the device since the last reboot. A successful
  exploit would allow the attacker to view sensitive information, which should be restricted.
