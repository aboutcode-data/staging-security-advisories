aliases: []
summary: 'BigTree 4.3 allows full path disclosure via authenticated admin/news/ input that triggers
  a syntax error. NOTE: This has been disputed with the following reasoning: "The issue reported
  requires full developer level access to the content management system where cross site scripting
  is not an issue -- you already have full control of the CMS including running arbitrary PHP.'
