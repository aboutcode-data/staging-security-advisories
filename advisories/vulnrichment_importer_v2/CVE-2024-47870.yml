aliases: []
summary: Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability
  involves a **race condition** in the `update_root_in_config` function, allowing an attacker
  to modify the `root` URL used by the Gradio frontend to communicate with the backend. By exploiting
  this flaw, an attacker can redirect user traffic to a malicious server. This could lead to
  the interception of sensitive data such as authentication credentials or uploaded files. This
  impacts all users who connect to a Gradio server, especially those exposed to the internet,
  where malicious actors could exploit this race condition. Users are advised to upgrade to
  `gradio>=5` to address this issue. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
