aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated,
  remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the underlying operating
  system of an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the affected software improperly
  sanitizes values that are parsed from a specific configuration file. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by tampering with a specific configuration file and then sending an API
  call. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject arbitrary code that would be
  executed on the underlying operating system of the affected device. To exploit this vulnerability,
  the attacker would need to have a privileged set of credentials to the device.
