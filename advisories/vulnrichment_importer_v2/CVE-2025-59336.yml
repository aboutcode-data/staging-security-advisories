aliases: []
summary: Luanox is a module host for Lua packages. Prior to 0.1.1, a file traversal vulnerability
  can cause potential denial of service by overwriting Phoenix runtime files. Package names
  like ../../package are not properly filtered and pass the validity check of the rockspec verification
  system. This causes the uploaded file to be stored at the relative path location. If planned
  carefully, this could overwrite a runtime file and cause the website to crash. This vulnerability
  is fixed by 0.1.1.
