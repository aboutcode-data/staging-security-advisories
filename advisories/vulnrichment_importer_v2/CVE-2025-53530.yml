aliases: []
summary: WeGIA is a web manager for charitable institutions. The Wegia server has a vulnerability
  that allows excessively long HTTP GET requests to a specific URL. This issue arises from the
  lack of validation for the length of the errorstr parameter. Tests confirmed that the server
  processes URLs up to 8,142 characters, resulting in high resource consumption, elevated latency,
  timeouts, and read errors. This makes the server susceptible to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.  This
  vulnerability is fixed in 3.3.0.
