aliases: []
summary: Dependency-Track is a component analysis platform that allows organizations to identify
  and reduce risk in the software supply chain. Dependency-Track allows users with the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION`
  permission to customize notification templates. Templates are evaluated using the Pebble template
  engine. Pebble supports an `include` tag, which allows template authors to include the content
  of arbitrary files upon evaluation. Prior to version 4.12.6, users of Dependency-Track with
  the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission can abuse the `include` tag by crafting notification
  templates that `include` sensitive local files, such as `/etc/passwd` or `/proc/1/environ`.
  By configuring such a template for a notification rule (aka "Alert"), and having it send notifications
  to a destination controlled by the actor, sensitive information may be leaked. The issue has
  been fixed in Dependency-Track 4.12.6. In fixed versions, the `include` tag can no longer
  be used. Usage of the tag will cause template evaluation to fail. As a workaround, avoid assigning
  the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission to untrusted users. The `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission
  per default is only granted to members of the `Administrators` team. Assigning this permission
  to non-administrative users or teams is a security risk in itself, and highly discouraged.
