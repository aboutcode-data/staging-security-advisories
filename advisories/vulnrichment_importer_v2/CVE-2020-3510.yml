summary: A vulnerability in the Umbrella Connector component of Cisco IOS XE Software for Cisco
  Catalyst 9200 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a
  reload, resulting in a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability
  is due to insufficient error handling when parsing DNS requests. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by sending a series of malicious DNS requests to an Umbrella Connector
  client interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause
  a crash of the iosd process, which triggers a reload of the affected device.
