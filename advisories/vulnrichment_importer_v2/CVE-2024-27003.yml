  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  clk: Get runtime PM before walking tree for clk_summary

  Similar to the previous commit, we should make sure that all devices are
  runtime resumed before printing the clk_summary through debugfs. Failure
  to do so would result in a deadlock if the thread is resuming a device
  to print clk state and that device is also runtime resuming in another
  thread, e.g the screen is turning on and the display driver is starting
  up. We remove the calls to clk_pm_runtime_{get,put}() in this path
  because they're superfluous now that we know the devices are runtime
  resumed. This also squashes a bug where the return value of
  clk_pm_runtime_get() wasn't checked, leading to an RPM count underflow
  on error paths.
