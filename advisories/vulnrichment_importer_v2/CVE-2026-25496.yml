aliases: []
summary: Craft is a platform for creating digital experiences. In Craft versions 4.0.0-RC1 through
  4.16.17 and 5.0.0-RC1 through 5.8.21, a stored XSS vulnerability exists in the Number field
  type settings. The Prefix and Suffix fields are rendered using the |md|raw Twig filter without
  proper escaping, allowing script execution when the Number field is displayed on users' profiles.
  This issue is patched in versions 4.16.18 and 5.8.22.
