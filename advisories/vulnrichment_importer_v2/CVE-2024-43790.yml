aliases: []
summary: Vim is an open source command line text editor. When performing a search and displaying
  the search-count message is disabled (:set shm+=S), the search pattern is displayed at the
  bottom of the screen in a buffer (msgbuf). When right-left mode (:set rl) is enabled, the
  search pattern is reversed. This happens by allocating a new buffer. If the search pattern
  contains some ASCII NUL characters, the buffer allocated will be smaller than the original
  allocated buffer (because for allocating the reversed buffer, the strlen() function is called,
  which only counts until it notices an ASCII NUL byte ) and thus the original length indicator
  is wrong. This causes an overflow when accessing characters inside the msgbuf by the previously
  (now wrong) length of the msgbuf. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0689.
