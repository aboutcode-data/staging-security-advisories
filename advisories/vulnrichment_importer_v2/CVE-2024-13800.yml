aliases: []
summary: The ConvertPlus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of
  data that can lead to a denial of service due to a missing capability check on the 'cp_dismiss_notice'
  AJAX endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.30. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update option values to '1' on the WordPress
  site. This can be leveraged to update an option that would create an error on the site and
  deny service to legitimate users or be used to set some values to true such as registration.
