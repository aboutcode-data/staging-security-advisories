aliases: []
summary: The WP3D Model Import Viewer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
  due to missing file type validation in the handle_import_file() function in all versions up
  to, and including, 1.0.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level
  access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote
  code execution possible.
