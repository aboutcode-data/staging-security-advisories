aliases: []
summary: dpanel is an open source server management panel written in Go. In versions 1.2.0 through
  1.7.2, dpanel allows authenticated users to read arbitrary files from the server via the /api/app/compose/get-from-uri
  API endpoint. The vulnerability exists in the GetFromUri function in app/application/http/controller/compose.go,
  where the uri parameter is passed directly to os.ReadFile without proper validation or access
  control. A logged-in attacker can exploit this flaw to read sensitive files from the host
  system, leading to information disclosure. No patched version is available as of this writing.
