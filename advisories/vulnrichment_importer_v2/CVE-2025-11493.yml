aliases: []
summary: The ConnectWise Automate Agent does not fully verify the authenticity of files downloaded
  from the server, such as updates, dependencies, and integrations. This creates a risk where
  an on-path attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle attack and substitute malicious files
  for legitimate ones by impersonating a legitimate server. This risk is mitigated when HTTPS
  is enforced and is related to CVE-2025-11492.
