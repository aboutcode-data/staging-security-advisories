aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker
  to execute persistent code at boot time and break the chain of trust. This vulnerability is
  due to incorrect validations by boot scripts when specific ROM monitor (ROMMON) variables
  are set. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by installing code to a specific directory
  in the underlying operating system (OS) and setting a specific ROMMON variable. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to execute persistent code on the underlying OS. To exploit
  this vulnerability, the attacker would need access to the root shell on the device or have
  physical access to the device.
