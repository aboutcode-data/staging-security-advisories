  drm/vmwgfx: Fix prime with external buffers

  Make sure that for external buffers mapping goes through the dma_buf
  interface instead of trying to access pages directly.

  External buffers might not provide direct access to readable/writable
  pages so to make sure the bo's created from external dma_bufs can be
  read dma_buf interface has to be used.

  Fixes crashes in IGT's kms_prime with vgem. Regular desktop usage won't
  trigger this due to the fact that virtual machines will not have
  multiple GPUs but it enables better test coverage in IGT.
