aliases: []
summary: parisneo/lollms-webui, in its latest version, is vulnerable to remote code execution
  due to an insecure dependency on llama-cpp-python version llama_cpp_python-0.2.61+cpuavx2-cp311-cp311-manylinux_2_31_x86_64.
  The vulnerability arises from the application's 'binding_zoo' feature, which allows attackers
  to upload and interact with a malicious model file hosted on hugging-face, leading to remote
  code execution. The issue is linked to a known vulnerability in llama-cpp-python, CVE-2024-34359,
  which has not been patched in lollms-webui as of commit b454f40a. The vulnerability is exploitable
  through the application's handling of model files in the 'bindings_zoo' feature, specifically
  when processing gguf format model files.
