aliases: []
summary: Rapid7 AppSpider Pro versions below 7.5.021 suffer from a project name validation vulnerability,
  whereby an attacker can change the project name directly in the configuration file to a name
  that already exists. This issue stems from a lack of effective verification of the uniqueness
  of project names when editing them outside the application in affected versions. This vulnerability
  was remediated in version 7.5.021 of the product.
