aliases: []
summary: 'The Taskbuilder – WordPress Project Management & Task Management plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to authorization bypass in all versions up to, and including, 5.0.2. This is
  due to missing authorization checks on the project and task comment submission functions (AJAX
  actions: wppm_submit_proj_comment and wppm_submit_task_comment). This makes it possible for
  authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to create comments on any
  project or task (including private projects they cannot view or are not assigned to), and
  inject arbitrary HTML and CSS via the insufficiently sanitized comment_body parameter.'
