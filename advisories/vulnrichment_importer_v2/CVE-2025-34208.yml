aliases: []
summary: Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host and Application (VA/SaaS
  deployments) store user passwords using unsalted SHA-512 hashes with a fall-back to unsalted
  SHA-1. The hashing is performed via PHP's `hash()` function in multiple files (server_write_requests_users.php,
  update_database.php, legacy/Login.php, tests/Unit/Api/IdpControllerTest.php). No per-user
  salt is used and the fast hash algorithms are unsuitable for password storage. An attacker
  who obtains the password database can recover cleartext passwords via offline dictionary or
  rainbow table attacks. The vulnerable code also contains logic that migrates legacy SHA-1
  hashes to SHA-512 on login, further exposing users still on the old hash. This vulnerability
  was partially resolved, but still present within the legacy authentication platform.
