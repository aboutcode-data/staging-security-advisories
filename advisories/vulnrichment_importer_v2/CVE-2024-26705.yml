  parisc: BTLB: Fix crash when setting up BTLB at CPU bringup

  When using hotplug and bringing up a 32-bit CPU, ask the firmware about the
  BTLB information to set up the static (block) TLB entries.

  For that write access to the static btlb_info struct is needed, but
  since it is marked __ro_after_init the kernel segfaults with missing
  write permissions.

  Fix the crash by dropping the __ro_after_init annotation.
