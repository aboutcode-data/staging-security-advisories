aliases: []
summary: Requests is a HTTP library. Due to a URL parsing issue, Requests releases prior to
  2.32.4 may leak .netrc credentials to third parties for specific maliciously-crafted URLs.
  Users should upgrade to version 2.32.4 to receive a fix. For older versions of Requests, use
  of the .netrc file can be disabled with `trust_env=False` on one's Requests Session.
