aliases: []
summary: The Waitlist Woocommerce ( Back in stock notifier ) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg without appropriate escaping
  on the URL in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick
  a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
