  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  can: etas_es58x: es58x_rx_err_msg(): fix memory leak in error path

  In es58x_rx_err_msg(), if can->do_set_mode() fails, the function
  directly returns without calling netif_rx(skb). This means that the
  skb previously allocated by alloc_can_err_skb() is not freed. In other
  terms, this is a memory leak.

  This patch simply removes the return statement in the error branch and
  let the function continue.

  Issue was found with GCC -fanalyzer, please follow the link below for
  details.
