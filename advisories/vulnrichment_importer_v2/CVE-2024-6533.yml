aliases: []
summary: Directus v10.13.0 allows an authenticated external attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript
  on the client. This is possible because the application injects an attacker-controlled parameter
  that will be stored in the server and used by the client into an unsanitized DOM element.
  When chained with CVE-2024-6534, it could result in account takeover.
