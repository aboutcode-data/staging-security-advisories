aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in RDoc 6.3.3 through 6.6.2, as distributed in Ruby 3.x through
  3.3.0. When parsing .rdoc_options (used for configuration in RDoc) as a YAML file, object
  injection and resultant remote code execution are possible because there are no restrictions
  on the classes that can be restored. (When loading the documentation cache, object injection
  and resultant remote code execution are also possible if there were a crafted cache.) The
  main fixed version is 6.6.3.1. For Ruby 3.0 users, a fixed version is rdoc 6.3.4.1. For Ruby
  3.1 users, a fixed version is rdoc 6.4.1.1. For Ruby 3.2 users, a fixed version is rdoc 6.5.1.1.
