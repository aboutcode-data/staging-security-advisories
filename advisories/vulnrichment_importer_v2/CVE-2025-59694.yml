aliases: []
summary: The Chassis Management Board in Entrust nShield Connect XC, nShield 5c, and nShield
  HSMi through 13.6.11, or 13.7, allows a physically proximate attacker to persistently modify
  firmware and influence the (insecurely configured) appliance boot process. To exploit this,
  the attacker must modify the firmware via JTAG or perform an upgrade to the chassis management
  board firmware. This is called F03.
