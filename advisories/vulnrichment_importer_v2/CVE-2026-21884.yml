aliases: []
summary: React Router is a router for React. In @remix-run/react version prior to 2.17.3. and
  react-router 7.0.0 through 7.11.0, a XSS vulnerability exists in in React Router's <ScrollRestoration>
  API in Framework Mode when using the getKey/storageKey props during Server-Side Rendering
  which could allow arbitrary JavaScript execution during SSR if untrusted content is used to
  generate the keys. There is no impact if server-side rendering in Framework Mode is disabled,
  or if Declarative Mode (<BrowserRouter>) or Data Mode (createBrowserRouter/<RouterProvider>)
  is being used. This issue has been patched in @remix-run/react version 2.17.3 and react-router
  version 7.12.0.
