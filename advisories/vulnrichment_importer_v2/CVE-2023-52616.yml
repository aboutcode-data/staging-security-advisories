  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  crypto: lib/mpi - Fix unexpected pointer access in mpi_ec_init

  When the mpi_ec_ctx structure is initialized, some fields are not
  cleared, causing a crash when referencing the field when the
  structure was released. Initially, this issue was ignored because
  memory for mpi_ec_ctx is allocated with the __GFP_ZERO flag.
  For example, this error will be triggered when calculating the
  Za value for SM2 separately.
