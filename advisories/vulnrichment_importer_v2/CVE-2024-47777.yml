aliases: []
summary: GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An OOB-read
  vulnerability has been identified in the gst_wavparse_smpl_chunk function within gstwavparse.c.
  This function attempts to read 4 bytes from the data + 12 offset without checking if the size
  of the data buffer is sufficient. If the buffer is too small, the function reads beyond its
  bounds. This vulnerability may result in reading 4 bytes out of the boundaries of the data
  buffer. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.
