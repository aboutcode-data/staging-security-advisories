aliases: []
summary: jQuery UI is a curated set of user interface interactions, effects, widgets, and themes
  built on top of jQuery. Versions prior to 1.13.2 are potentially vulnerable to cross-site
  scripting. Initializing a checkboxradio widget on an input enclosed within a label makes that
  parent label contents considered as the input label. Calling `.checkboxradio( "refresh" )`
  on such a widget and the initial HTML contained encoded HTML entities will make them erroneously
  get decoded. This can lead to potentially executing JavaScript code. The bug has been patched
  in jQuery UI 1.13.2. To remediate the issue, someone who can change the initial HTML can wrap
  all the non-input contents of the `label` in a `span`.
