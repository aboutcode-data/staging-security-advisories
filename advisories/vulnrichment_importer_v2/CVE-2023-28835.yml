aliases: []
summary: Nextcloud server is an open source home cloud implementation. In affected versions
  the generated fallback password when creating a share was using a weak complexity random number
  generator, so when the sharer did not change it the password could be guessable to an attacker
  willing to brute force it. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 24.0.10
  or 25.0.4. This issue only affects users who do not have a password policy enabled, so enabling
  a password policy is an effective mitigation for users unable to upgrade.
