aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Application Visibility and Control (AVC-FNF) feature of Cisco
  IOS XE Software for Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controllers could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability
  is due to insufficient packet verification for traffic inspected by the AVC feature. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets from the wired network to a wireless
  client, resulting in the crafted packets being processed by the wireless controller. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to cause a crash and reload of the affected device, resulting
  in a DoS condition.
