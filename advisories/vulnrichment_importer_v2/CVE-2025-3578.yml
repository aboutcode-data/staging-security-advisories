aliases: []
summary: A malicious, authenticated user in Aidex, versions prior to 1.7, could list credentials
  of other users, create or modify existing users in the application, list credentials of users
  in production or development environments. In addition, it would be possible to cause bugs
  that would result in the exfiltration of sensitive information, such as details about the
  software or internal system paths. These actions could be carried out through the misuse of
  LLM Prompt (chatbot) technology, via the /api/<string-chat>/message endpoint, by manipulating
  the contents of the ‘content’ parameter.
