aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business
  RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to
  inject arbitrary commands that are executed with root privileges. The vulnerabilities are
  due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface. An
  attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests to a targeted
  device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root
  user on the underlying operating system. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would
  need to have valid administrator credentials on an affected device. Cisco has not released
  software updates that address these vulnerabilities.
