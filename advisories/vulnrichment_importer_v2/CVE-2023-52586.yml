  drm/msm/dpu: Add mutex lock in control vblank irq

  Add a mutex lock to control vblank irq to synchronize vblank
  enable/disable operations happening from different threads to prevent
  race conditions while registering/unregistering the vblank irq callback.

  v4: -Removed vblank_ctl_lock from dpu_encoder_virt, so it is only a
      parameter of dpu_encoder_phys.
      -Switch from atomic refcnt to a simple int counter as mutex has
      now been added
  v3: Mistakenly did not change wording in last version. It is done now.
  v2: Slightly changed wording of commit message
