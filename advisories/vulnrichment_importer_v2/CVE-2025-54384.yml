aliases: []
summary: CKAN is an open-source DMS (data management system) for powering data hubs and data
  portals. Prior to 2.10.9 and 2.11.4, the helpers.markdown_extract() function did not perform
  sufficient sanitization of input data before wrapping in an HTML literal element. This helper
  is used to render user-provided data on dataset, resource, organization or group pages (plus
  any page provided by an extension that used that helper function), leading to a potential
  XSS vector. This vulnerability has been fixed in CKAN 2.10.9 and 2.11.4.
