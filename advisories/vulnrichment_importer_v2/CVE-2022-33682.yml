datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2022/33xxx/CVE-2022-33682.json
aliases: []
summary: TLS hostname verification cannot be enabled in the Pulsar Broker's Java Client, the
  Pulsar Broker's Java Admin Client, the Pulsar WebSocket Proxy's Java Client, and the Pulsar
  Proxy's Admin Client leaving intra-cluster connections and geo-replication connections vulnerable
  to man in the middle attacks, which could leak credentials, configuration data, message data,
  and any other data sent by these clients. The vulnerability is for both the pulsar+ssl protocol
  and HTTPS. An attacker can only take advantage of this vulnerability by taking control of
  a machine 'between' the client and the server. The attacker must then actively manipulate
  traffic to perform the attack by providing the client with a cryptographically valid certificate
  for an unrelated host. This issue affects Apache Pulsar Broker, Proxy, and WebSocket Proxy
  versions 2.7.0 to 2.7.4; 2.8.0 to 2.8.3; 2.9.0 to 2.9.2; 2.10.0; 2.6.4 and earlier.
