summary: A vulnerability in role-based access control of Cisco Integrated Management Controller
  (IMC) Supervisor, Cisco UCS Director, and Cisco UCS Director Express for Big Data could allow
  a read-only authenticated, remote attacker to disable user accounts on an affected system.
  The vulnerability is due to incorrect allocation of the enable/disable action button under
  the role-based access control code on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by authenticating as a read-only user and then updating the roles of other users to disable
  them. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to disable users, including administrative
  users.
