  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  sched: Fix yet more sched_fork() races

  Where commit 4ef0c5c6b5ba ("kernel/sched: Fix sched_fork() access an
  invalid sched_task_group") fixed a fork race vs cgroup, it opened up a
  race vs syscalls by not placing the task on the runqueue before it
  gets exposed through the pidhash.

  Commit 13765de8148f ("sched/fair: Fix fault in reweight_entity") is
  trying to fix a single instance of this, instead fix the whole class
  of issues, effectively reverting this commit.
