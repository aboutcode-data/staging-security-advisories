  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  s390/cio: fix race condition during online processing

  A race condition exists in ccw_device_set_online() that can cause the
  online process to fail, leaving the affected device in an inconsistent
  state. As a result, subsequent attempts to set that device online fail
  with return code ENODEV.

  The problem occurs when a path verification request arrives after
  a wait for final device state completed, but before the result state
  is evaluated.

  Fix this by ensuring that the CCW-device lock is held between
  determining final state and checking result state.

  Note that since:

  commit 2297791c92d0 ("s390/cio: dont unregister subchannel from child-drivers")

  path verification requests are much more likely to occur during boot,
  resulting in an increased chance of this race condition occurring.
