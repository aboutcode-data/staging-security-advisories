aliases: []
summary: iccDEV provides libraries and tools for interacting with, manipulating, and applying
  ICC color management profiles. Versions 2.3.1.1 and below have a Heap Buffer Overflow vulnerability
  in CIccTagNamedColor2::SetSize(). This occurs when user-controllable input is unsafely incorporated
  into ICC profile data or other structured binary blobs. Successful exploitation may allow
  an attacker to perform DoS, manipulate data, bypass application logic and Code Execution.
  This issue has been fixed in version 2.3.1.2.
