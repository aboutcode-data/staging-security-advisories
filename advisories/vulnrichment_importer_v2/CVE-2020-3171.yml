summary: A vulnerability in the local management (local-mgmt) CLI of Cisco FXOS Software and
  Cisco UCS Manager Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary
  commands on the underlying operating system (OS) of an affected device. The vulnerability
  is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including
  crafted arguments to specific commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute
  arbitrary commands on the underlying OS with the privileges of the currently logged-in user
  for all affected platforms excluding Cisco UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects. On Cisco
  UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects, the injected commands are executed with root privileges.
