aliases: []
summary: The WP Delicious – Recipe Plugin for Food Bloggers (formerly Delicious Recipes) plugin
  for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file movement and reading due to insufficient file
  path validation in the save_edit_profile_details() function in all versions up to, and including,
  1.6.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and
  above, to move arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution
  when the right file is moved (such as wp-config.php). This can also lead to the reading of
  arbitrary files that may contain sensitive information like wp-config.php.
