aliases: []
summary: Pimcore is an Open Source Data & Experience Management Platform. In affected versions
  the `/admin/object/grid-proxy` endpoint calls `getFilterCondition()` on fields of classes
  to be filtered for, passing input from the request, and later executes the returned SQL.  One
  implementation of `getFilterCondition()` is in `Multiselect`, which does not normalize/escape/validate
  the passed value. Any backend user with very basic permissions can execute arbitrary SQL statements
  and thus alter any data or escalate their privileges to at least admin level. This vulnerability
  has been addressed in version 11.1.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
  for this vulnerability.
