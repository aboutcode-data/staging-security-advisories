aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an
  unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on
  an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web
  UI on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user
  of the interface to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the targeted user. If the user has
  administrative privileges, the attacker could alter the configuration, execute commands, or
  reload an affected device.
