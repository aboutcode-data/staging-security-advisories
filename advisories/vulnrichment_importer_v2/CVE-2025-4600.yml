aliases: []
summary: A request smuggling vulnerability existed in the Google Cloud Classic Application Load
  Balancer due to improper handling of chunked-encoded HTTP requests. This allowed attackers
  to craft requests that could be misinterpreted by backend servers. The issue was fixed by
  disallowing stray data after a chunk, and is no longer exploitable. No action is required
  as Classic Application Load Balancer service after 2025-04-26 is not vulnerable.
