aliases: []
summary: In mintplex-labs/anything-llm, a vulnerability exists due to improper input validation
  in the workspace update process. Specifically, the application fails to validate or format
  JSON data sent in an HTTP POST request to `/api/workspace/:workspace-slug/update`, allowing
  it to be executed as part of a database query without restrictions. This flaw enables users
  with a manager role to craft a request that includes nested write operations, effectively
  allowing them to create new Administrator accounts.
