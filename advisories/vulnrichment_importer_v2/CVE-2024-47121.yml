aliases: []
summary: "The goTenna Pro App uses a weak password for sharing encryption keys via\n the key\
  \ broadcast method. If the broadcasted encryption key is captured\n over RF, and password\
  \ is cracked via brute force attack, it is possible\n to decrypt it and use it to decrypt\
  \ all future and past messages sent \nvia encrypted broadcast with that particular key. This\
  \ only applies when\n the key is broadcasted over RF. This is an optional feature, so it is\
  \ \nrecommended to use local QR encryption key sharing for additional \nsecurity on this and\
  \ previous versions."
