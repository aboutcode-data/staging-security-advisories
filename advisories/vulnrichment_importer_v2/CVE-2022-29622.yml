summary: 'An arbitrary file upload vulnerability in formidable v3.1.4 allows attackers to execute
  arbitrary code via a crafted filename. NOTE: some third parties dispute this issue because
  the product has common use cases in which uploading arbitrary files is the desired behavior.
  Also, there are configuration options in all versions that can change the default behavior
  of how files are handled. Strapi does not consider this to be a valid vulnerability.'
