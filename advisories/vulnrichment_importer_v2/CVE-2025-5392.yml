aliases: []
summary: The GB Forms DB plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all
  versions up to, and including, 1.0.2 via the gbfdb_talk_to_front() function. This is due to
  the function accepting user input and then passing that through call_user_func(). This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute code on the server which can be leverage
  to inject backdoors or create new administrative user accounts to name a few things.
