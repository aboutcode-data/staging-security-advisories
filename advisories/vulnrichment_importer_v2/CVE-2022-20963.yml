summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine\
  \ (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS)\
  \ attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device.\r\n\r\
  \ This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based\
  \ management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could\
  \ allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface\
  \ or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker\
  \ would need valid credentials to access the web-based management interface of an affected\
  \ device."
