summary: Redlib is an alternative private front-end to Reddit. A vulnerability has been identified
  in Redlib where an attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DOS) condition by submitting a
  specially crafted base2048-encoded DEFLATE decompression bomb to the restore_preferences form.
  This leads to excessive memory consumption and potential system instability, which can be
  exploited to disrupt Redlib instances. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.36.0.
