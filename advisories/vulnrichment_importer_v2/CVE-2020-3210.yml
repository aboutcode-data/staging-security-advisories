aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the CLI parsers of Cisco IOS Software for Cisco 809 and 829 Industrial
  Integrated Services Routers (Industrial ISRs) and Cisco 1000 Series Connected Grid Routers
  (CGR1000) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands
  on the Virtual Device Server (VDS) of an affected device. The attacker must have valid user
  credentials at privilege level 15. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of
  arguments that are passed to specific VDS-related CLI commands. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by authenticating to the targeted device and including malicious input
  as the argument of an affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute
  arbitrary commands in the context of the Linux shell of VDS with the privileges of the root
  user.
