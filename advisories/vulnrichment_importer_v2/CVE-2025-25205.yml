aliases: []
summary: Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Starting in version 2.17.0
  and prior to version 2.19.1, a flaw in the authentication bypass logic allows unauthenticated
  requests to match certain unanchored regex patterns in the URL. Attackers can craft URLs containing
  substrings like "/api/items/1/cover" in a query parameter (?r=/api/items/1/cover) to partially
  bypass authentication or trigger server crashes under certain routes. This could lead to information
  disclosure of otherwise protected data and, in some cases, a complete denial of service (server
  crash) if downstream code expects an authenticated user object. Version 2.19.1 contains a
  patch for the issue.
