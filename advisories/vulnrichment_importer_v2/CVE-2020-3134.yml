summary: A vulnerability in the zip decompression engine of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco
  Email Security Appliance (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a
  denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper
  validation of zip files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an email

  of the content-scanning process, causing a temporary DoS condition. This vulnerability affects
  Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco ESA releases earlier than 13.0.
