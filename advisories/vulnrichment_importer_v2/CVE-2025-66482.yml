aliases: []
summary: 'Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Attackers who use an untrusted
  reverse proxy or not using a reverse proxy at all can bypass IP rate limiting by adding a
  forged X-Forwarded-For header. Starting with version 2025.9.1, an option (`trustProxy`) has
  been added in config file to prevent this from happening. However, it is initialized with
  an insecure default value before version 2025.12.0-alpha.2, making it still vulnerable if
  the configuration is not set correctly. This is patched in v2025.12.0-alpha.2 by flipping
  default value of `trustProxy` to `false`. Users of a trusted reverse proxy who are unsure
  if they manually overode this value should check their config for optimal behavior. Users
  are running Misskey with a trusted reverse proxy should not be affected by this vulnerability.
  From v2025.9.1 to v2025.11.1, workaround is available. Set `trustProxy: false` in config file.'
