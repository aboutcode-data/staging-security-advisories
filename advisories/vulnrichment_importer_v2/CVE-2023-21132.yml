aliases: []
summary: In onCreate of ManagePermissionsActivity.java, there is a possible way to bypass factory
  reset protections due to a missing permission check. This could lead to local escalation of
  privilege with physical access to a device that's been factory reset with no additional execution
  privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.
