aliases: []
summary: The If-So Dynamic Content Personalization plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information
  Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.2.1 via the 'ifso-show-post' shortcode
  due to insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for
  authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract data from private
  or draft posts created via Elementor that they should not have access to.
