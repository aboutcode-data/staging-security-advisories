aliases: []
summary: Gardener External DNS Management is an environment to manage external DNS entries for
  a kubernetes cluster. A security vulnerability was discovered in Gardener's External DNS Management
  prior to version 0.23.6 that could allow a user with administrative privileges for a Gardener
  project or a user with administrative privileges for a shoot cluster, including administrative
  privileges for a single namespace of the shoot cluster, to obtain control over the seed cluster
  where the shoot cluster is managed. This CVE affects all Gardener installations no matter
  of the public cloud provider(s) used for the seed clusters/shoot clusters. The affected component
  is `gardener/external-dns-management`. The `external-dns-management` component may also be
  deployed on the seeds by the `gardener/gardener-extension-shoot-dns-service` extension when
  the extension is enabled. In this case, all versions of the `shoot-dns-service` extension
  `<= v1.60.0` are affected by this vulnerability. Version 0.23.6 of Gardener External DNS Management
  fixes the issue.
