  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ice: Don't process extts if PTP is disabled

  The ice_ptp_extts_event() function can race with ice_ptp_release() and
  result in a NULL pointer dereference which leads to a kernel panic.

  Panic occurs because the ice_ptp_extts_event() function calls
  ptp_clock_event() with a NULL pointer. The ice driver has already
  released the PTP clock by the time the interrupt for the next external
  timestamp event occurs.

  To fix this, modify the ice_ptp_extts_event() function to check the
  PTP state and bail early if PTP is not ready.
