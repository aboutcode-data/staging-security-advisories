aliases: []
summary: AudioCodes Fax Server and Auto-Attendant IVR appliances versions up to and including
  2.6.23 expose an unauthenticated backup upload endpoint at AudioCodes_files/ajaxBackupUploadFile.php
  in the F2MAdmin web interface. The script derives a backup folder path from application configuration,
  creates the directory if it does not exist, and then moves an uploaded file to that location
  using the attacker-controlled filename, without any authentication, authorization, or file-type
  validation. On default Windows deployments where the backup directory resolves to the system
  drive, a remote attacker can upload web server or interpreter configuration files that cause
  a log file or other server-controlled resource to be treated as executable code. This allows
  subsequent HTTP requests to trigger arbitrary command execution under the web server account,
  which runs as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.
