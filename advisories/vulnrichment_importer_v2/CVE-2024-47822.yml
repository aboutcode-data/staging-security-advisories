aliases: []
summary: Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Access
  tokens from query strings are not redacted and are potentially exposed in system logs which
  may be persisted. The access token in `req.query` is not redacted when the `LOG_STYLE` is
  set to `raw`. If these logs are not properly sanitized or protected, an attacker with access
  to it can potentially gain administrative control, leading to unauthorized data access and
  manipulation. This impacts systems where the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. The `access_token`
  in the query could potentially be a long-lived static token. Users with impacted systems should
  rotate their static tokens if they were provided using query string. This vulnerability has
  been patched in release version 10.13.2 and subsequent releases as well. Users are advised
  to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
