summary: The Droip plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification and access
  of data due to a missing capability check on the droip_post_apis() function in all versions
  up to, and including, 2.2.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
  access and above, to perform many actions as the AJAX hooks to several functions. Some potential
  impacts include arbitrary post deletion, arbitrary post creation, post duplication, settings
  update, user manipulation, and much more.
