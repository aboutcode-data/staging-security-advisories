summary: OpenSupports v4.11.0 is vulnerable to Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type.
  In the comment function, an attacker can bypass security restrictions and upload a .bat file
  by manipulating the file's magic bytes to masquerade as an allowed type. This can enable the
  attacker to execute arbitrary code or establish a reverse shell, leading to unauthorized file
  writes or control over the victim's station via a crafted file upload operation.
