aliases: []
summary: 'Some field types do not properly sanitize data from non-form sources in Drupal 8.5.x
  before 8.5.11 and Drupal 8.6.x before 8.6.10. This can lead to arbitrary PHP code execution
  in some cases. A site is only affected by this if one of the following conditions is met:
  The site has the Drupal 8 core RESTful Web Services (rest) module enabled and allows PATCH
  or POST requests, or the site has another web services module enabled, like JSON:API in Drupal
  8, or Services or RESTful Web Services in Drupal 7. (Note: The Drupal 7 Services module itself
  does not require an update at this time, but you should apply other contributed updates associated
  with this advisory if Services is in use.)'
