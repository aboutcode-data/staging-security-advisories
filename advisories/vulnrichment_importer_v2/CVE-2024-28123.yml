aliases: []
summary: Wasmi is an efficient and lightweight WebAssembly interpreter with a focus on constrained
  and embedded systems. In the WASMI Interpreter, an Out-of-bounds Buffer Write will arise if
  the host calls or resumes a Wasm function with more parameters than the default limit (128),
  as it will surpass the stack value. This doesn’t affect calls from Wasm to Wasm, only from
  host to Wasm. This vulnerability was patched in version 0.31.1.
