aliases: []
summary: SvelteKit is a framework for rapidly developing robust, performant web applications
  using Svelte. Versions of @sveltejs/adapter-vercel prior to 6.3.2 are vulnerable to cache
  poisoning. An internal query parameter intended for Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
  is accessible on all routes, allowing an attacker to cause sensitive user-specific responses
  to be cached and served to other users. Successful exploitation requires a victim to visit
  an attacker-controlled link while authenticated. Existing deployments are protected by Vercel's
  WAF, but users should upgrade as soon as possible. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.3.2.
