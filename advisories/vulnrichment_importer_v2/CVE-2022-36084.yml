aliases: []
summary: cruddl is software for creating a GraphQL API for a database, using the GraphQL SDL
  to model a schema. If cruddl starting with version 1.1.0 and prior to versions 2.7.0 and 3.0.2
  is used to generate a schema that uses `@flexSearchFulltext`, users of that schema may be
  able to inject arbitrary AQL queries that will be forwarded to and executed by ArangoDB. Schemas
  that do not use `@flexSearchFulltext` are not affected. The attacker needs to have `READ`
  permission to at least one root entity type that has `@flexSearchFulltext` enabled. The issue
  has been fixed in version 3.0.2 and in version 2.7.0 of cruddl. As a workaround, users can
  temporarily remove `@flexSearchFulltext` from their schemas.
