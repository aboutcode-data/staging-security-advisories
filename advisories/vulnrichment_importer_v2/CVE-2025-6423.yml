aliases: []
summary: The BeeTeam368 Extensions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
  due to missing file type validation in the handle_submit_upload_file() function in all versions
  up to, and including, 2.3.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level
  access or higher to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote
  code execution possible.
