aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability was found in OpenShift AI that allows for authentication bypass and
  privilege escalation across models within the same namespace. When deploying AI models, the
  UI provides the option to protect models with authentication. However, credentials from one
  model can be used to access other models and APIs within the same namespace. The exposed ServiceAccount
  tokens, visible in the UI, can be utilized with oc --token={token} to exploit the elevated
  view privileges associated with the ServiceAccount, leading to unauthorized access to additional
  resources.
