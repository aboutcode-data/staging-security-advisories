aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) restore functionality
  that is available in Cisco ASA Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software
  could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying
  operating system with root-level privileges. Administrator-level privileges are required to
  exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability exists because the contents of a backup file
  are improperly sanitized at restore time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
  restoring a crafted backup file to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the
  attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system as root.
