datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2024-47545
datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2024/47xxx/CVE-2024-47545.json
aliases: []
summary: GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An integer
  underflow has been detected in qtdemux_parse_trak function within qtdemux.c. During the strf
  parsing case, the subtraction size -= 40 can lead to a negative integer overflow if it is
  less than 40. If this happens, the subsequent call to gst_buffer_fill will invoke memcpy with
  a large tocopy size, resulting in an OOB-read. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.
