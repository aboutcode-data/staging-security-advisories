  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  pinctrl: fix deadlock in create_pinctrl() when handling -EPROBE_DEFER

  In create_pinctrl(), pinctrl_maps_mutex is acquired before calling
  add_setting(). If add_setting() returns -EPROBE_DEFER, create_pinctrl()
  calls pinctrl_free(). However, pinctrl_free() attempts to acquire
  pinctrl_maps_mutex, which is already held by create_pinctrl(), leading to
  a potential deadlock.

  This patch resolves the issue by releasing pinctrl_maps_mutex before
  calling pinctrl_free(), preventing the deadlock.

  This bug was discovered and resolved using Coverity Static Analysis
  Security Testing (SAST) by Synopsys, Inc.
