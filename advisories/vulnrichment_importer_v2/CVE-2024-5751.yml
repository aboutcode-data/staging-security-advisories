aliases: []
summary: BerriAI/litellm version v1.35.8 contains a vulnerability where an attacker can achieve
  remote code execution. The vulnerability exists in the `add_deployment` function, which decodes
  and decrypts environment variables from base64 and assigns them to `os.environ`. An attacker
  can exploit this by sending a malicious payload to the `/config/update` endpoint, which is
  then processed and executed by the server when the `get_secret` function is triggered. This
  requires the server to use Google KMS and a database to store a model.
