aliases: []
summary: The Royal Elementor Addons WordPress plugin before 1.3.56 does not have authorization
  and CSRF checks when deleting a template and does not ensure that the post to be deleted is
  a template. This could allow any authenticated users, such as subscribers, to delete arbitrary
  posts assuming they know the related slug.
