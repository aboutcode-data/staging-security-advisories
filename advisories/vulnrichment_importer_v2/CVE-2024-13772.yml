aliases: []
summary: The Civi - Job Board & Freelance Marketplace WordPress Theme plugin for WordPress is
  vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.6.1. This is
  due to a lack of password randomization and user validation through the fb_ajax_login_or_register
  and google_ajax_login_or_register actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to login as any user as long as they have access to the email.
