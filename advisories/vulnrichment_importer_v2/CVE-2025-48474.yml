aliases: []
summary: FreeScout is a free self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. Prior to version 1.8.180,
  the application incorrectly checks user access rights for conversations. Users with show_only_assigned_conversations
  enabled can assign themselves to an arbitrary conversation from the mailbox to which they
  have access, thereby bypassing the restriction on viewing conversations. This issue has been
  patched in version 1.8.180.
