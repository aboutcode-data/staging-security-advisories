aliases: []
summary: Vela is a Pipeline Automation (CI/CD) framework built on Linux container technology
  written in Golang. In Vela Server and Vela Worker prior to version 0.16.0 and Vela UI prior
  to version 0.17.0, some default configurations for Vela allow exploitation and container breakouts.
  Users should upgrade to Server 0.16.0, Worker 0.16.0, and UI 0.17.0 to fix the issue. After
  upgrading, Vela administrators will need to explicitly change the default settings to configure
  Vela as desired. Some of the fixes will interrupt existing workflows and will require Vela
  administrators to modify default settings. However, not applying the patch (or workarounds)
  will continue existing risk exposure. Some workarounds are available. Vela administrators
  can adjust the worker's `VELA_RUNTIME_PRIVILEGED_IMAGES` setting to be explicitly empty, leverage
  the `VELA_REPO_ALLOWLIST` setting on the server component to restrict access to a list of
  repositories that are allowed to be enabled, and/or audit enabled repositories and disable
  pull_requests if they are not needed.
