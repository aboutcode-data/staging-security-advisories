aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in open-webui/open-webui versions <= 0.3.8 allows remote code execution
  by non-admin users via Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The application uses cookies with
  the SameSite attribute set to lax for authentication and lacks CSRF tokens. This allows an
  attacker to craft a malicious HTML that, when accessed by a victim, can modify the Python
  code of an existing pipeline and execute arbitrary code with the victim's privileges.
