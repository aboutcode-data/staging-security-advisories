  mm/hugetlb.c: fix UAF of vma in hugetlb fault pathway

  Syzbot reports a UAF in hugetlb_fault().  This happens because
  vmf_anon_prepare() could drop the per-VMA lock and allow the current VMA
  to be freed before hugetlb_vma_unlock_read() is called.

  We can fix this by using a modified version of vmf_anon_prepare() that
  doesn't release the VMA lock on failure, and then release it ourselves
  after hugetlb_vma_unlock_read().
