aliases: []
summary: CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework. Prior to 4.5.8, CodeIgniter lacked proper
  header validation for its name and value. The potential attacker can construct deliberately
  malformed headers with Header class. This could disrupt application functionality, potentially
  causing errors or generating invalid HTTP requests. In some cases, these malformed requests
  might lead to a DoS scenario if a remote service’s web application firewall interprets them
  as malicious and blocks further communication with the application. This vulnerability is
  fixed in 4.5.8.
