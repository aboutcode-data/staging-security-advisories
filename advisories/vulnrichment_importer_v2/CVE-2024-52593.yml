aliases: []
summary: Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform.In affected versions missing
  validation in `NoteCreateService.insertNote`, `ApPersonService.createPerson`, and `ApPersonService.updatePerson`
  allows an attacker to control the target of any "origin" links (such as the "view on remote
  instance" banner). Any HTTPS URL can be set, even if it belongs to a different domain than
  the note / user. Vulnerable Misskey instances will use the unverified URL for several clickable
  links, allowing an attacker to conduct phishing or other attacks against remote users. This
  issue has been addressed in version 2024.11.0-alpha.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There
  are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
