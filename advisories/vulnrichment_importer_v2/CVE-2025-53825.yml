aliases: []
summary: Dokploy is a free, self-hostable Platform as a Service (PaaS). Prior to version 0.24.3,
  an unauthenticated preview deployment vulnerability in Dokploy allows any user to execute
  arbitrary code and access sensitive environment variables by simply opening a pull request
  on a public repository. This exposes secrets and potentially enables remote code execution,
  putting all public Dokploy users using these preview deployments at risk. Version 0.24.3 contains
  a fix for the issue.
