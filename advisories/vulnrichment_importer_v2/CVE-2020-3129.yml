summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unity Connection Software
  could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a stored cross-site scripting (XSS)
  attack. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation by the web-based management
  interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing crafted data to a specific

  attack within the interface. This stored XSS attack would then be executed on the system of
  any user viewing the attacker-supplied data element.
