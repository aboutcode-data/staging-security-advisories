aliases: []
summary: The Easy Digital Downloads – Sell Digital Files & Subscriptions (eCommerce Store +
  Payments Made Easy) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via
  the Agreement Text value in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.2 due to insufficient input
  sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
  administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
  a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations
  where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
