aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the upload function of binary-husky/gpt_academic allows any user
  to read arbitrary files on the system, including sensitive files such as `config.py`. This
  issue affects the latest version of the product. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability
  by intercepting the websocket request during file upload and replacing the file path with
  the path of the file they wish to read. The server then copies the file to the `private_upload`
  folder and provides the path to the copied file, which can be accessed via a GET request.
  This vulnerability can lead to the exposure of sensitive system files, potentially including
  credentials, configuration files, or sensitive user data.
