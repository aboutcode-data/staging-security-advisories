aliases: []
summary: The Timeline Event History plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection
  in all versions up to, and including, 3.1 via deserialization of untrusted input 'timelines-data'
  parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access
  and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software.
  If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system,
  it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute
  code.
