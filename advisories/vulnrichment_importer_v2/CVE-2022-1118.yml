datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2022/1xxx/CVE-2022-1118.json
aliases: []
summary: Connected Components Workbench (v13.00.00 and prior), ISaGRAF Workbench (v6.0 though
  v6.6.9), and Safety Instrumented System Workstation (v1.2 and prior (for Trusted Controllers))
  do not limit the objects that can be deserialized. This allows attackers to craft a malicious
  serialized object that, if opened by a local user in Connected Components Workbench, may result
  in arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability requires user interaction to be successfully
  exploited
