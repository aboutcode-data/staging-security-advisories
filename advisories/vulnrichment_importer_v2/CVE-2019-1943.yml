summary: A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Small Business 200, 300, and 500 Series
  Switches software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to redirect a user to a
  malicious web page. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the parameters
  of an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting a user's
  HTTP request and modifying it into a request that causes the web interface to redirect the
  user to a specific malicious URL. This type of vulnerability is known as an open redirect
  attack and is used in phishing attacks that get users to unknowingly visit malicious sites.
