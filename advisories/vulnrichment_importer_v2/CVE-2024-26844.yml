  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  block: Fix WARNING in _copy_from_iter

  Syzkaller reports a warning in _copy_from_iter because an
  iov_iter is supposedly used in the wrong direction. The reason
  is that syzcaller managed to generate a request with
  a transfer direction of SG_DXFER_TO_FROM_DEV. This instructs
  the kernel to copy user buffers into the kernel, read into
  the copied buffers and then copy the data back to user space.

  Thus the iovec is used in both directions.

  Detect this situation in the block layer and construct a new
  iterator with the correct direction for the copy-in.
