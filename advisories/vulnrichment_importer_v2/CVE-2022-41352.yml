aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) 8.8.15 and 9.0. An attacker can
  upload arbitrary files through amavis via a cpio loophole (extraction to /opt/zimbra/jetty/webapps/zimbra/public)
  that can lead to incorrect access to any other user accounts. Zimbra recommends pax over cpio.
  Also, pax is in the prerequisites of Zimbra on Ubuntu; however, pax is no longer part of a
  default Red Hat installation after RHEL 6 (or CentOS 6). Once pax is installed, amavis automatically
  prefers it over cpio.
