aliases: []
summary: "An Improper Privilege Management vulnerability in SUSE Rancher allowed standard users\
  \ to leverage their existing permissions to manipulate Kubernetes secrets in the local\n cluster,\
  \ resulting in the secret being deleted, but their read-level \npermissions to the secret\
  \ being preserved. When this operation was \nfollowed-up by other specially crafted commands,\
  \ it could result in the \nuser gaining access to tokens belonging to service accounts in\
  \ the local cluster.\n\n\nThis issue affects Rancher: from >= 2.6.0 before < 2.6.13, from\
  \ >= 2.7.0 before < 2.7.4."
