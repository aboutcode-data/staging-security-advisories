aliases: []
summary: In langgenius/dify-web version 1.6.0, the authentication mechanism reveals the existence
  of user accounts by returning different error messages for non-existent and existing accounts.
  Specifically, when a login or registration attempt is made with a non-existent username or
  email, the system responds with a message such as "account not found." Conversely, when the
  username or email exists but the password is incorrect, a different error message is returned.
  This discrepancy allows an attacker to enumerate valid user accounts by analyzing the error
  responses, potentially facilitating targeted social engineering, brute force, or credential
  stuffing attacks.
