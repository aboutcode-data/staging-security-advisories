aliases: []
summary: "In Liferay Portal 7.4.3.27 through 7.4.3.42, and Liferay DXP 2024.Q1.1 through 2024.Q1.20,\
  \ 2023.Q4.0 through 2023.Q4.10, 2023.Q3.1 through 2023.Q3.10, 7.4 update 27 through update\
  \ 42 (Liferay PaaS, and Liferay Self-Hosted), the Objects module does not restrict the use\
  \ of Groovy scripts in Object actions for Admin Users. This allows remote authenticated admin\
  \ users with the Instance Administrator role to execute arbitrary Groovy scripts (i.e., remote\
  \ code execution) through Object actions. \n\nIn contrast, in Liferay DXP (Liferay SaaS),\
  \ the use of Groovy in Object actions is not allowed due to the high security risks it poses.\
  \ \n\nStarting from Liferay DXP 2024.Q2 and later, a new feature has been introduced in Instance\
  \ Settings that allows administrators to configure whether Groovy scripts are allowed in their\
  \ instances."
