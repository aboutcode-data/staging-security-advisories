aliases: []
summary: Grav is a file-based Web platform. Prior to 1.8.0-beta.27, due to improper authorization
  checks when modifying critical fields on a POST request to /admin/pages/{page_name}, an editor
  with only permissions to change basic content on the form is now able to change the functioning
  of the form through modifying the content of the data[_json][header][form] which is the YAML
  frontmatter which includes the process section which dictates what happens after a user submits
  the form which include some important actions that could lead to further vulnerabilities.
  This vulnerability is fixed in 1.8.0-beta.27.
