aliases: []
summary: The Royal Elementor Addons and Templates plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
  DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's Magazine Grid/Slider widget in all versions
  up to, and including, 1.3.980 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on
  user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses an injected page.
