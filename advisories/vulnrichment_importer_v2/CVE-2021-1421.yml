summary: A vulnerability in Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow
  an authenticated, local attacker to perform a command injection attack on an affected device.
  The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input to a configuration

  the execution of this command. A successful exploit could allow a non-privileged attacker
  authenticated in the restricted CLI to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating
  system (OS) with root privileges.
