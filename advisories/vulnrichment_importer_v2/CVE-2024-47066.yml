summary: Lobe Chat is an open-source artificial intelligence chat framework. Prior to version
  1.19.13, server-side request forgery protection implemented in `src/app/api/proxy/route.ts`

  URL which redirects to internal resources like a private network or loopback address. Version
  1.19.13 contains an improved fix for the issue.
