aliases: []
summary: 'LimeSurvey v5.4.15 was discovered to contain a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
  in the component /index.php/surveyAdministration/rendersidemenulink?subaction=surveytexts.
  This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML via a crafted
  payload injected into the Description or Welcome-message text fields. NOTE: the vendor indicates
  that this is not a vulnerability because the manipulation requires Superadministrator privileges,
  and Superadministrators are already allowed to customize surveys with JavaScript as they wish.'
