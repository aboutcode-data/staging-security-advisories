aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Cisco Aironet Series Access Points (APs) software could allow
  an authenticated, adjacent attacker to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly, resulting
  in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a deadlock condition that
  may occur when an affected AP attempts to dequeue aggregated traffic that is destined to an
  attacker-controlled wireless client. An attacker who can successfully transition between multiple
  Service Set Identifiers (SSIDs) hosted on the same AP while replicating the required traffic
  patterns could trigger the deadlock condition. A watchdog timer that detects the condition
  will trigger a reload of the device, resulting in a DoS condition while the device restarts.
