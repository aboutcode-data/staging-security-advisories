summary: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation vulnerability in Stackposts
  Social Marketing Tool allows Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attack. By submitting the payload
  in the username during registration, it can be executed later in the application panel. This
  could lead to the unauthorised acquisition of information (e.g. cookies from a logged-in user). After
  multiple attempts to contact the vendor we did not receive any answer. Our team has confirmed
  the existence of this vulnerability. We suppose this issue affects Social Marketing Tool in
  all versions.
