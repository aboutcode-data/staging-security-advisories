aliases: []
summary: MQTTX is an MQTT 5.0 desktop client and MQTT testing tool. A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  vulnerability was introduced in MQTTX v1.12.0 due to improper handling of MQTT message payload
  rendering. Malicious payloads containing HTML or JavaScript could be rendered directly in
  the MQTTX message viewer. If exploited, this could allow attackers to execute arbitrary scripts
  in the context of the application UI — for example, attempting to access MQTT connection credentials
  or trigger unintended actions through script injection. This vulnerability is especially relevant
  when MQTTX is used with brokers in untrusted or multi-tenant environments, where message content
  cannot be fully controlled. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.12.1.
