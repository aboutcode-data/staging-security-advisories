  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: fix 6 GHz scan construction

  If more than 255 colocated APs exist for the set of all
  APs found during 2.4/5 GHz scanning, then the 6 GHz scan
  construction will loop forever since the loop variable
  has type u8, which can never reach the number found when
  that's bigger than 255, and is stored in a u32 variable.
  Also move it into the loops to have a smaller scope.

  Using a u32 there is fine, we limit the number of APs in
  the scan list and each has a limit on the number of RNR
  entries due to the frame size. With a limit of 1000 scan
  results, a frame size upper bound of 4096 (really it's
  more like ~2300) and a TBTT entry size of at least 11,
  we get an upper bound for the number of ~372k, well in
  the bounds of a u32.
