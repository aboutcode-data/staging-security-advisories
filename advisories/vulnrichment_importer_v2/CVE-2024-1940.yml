summary: The Brizy – Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via post content in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.41 due to insufficient input sanitization
  performed only on the client side and insufficient output escaping. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with contributor access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts
  in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
