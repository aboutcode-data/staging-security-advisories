aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in Samba. Some SMB1 write requests were not correctly range-checked
  to ensure the client had sent enough data to fulfill the write, allowing server memory contents
  to be written into the file (or printer) instead of client-supplied data. The client cannot
  control the area of the server memory written to the file (or printer).
