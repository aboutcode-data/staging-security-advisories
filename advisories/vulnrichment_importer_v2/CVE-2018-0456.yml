aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) input packet processor
  of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause the SNMP application
  of an affected device to restart unexpectedly. The vulnerability is due to improper validation
  of SNMP protocol data units (PDUs) in SNMP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the
  attacker to cause the SNMP application to restart multiple times, leading to a system-level
  restart and a denial of service (DoS) condition.
