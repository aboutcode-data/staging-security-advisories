aliases: []
summary: The AnyWhere Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.2.11 via the 'INSERT_ELEMENTOR' shortcode due to insufficient
  restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Contributor-level access and above, to extract data from private or draft posts created
  by Elementor that they should not have access to.
