  i2c: piix4: Fix a memory leak in the EFCH MMIO support

  The recently added support for EFCH MMIO regions introduced a memory
  leak in that code path. The leak is caused by the fact that
  release_resource() merely removes the resource from the tree but does
  not free its memory. We need to call release_mem_region() instead,
  which does free the memory. As a nice side effect, this brings back
  some symmetry between the legacy and MMIO paths.
