aliases: []
summary: 'Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host versions prior to 22.0.843
  and Application prior to 20.0.1923 (macOS/Linux client deployments) contain an arbitrary file
  write vulnerability via the response file handling. When tasks produce output the service
  writes response data into files under /opt/PrinterInstallerClient/tmp/responses/ reusing the
  requested filename. The service follows symbolic links in the responses directory and writes
  as the service user (typically root), allowing a local, unprivileged user to cause the service
  to overwrite or create arbitrary files on the filesystem as root. This can be used to modify
  configuration files, replace or inject binaries or drivers, and otherwise achieve local privilege
  escalation and full system compromise. This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor
  as: V-2023-019 — Arbitrary File Write as Root.'
