aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure
  (PI) and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM) could allow an authenticated, remote
  attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based
  management interface of an affected device. This vulnerability exists because the web-based
  management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to click a crafted link.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context
  of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
