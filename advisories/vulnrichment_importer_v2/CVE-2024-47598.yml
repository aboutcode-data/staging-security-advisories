aliases: []
summary: GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An OOB-read
  vulnerability has been discovered in the qtdemux_merge_sample_table function within qtdemux.c.
  The problem is that the size of the stts buffer isn’t properly checked before reading stts_duration,
  allowing the program to read 4 bytes beyond the boundaries of stts->data. This vulnerability
  reads up to 4 bytes past the allocated bounds of the stts array. This vulnerability is fixed
  in 1.24.10.
