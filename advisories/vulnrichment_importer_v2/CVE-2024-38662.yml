  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  bpf: Allow delete from sockmap/sockhash only if update is allowed

  We have seen an influx of syzkaller reports where a BPF program attached to
  a tracepoint triggers a locking rule violation by performing a map_delete
  on a sockmap/sockhash.

  We don't intend to support this artificial use scenario. Extend the
  existing verifier allowed-program-type check for updating sockmap/sockhash
  to also cover deleting from a map.

  From now on only BPF programs which were previously allowed to update
  sockmap/sockhash can delete from these map types.
