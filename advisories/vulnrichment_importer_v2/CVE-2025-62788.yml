datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2025/62xxx/CVE-2025-62788.json
aliases: []
summary: Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and
  response. Prior to 4.11.0, w_copy_event_for_log() references memory (initially allocated in
  OS_CleanMSG()) after it has been freed. A compromised agent can potentially compromise the
  integrity of the application by sending a specially crafted message to the wazuh manager.
  An attacker who is able to craft and send an agent message to the wazuh manager can leverage
  this issue to potentially compromise the integrity of the application (the use of previously
  freed memory may corrupt valid data, if the memory area in question has been allocated and
  used properly elsewhere). This vulnerability is fixed in 4.11.0.
