aliases: []
summary: Terraform Enterprise since v202207-1 did not properly implement authorization rules
  for agent pools, allowing the workspace to be targeted by unauthorized agents. This authorization
  flaw could potentially allow a workspace to access resources from a separate, higher-privileged
  workspace in the same organization that targeted an agent pool. This vulnerability, CVE-2023-3114,
  is fixed in Terraform Enterprise v202306-1.
