aliases: []
summary: OpenObserve is a cloud-native observability platform. Prior to version 0.16.0, organization
  invitation tokens do not expire once issued, remain valid even after the invited user is removed
  from the organization, and allow multiple invitations to the same email with different roles
  where all issued links remain valid simultaneously. This results in broken access control
  where a removed or demoted user can regain access or escalate privileges. This issue has been
  patched in version 0.16.0.
