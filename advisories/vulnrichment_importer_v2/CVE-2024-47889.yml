aliases: []
summary: Action Mailer is a framework for designing email service layers. Starting in version
  3.0.0 and prior to versions 6.1.7.9, 7.0.8.5, 7.1.4.1, and 7.2.1.1, there is a possible ReDoS
  vulnerability in the block_format helper in Action Mailer. Carefully crafted text can cause
  the block_format helper to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a DoS
  vulnerability. All users running an affected release should either upgrade to versions 6.1.7.9,
  7.0.8.5, 7.1.4.1, or 7.2.1.1 or apply the relevant patch immediately. As a workaround, users
  can avoid calling the `block_format` helper or upgrade to Ruby 3.2. Ruby 3.2 has mitigations
  for this problem, so Rails applications using Ruby 3.2 or newer are unaffected. Rails 8.0.0.beta1
  requires Ruby 3.2 or greater so is unaffected.
