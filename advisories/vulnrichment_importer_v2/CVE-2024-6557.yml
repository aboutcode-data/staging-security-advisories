aliases: []
summary: The SchedulePress – Auto Post & Publish, Auto Social Share, Schedule Posts with Editorial
  Calendar & Missed Schedule Post Publisher plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path
  Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.3. This is due the plugin utilizing the
  wpdeveloper library and leaving the demo files in place with display_errors on. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application,
  which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own,
  and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.
