aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Django 5.0 before 5.0.7 and 4.2 before 4.2.14. Derived classes
  of the django.core.files.storage.Storage base class, when they override generate_filename()
  without replicating the file-path validations from the parent class, potentially allow directory
  traversal via certain inputs during a save() call. (Built-in Storage sub-classes are unaffected.)
