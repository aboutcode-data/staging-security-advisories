aliases: []
summary: Core Bot Is an Open Source discord bot made for maple hospital servers. Prior to commit
  dffe050, the API keys (SUPABASE_API_KEY, TOKEN) are loaded using environment variables, but
  there are cases in code (error handling, summaries, webhooks) where configuration summaries
  may inadvertently leak sensitive data (e.g., by failing to redact data in summary embeds or
  logs). This issue has been patched via commit dffe050.
