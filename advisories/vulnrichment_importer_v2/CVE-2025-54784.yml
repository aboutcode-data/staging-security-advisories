aliases: []
summary: SuiteCRM is an open-source, enterprise-ready Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
  software application. There is a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the email viewer
  in versions 7.14.0 through 7.14.6. An external attacker could send a prepared message to the
  inbox of the SuiteCRM-instance. By simply viewing emails as the logged-in user, the payload
  can be triggered. With that, an attacker is able to run arbitrary actions as the logged-in
  user - like extracting data, or if it is an admin executing the payload, takeover the instance.
  This is fixed in versions 7.14.7.
