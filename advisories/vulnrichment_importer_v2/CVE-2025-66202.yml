aliases: []
summary: Astro is a web framework. Versions 5.15.7 and below have a double URL encoding bypass
  which allows any unauthenticated attacker to bypass path-based authentication checks in Astro
  middleware, granting unauthorized access to protected routes. While the original CVE-2025-64765
  was fixed in v5.15.8, the fix is insufficient as it only decodes once. By using double-encoded
  URLs, attackers can still bypass authentication and access any route protected by middleware
  pathname checks. This issue is fixed in version 5.15.8.
