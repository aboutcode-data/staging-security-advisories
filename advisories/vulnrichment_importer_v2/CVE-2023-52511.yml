  spi: sun6i: reduce DMA RX transfer width to single byte

  Through empirical testing it has been determined that sometimes RX SPI
  transfers with DMA enabled return corrupted data. This is down to single
  or even multiple bytes lost during DMA transfer from SPI peripheral to
  memory. It seems the RX FIFO within the SPI peripheral can become
  confused when performing bus read accesses wider than a single byte to it
  during an active SPI transfer.

  This patch reduces the width of individual DMA read accesses to the
  RX FIFO to a single byte to mitigate that issue.
