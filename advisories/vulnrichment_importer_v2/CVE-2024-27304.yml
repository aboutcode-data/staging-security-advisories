aliases: []
summary: pgx is a PostgreSQL driver and toolkit for Go. SQL injection can occur if an attacker
  can cause a single query or bind message to exceed 4 GB in size. An integer overflow in the
  calculated message size can cause the one large message to be sent as multiple messages under
  the attacker's control. The problem is resolved in v4.18.2 and v5.5.4. As a workaround, reject
  user input large enough to cause a single query or bind message to exceed 4 GB in size.
