  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  idpf: fix kernel panic on unknown packet types

  In the very rare case where a packet type is unknown to the driver,
  idpf_rx_process_skb_fields would return early without calling
  eth_type_trans to set the skb protocol / the network layer handler.
  This is especially problematic if tcpdump is running when such a
  packet is received, i.e. it would cause a kernel panic.

  Instead, call eth_type_trans for every single packet, even when
  the packet type is unknown.
