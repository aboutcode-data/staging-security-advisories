aliases: []
summary: An IP Spoofing vulnerability has been discovered in Likeshop up to 2.5.7.20210811.
  This issue allows an attacker to replace their real IP address with any arbitrary IP address,
  specifically by adding a forged 'X-Forwarded' or 'Client-IP' header to requests. Exploiting
  IP spoofing, attackers can bypass account lockout mechanisms during attempts to log into admin
  accounts, spoof IP addresses in requests sent to the server, and impersonate IP addresses
  that have logged into user accounts, etc.
