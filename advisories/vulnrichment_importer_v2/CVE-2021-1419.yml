aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the SSH management feature of multiple Cisco Access Points (APs)
  platforms could allow a local, authenticated user to modify files on the affected device and
  possibly gain escalated privileges. The vulnerability is due to improper checking on file
  operations within the SSH management interface. A network administrator user could exploit
  this vulnerability by accessing an affected device through SSH management to make a configuration
  change. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain privileges equivalent to the
  root user.
