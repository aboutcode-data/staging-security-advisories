aliases: []
summary: Nagios XI before 5.6.6 allows remote command execution as root. The exploit requires
  access to the server as the nagios user, or access as the admin user via the web interface.
  The getprofile.sh script, invoked by downloading a system profile (profile.php?cmd=download),
  is executed as root via a passwordless sudo entry; the script executes check_plugin, which
  is owned by the nagios user. A user logged into Nagios XI with permissions to modify plugins,
  or the nagios user on the server, can modify the check_plugin executable and insert malicious
  commands to execute as root.
