aliases: []
summary: Due to the lack of randomness in assigning Object Identifiers in the SAP NetWeaver
  AS JAVA IIOP service, an authenticated attacker with low privileges could predict the identifiers
  by conducting a brute force search. By leveraging knowledge of several identifiers generated
  close to the same time, the attacker could determine a desired identifier which could enable
  them to access limited system information. This poses a low risk to confidentiality without
  impacting the integrity or availability of the service.
