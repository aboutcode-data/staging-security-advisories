aliases: []
summary: 'In IZArc through 4.5, there is a Mark-of-the-Web Bypass Vulnerability. When a user
  performs an extraction from an archive file that bears Mark-of-the-Web, Mark-of-the-Web is
  not propagated to the extracted files. NOTE: this is disputed because Mark-of-the-Web propagation
  can increase risk via security-warning habituation, and because the intended control sphere
  for file-origin metadata (e.g., HostUrl in Zone.Identifier) may be narrower than that for
  reading the file''s content.'
