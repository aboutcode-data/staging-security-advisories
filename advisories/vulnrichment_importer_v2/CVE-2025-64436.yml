aliases: []
summary: KubeVirt is a virtual machine management add-on for Kubernetes. In 1.5.0 and earlier,
  the permissions granted to the virt-handler service account, such as the ability to update
  VMI and patch nodes, could be abused to force a VMI migration to an attacker-controlled node.
  This vulnerability could otherwise allow an attacker to mark all nodes as unschedulable, potentially
  forcing the migration or creation of privileged pods onto a compromised node.
