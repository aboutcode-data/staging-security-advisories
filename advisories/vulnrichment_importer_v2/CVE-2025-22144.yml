aliases: []
summary: NamelessMC is a free, easy to use & powerful website software for Minecraft servers.
  A user with admincp.core.emails or admincp.users.edit permissions can validate users and an
  attacker can reset their password. When the account is successfully approved by email the
  reset code is NULL, but when the account is manually validated by a user with admincp.core.emails
  or admincp.users.edit permissions then the reset_code will no longer be NULL but empty. An
  attacker can request http://localhost/nameless/index.php?route=/forgot_password/&c= and reset
  the password. As a result an attacker may compromise another users password and take over
  their account. This issue has been addressed in release version 2.1.3 and all users are advised
  to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
