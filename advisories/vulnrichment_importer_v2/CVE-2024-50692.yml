aliases: []
summary: SunGrow WiNet-SV200.001.00.P027 and earlier versions contains hardcoded MQTT credentials
  that allow an attacker to send arbitrary commands to an arbitrary inverter. It is also possible
  to impersonate the broker, because TLS is not used to identify the real MQTT broker. This
  means that MQTT communications are vulnerable to MitM attacks at the TCP/IP level.
