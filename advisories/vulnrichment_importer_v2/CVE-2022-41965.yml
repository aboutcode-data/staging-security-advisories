summary: Opencast is a free, open-source platform to support the management of educational audio
  and video content. Prior to Opencast 12.5, Opencast's Paella authentication page could be

  to redirect users to sites outside of one's Opencast install, potentially facilitating phishing
  attacks or other security issues. This issue is fixed in Opencast 12.5 and newer.
