aliases: []
summary: Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications.
  The default_validator.cc implementation used to implement the default certificate validation
  routines has a "type confusion" bug when processing subjectAltNames. This processing allows,
  for example, an rfc822Name or uniformResourceIndicator to be authenticated as a domain name.
  This confusion allows for the bypassing of nameConstraints, as processed by the underlying
  OpenSSL/BoringSSL implementation, exposing the possibility of impersonation of arbitrary servers.
  As a result Envoy will trust upstream certificates that should not be trusted.
