aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the Object Linking and Embedding 2 (OLE2) decryption routine of\
  \ ClamAV could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS)\
  \ condition on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to an integer underflow\
  \ in a bounds check that allows for a heap buffer overflow read. An attacker could exploit\
  \ this vulnerability by submitting a crafted file containing OLE2 content to be scanned by\
  \ ClamAV on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to terminate\
  \ the ClamAV scanning process, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected software.\r\n\
  For a description of this vulnerability, see the .\r\nCisco has released software updates\
  \ that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
