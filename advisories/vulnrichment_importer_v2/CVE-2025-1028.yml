aliases: []
summary: The Contact Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due
  to missing file type validation in the contact form upload feature in all versions up to,
  and including, 8.6.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary
  files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible in specific
  configurations where the first extension is processed over the final. This vulnerability also
  requires successfully exploiting a race condition in order to exploit.
