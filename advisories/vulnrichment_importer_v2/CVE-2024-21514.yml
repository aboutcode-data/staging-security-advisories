aliases: []
summary: This affects versions of the package opencart/opencart from 0.0.0. An SQL Injection
  issue was identified in the Divido payment extension for OpenCart, which is included by default
  in version 3.0.3.9. As an anonymous unauthenticated user, if the Divido payment module is
  installed (it does not have to be enabled), it is possible to exploit SQL injection to gain
  unauthorised access to the backend database. For any site which is vulnerable, any unauthenticated
  user could exploit this to dump the entire OpenCart database, including customer PII data.
