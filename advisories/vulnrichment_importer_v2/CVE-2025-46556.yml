aliases: []
summary: Mantis Bug Tracker (MantisBT) is an open source issue tracker. Versions 2.27.1 and
  below allow attackers to permanently corrupt issue activity logs by submitting extremely long
  notes (tested with 4,788,761 characters) due to a lack of server-side validation of note length.
  Once such a note is added, the activity stream UI fails to render; therefore, new notes cannot
  be displayed, effectively breaking all future collaboration on the issue. This issue is fixed
  in version 2.27.2.
