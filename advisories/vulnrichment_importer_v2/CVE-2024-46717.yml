summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net/mlx5e: SHAMPO, Fix incorrect page release

  Under the following conditions:
  1) No skb created yet
  2) header_size == 0 (no SHAMPO header)
  3) header_index + 1 % MLX5E_SHAMPO_WQ_HEADER_PER_PAGE == 0 (this is the
     last page fragment of a SHAMPO header page)

  a new skb is formed with a page that is NOT a SHAMPO header page (it
  is a regular data page). Further down in the same function
  (mlx5e_handle_rx_cqe_mpwrq_shampo()), a SHAMPO header page from
  header_index is released. This is wrong and it leads to SHAMPO header
  pages being released more than once.
