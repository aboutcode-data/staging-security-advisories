aliases: []
summary: An unrestricted file upload vulnerability exists in BuilderEngine 3.5.0 via the integration
  of the elFinder 2.0 file manager and its use of the jQuery File Upload plugin. The plugin
  fails to properly validate or restrict file types or locations during upload operations, allowing
  an attacker to upload a malicious .php file and subsequently execute arbitrary PHP code on
  the server under the context of the web server process. While the root vulnerability lies
  within the jQuery File Upload component, BuilderEngine’s improper integration and lack of
  access controls expose this functionality to unauthenticated users, resulting in full remote
  code execution.
