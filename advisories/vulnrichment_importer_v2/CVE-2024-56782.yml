aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ACPI: x86: Add adev NULL check to acpi_quirk_skip_serdev_enumeration()

  acpi_dev_hid_match() does not check for adev == NULL, dereferencing
  it unconditional.

  Add a check for adev being NULL before calling acpi_dev_hid_match().

  At the moment acpi_quirk_skip_serdev_enumeration() is never called with
  a controller_parent without an ACPI companion, but better safe than sorry.
