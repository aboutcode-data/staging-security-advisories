aliases: []
summary: Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host versions prior to 1.0.735
  and Application versions prior to 20.0.1330 (macOS/Linux client deployments) contain a vulnerability
  in the local inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism. The software stores IPC request
  and response files inside /opt/PrinterInstallerClient/tmp with world-readable and world-writable
  permissions. Any local user can craft malicious request files that are processed by privileged
  daemons, leading to unauthorized actions being executed in other user sessions. This breaks
  user session isolation, potentially allowing local attackers to hijack sessions, perform unintended
  actions in the context of other users, and impact system integrity and availability. This
  vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2022-004 — Client Inter-process Security.
