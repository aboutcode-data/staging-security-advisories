aliases: []
summary: OrangeHRM is a comprehensive human resource management (HRM) system. From version 5.0
  to 5.7, the interview attachment retrieval endpoint in the Recruitment module serves files
  based solely on an authenticated session and user-supplied identifiers, without verifying
  whether the requester has permission to access the associated interview record. Because the
  server does not perform any recruitment-level authorization checks, an ESS-level user with
  no access to recruitment workflows can directly request interview attachment URLs and receive
  the corresponding files. This exposes confidential interview documents—including candidate
  CVs, evaluations, and supporting files—to unauthorized users. The issue arises from relying
  on predictable object identifiers and session presence rather than validating the user’s association
  with the relevant recruitment process. This issue has been patched in version 5.8.
