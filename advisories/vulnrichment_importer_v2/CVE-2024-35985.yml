  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  sched/eevdf: Prevent vlag from going out of bounds in reweight_eevdf()

  It was possible to have pick_eevdf() return NULL, which then causes a
  NULL-deref. This turned out to be due to entity_eligible() returning
  falsely negative because of a s64 multiplcation overflow.

  Specifically, reweight_eevdf() computes the vlag without considering
  the limit placed upon vlag as update_entity_lag() does, and then the
  scaling multiplication (remember that weight is 20bit fixed point) can
  overflow. This then leads to the new vruntime being weird which then
  causes the above entity_eligible() to go side-ways and claim nothing
  is eligible.

  Thus limit the range of vlag accordingly.

  All this was quite rare, but fatal when it does happen.
