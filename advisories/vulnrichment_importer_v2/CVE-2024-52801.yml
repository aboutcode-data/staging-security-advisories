aliases: []
summary: 'sftpgo is a full-featured and highly configurable event-driven file transfer solution.
  Server protocols: SFTP, HTTP/S, FTP/S, WebDAV. The OpenID Connect implementation allows authenticated
  users to brute force session cookies and thereby gain access to other users'' data, since
  the cookies are generated predictably using the xid library and are therefore unique but not
  cryptographically secure. This issue was fixed in version v2.6.4, where cookies are opaque
  and cryptographically secure strings. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
  workarounds for this vulnerability.'
