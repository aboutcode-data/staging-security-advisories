aliases: []
summary: Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. In versions prior
  to 1.22.1 if Envoy attempts to send an internal redirect of an HTTP request consisting of
  more than HTTP headers, there’s a lifetime bug which can be triggered. If while replaying
  the request Envoy sends a local reply when the redirect headers are processed, the downstream
  state indicates that the downstream stream is not complete. On sending the local reply, Envoy
  will attempt to reset the upstream stream, but as it is actually complete, and deleted, this
  result in a use-after-free. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade are advised
  to disable internal redirects if crashes are observed.
