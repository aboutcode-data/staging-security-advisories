aliases: []
summary: Solara is a pure Python, React-style framework for scaling Jupyter and web apps. A
  Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability was identified in widgetti/solara, in version <1.35.1,
  which was fixed in version 1.35.1. This vulnerability arises from the application's failure
  to properly validate URI fragments for directory traversal sequences such as '../' when serving
  static files. An attacker can exploit this flaw by manipulating the fragment part of the URI
  to read arbitrary files on the local file system.
