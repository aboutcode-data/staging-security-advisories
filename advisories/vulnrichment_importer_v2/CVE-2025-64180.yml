summary: Manager-io/Manager is accounting software. In Manager Desktop and Server versions 25.11.1.3085
  and below, a critical vulnerability permits unauthorized access to internal network resources.
  The flaw lies in the fundamental design of the DNS validation mechanism. A Time-of-Check Time-of-Use
  (TOCTOU) condition that allows attackers to bypass network isolation and access internal services,
  cloud metadata endpoints, and protected network segments. The Desktop edition requires no
  authentication; the Server edition requires only standard authentication. This issue is fixed
  in version 25.11.1.3086.
