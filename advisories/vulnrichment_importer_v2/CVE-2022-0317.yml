aliases: []
summary: An improper input validation vulnerability in go-attestation before 0.3.3 allows local
  users to provide a maliciously-formed Quote over no/some PCRs, causing AKPublic.Verify to
  succeed despite the inconsistency. Subsequent use of the same set of PCR values in Eventlog.Verify
  lacks the authentication performed by quote verification, meaning a local attacker could couple
  this vulnerability with a maliciously-crafted TCG log in Eventlog.Verify to spoof events in
  the TCG log, hence defeating remotely-attested measured-boot. We recommend upgrading to Version
  0.4.0 or above.
