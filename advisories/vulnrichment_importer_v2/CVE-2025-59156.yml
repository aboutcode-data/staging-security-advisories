aliases: []
summary: Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications,
  and databases. Prior to version 4.0.0-beta.420.7, a Remote Code Execution (RCE)*vulnerability
  exists in Coolify's application deployment workflow. This flaw allows a low-privileged member
  to inject arbitrary Docker Compose directives during project creation or updates. By defining
  a malicious service that mounts the host filesystem, an attacker can achieve root-level command
  execution on the host OS, completely bypassing container isolation. Version 4.0.0-beta.420.7
  contains a patch for the issue.
