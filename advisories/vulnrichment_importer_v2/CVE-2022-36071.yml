aliases: []
summary: SFTPGo is configurable SFTP server with optional HTTP/S, FTP/S and WebDAV support.
  SFTPGo WebAdmin and WebClient support login using TOTP (Time-based One Time Passwords) as
  a secondary authentication factor. Because TOTPs are often configured on mobile devices that
  can be lost, stolen or damaged, SFTPGo also supports recovery codes. These are a set of one
  time use codes that can be used instead of the TOTP. In SFTPGo versions from version 2.2.0
  to 2.3.3 recovery codes can be generated before enabling two-factor authentication. An attacker
  who knows the user's password could potentially generate some recovery codes and then bypass
  two-factor authentication after it is enabled on the account at a later time. This issue has
  been fixed in version 2.3.4. Recovery codes can now only be generated after enabling two-factor
  authentication and are deleted after disabling it.
