aliases: []
summary: hippo4j 1.0.0 to 1.5.0, uses a hard-coded secret key in its JWT (JSON Web Token) creation.
  This allows attackers with access to the source code or compiled binary to forge valid access
  tokens and impersonate any user, including privileged ones such as "admin". The vulnerability
  poses a critical security risk in systems where authentication and authorization rely on the
  integrity of JWTs.
