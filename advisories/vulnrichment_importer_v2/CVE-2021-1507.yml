summary: A vulnerability in an API of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated,
  remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against users of the
  application web-based interface. This vulnerability exists because the API does not properly

  code in the context of the web-based interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
