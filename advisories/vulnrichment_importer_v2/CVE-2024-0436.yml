aliases: []
summary: |
  Theoretically, it would be possible for an attacker to brute-force the password for an instance in single-user password protection mode via a timing attack given the linear nature of the `!==` used for comparison.

  The risk is minified by the additional overhead of the request, which varies in a non-constant nature making the attack less reliable to execute
