summary: 'An issue was discovered in the oidc (aka OpenID Connect Authentication) extension
  before 4.0.0 for TYPO3. The account linking logic allows a pre-hijacking attack, leading to
  Account Takeover. The attack can only be exploited if the following requirements are met:

  a public frontend user account using that e-mail address before the user''s first OIDC login,
  and (3) the IDP returns an email field containing the e-mail address of the user,'
