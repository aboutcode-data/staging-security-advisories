aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in x509/x509_verify.c in LibreSSL before 3.6.1, and in OpenBSD
  before 7.2 errata 001. x509_verify_ctx_add_chain does not store errors that occur during leaf
  certificate verification, and therefore an incorrect error is returned. This behavior occurs
  when there is an installed verification callback that instructs the verifier to continue upon
  detecting an invalid certificate.
