aliases: []
summary: The User Toolkit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions
  up to, and including, 1.2.3. This is due to an improper capability check in the 'switchUser'
  function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions
  and above, to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator.
