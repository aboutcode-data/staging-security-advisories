aliases: []
summary: The Photoswipe Masonry Gallery WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting
  due to insufficient escaping and sanitization of the thumbnail_width, thumbnail_height, max_image_width,
  and max_image_height parameters  found in the ~/photoswipe-masonry.php file which allows authenticated
  attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts into galleries created by the plugin and on the
  PhotoSwipe Options page. This affects versions up to and including 1.2.14.
