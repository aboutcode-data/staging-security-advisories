aliases: []
summary: Code by Zapier before 2022-08-17 allowed intra-account privilege escalation that included
  execution of Python or JavaScript code. In other words, Code by Zapier was providing a customer-controlled
  general-purpose virtual machine that unintentionally granted full access to all users of a
  company's account, but was supposed to enforce role-based access control within that company's
  account. Before 2022-08-17, a customer could have resolved this by (in effect) using a separate
  virtual machine for an application that held credentials - or other secrets - that weren't
  supposed to be shared among all of its employees. (Multiple accounts would have been needed
  to operate these independent virtual machines.)
