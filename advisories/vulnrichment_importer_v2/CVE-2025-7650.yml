aliases: []
summary: The BizCalendar Web plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all
  versions up to, and including, 1.1.0.50 via the 'bizcalv' shortcode. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include and execute
  arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This
  can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in
  cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included.
