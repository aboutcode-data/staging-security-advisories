aliases: []
summary: The Rife Elementor Extensions & Templates plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
  Cross-Site Scripting via the 'tag' attribute within the plugin's Writing Effect Headline widget
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
  escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
  execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
