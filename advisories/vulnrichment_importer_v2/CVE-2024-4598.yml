aliases: []
summary: |
  An information disclosure vulnerability exists in multiple WSO2 products due to improper implementation of the enrich mediator. Authenticated users may be able to view unintended business data from other mediation contexts because the internal state is not properly isolated or cleared between executions.

  This vulnerability does not impact user credentials or access tokens but may lead to leakage of sensitive business information handled during message flows.
