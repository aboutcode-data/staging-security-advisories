aliases: []
summary: The Ally – Web Accessibility & Usability plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.0. This is due to missing or incorrect
  nonce validation on the enable_unfiltered_files_upload function. This makes it possible for
  unauthenticated attackers to enable unfiltered file upload and add svg files to the upload
  list via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
  such as clicking on a link.
