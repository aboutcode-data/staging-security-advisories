aliases: []
summary: |
  A vulnerability in the Eclipse Open VSX Registry’s automated publishing system could have allowed unauthorized uploads of extensions. Specifically, the system’s build scripts were executed without proper isolation, potentially exposing a privileged token. This token enabled the publishing of new extension versions under any namespace, including those not controlled by an attacker. However, it did not permit deletion of existing extensions, overwriting of published versions, or access to administrative features of the registry.

  The issue was reported on May 4, 2025, fully resolved by June 24, and followed by a comprehensive audit. No evidence of compromise was found, though 81 extensions were proactively deactivated as a precaution. The standard publishing process remained unaffected. Recommendations have been issued to mitigate similar risks in the future.
