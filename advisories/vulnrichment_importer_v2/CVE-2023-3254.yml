aliases: []
summary: The Widgets for Google Reviews plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery in versions up to, and including, 10.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce
  validation within setup_no_reg_header.php. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to reset plugin settings and remove reviews via a forged request granted they can trick a
  site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
