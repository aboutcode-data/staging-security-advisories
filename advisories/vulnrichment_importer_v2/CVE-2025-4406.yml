summary: The wpForo Forum plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.5 due to insufficient input

  Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute
  whenever a user accesses the SVG file.
