aliases: []
summary: opa-envoy-plugun is a plugin to enforce OPA policies with Envoy. Versions prior to
  1.13.2-envoy-2 have a vulnerability in how the `input.parsed_path` field is constructed. HTTP
  request paths are treated as full URIs when parsed; interpreting leading path segments prefixed
  with double slashes (`//`) as authority components, and therefore dropping them from the parsed
  path. This creates a path interpretation mismatch between authorization policies and backend
  servers, enabling attackers to bypass access controls by crafting requests where the authorization
  filter evaluates a different path than the one ultimately served. Version 1.13.2-envoy-2 fixes
  the issue.
