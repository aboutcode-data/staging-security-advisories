  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  bpf: Fix out-of-bounds dynptr write in bpf_crypto_crypt

  Stanislav reported that in bpf_crypto_crypt() the destination dynptr's
  size is not validated to be at least as large as the source dynptr's
  size before calling into the crypto backend with 'len = src_len'. This
  can result in an OOB write when the destination is smaller than the
  source.

  Concretely, in mentioned function, psrc and pdst are both linear
  buffers fetched from each dynptr:

    psrc = __bpf_dynptr_data(src, src_len);
    [...]
    pdst = __bpf_dynptr_data_rw(dst, dst_len);
    [...]
    err = decrypt ?
          ctx->type->decrypt(ctx->tfm, psrc, pdst, src_len, piv) :
          ctx->type->encrypt(ctx->tfm, psrc, pdst, src_len, piv);

  The crypto backend expects pdst to be large enough with a src_len length
  that can be written. Add an additional src_len > dst_len check and bail
  out if it's the case. Note that these kfuncs are accessible under root
  privileges only.
