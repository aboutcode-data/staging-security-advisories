aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web services interface of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance
  (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated,
  remote attacker to cause a buffer overflow on an affected system. The vulnerability is due
  to insufficient boundary checks for specific data that is provided to the web services interface
  of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious
  HTTP request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow condition
  on the affected system, which could disclose data fragments or cause the device to reload,
  resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
