summary: 'A vulnerability in the filesystem permissions of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow
  an authenticated, local attacker to access sensitive data that could be used to elevate their
  privileges to administrator. The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of filesystem
  permissions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the CLI of an affected
  device, accessing a specific file, and leveraging this information to authenticate to the
  NX-API server. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to make configuration changes
  as administrator. Note: NX-API is disabled by default. Nexus 3000 Series Switches are affected
  in versions prior to 7.0(3)I7(4). Nexus 3500 Platform Switches are affected in versions prior
  to 7.0(3)I7(4). Nexus 3600 Platform Switches are affected in versions prior to 7.0(3)F3(5).
  Nexus 9000 Series Switches-Standalone are affected in versions prior to 7.0(3)I7(4). Nexus
  9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules are affected in versions prior to 7.0(3)F3(5).'
