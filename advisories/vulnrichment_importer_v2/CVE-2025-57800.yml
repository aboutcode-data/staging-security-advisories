aliases: []
summary: Audiobookshelf is an open-source self-hosted audiobook server. In versions 2.6.0 through
  2.26.3, the application does not properly restrict redirect callback URLs during OIDC authentication.
  An attacker can craft a login link that causes Audiobookshelf to store an arbitrary callback
  in a cookie, which is later used to redirect the user after authentication. The server then
  issues a 302 redirect to the attacker-controlled URL, appending sensitive OIDC tokens as query
  parameters. This allows an attacker to obtain the victim's tokens and perform full account
  takeover, including creating persistent admin users if the victim is an administrator. Tokens
  are further leaked via browser history, Referer headers, and server logs. This vulnerability
  impacts all Audiobookshelf deployments using OIDC; no IdP misconfiguration is required. The
  issue is fixed in version 2.28.0. No known workarounds exist.
