aliases: []
summary: 'Opencast is a free, open-source platform to support the management of educational
  audio and video content. Prior to version 17.6, Opencast would incorrectly send the hashed
  global system account credentials (ie: org.opencastproject.security.digest.user and org.opencastproject.security.digest.pass)
  when attempting to fetch mediapackage elements included in a mediapackage XML file. A previous
  CVE prevented many cases where the credentials were inappropriately sent, but not all. Anyone
  with ingest permissions could cause Opencast to send its hashed global system account credentials
  to a url of their choosing. This issue is fixed in Opencast 17.6.'
