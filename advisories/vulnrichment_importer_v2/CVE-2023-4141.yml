aliases: []
summary: The WP Ultimate CSV Importer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution
  in versions up to, and including, 7.9.8 via the '->cus2' parameter. This allows authenticated
  attackers with author-level permissions or above, if the administrator previously grants access
  in the plugin settings, to create a PHP file and execute code on the server. The author resolved
  this vulnerability by removing the ability for authors and editors to import files, please
  note that this means php file creation is still allowed for site administrators, use the plugin
  with caution.
