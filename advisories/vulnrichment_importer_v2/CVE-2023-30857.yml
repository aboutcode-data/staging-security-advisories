aliases: []
summary: '@aedart/support is the support package for Ion, a monorepo for JavaScript/TypeScript
  packages. Prior to version `0.6.1`, there is a possible prototype pollution issue for the
  `MetadataRecord`, when merged with a base class'' metadata object, in `meta` decorator from
  the `@aedart/support` package. The likelihood of exploitation is questionable, given that
  a class''s metadata can only be set or altered when the class is decorated via `meta()`. Furthermore,
  object(s) of sensitive nature would have to be stored as metadata, before this can lead to
  a security impact. The issue has been patched in version `0.6.1`.'
