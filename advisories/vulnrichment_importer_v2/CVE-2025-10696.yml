aliases: []
summary: 'OpenSupports exposes an endpoint that allows the list of ''supervised users'' for
  any account to be edited, but it does not validate whether the actor is the owner of that
  list. A Level 1 staff member can modify the supervision relationship of a third party (the
  target user), who can then view the tickets of the added ''supervised'' users. This breaks
  the authorization model and filters the content of other users'' tickets.This issue affects
  OpenSupports: 4.11.0.'
