aliases: []
summary: stats is a macOS system monitor in for the menu bar. The Stats application is vulnerable
  to a local privilege escalation due to the insecure implementation of its XPC service. The
  application registers a Mach service under the name `eu.exelban.Stats.SMC.Helper`. The associated
  binary, eu.exelban.Stats.SMC.Helper, is a privileged helper tool designed to execute actions
  requiring elevated privileges on behalf of the client, such as setting fan modes, adjusting
  fan speeds, and executing the `powermetrics` command. The root cause of this vulnerability
  lies in the `shouldAcceptNewConnection` method, which unconditionally returns YES (or true),
  allowing any XPC client to connect to the service without any form of verification. As a result,
  unauthorized clients can establish a connection to the Mach service and invoke methods exposed
  by the HelperTool interface. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to modify the hardware
  settings of the user’s device and execute arbitrary code with root privileges. This issue
  has been addressed in version 2.11.21 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
  workarounds for this vulnerability.
