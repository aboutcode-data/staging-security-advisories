aliases: []
summary: '@hoppscotch/cli is a CLI to run Hoppscotch Test Scripts in CI environments. Prior
  to 0.8.0, the @hoppscotch/js-sandbox package provides a Javascript sandbox that uses the Node.js
  vm module. However, the vm module is not safe for sandboxing untrusted Javascript code. This
  is because code inside the vm context can break out if it can get a hold of any reference
  to an object created outside of the vm. In the case of @hoppscotch/js-sandbox, multiple references
  to external objects are passed into the vm context to allow pre-request scripts interactions
  with environment variables and more. But this also allows the pre-request script to escape
  the sandbox. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.8.0.'
