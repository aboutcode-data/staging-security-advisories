aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the SSH connection handling of Cisco Integrated Management Controller\
  \ (IMC) for Cisco UCS B-Series, UCS C-Series, UCS S-Series, and UCS X-Series Servers could\
  \ allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access internal services with elevated privileges.\r\
  \n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient restrictions on access to internal services.\
  \ An attacker with a valid user account could exploit this vulnerability by using crafted\
  \ syntax when connecting to the Cisco IMC of an affected device through SSH. A successful\
  \ exploit could allow the attacker to access internal services with elevated privileges, which\
  \ may allow unauthorized modifications to the system, including the possibility of creating\
  \ new administrator accounts on the affected device."
