summary: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. Prior to version 3.23.0,
  a malicious RDP server can trigger a heap buffer overflow in FreeRDP clients using the GDI
  surface pipeline (e.g., `xfreerdp`) by sending an RDPGFX ClearCodec surface command with an
  out-of-bounds destination rectangle. The `gdi_SurfaceCommand_ClearCodec()` handler does not
  call `is_within_surface()` to validate the command rectangle against the destination surface
  dimensions, allowing attacker-controlled `cmd->left`/`cmd->top` (and subcodec rectangle offsets)
  to reach image copy routines that write into `surface->data` without bounds enforcement. The
  OOB write corrupts an adjacent `gdiGfxSurface` struct's `codecs*` pointer with attacker-controlled
  pixel data, and corruption of `codecs*` is sufficient to reach an indirect function pointer
  call (`NSC_CONTEXT.decode` at `nsc.c:500`) on a subsequent codec command — full instruction
  pointer (RIP) control demonstrated in exploitability harness. Users should upgrade to version
  3.23.0 to receive a patch.
