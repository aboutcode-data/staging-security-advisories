summary: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.1.1 of the `stable`
  branch and version 3.2.0.beta1 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, a malicious user
  can create an unlimited number of drafts with very long draft keys which may end up exhausting
  the resources on the server. The issue is patched in version 3.1.1 of the `stable` branch
  and version 3.2.0.beta1 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. There are no known workarounds.
