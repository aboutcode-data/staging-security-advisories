aliases: []
summary: The Metro Development Server, which is opened by the React Native Community CLI, binds
  to external interfaces by default. The server exposes an endpoint that is vulnerable to OS
  command injection. This allows unauthenticated network attackers to send a POST request to
  the server and run arbitrary executables. On Windows, the attackers can also execute arbitrary
  shell commands with fully controlled arguments.
