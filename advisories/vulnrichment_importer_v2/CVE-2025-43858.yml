aliases: []
summary: YoutubeDLSharp is a wrapper for the command-line video downloaders youtube-dl and yt-dlp.
  In versions starting from 1.0.0-beta4 and prior to 1.1.2, an unsafe conversion of arguments
  allows the injection of a malicious commands when starting `yt-dlp` from a commands prompt
  running on Windows OS with the `UseWindowsEncodingWorkaround` value defined to true (default
  behavior). If a user is using built-in methods from the YoutubeDL.cs file, the value is true
  by default and a user cannot disable it from these methods. This issue has been patched in
  version 1.1.2.
