aliases: []
summary: The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to arbitrary file moving due to insufficient file path validation via the wc-upload-file[]
  parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to move arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution
  when the right file is moved (such as wp-config.php).
