aliases: []
summary: Versions of the package git-commit-info before 2.0.2 are vulnerable to Command Injection
  such that the package-exported method gitCommitInfo () fails to sanitize its parameter commit,
  which later flows into a sensitive command execution API. As a result, attackers may inject
  malicious commands once they control the hash content.
