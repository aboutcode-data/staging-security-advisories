aliases: []
summary: NLnet Labs Krill supports direct access to the RRDP repository content through its
  built-in web server at the "/rrdp" endpoint. Prior to 0.12.1 a direct query for any existing
  directory under "/rrdp/", rather than an RRDP file such as "/rrdp/notification.xml" as would
  be expected, causes Krill to crash. If the built-in "/rrdp" endpoint is exposed directly to
  the internet, then malicious remote parties can cause the publication server to crash. The
  repository content is not affected by this, but the availability of the server and repository
  can cause issues if this attack is persistent and is not mitigated.
