aliases: []
summary: Tonic is a native gRPC client & server implementation with async/await support. When
  using tonic::transport::Server there is a remote DoS attack that can cause the server to exit
  cleanly on accepting a TCP/TLS stream. This can be triggered by causing the accept call to
  error out with errors that were not covered correctly causing the accept loop to exit. Upgrading
  to tonic 0.12.3 and above contains the fix.
