aliases: []
summary: GeoServer is an open source server that allows users to share and edit geospatial data.
  From version 2.26.0 to before 2.26.2 and before 2.25.6, an XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability
  was identified. The application accepts XML input through a specific endpoint /geoserver/wms
  operation GetMap. However, this input is not sufficiently sanitized or restricted, allowing
  an attacker to define external entities within the XML request. This issue has been patched
  in GeoServer 2.25.6, GeoServer 2.26.3, and GeoServer 2.27.0.
