summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  memblock: make memblock_set_node() also warn about use of MAX_NUMNODES

  On an (old) x86 system with SRAT just covering space above 4Gb:

      ACPI: SRAT: Node 0 PXM 0 [mem 0x100000000-0xfffffffff] hotplug

  the commit referenced below leads to this NUMA configuration no longer
  being refused by a CONFIG_NUMA=y kernel (previously

      NUMA: nodes only cover 6144MB of your 8185MB e820 RAM. Not used.
      No NUMA configuration found
      Faking a node at [mem 0x0000000000000000-0x000000027fffffff]

  was seen in the log directly after the message quoted above), because of
  memblock_validate_numa_coverage() checking for NUMA_NO_NODE (only). This
  in turn led to memblock_alloc_range_nid()'s warning about MAX_NUMNODES
  triggering, followed by a NULL deref in memmap_init() when trying to
  access node 64's (NODE_SHIFT=6) node data.

  To compensate said change, make memblock_set_node() warn on and adjust
  a passed in value of MAX_NUMNODES, just like various other functions
  already do.
