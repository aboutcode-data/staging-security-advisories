aliases: []
summary: The API used to interact with documents in the application contains two endpoints with
  a flaw that allows an authenticated attacker to write a file with controlled contents to an
  arbitrary location on the underlying file system. This can be used to facilitate RCE. An account
  with ‘read’ and ‘write’ privileges on at least one existing document in the application is
  required to exploit the vulnerability. Exploitation of this vulnerability would allow an attacker
  to run commands of their choosing on the underlying operating system of the web server running
  LogicalDOC.
