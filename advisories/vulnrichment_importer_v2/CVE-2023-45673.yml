aliases: []
summary: 'Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application. A remote code execution
  (RCE) vulnerability in affected versions allows clicking on a link in a PDF in an untrusted
  note to execute arbitrary shell commands. Clicking links in PDFs allows for arbitrary code
  execution because Joplin desktop: 1. has not disabled top redirection for note viewer iframes,
  and 2. and has node integration enabled. This is a remote code execution vulnerability that
  impacts anyone who attaches untrusted PDFs to notes and has the icon enabled. This issue has
  been addressed in version 2.13.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
  for this vulnerability.'
