summary: 'Evmos is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Hub on the Cosmos Network. Preliminary
  checks on actions computed by the clawback vesting accounts are performed in the ante handler.
  Evmos core, implements two different ante handlers: one for Cosmos transactions and one for
  Ethereum transactions. Checks performed on the two implementation are different. The vulnerability
