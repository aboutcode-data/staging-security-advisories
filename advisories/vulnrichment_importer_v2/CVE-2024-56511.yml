aliases: []
summary: DataEase is an open source data visualization analysis tool. Prior to 2.10.4, there
  is a flaw in the authentication in the io.dataease.auth.filter.TokenFilter class, which can
  be bypassed and cause the risk of unauthorized access. In the io.dataease.auth.filter.TokenFilter
  class, ”request.getRequestURI“ is used to obtain the request URL, and it is passed to the
  "WhitelistUtils.match" method to determine whether the URL request is an interface that does
  not require authentication. The "match" method filters semicolons, but this is not enough.
  When users set "server.servlet.context-path" when deploying products, there is still a risk
  of being bypassed, which can be bypassed by any whitelist prefix /geo/../context-path/. The
  vulnerability has been fixed in v2.10.4.
