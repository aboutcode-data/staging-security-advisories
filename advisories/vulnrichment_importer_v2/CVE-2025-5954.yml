aliases: []
summary: The Service Finder SMS System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
  via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.0. This is due to the plugin
  not restricting user role selection at the time of registration through the aonesms_fn_savedata_after_signup()
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register as an administrator
  user.
