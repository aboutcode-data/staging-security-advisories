aliases: []
summary: phpMyFAQ is an open source FAQ web application for PHP 8.1+ and MySQL, PostgreSQL and
  other databases. A SQL injection vulnerability has been discovered in the the "Add News" functionality
  due to improper escaping of the email address. This allows any authenticated user with the
  rights to add/edit FAQ news to exploit this vulnerability to exfiltrate data, take over accounts
  and in some cases, even achieve RCE. The vulnerable field lies in the  `authorEmail` field
  which uses PHP's `FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL` filter. This filter is insufficient in protecting
  against SQL injection attacks and should still be properly escaped. However, in this version
  of phpMyFAQ (3.2.5), this field is not escaped properly can be used together with other fields
  to fully exploit the SQL injection vulnerability. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.2.6.
