aliases: []
summary: When calling `JS::CheckRegExpSyntax` a Syntax Error could have been set which would
  end in calling `convertToRuntimeErrorAndClear`. A path in the function could attempt to allocate
  memory when none is available which would have caused a newly created Out of Memory exception
  to be mishandled as a Syntax Error. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 117, Firefox ESR
  < 115.2, and Thunderbird < 115.2.
