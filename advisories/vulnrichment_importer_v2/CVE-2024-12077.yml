aliases: []
summary: The Booking Calendar and Booking Calendar Pro plugins for WordPress are vulnerable
  to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘calendar_id’ parameter in all versions up to, and
  including, 3.2.19 and 11.2.19 respectively, due to insufficient input sanitization and output
  escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
  in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such
  as clicking on a link.
