aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco RV132W ADSL2+ Wireless-N VPN Routers
  and Cisco RV134W VDSL2 Wireless-AC VPN Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to view configuration parameters for an affected device, which could lead to the disclosure
  of confidential information. The vulnerability is due to the absence of user authentication
  requirements for certain pages that are part of the web interface and contain confidential
  information for an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
  a crafted HTTP request to an affected device and examining the HTTP response to the request.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view configuration parameters, including
  the administrator password, for the affected device. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg92739, CSCvh60172.'
