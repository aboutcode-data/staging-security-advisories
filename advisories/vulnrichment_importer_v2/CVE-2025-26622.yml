aliases: []
summary: vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the EVM. Vyper `sqrt()` builtin uses
  the babylonian method to calculate square roots of decimals. Unfortunately, improper handling
  of the oscillating final states may lead to sqrt incorrectly returning rounded up results.
  This issue is being addressed and a fix is expected in version 0.4.1. Users are advised to
  upgrade as soon as the patched release is available. There are no known workarounds for this
  vulnerability.
