aliases: []
summary: authentik is an open-source Identity provider focused on flexibility and versatility.
  In versions prior to 2022.10.4, and 2022.11.4, any authenticated user can create an arbitrary
  number of accounts through the default flows. This would circumvent any policy in a situation
  where it is undesirable for users to create new accounts by themselves. This may also affect
  other applications as these new basic accounts would exist throughout the SSO infrastructure.
  By default the newly created accounts cannot be logged into as no password reset exists by
  default. However password resets are likely to be enabled by most installations. This vulnerability
  pertains to the user context used in the default-user-settings-flow, /api/v3/flows/instances/default-user-settings-flow/execute/.
  This issue has been fixed in versions 2022.10.4 and 2022.11.4.
