aliases: []
summary: The Go Pricing - WordPress Responsive Pricing Tables plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to PHP Object Injection in versions up to, and including, 3.3.19 via deserialization of untrusted
  input from the 'go_pricing' shortcode 'data' parameter. This allows authenticated attackers,
  with subscriber-level permissions and above, to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present
  in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed
  on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive
  data, or execute code.
