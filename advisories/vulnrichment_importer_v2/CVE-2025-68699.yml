aliases: []
summary: NanoMQ MQTT Broker (NanoMQ) is an all-around Edge Messaging Platform. In version 0.24.6,
  NanoMQ has a protocol parsing / forwarding inconsistency when handling shared subscriptions
  ($share/). A malformed SUBSCRIBE topic such as $share/ab (missing the second /) is not strictly
  validated during the subscription stage, so the invalid Topic Filter is stored into the subscription
  table. Later, when any PUBLISH matches this subscription, the broker send path (nmq_pipe_send_start_v4/v5)
  performs a second $share/ parsing using strchr() and increments the returned pointer without
  NULL checks. If the second strchr() returns NULL, sub_topic++ turns the pointer into an invalid
  address (e.g. 0x1). This invalid pointer is then passed into topic_filtern(), which triggers
  strlen() and crashes with SIGSEGV. The crash is stable and remotely triggerable. This issue
  has been patched in version 0.24.7.
