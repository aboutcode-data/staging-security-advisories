aliases: []
summary: Tibbo AggreGate Network Manager < 6.40.05 contains an observable response discrepancy
  in its login functionality. Authentication failure messages differ based on whether a supplied
  username exists or not, allowing an unauthenticated remote attacker to infer valid account
  identifiers. This can facilitate user enumeration and increase the likelihood of targeted
  brute-force or credential-stuffing attacks.
