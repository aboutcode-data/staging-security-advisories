  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  nfc: nci: free rx_data_reassembly skb on NCI device cleanup

  rx_data_reassembly skb is stored during NCI data exchange for processing
  fragmented packets. It is dropped only when the last fragment is processed
  or when an NTF packet with NCI_OP_RF_DEACTIVATE_NTF opcode is received.
  However, the NCI device may be deallocated before that which leads to skb
  leak.

  As by design the rx_data_reassembly skb is bound to the NCI device and
  nothing prevents the device to be freed before the skb is processed in
  some way and cleaned, free it on the NCI device cleanup.

  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.
