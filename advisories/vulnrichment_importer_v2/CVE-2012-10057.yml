aliases: []
summary: Lattice Semiconductor ispVM System v18.0.2 contains a buffer overflow vulnerability
  in its handling of .xcf project files. When parsing the version attribute of the ispXCF XML
  tag, the application fails to properly validate input length, allowing a specially crafted
  file to overwrite memory on the stack. This can result in arbitrary code execution under the
  context of the user who opens the file. The vulnerability is triggered locally by opening
  a malicious .xcf file and does not require elevated privileges.
