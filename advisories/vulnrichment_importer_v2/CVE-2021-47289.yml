  ACPI: fix NULL pointer dereference

  Commit 71f642833284 ("ACPI: utils: Fix reference counting in
  for_each_acpi_dev_match()") started doing "acpi_dev_put()" on a pointer
  that was possibly NULL.  That fails miserably, because that helper
  inline function is not set up to handle that case.

  Just make acpi_dev_put() silently accept a NULL pointer, rather than
  calling down to put_device() with an invalid offset off that NULL
  pointer.
