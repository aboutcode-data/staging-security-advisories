aliases: []
summary: Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Prior to
  versions 2.8.13, 2.9.9, and 2.10.4, an attacker can exploit a critical flaw in the application
  to initiate a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, rendering the application inoperable and affecting
  all users. The issue arises from unsafe manipulation of an array in a multi-threaded environment.
  The vulnerability is rooted in the application's code, where an array is being modified while
  it is being iterated over. This is a classic programming error but becomes critically unsafe
  when executed in a multi-threaded environment. When two threads interact with the same array
  simultaneously, the application crashes. This is a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability.
  Any attacker can crash the application continuously, making it impossible for legitimate users
  to access the service. The issue is exacerbated because it does not require authentication,
  widening the pool of potential attackers. Versions 2.8.13, 2.9.9, and 2.10.4 contain a patch
  for this issue.
