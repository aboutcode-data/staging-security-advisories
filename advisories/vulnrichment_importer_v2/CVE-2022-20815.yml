datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2022/20xxx/CVE-2022-20815.json
aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications
  Manager (Unified CM), Cisco Unified CM Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME), and Cisco
  Unified Communications Manager IM &amp; Presence Service (Unified CM IM&amp;P) could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against
  a user of the interface. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface
  does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface
  or access sensitive browser-based information.
