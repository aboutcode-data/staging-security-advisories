aliases: []
summary: Rockwell Automation's FactoryTalk System Services uses a hard-coded cryptographic key
  to generate administrator cookies.  Hard-coded cryptographic key may lead to privilege escalation. 
  This vulnerability may allow a local, authenticated non-admin user to generate an invalid
  administrator cookie giving them administrative privileges to the FactoryTalk Policy Manger
  database. This may allow the threat actor to make malicious changes to the database that will
  be deployed when a legitimate FactoryTalk Policy Manager user deploys a security policy model.
  User interaction is required for this vulnerability to be successfully exploited.
