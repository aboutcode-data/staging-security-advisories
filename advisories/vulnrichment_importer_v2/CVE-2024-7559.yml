aliases: []
summary: The File Manager Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due
  to missing file type validation and capability checks in the mk_file_folder_manager AJAX action
  in all versions up to, and including, 8.3.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server
  which may make remote code execution possible.
