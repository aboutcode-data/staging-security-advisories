summary: The AI Post Generator | AutoWriter plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
  access, modification or deletion of posts due to a missing capability check on functions hooked
  by AJAX actions in all versions up to, and including, 3.3. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with subscriber access or higher, to view all posts generated with this plugin
  (even in non-published status), create new posts (and publish them), publish unpublished post
  or perform post deletions.
