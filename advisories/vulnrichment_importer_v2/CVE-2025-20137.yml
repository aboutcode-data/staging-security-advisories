aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the access control list (ACL) programming of Cisco IOS Software\
  \ that is running on Cisco Catalyst 1000 Switches and Cisco Catalyst 2960L Switches could\
  \ allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured ACL.\r\n\r This vulnerability\
  \ is due to the use of both an IPv4 ACL and a dynamic ACL of IP Source Guard on the same interface,\
  \ which is an unsupported configuration. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting\
  \ to send traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker\
  \ to bypass an ACL on the affected device.\r\n\r Note: Cisco documentation has been updated\
  \ to reflect that this is an unsupported configuration. However, Cisco is publishing this\
  \ advisory because the device will not prevent an administrator from configuring both features\
  \ on the same interface. There are no plans to implement the ability to configure both features\
  \ on the same interface on Cisco Catalyst 1000 or Catalyst 2960L Switches."
