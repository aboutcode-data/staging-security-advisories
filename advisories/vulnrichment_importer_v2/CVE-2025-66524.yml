aliases: []
summary: Apache NiFi 1.20.0 through 2.6.0 include the GetAsanaObject Processor, which requires
  integration with a configurable Distribute Map Cache Client Service for storing and retrieving
  state information. The GetAsanaObject Processor used generic Java Object serialization and
  deserialization without filtering. Unfiltered Java object deserialization does not provide
  protection against crafted state information stored in the cache server configured for GetAsanaObject.
  Exploitation requires an Apache NiFi system running with the GetAsanaObject Processor, and
  direct access to the configured cache server. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 2.7.0 is the recommended
  mitigation, which replaces Java Object serialization with JSON serialization. Removing the
  GetAsanaObject Processor located in the nifi-asana-processors-nar bundle also prevents exploitation.
