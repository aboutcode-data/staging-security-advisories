aliases: []
summary: The WP Directory Kit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in
  versions up to, and including, 1.1.9 via the 'wdk_public_action' function. This allows unauthenticated
  attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of
  any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive
  data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded
  and included.
