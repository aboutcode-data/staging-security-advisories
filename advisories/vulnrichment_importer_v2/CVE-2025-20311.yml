summary: "A vulnerability in the handling of certain Ethernet frames in Cisco IOS XE Software\
  \ for Catalyst 9000 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause\
  \ an egress port to become blocked and drop all outbound traffic.\r\n\r This vulnerability\
  \ is due to improper handling of crafted Ethernet frames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by sending crafted Ethernet frames through an affected switch. A successful exploit could\
  \ allow the attacker to cause the egress port to which the crafted frame is forwarded to start\
  \ dropping all frames, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition."
