aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the host input API daemon of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC)
  Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS)
  condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper certificate validation.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted data stream to the host
  input daemon of the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause
  the host input daemon to restart. The attacker could use repeated attacks to cause the daemon
  to continuously reload, creating a DoS condition for the API.
