aliases: []
summary: ZoneMinder is a free, open source Closed-circuit television software application The
  file parameter is vulnerable to a cross site scripting vulnerability (XSS) by backing out
  of the current "tr" "td" brackets. This then allows a malicious user to provide code that
  will execute when a user views the specific log on the "view=log" page. This vulnerability
  allows an attacker to store code within the logs that will be executed when loaded by a legitimate
  user. These actions will be performed with the permission of the victim. This could lead to
  data loss and/or further exploitation including account takeover. This issue has been addressed
  in versions `1.36.27` and `1.37.24`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade
  should disable database logging.
