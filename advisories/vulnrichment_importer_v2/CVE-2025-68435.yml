aliases: []
summary: Zerobyte is a backup automation tool Zerobyte versions prior to 0.18.5 and 0.19.0 contain
  an authentication bypass vulnerability where authentication middleware is not properly applied
  to API endpoints. This results in certain API endpoints being accessible without valid session
  credentials. This is dangerous for those who have exposed Zerobyte to be used outside of their
  internal network. A fix has been applied in both version 0.19.0 and 0.18.5. If immediate upgrade
  is not possible, restrict network access to the Zerobyte instance to trusted networks only
  using firewall rules or network segmentation. This is only a temporary mitigation; upgrading
  is strongly recommended.
