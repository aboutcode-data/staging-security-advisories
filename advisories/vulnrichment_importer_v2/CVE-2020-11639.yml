datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2020-11639
datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2020/11xxx/CVE-2020-11639.json
aliases: []
summary: |
  An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by
  injecting garbage data or specially crafted data. Depending on the data injected each process might be
  affected differently. The process could crash or cause communication issues on the affected node, effectively causing a denial-of-service attack. The attacker could tamper with the data transmitted, causing
  the product to store wrong information or act on wrong data or display wrong information.


  This issue affects Advant MOD 300 AdvaBuild: from 3.0 through 3.7 SP2.




  For an attack to be successful, the attacker must have local access to a node in the system and be able to
  start a specially crafted application that disrupts the communication.
  An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability would be able to manipulate the data in such
  way as allowing reads and writes to the controllers or cause Windows processes in 800xA for MOD 300
  and AdvaBuild to crash.
