aliases: []
summary: Uncontrolled recursion in XPath evaluation in libxml2 up to and including version 2.9.14
  allows a local attacker to cause a stack overflow via crafted expressions. XPath processing
  functions `xmlXPathRunEval`, `xmlXPathCtxtCompile`, and `xmlXPathEvalExpr` were resetting
  recursion depth to zero before making potentially recursive calls. When such functions were
  called recursively this could allow for uncontrolled recursion and lead to a stack overflow.
  These functions now preserve recursion depth across recursive calls, allowing recursion depth
  to be controlled.
