  drm/amd/display: Add NULL check for clk_mgr and clk_mgr->funcs in dcn401_init_hw

  This commit addresses a potential null pointer dereference issue in the
  `dcn401_init_hw` function. The issue could occur when `dc->clk_mgr` or
  `dc->clk_mgr->funcs` is null.

  The fix adds a check to ensure `dc->clk_mgr` and `dc->clk_mgr->funcs` is
  not null before accessing its functions. This prevents a potential null
  pointer dereference.

  Reported by smatch:
  drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/hwss/dcn401/dcn401_hwseq.c:416 dcn401_init_hw() error: we previously assumed 'dc->clk_mgr' could be null (see line 225)
