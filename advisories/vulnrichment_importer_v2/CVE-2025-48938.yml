aliases: []
summary: go-gh is a collection of Go modules to make authoring GitHub CLI extensions easier.
  A security vulnerability has been identified in versions prior to 2.12.1 where an attacker-controlled
  GitHub Enterprise Server could result in executing arbitrary commands on a user's machine
  by replacing HTTP URLs provided by GitHub with local file paths for browsing. In `2.12.1`,
  `Browser.Browse()` has been enhanced to allow and disallow a variety of scenarios to avoid
  opening or executing files on the filesystem without unduly impacting HTTP URLs. No known
  workarounds are available other than upgrading.
