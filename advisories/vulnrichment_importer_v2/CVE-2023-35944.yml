aliases: []
summary: Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications.
  Envoy allows mixed-case schemes in HTTP/2, however, some internal scheme checks are case-sensitive.
  Prior to versions 1.27.0, 1.26.4, 1.25.9, 1.24.10, and 1.23.12, this can lead to the rejection
  of requests with mixed-case schemes such as `htTp` or `htTps`, or the bypassing of some requests
  such as `https` in unencrypted connections. With a fix in versions 1.27.0, 1.26.4, 1.25.9,
  1.24.10, and 1.23.12, Envoy will now lowercase scheme values by default, and change the internal
  scheme checks that were case-sensitive to be case-insensitive. There are no known workarounds
  for this issue.
