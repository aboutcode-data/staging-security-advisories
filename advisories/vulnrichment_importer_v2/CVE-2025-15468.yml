summary: "Issue summary: If an application using the SSL_CIPHER_find() function in\na QUIC protocol\
  \ client or server receives an unknown cipher suite from\nthe peer, a NULL dereference occurs.\n\
  \nImpact summary: A NULL pointer dereference leads to abnormal termination of\nthe running\
  \ process causing Denial of Service.\n\nSome applications call SSL_CIPHER_find() from the\
  \ client_hello_cb callback\non the cipher ID received from the peer. If this is done with\
  \ an SSL object\nimplementing the QUIC protocol, NULL pointer dereference will happen if\n\
  the examined cipher ID is unknown or unsupported.\n\nAs it is not very common to call this\
  \ function in applications using the QUIC \nprotocol and the worst outcome is Denial of Service,\
  \ the issue was assessed\nas Low severity.\n\nThe vulnerable code was introduced in the 3.2\
  \ version with the addition\nof the QUIC protocol support.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.6, 3.5,\
  \ 3.4 and 3.3 are not affected by this issue,\nas the QUIC implementation is outside the OpenSSL\
  \ FIPS module boundary.\n\nOpenSSL 3.6, 3.5, 3.4 and 3.3 are vulnerable to this issue.\n\n\
  OpenSSL 3.0, 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are not affected by this issue."
