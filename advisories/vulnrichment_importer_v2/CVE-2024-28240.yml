aliases: []
summary: The GLPI Agent is a generic management agent. A vulnerability that only affects GLPI-Agent
  installed on windows via MSI packaging can allow a local user to cause denial of agent service
  by replacing GLPI server url with a wrong url or disabling the service. Additionally, in the
  case the Deploy task is installed, a local malicious user can trigger privilege escalation
  configuring a malicious server providing its own deploy task payload. GLPI-Agent 1.7.2 contains
  a patch for this issue. As a workaround, edit GLPI-Agent related key under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall`
  and add `SystemComponent` DWORD value setting it to `1` to hide GLPI-Agent from installed
  applications.
