aliases: []
summary: UnoPim is an open-source Product Information Management (PIM) system built on the Laravel
  framework. Versions 0.3.0 and prior are vulnerable to CSV injection, also known as formula
  injection, in the Quick Export feature. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious
  content into exported CSV files. When the CSV file is opened in spreadsheet applications such
  as Microsoft Excel, the malicious input may be interpreted as a formula or command, potentially
  resulting in the execution of arbitrary code on the victim's device. Successful exploitation
  can lead to remote code execution, including the establishment of a reverse shell. Users are
  advised to upgrade to version 0.3.1 or later.
