aliases: []
summary: Nuxt is a free and open-source framework to create full-stack web applications and
  websites with Vue.js. Due to the insufficient validation of the `path` parameter in the NuxtTestComponentWrapper,
  an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript on the server side, which allows them to execute
  arbitrary commands. Users who open a malicious web page in the browser while running the test
  locally are affected by this vulnerability, which results in the remote code execution from
  the malicious web page. Since web pages can send requests to arbitrary addresses, a malicious
  web page can repeatedly try to exploit this vulnerability, which then triggers the exploit
  when the test server starts.
