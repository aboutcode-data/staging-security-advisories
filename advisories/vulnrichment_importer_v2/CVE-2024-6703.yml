aliases: []
summary: The Contact Form Plugin by Fluent Forms for Quiz, Survey, and Drag & Drop WP Form Builder
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘description’ and
  'btn_txt' parameters in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.19 due to insufficient input
  sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for attackers with the Form Manager
  permissions and Subscriber+ user role, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
  execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
