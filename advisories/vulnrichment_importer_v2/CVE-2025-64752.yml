aliases: []
summary: grist-core is a spreadsheet hosting server. Prior to version 1.7.7, a user with access
  to any document on a Grist installation can use a feature for fetching from a URL that is
  executed on the server. The privileged network access of server-side requests could offer
  opportunities for attack escalation. This issue is fixed in version 1.7.7. The mitigation
  was to use the proxy for untrusted fetches intended for such purposes. As a workaround, avoid
  making http/https endpoints available to an instance running Grist that expose credentials
  or operate without credentials.
