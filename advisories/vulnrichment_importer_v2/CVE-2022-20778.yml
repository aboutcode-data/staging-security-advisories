aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the authentication component of Cisco Webex Meetings could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against
  a user of the web-based interface. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of
  user-supplied input by the web-based interface of the authentication component of Cisco Webex
  Meetings. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface
  to click a maliciously crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute
  arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based
  information.
