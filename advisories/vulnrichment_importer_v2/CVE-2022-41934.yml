aliases: []
summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications
  built on top of it. Any user with view rights on commonly accessible documents including the
  menu macro can execute arbitrary Groovy, Python or Velocity code in XWiki leading to full
  access to the XWiki installation due to improper escaping of the macro content and parameters
  of the menu macro. The problem has been patched in XWiki 14.6RC1, 13.10.8 and 14.4.3. The
  patch (commit `2fc20891`) for the document `Menu.MenuMacro` can be manually applied or a XAR
  archive of a patched version can be imported. The menu macro was basically unchanged since
  XWiki 11.6 so on XWiki 11.6 or later the patch for version of 13.10.8 (commit `59ccca24a`)
  can most likely be applied, on XWiki version 14.0 and later the versions in XWiki 14.6 and
  14.4.3 should be appropriate.
