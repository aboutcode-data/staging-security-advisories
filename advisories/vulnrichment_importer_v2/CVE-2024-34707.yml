aliases: []
summary: Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform. A Nautobot user
  with admin privileges can modify the `BANNER_TOP`, `BANNER_BOTTOM`, and `BANNER_LOGIN` configuration
  settings via the `/admin/constance/config/` endpoint. Normally these settings are used to
  provide custom banner text at the top and bottom of all Nautobot web pages (or specifically
  on the login page in the case of `BANNER_LOGIN`) but it was reported that an admin user can
  make use of these settings to inject arbitrary HTML, potentially exposing Nautobot users to
  security issues such as cross-site scripting (stored XSS). The vulnerability is fixed in Nautobot
  1.6.22 and 2.2.4.
