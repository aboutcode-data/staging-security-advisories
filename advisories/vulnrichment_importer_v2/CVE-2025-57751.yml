aliases: []
summary: pyLoad is the free and open-source Download Manager written in pure Python. The jk
  parameter is received in pyLoad CNL Blueprint. Due to the lack of jk parameter verification,
  the jk parameter input by the user is directly determined as dykpy.evaljs(), resulting in
  the server CPU being fully occupied and the web-ui becoming unresponsive. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 0.5.0b3.dev92.
