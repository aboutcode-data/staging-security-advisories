aliases: []
summary: Archery is an open source SQL audit platform. The Archery project contains multiple
  SQL injection vulnerabilities, that may allow an attacker to query the connected databases.Affected
  versions are subject to SQL injection in the `explain` method in `sql_optimize.py`. User input
  coming from the `db_name` parameter value in the `explain` endpoint is passed to the following
  `query` methods of each database engine for execution. `query` in `sql/engines/mssql.py`,
  and `query` in `sql/engines/oracle.py`. Each of these issues may be mitigated by escaping
  user input or by using prepared statements when executing SQL queries. This issue is also
  indexed as `GHSL-2022-108`.
