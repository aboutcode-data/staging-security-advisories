aliases: []
summary: Azle is a WebAssembly runtime for TypeScript and JavaScript on ICP. Calling `setTimer`
  in Azle versions `0.27.0`, `0.28.0`, and `0.29.0` causes an immediate infinite loop of timers
  to be executed on the canister, each timer attempting to clean up the global state of the
  previous timer. The infinite loop will occur with any valid invocation of `setTimer`. The
  problem has been fixed as of Azle version `0.30.0`. As a workaround, if a canister is caught
  in this infinite loop after calling `setTimer`, the canister can be upgraded and the timers
  will all be cleared, thus ending the loop.
