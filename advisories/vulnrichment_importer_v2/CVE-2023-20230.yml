aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the restricted security domain implementation of Cisco Application\
  \ Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to\
  \ read, modify, or delete non-tenant policies (for example, access policies) created by users\
  \ associated with a different security domain on an affected system.\r\n\r This vulnerability\
  \ is due to improper access control when restricted security domains are used to implement\
  \ multi-tenancy for policies outside the tenant boundaries. An attacker with a valid user\
  \ account associated with a restricted security domain could exploit this vulnerability. A\
  \ successful exploit could allow the attacker to read, modify, or delete policies created\
  \ by users associated with a different security domain. Exploitation is not possible for policies\
  \ under tenants that an attacker has no authorization to access."
