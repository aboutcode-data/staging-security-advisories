aliases: []
summary: The LatePoint plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all
  versions up to, and including, 5.1.94. This is due to missing nonce validation on the change_password()
  function of its customer_cabinet__change_password AJAX route. The plugin hooks this endpoint
  via wp_ajax and wp_ajax_nopriv but does not verify a nonce or user capability before resetting
  the user’s password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers who trick a logged-in
  customer (or, with “WP users as customers” enabled, an administrator) into visiting a malicious
  link to take over their account.
