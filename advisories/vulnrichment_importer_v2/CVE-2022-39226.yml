aliases: []
summary: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. In versions prior to 2.8.9 on the
  `stable` branch and prior to 2.9.0.beta10 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, a malicious
  actor can add large payloads of text into the Location and Website fields of a user profile,
  which causes issues for other users when loading that profile. A fix to limit the length of
  user input for these fields is included in version 2.8.9 on the `stable` branch and version
  2.9.0.beta10 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. There are no known workarounds.
