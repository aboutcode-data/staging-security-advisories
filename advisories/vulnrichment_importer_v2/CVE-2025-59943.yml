summary: phpMyFAQ is an open source FAQ web application. Versions 4.0-nightly-2025-10-03 and
  below do not enforce uniqueness of email addresses during user registration. This allows multiple
  distinct accounts to be created with the same email. Because email is often used as an identifier
  for password resets, notifications, and administrative actions, this flaw can cause account
  ambiguity and, in certain configurations, may lead to privilege escalation or account takeover.
  This issue is fixed in version 4.0.13.
