aliases: []
summary: 'The findOne function in TypeORM before 0.3.0 can either be supplied with a string
  or a FindOneOptions object. When input to the function is a user-controlled parsed JSON object,
  supplying a crafted FindOneOptions instead of an id string leads to SQL injection. NOTE: the
  vendor''s position is that the user''s application is responsible for input validation'
