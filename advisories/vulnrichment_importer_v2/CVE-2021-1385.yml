aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOx application hosting environment of multiple Cisco
  platforms could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct directory traversal attacks
  and read and write files on the underlying operating system or host system. This vulnerability
  occurs because the device does not properly validate URIs in IOx API requests. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted API request that contains directory
  traversal character sequences to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the
  attacker to read or write arbitrary files on the underlying operating system.
