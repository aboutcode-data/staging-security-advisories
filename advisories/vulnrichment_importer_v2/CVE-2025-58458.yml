aliases: []
summary: In Jenkins Git client Plugin 6.3.2 and earlier, except 6.1.4 and 6.2.1, Git URL field
  form validation responses differ based on whether the specified file path exists on the controller
  when specifying `amazon-s3` protocol for use with JGit, allowing attackers with Overall/Read
  permission to check for the existence of an attacker-specified file path on the Jenkins controller
  file system.
