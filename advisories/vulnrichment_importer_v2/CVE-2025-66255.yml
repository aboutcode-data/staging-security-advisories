summary: |
  Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload (upgrade_contents.php) in DB Electronica Telecomunicazioni S.p.A. Mozart FM Transmitter versions 30, 50, 100, 300, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 3500, 6000, 7000 allows an attacker to perform Missing signature validation allows uploading malicious firmware packages. 
  The firmware upgrade endpoint in `upgrade_contents.php` accepts arbitrary file uploads without validating file headers, cryptographic signatures, or enforcing .tgz format requirements, allowing malicious firmware injection.
