summary: The Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions
  up to, and including, 1.3 via deserialization of untrusted input from wd_gallery_$id parameter.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above,
  to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP
  chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could
  allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
