summary: The absence of filters when loading some sections in the web application of the vulnerable
  device allows potential attackers to inject malicious code that will be interpreted when a
  legitimate user accesses the web section (MAIL SERVER) where the information is displayed.
  Injection can be done on parameter MAIL_RCV. When a legitimate user attempts to review NOTIFICATION/MAIL
  SERVER, the injected code will be executed.
