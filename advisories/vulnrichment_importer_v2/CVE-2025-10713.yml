summary: |
  An XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability exists in multiple WSO2 products due to improper configuration of the XML parser. The application parses user-supplied XML without applying sufficient restrictions, allowing resolution of external entities.

  A successful attack could enable a remote, unauthenticated attacker to read sensitive files from the server's filesystem or perform denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that render affected services unavailable.
