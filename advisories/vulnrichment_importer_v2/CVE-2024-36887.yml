  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  e1000e: change usleep_range to udelay in PHY mdic access

  This is a partial revert of commit 6dbdd4de0362 ("e1000e: Workaround
  for sporadic MDI error on Meteor Lake systems"). The referenced commit
  used usleep_range inside the PHY access routines, which are sometimes
  called from an atomic context. This can lead to a kernel panic in some
  scenarios, such as cable disconnection and reconnection on vPro systems.

  Solve this by changing the usleep_range calls back to udelay.
