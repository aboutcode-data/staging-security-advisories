summary: my little forum is a PHP and MySQL based internet forum that displays the messages
  in classical threaded view. Prior to version 2.5.12, an authenticated SQL injection vulnerability
  in the bookmark reordering feature allows any logged-in user to execute arbitrary SQL commands.

  or deleting all data. This issue has been patched in version 2.5.12.
