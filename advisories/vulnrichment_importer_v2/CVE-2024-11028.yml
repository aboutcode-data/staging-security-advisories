aliases: []
summary: 'The MultiManager WP – Manage All Your WordPress Sites Easily plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.5. This is
  due to the user impersonation feature inappropriately determining the current user via user-supplied
  input. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to generate an impersonation link
  that will allow them to log in as any existing user, such as an administrator. NOTE: The user
  impersonation feature was disabled in version 1.1.0 and re-enabled with a patch in version
  1.1.2.'
