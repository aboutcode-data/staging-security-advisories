summary: 'Craft is a platform for creating digital experiences. Versions 4.13.8 through 4.16.2
  and 5.5.8 through 5.8.3 contain a vulnerability that can bypass CVE-2025-23209: "Craft CMS
  has a potential RCE with a compromised security key". To exploit this vulnerability, the project
  must meet these requirements: have a compromised security key and create an arbitrary file
  in Craft''s /storage/backups folder. With those criteria in place, attackers could create
  a specific, malicious request to the /updater/restore-db endpoint and execute CLI commands
  remotely. This issue is fixed in versions 4.16.3 and 5.8.4.'
