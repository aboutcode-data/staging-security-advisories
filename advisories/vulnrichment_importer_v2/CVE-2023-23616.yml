aliases: []
summary: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.0.1 on the `stable`
  branch and 3.1.0.beta2 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, when submitting a membership
  request, there is no character limit for the reason provided with the request. This could
  potentially allow a user to flood the database with a large amount of data. However it is
  unlikely this could be used as part of a DoS attack, as the paths reading back the reasons
  are only available to administrators. Starting in version 3.0.1 on the `stable` branch and
  3.1.0.beta2 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, a limit of 280 characters has been
  introduced for membership requests.
