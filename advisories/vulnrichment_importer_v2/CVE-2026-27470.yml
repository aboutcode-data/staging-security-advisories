aliases: []
summary: ZoneMinder is a free, open source closed-circuit television software application. In
  versions 1.36.37 and below and 1.37.61 through 1.38.0, there is a second-order SQL Injection
  vulnerability in the web/ajax/status.php file within the getNearEvents() function. Event field
  values (specifically Name and Cause) are stored safely via parameterized queries but are later
  retrieved and concatenated directly into SQL WHERE clauses without escaping. An authenticated
  user with Events edit and view permissions can exploit this to execute arbitrary SQL queries.
