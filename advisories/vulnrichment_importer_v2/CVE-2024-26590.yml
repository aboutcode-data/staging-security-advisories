  erofs: fix inconsistent per-file compression format

  EROFS can select compression algorithms on a per-file basis, and each
  per-file compression algorithm needs to be marked in the on-disk
  superblock for initialization.

  However, syzkaller can generate inconsistent crafted images that use
  an unsupported algorithmtype for specific inodes, e.g. use MicroLZMA
  algorithmtype even it's not set in `sbi->available_compr_algs`.  This
  can lead to an unexpected "BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference" if
  the corresponding decompressor isn't built-in.

  Fix this by checking against `sbi->available_compr_algs` for each
  m_algorithmformat request.  Incorrect !erofs_sb_has_compr_cfgs preset
  bitmap is now fixed together since it was harmless previously.
