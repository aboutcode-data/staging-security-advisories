aliases: []
summary: containerd is a container runtime. A bug was found in containerd versions prior to
  1.4.8 and 1.5.4 where pulling and extracting a specially-crafted container image can result
  in Unix file permission changes for existing files in the host’s filesystem. Changes to file
  permissions can deny access to the expected owner of the file, widen access to others, or
  set extended bits like setuid, setgid, and sticky. This bug does not directly allow files
  to be read, modified, or executed without an additional cooperating process. This bug has
  been fixed in containerd 1.5.4 and 1.4.8. As a workaround, ensure that users only pull images
  from trusted sources. Linux security modules (LSMs) like SELinux and AppArmor can limit the
  files potentially affected by this bug through policies and profiles that prevent containerd
  from interacting with specific files.
