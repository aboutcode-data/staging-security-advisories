aliases: []
summary: The UpMenu – Online ordering for restaurants plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'lang' attribute of the 'upmenu-menu' shortcode in all
  versions up to, and including, 3.1. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output
  escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
  execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
