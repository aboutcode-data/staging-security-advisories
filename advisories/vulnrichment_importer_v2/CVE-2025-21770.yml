  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  iommu: Fix potential memory leak in iopf_queue_remove_device()

  The iopf_queue_remove_device() helper removes a device from the per-iommu
  iopf queue when PRI is disabled on the device. It responds to all
  outstanding iopf's with an IOMMU_PAGE_RESP_INVALID code and detaches the
  device from the queue.

  However, it fails to release the group structure that represents a group
  of iopf's awaiting for a response after responding to the hardware. This
  can cause a memory leak if iopf_queue_remove_device() is called with
  pending iopf's.

  Fix it by calling iopf_free_group() after the iopf group is responded.
