  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  KVM: s390: vsie: fix race during shadow creation

  Right now it is possible to see gmap->private being zero in
  kvm_s390_vsie_gmap_notifier resulting in a crash.  This is due to the
  fact that we add gmap->private == kvm after creation:

  static int acquire_gmap_shadow(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu,
                                 struct vsie_page *vsie_page)
  {
  [...]
          gmap = gmap_shadow(vcpu->arch.gmap, asce, edat);
          if (IS_ERR(gmap))
                  return PTR_ERR(gmap);
          gmap->private = vcpu->kvm;

  Let children inherit the private field of the parent.
