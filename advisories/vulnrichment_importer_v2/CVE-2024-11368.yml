aliases: []
summary: The Splash Sync plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  due to the use of add_query_arg without appropriate escaping on the URL in all versions up
  to, and including, 2.0.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary
  web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an
  action such as clicking on a link.
