aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability was found in a Moodle TeX filter administrative setting where insufficient
  sanitization of configuration input could allow command injection. On sites where the TeX
  filter is enabled and ImageMagick is installed, a maliciously crafted setting value entered
  by an administrator could result in unintended system command execution. While exploitation
  requires administrative privileges, successful compromise could affect the entire Moodle server.
