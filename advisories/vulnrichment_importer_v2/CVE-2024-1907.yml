summary: The Categorify plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.0.7.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the categorifyAjaxDeleteCategory function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to delete categories via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
  performing an action such as clicking on a link.
