aliases: []
summary: '@std/toml is the Deno Standard Library. Prior to version 1.0.9, an attacker can pollute
  the prototype chain in Node.js runtime and Browser when parsing untrusted TOML data, thus
  achieving Prototype Pollution (PP) vulnerability. This is because the library is merging an
  untrusted object with an empty object, which by default the empty object has the prototype
  chain. This issue has been patched in version 1.0.9.'
