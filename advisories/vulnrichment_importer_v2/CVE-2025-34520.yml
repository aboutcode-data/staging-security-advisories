aliases: []
summary: An authentication bypass vulnerability in Arcserve Unified Data Protection (UDP) allows
  unauthenticated attackers to gain unauthorized access to protected functionality or user accounts.
  By manipulating specific request parameters or exploiting a logic flaw, an attacker can bypass
  login mechanisms without valid credentials and access administrator-level features. This vulnerability
  affects all UDP versions prior to 10.2. UDP 10.2 includes the necessary patches and requires
  no action. Versions 8.0 through 10.1 are supported and require either patch application or
  upgrade to 10.2. Versions 7.x and earlier are unsupported or out of maintenance and must be
  upgraded to 10.2 to remediate the issue.
