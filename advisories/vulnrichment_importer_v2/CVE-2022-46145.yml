aliases: []
summary: authentik is an open-source identity provider. Versions prior to 2022.11.2 and 2022.10.2
  are vulnerable to unauthorized user creation and potential account takeover. With the default
  flows, unauthenticated users can create new accounts in authentik. If a flow exists that allows
  for email-verified password recovery, this can be used to overwrite the email address of admin
  accounts and take over their accounts. authentik 2022.11.2 and 2022.10.2 fix this issue. As
  a workaround, a policy can be created and bound to the `default-user-settings-flow flow` with
  the contents `return request.user.is_authenticated`.
