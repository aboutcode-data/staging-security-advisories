aliases: []
summary: Uniview NVR301-04S2-P4 is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting attack (XSS).
  An attacker could send a user a URL that if clicked on could execute malicious JavaScript
  in their browser. This vulnerability also requires authentication before it can be exploited,
  so the scope and severity is limited. Also, even if JavaScript is executed, no additional
  benefits are obtained.
