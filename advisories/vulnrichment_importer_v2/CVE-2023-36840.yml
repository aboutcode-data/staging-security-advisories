summary: |
  A Reachable Assertion vulnerability in Routing Protocol Daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a locally-based, low-privileged attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

  On all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved, when a specific L2VPN command is run, RPD will crash and restart. Continued execution of this specific command will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
