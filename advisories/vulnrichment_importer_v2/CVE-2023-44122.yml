datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2023/44xxx/CVE-2023-44122.json
aliases: []
summary: The vulnerability is to theft of arbitrary files with system privilege in the LockScreenSettings
  ("com.lge.lockscreensettings") app in the "com/lge/lockscreensettings/dynamicwallpaper/MyCategoryGuideActivity.java"
  file. The main problem is that the app launches implicit intents that can be intercepted by
  third-party apps installed on the same device. They also can return arbitrary data that will
  be passed to the "onActivityResult()" method. The LockScreenSettings app copies the received
  file to the "/data/shared/dw/mycategory/wallpaper_01.png" path and then changes the file access
  mode to world-readable and world-writable.
