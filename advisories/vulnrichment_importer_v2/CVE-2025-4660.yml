datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2025/4xxx/CVE-2025-4660.json
aliases: []
summary: |
  A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Windows agent component of SecureConnector due to improper access controls on a named pipe. The pipe is accessible to the Everyone group and does not restrict remote connections, allowing any network-based attacker to connect without authentication. By interacting with this pipe, an attacker can redirect the agent to communicate with a rogue server that can issue commands via the SecureConnector Agent. 



  This does not impact Linux or OSX Secure Connector.
