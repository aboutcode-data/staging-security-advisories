summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco&nbsp;Prime Access Registrar\
  \ Appliance could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting\
  \ attack against a user of the interface. The attacker would require valid credentials for\
  \ the device.\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input\
  \ by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading\
  \ a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker\
  \ to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based\
  \ information.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There\
  \ are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
