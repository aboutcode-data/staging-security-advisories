aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the loading mechanism of specific dynamic link libraries in Cisco
  Webex Teams for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a DLL hijacking
  attack. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials on
  the Windows system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the resources loaded
  by the application at run time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a
  malicious DLL file and placing it in a specific location on the targeted system. The malicious
  DLL file would execute when the vulnerable application is launched. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target machine with the privileges of
  another user account.
