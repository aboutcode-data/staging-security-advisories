aliases: []
summary: claude-code-router is a powerful tool to route Claude Code requests to different models
  and customize any request. Due to improper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration,
  there is a risk that user API Keys or equivalent credentials may be exposed to untrusted domains.
  Attackers could exploit this misconfiguration to steal credentials, abuse accounts, exhaust
  quotas, or access sensitive data. The issue has been patched in v1.0.34.
