summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/panfrost: Fix the error path in panfrost_mmu_map_fault_addr()

  Subject: [PATCH] drm/panfrost: Fix the error path in
   panfrost_mmu_map_fault_addr()

  If some the pages or sgt allocation failed, we shouldn't release the
  pages ref we got earlier, otherwise we will end up with unbalanced
  get/put_pages() calls. We should instead leave everything in place
  and let the BO release function deal with extra cleanup when the object
  is destroyed, or let the fault handler try again next time it's called.
