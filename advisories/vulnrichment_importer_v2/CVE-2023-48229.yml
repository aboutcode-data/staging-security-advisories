aliases: []
summary: 'Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for Next-Generation
  IoT devices. An out-of-bounds write exists in the driver for IEEE 802.15.4 radios on nRF platforms
  in the Contiki-NG operating system. The problem is triggered when parsing radio frames in
  the `read_frame` function in the `arch/cpu/nrf/net/nrf-ieee-driver-arch.c` module. More specifically,
  the `read_frame` function performs an incomplete validation of the payload length of the packet,
  which is a value that can be set by an external party that sends radio packets to a Contiki-NG
  system. Although the value is validated to be in the range of the MTU length, it is not validated
  to fit into the given buffer into which the packet will be copied. The problem has been patched
  in the "develop" branch of Contiki-NG and is expected to be included in subsequent releases.
  Users are advised to update their develop branch or to update to a subsequent release when
  available. Users unable to upgrade should consider manually applying the changes in PR #2741.'
