aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web UI of Cisco IoT Field Network Director (FND) could
  allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against
  users on an affected system. The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied
  input that is processed by the web UI. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by
  persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
  execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based
  information on an affected system.
