aliases: []
summary: The Fancy Product Designer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Disclosure
  and PHAR Deserialization in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.8. This is due to insufficient
  validation of user-supplied input in the 'url' parameter of the 'fpd_custom_uplod_file' AJAX
  action, which flows directly into the 'getimagesize' function without sanitization. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary sensitive files from the server,
  including wp-config.php.
