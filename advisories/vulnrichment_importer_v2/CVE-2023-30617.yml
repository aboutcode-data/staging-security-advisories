aliases: []
summary: Kruise provides automated management of large-scale applications on Kubernetes. Starting
  in version 0.8.0 and prior to versions 1.3.1, 1.4.1, and 1.5.2, an attacker who has gained
  root privilege of the node that kruise-daemon run can leverage the kruise-daemon pod to list
  all secrets in the entire cluster. After that, the attacker can leverage the "captured" secrets
  (e.g. the kruise-manager service account token) to gain extra privileges such as pod modification.
  Versions 1.3.1, 1.4.1, and 1.5.2 fix this issue. A workaround is available. For users that
  do not require imagepulljob functions, they can modify kruise-daemon-role to drop the cluster
  level secret get/list privilege.
