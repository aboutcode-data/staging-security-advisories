aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management
  Center (FMC) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a directory
  traversal attack on an affected device. The attacker would require valid device credentials.
  The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of the HTTPS URL by the web-based
  management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTPS
  request that contains directory traversal character sequences to an affected device. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to read or write arbitrary files on the device.
