  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mptcp: fix sk_forward_memory corruption on retransmission

  MPTCP sk_forward_memory handling is a bit special, as such field
  is protected by the msk socket spin_lock, instead of the plain
  socket lock.

  Currently we have a code path updating such field without handling
  the relevant lock:

  __mptcp_retrans() -> __mptcp_clean_una_wakeup()

  Several helpers in __mptcp_clean_una_wakeup() will update
  sk_forward_alloc, possibly causing such field corruption, as reported
  by Matthieu.

  Address the issue providing and using a new variant of blamed function
  which explicitly acquires the msk spin lock.
