aliases: []
summary: TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released under the
  GNU GPL. It has been discovered that the expiration time of a password reset link for TYPO3
  backend users has never been evaluated. As a result, a password reset link could be used to
  perform a password reset even if the default expiry time of two hours has been exceeded. Update
  to TYPO3 version 10.4.32 or 11.5.16 that fix the problem. There are no known workarounds for
  this issue.
