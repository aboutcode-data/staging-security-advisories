aliases: []
summary: ReadtoMyShoe, a web app that lets users upload articles and listen to them later, generates
  an error message containing sensitive information prior to commit 8533b01. If an error occurs
  when adding an article, the website shows the user an error message. If the error originates
  from the Google Cloud TTS request, then it will include the full URL of the request. The request
  URL contains the Google Cloud API key. This has been patched in commit 8533b01. Upgrading
  should be accompanied by deleting the current GCP API key and issuing a new one. There are
  no known workarounds.
