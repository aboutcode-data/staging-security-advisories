aliases: []
summary: The DuoConnect client enables users to establish SSH connections to hosts protected
  by a DNG instance. When a user initiates an SSH connection to a DNG-protected host for the
  first time using DuoConnect, the user’s browser is opened to a login screen in order to complete
  authentication determined by the contents of the '-relay' argument. If the ‘-relay’ is set
  to a URL beginning with "http://", then the browser will initially attempt to load the URL
  over an insecure HTTP connection, before being immediately redirected to HTTPS (in addition
  to standard redirect mechanisms, the DNG uses HTTP Strict Transport Security headers to enforce
  this). After successfully authenticating to a DNG, DuoConnect stores an authentication token
  in a local system cache, so users do not have to complete this browser-based authentication
  workflow for every subsequent SSH connection. These tokens are valid for a configurable period
  of time, which defaults to 8 hours. If a user running DuoConnect already has a valid token,
  then instead of opening a web browser, DuoConnect directly contacts the DNG, again using the
  configured '-relay' value, and sends this token, as well as the intended SSH server hostname
  and port numbers. If the '-relay' argument begins with "http://", then this request will be
  sent over an insecure connection, and could be exposed to an attacker who is sniffing the
  traffic on the same network. The DNG authentication tokens that may be exposed during SSH
  relay may be used to gain network-level access to the servers and ports protected by that
  given relay host. The DNG provides network-level access only to the protected SSH servers.
  It does not interact with the independent SSH authentication and encryption. An attacker cannot
  use a stolen token on its own to authenticate against a DNG-protected SSH server.
