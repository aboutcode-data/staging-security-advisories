aliases: []
summary: The Broken Link Checker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted
  input via the '$log_file' value in versions up to, and including 1.11.16. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers with administrative privileges and above to call files using a
  PHAR wrapper that will deserialize the data and call arbitrary PHP Objects that can be used
  to perform a variety of malicious actions granted a POP chain is also present. It also requires
  that the attacker is successful in uploading a file with the serialized payload.
