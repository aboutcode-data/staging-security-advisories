aliases: []
summary: The WebAssembly Micro Runtime's (WAMR) iwasm package is the executable binary built
  with WAMR VMcore which supports WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) and command line interface.
  Anyone running WAMR up to and including version 2.2.0 or WAMR built with libc-uvwasi on Windows
  is affected by a symlink following vulnerability. On WAMR running in Windows, creating a symlink
  pointing outside of the preopened directory and subsequently opening it with create flag will
  create a file on host outside of the sandbox. If the symlink points to an existing host file,
  it's also possible to open it and read its content. Version 2.3.0 fixes the issue.
