aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the session identification management functionality of the web-based
  interface of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to hijack a valid user session on an affected system. The vulnerability exists
  because the affected software does not properly clear previously assigned session identifiers
  for a user session when a user authenticates to the web-based interface. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by using an existing session identifier to connect to the software
  through the web-based interface. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to hijack
  an authenticated user's browser session on the system. Versions 8.1 and 8.5 are affected.
