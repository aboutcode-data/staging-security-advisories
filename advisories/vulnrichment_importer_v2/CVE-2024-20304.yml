aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the multicast traceroute version 2 (Mtrace2) feature of Cisco IOS\
  \ XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to exhaust the UDP packet memory\
  \ of an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the Mtrace2 code does not\
  \ properly handle packet memory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted\
  \ packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust\
  \ the incoming UDP packet memory. The affected device would not be able to process higher-level\
  \ UDP-based protocols packets, possibly causing a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\nNote:\
  \ This vulnerability can be exploited using IPv4 or IPv6."
