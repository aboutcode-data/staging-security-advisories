aliases: []
summary: |
  A Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in the telemetry sensor process (sensord) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX240, MX480, MX960 platforms using MPC10E causes a steady increase in memory utilization, ultimately leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).

  When the device is subscribed to a specific subscription on Junos Telemetry Interface, a slow memory leak occurs and eventually all resources are consumed and the device becomes unresponsive. A manual reboot of the Line Card will be required to restore the device to its normal functioning. 

  This issue is only seen when telemetry subscription is active.

  The Heap memory utilization can be monitored using the following command:
    > show system processes extensive

  The following command can be used to monitor the memory utilization of the specific sensor
    > show system info | match sensord
     PID   NAME                 MEMORY     PEAK MEMORY    %CPU   THREAD-COUNT CORE-AFFINITY   UPTIME
