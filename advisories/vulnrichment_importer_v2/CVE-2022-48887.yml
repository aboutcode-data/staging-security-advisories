  drm/vmwgfx: Remove rcu locks from user resources

  User resource lookups used rcu to avoid two extra atomics. Unfortunately
  the rcu paths were buggy and it was easy to make the driver crash by
  submitting command buffers from two different threads. Because the
  lookups never show up in performance profiles replace them with a
  regular spin lock which fixes the races in accesses to those shared
  resources.

  Fixes kernel oops'es in IGT's vmwgfx execution_buffer stress test and
  seen crashes with apps using shared resources.
