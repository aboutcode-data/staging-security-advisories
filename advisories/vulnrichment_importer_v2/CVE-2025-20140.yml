summary: "A vulnerability in the Wireless Network Control daemon (wncd) of Cisco IOS XE Software\
  \ for Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs) could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent wireless attacker\
  \ to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper\
  \ memory management. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of IPv6\
  \ network requests from an associated wireless IPv6 client to an affected device. To associate\
  \ a client to a device, an attacker may first need to authenticate to the network, or associate\
  \ freely in the case of a configured open network. A successful exploit could allow the attacker\
  \ to cause the wncd process to consume available memory and eventually cause the device to\
  \ stop responding, resulting in a DoS condition."
