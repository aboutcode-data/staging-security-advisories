aliases: []
summary: |
  An attacker with access to the Administration panel, specifically the "Role Management"
  tab, can
  inject code by adding a new role in the "name" field. It should be noted, however, that the risk of exploiting vulnerability is reduced due to the
  required additional error that allows bypassing the Content-Security-Policy policy, which
  mitigates JS code execution while still allowing HTML injection.


  This issue affects CyberArk Endpoint Privilege Manager in SaaS version 24.7.1. The status of other versions is unknown. After multiple attempts to contact the vendor we did not receive any answer.
