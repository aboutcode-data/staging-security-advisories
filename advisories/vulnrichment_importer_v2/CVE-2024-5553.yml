aliases: []
summary: The Premium Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to DOM-Based Stored
  Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters in all versions up to, and including, 4.10.33
  due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
  that will execute whenever a user accesses and edits an injected element, and subsequently
  clicks the element with the mouse scroll wheel.
