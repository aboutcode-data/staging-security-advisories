aliases: []
summary: The BuddyBoss Platform plugin and BuddyBoss Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
  Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘invitee_name’ parameter in all versions up to, and including,
  2.8.50 and 2.8.41, respectively, due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above,
  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page. The vulnerability was partially patched in the BuddyBoss Platform plugin in version
  2.8.41.
