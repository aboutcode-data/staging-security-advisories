aliases: []
summary: The vulnerability exists in the EJBCA service, version 8.0 Enterprise. Not tested in
  higher versions. By modifying the ‘Host’ header in an HTTP request, it is possible to manipulate
  the generated links and thus redirect the client to a different base URL.  In this way, an
  attacker could insert his own server for the client to send HTTP requests, provided he succeeds
  in exploiting it.
