aliases: []
summary: An OS command injection vulnerability exists in AVTECH IP camera, DVR, and NVR devices
  via the PwdGrp.cgi endpoint, which handles user and group management operations. Authenticated
  users can supply input through the pwd or grp parameters, which are directly embedded into
  system commands without proper sanitation. This allows for the execution of arbitrary shell
  commands with root privileges.
