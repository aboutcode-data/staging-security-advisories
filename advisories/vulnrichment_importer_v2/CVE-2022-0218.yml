aliases: []
summary: The WP HTML Mail WordPress plugin is vulnerable to unauthorized access which allows
  unauthenticated attackers to retrieve and modify theme settings due to a missing capability
  check on the /themesettings REST-API endpoint found in the ~/includes/class-template-designer.php
  file, in versions up to and including 3.0.9. This makes it possible for attackers with no
  privileges to execute the endpoint and add malicious JavaScript to a vulnerable WordPress
  site.
