aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the session authentication functionality of the Remote Access SSL\
  \ VPN feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat\
  \ Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to prevent users\
  \ from authenticating.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient entropy in the authentication\
  \ process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by determining the handle of an authenticating\
  \ user and using it to terminate their authentication session. A successful exploit could\
  \ allow the attacker to force a user to restart the authentication process, preventing a legitimate\
  \ user from establishing remote access VPN sessions."
