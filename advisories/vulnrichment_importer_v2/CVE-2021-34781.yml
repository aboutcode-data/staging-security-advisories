aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the processing of SSH connections for multi-instance deployments
  of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device. This vulnerability is
  due to a lack of proper error handling when an SSH session fails to be established. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of crafted SSH connections to the
  instance. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause resource exhaustion, which
  causes a DoS condition on the affected device. The device must be manually reloaded to recover.
