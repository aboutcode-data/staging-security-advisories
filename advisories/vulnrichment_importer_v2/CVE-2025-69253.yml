aliases: []
summary: free5GC is an open-source project for 5th generation (5G) mobile core networks. Versions
  up to and including 1.4.1 of the User Data Repository are affected by Improper Error Handling
  with Information Exposure. The NEF component reliably leaks internal parsing error details
  (e.g., invalid character 'n' after top-level value) to remote clients, which can aid attackers
  in service fingerprinting. All deployments of free5GC using the Nnef_PfdManagement service
  may be vulnerable. free5gc/udr pull request 56 contains a patch. No direct workaround is available
  at the application level. Applying the official patch is recommended.
