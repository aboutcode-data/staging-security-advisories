summary: A vulnerability in a specific CLI command implementation of Cisco Nexus 9000 Series
  ACI Mode Switch Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to escape a restricted
  shell on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied
  input when issuing a specific CLI command with parameters on an affected device. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device CLI and issuing certain commands.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to escape the restricted shell and execute arbitrary
  commands with root-level privileges on the affected device. This vulnerability only affects
  Cisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI Mode Switches that are running a release prior to 14.0(3d).
