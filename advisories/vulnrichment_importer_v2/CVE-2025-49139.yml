aliases: []
summary: HAX CMS PHP allows users to manage their microsite universe with a PHP backend. Prior
  to version 11.0.0, in the HAX site editor, users can create a website block to load another
  site in an iframe. The application allows users to supply a target URL in the website block.
  When the HAX site is visited, the client's browser will query the supplied URL. An authenticated
  attacker can create a HAX site with a website block pointing at an attacker-controlled server
  running Responder or a similar tool. The attacker can then conduct a phishing attack by convincing
  another user to visit their malicious HAX site to harvest credentials. Version 11.0.0 contains
  a patch for the issue.
