aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series
  Smart Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to upload arbitrary files.
  The vulnerability is due to incomplete authorization checks in the web management interface.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious request to certain parts
  of the web management interface. Depending on the configuration of the affected switch, the
  malicious request must be sent via HTTP or HTTPS. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to modify the configuration of an affected device or to inject a reverse shell. This vulnerability
  affects Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches running firmware versions prior to
  1.1.4.4 with the web management interface enabled. The web management interface is enabled
  via both HTTP and HTTPS by default.
