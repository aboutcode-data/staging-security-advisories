aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the implementation of the Intermediate System&ndash;to&ndash;Intermediate
  System (IS&ndash;IS) routing protocol functionality in Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an
  unauthenticated attacker who is in the same IS&ndash;IS area to cause a denial of service
  (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of crafted IS&ndash;IS link-state
  protocol data units (PDUs). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted
  link-state PDU to an affected system to be processed. A successful exploit could allow the
  attacker to cause all routers within the IS&ndash;IS area to unexpectedly restart the IS&ndash;IS
  process, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects Cisco devices if they are
  running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR Software earlier than Release 6.6.3 and are configured
  with the IS–IS routing protocol. Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability affects both
  Cisco IOS XR 32-bit Software and Cisco IOS XR 64-bit Software.
