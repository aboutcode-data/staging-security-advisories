aliases: []
summary: The mobile application is configured to allow clear text traffic to all domains and
  communicates with an API server over HTTP. As a result, an adversary located "upstream" can
  intercept the traffic, inspect its contents, and modify the requests in transit. TThis may
  result in a total compromise of the user's account if the attacker intercepts a request with
  active authentication tokens or cracks the MD5 hash sent on login.
