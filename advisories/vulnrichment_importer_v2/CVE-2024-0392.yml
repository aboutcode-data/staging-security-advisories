aliases: []
summary: A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the management console
  of WSO2 Enterprise Integrator 6.6.0 due to the absence of CSRF token validation. This flaw
  allows attackers to craft malicious requests that can trigger state-changing operations on
  behalf of an authenticated user, potentially compromising account settings and data integrity.
  The vulnerability only affects a limited set of state-changing operations, and successful
  exploitation requires social engineering to trick a user with access to the management console
  into performing the malicious action.
