aliases: []
summary: Inside Track / Entropy Derby is a research-grade horse-racing betting engine. Prior
  to commit 2d38d2f, the VDF-based timelock encryption system fails to enforce sequential delay
  against the betting operator. Bettors pre-compute the entire Wesolowski VDF and include vdfOutputHex
  in their encrypted bet ticket, allowing the house to decrypt immediately using fast proof
  verification instead of expensive VDF evaluation. This issue has been patched via commit 2d38d2f.
