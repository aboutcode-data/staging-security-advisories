aliases: []
summary: An attacker can abuse the batch-requests plugin to send requests to bypass the IP restriction
  of Admin API. A default configuration of Apache APISIX (with default API key) is vulnerable
  to remote code execution. When the admin key was changed or the port of Admin API was changed
  to a port different from the data panel, the impact is lower. But there is still a risk to
  bypass the IP restriction of Apache APISIX's data panel. There is a check in the batch-requests
  plugin which overrides the client IP with its real remote IP. But due to a bug in the code,
  this check can be bypassed.
