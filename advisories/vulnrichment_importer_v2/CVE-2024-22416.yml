aliases: []
summary: 'pyLoad is a free and open-source Download Manager written in pure Python. The `pyload`
  API allows any API call to be made using GET requests. Since the session cookie is not set
  to `SameSite: strict`, this opens the library up to severe attack possibilities via a Cross-Site
  Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. As a result any API call can be made via a CSRF attack by an
  unauthenticated user. This issue has been addressed in release `0.5.0b3.dev78`. All users
  are advised to upgrade.'
