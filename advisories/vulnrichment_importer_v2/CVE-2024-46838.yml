summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  userfaultfd: don't BUG_ON() if khugepaged yanks our page table

  Since khugepaged was changed to allow retracting page tables in file
  mappings without holding the mmap lock, these BUG_ON()s are wrong - get
  rid of them.

  We could also remove the preceding "if (unlikely(...))" block, but then we
  could reach pte_offset_map_lock() with transhuge pages not just for file
  mappings but also for anonymous mappings - which would probably be fine
  but I think is not necessarily expected.
