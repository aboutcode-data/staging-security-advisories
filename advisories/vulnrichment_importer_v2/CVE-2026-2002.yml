aliases: []
summary: The Forminator Forms – Contact Form, Payment Form & Custom Form Builder plugin for
  WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the form_name parameter in all
  versions up to, and including, 1.50.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject
  arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
  The plugin allows admins to give form management permissions to lower level users, which could
  make this exploitable by users such as subscribers.
