summary: GraphQL Modules is a toolset of libraries and guidelines dedicated to create reusable,
  maintainable, testable and extendable modules out of your GraphQL server. From 2.2.1 to before
  2.4.1 and 3.1.1, when 2 or more parallel requests are made which trigger the same service,
  the context of the requests is mixed up in the service when the context is injected via @ExecutionContext().
  ExecutionContext is often used to pass authentication tokens from incoming requests to services
  loading data from backend APIs. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.4.1 and 3.1.1.
