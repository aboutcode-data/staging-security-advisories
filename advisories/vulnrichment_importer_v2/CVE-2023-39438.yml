aliases: []
summary: A missing authorization check allows an arbitrary authenticated user to perform certain
  operations through the API of CLA-assistant by executing specific additional steps. This allows
  an arbitrary authenticated user to read CLA information including information of the persons
  who signed them as well as custom fields the CLA requester had configured. In addition, an
  arbitrary authenticated user can update or delete the CLA-configuration for repositories or
  organizations using CLA-assistant. The stored access tokens for GitHub are not affected, as
  these are redacted from the API-responses.
