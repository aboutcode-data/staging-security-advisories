aliases: []
summary: The Uncanny Automator – Easy Automation, Integration, Webhooks & Workflow Builder Plugin
  for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including,
  6.3.0.2. This is due to add_role() and user_role() functions missing proper capability checks
  performed through the validate_rest_call() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to set the role of arbitrary users to administrator granting full access to the
  site, though privilege escalation requires an active account on the site so this is considered
  an authenticated privilege escalation.
