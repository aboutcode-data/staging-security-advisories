  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: hso: fix null-ptr-deref during tty device unregistration

  Multiple ttys try to claim the same the minor number causing a double
  unregistration of the same device. The first unregistration succeeds
  but the next one results in a null-ptr-deref.

  The get_free_serial_index() function returns an available minor number
  but doesn't assign it immediately. The assignment is done by the caller
  later. But before this assignment, calls to get_free_serial_index()
  would return the same minor number.

  Fix this by modifying get_free_serial_index to assign the minor number
  immediately after one is found to be and rename it to obtain_minor()
  to better reflect what it does. Similary, rename set_serial_by_index()
  to release_minor() and modify it to free up the minor number of the
  given hso_serial. Every obtain_minor() should have corresponding
  release_minor() call.
