aliases: []
summary: XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top level XWiki projects.
  The HTML macro does not systematically perform a proper neutralization of script-related html
  tags. As a result, any user able to use the html macro in XWiki, is able to introduce an XSS
  attack. This can be particularly dangerous since in a standard wiki, any user is able to use
  the html macro directly in their own user profile page. The problem has been patched in XWiki
  14.8RC1. The patch involves the HTML macros and are systematically cleaned up whenever the
  user does not have the script correct.
