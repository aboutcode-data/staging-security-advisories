aliases: []
summary: Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability
  is related to **CORS origin validation**, where the Gradio server fails to validate the request
  origin when a cookie is present. This allows an attacker’s website to make unauthorized requests
  to a local Gradio server. Potentially, attackers can upload files, steal authentication tokens,
  and access user data if the victim visits a malicious website while logged into Gradio. This
  impacts users who have deployed Gradio locally and use basic authentication. Users are advised
  to upgrade to `gradio>4.44` to address this issue. As a workaround, users can manually enforce
  stricter CORS origin validation by modifying the `CustomCORSMiddleware` class in their local
  Gradio server code. Specifically, they can bypass the condition that skips CORS validation
  for requests containing cookies to prevent potential exploitation.
