aliases: []
summary: Laravel Rest Api is an API generator. Prior to version 2.13.0, a validation bypass
  vulnerability was discovered where multiple validations defined for the same attribute could
  be silently overridden. Due to how the framework merged validation rules across multiple contexts
  (such as index, store, and update actions), malicious actors could exploit this behavior by
  crafting requests that bypass expected validation rules, potentially injecting unexpected
  or dangerous parameters into the application. This could lead to unauthorized data being accepted
  or processed by the API, depending on the context in which the validation was bypassed. This
  issue has been patched in version 2.13.0.
