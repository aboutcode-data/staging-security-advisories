aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Expressway Series could\
  \ allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack\
  \ against a user of the interface.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the web-based\
  \ management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit\
  \ this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful\
  \ exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the\
  \ affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.\r\nNote:&nbsp;Cisco Expressway\
  \ Series refers to Cisco Expressway Control (Expressway-C) devices and Cisco Expressway Edge\
  \ (Expressway-E) devices."
