summary: "A vulnerability in Cisco IOS XE Wireless Controller Software could allow an unauthenticated,\
  \ adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\
  \r This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of access point (AP) Cisco Discovery\
  \ Protocol (CDP) neighbor reports when they are processed by the wireless controller. An attacker\
  \ could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted CDP packet to an AP. A successful\
  \ exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected reload of the wireless controller\
  \ that is managing the AP, resulting in a DoS condition that affects the wireless network."
