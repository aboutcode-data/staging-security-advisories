aliases: []
summary: PolarLearn is a free and open-source learning program. In 0-PRERELEASE-15 and earlier,
  a timing attack vulnerability in the sign-in process allows unauthenticated attackers to determine
  if a specific email address is registered on the platform. By measuring the response time
  of the login endpoint, an attacker can distinguish between valid and invalid email addresses.
  This occurs because the server only performs the computationally expensive Argon2 password
  hashing if the user exists in the database. Requests for existing users take significantly
  longer (~650ms) than requests for non-existent users (~160ms).
