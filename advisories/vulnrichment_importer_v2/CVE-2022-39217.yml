aliases: []
summary: some-natalie/ghas-to-csv (GitHub Advanced Security to CSV) is a GitHub action which
  scrapes the GitHub Advanced Security API and shoves it into a CSV. In affected versions this
  GitHub Action creates a CSV file without sanitizing the output of the APIs. If an alert is
  dismissed or any other custom field contains executable code / formulas, it might be run when
  an endpoint opens that CSV file in a spreadsheet program. This issue has been addressed in
  version `v1`. Users are advised to use `v1` or later. There are no known workarounds for this
  issue.
