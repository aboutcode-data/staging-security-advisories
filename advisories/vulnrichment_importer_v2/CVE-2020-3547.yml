aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco AsyncOS software for
  Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA), Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA), and
  Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access
  sensitive information on an affected device. The vulnerability exists because an insecure
  method is used to mask certain passwords on the web-based management interface. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by looking at the raw HTML code that is received from the
  interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain some of the passwords configured
  throughout the interface.
