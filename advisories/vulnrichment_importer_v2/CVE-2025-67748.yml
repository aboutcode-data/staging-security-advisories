aliases: []
summary: Fickling is a Python pickling decompiler and static analyzer. Versions prior to 0.1.6
  had a bypass caused by `pty` missing from the block list of unsafe module imports. This led
  to unsafe pickles based on `pty.spawn()` being incorrectly flagged as `LIKELY_SAFE`, and was
  fixed in version 0.1.6. This impacted any user or system that used Fickling to vet pickle
  files for security issues.
