summary: Part-DB is an open source inventory management system for your electronic components.
  User input was found not being properly escaped, which allowed malicious users to inject arbitrary
  HTML into the pages. The Content-Security-Policy forbids inline and external scripts so it
  is not possible to execute JavaScript code, unless in combination with other vulnerabilities.
  There are no workarounds, please upgrade to Pat-DB 1.0.2 or later.
