aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered on Renesas SmartBond DA14691, DA14695, DA14697, and DA14699
  devices. The Nonce used for on-the-fly decryption of flash images is stored in an unsigned
  header, allowing its value to be modified without invalidating the signature used for secureboot
  image verification. Because the encryption engine for on-the-fly decryption uses AES in CTR
  mode without authentication, an attacker-modified Nonce can result in execution of arbitrary
  code.
