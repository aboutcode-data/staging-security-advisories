aliases: []
summary: TensorFlow is an open source machine learning platform. Prior to versions 2.12.0 and
  2.11.1, `nn_ops.fractional_avg_pool_v2` and `nn_ops.fractional_max_pool_v2` require the first
  and fourth elements of their parameter `pooling_ratio` to be equal to 1.0, as pooling on batch
  and channel dimensions is not supported. A fix is included in TensorFlow 2.12.0 and 2.11.1.
