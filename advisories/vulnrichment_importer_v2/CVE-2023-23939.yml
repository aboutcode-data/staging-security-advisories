aliases: []
summary: Azure/setup-kubectl is a GitHub Action for installing Kubectl. This vulnerability only
  impacts versions before version 3. An insecure temporary creation of a file allows other actors
  on the Actions runner to replace the Kubectl binary created by this action because it is world
  writable. This Kubectl tool installer runs `fs.chmodSync(kubectlPath, 777)` to set permissions
  on the Kubectl binary, however, this allows any local user to replace the Kubectl binary.
  This allows privilege escalation to the user that can also run kubectl, most likely root.
  This attack is only possible if an attacker somehow breached the GitHub actions runner or
  if a user is utilizing an Action that maliciously executes this attack. This has been fixed
  and released in all versions `v3` and later. 775 permissions are used instead. Users are advised
  to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
