summary: Dokans Multi-Tenancy Based eCommerce Platform SaaS 3.9.2 allows unauthenticated remote
  attackers to obtain sensitive application configuration data via direct request to /script/.env
  file. The exposed file contains Laravel application encryption key (APP_KEY), database credentials,
  SMTP/SendGrid API credentials, and internal configuration parameters, enabling complete system
  compromise including authentication bypass via session token forgery, direct database access
  to all tenant data, and email infrastructure takeover. Due to the multi-tenancy architecture,
  this vulnerability affects all tenants in the system.
