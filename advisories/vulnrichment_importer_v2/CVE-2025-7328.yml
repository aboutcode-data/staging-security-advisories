aliases: []
summary: Multiple Broken Authentication security issues exist in the affected product. The security
  issues are due to missing authentication checks on critical functions. These could result
  in potential denial-of-service, admin account takeover, or NAT rule modifications. Devices
  would no longer be able to communicate through NATR as a result of denial-of-service or NAT
  rule modifications. NAT rule modification could also result in device communication to incorrect
  endpoints. Admin account takeover could allow modification of configuration and require physical
  access to restore.
