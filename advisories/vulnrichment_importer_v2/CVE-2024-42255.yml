summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  tpm: Use auth only after NULL check in tpm_buf_check_hmac_response()

  Dereference auth after NULL check in tpm_buf_check_hmac_response().
  Otherwise, unless tpm2_sessions_init() was called, a call can cause NULL
  dereference, when TCG_TPM2_HMAC is enabled.

  [jarkko: adjusted the commit message.]
