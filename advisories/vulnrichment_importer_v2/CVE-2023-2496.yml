summary: The Go Pricing - WordPress Responsive Pricing Tables plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to unauthorized arbitrary file uploads due to an improper capability check on the 'validate_upload'

  attackers with a role that the administrator previously granted access to the plugin to upload
  arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
