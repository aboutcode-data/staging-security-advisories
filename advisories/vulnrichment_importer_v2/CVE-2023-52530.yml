  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  wifi: mac80211: fix potential key use-after-free

  When ieee80211_key_link() is called by ieee80211_gtk_rekey_add()
  but returns 0 due to KRACK protection (identical key reinstall),
  ieee80211_gtk_rekey_add() will still return a pointer into the
  key, in a potential use-after-free. This normally doesn't happen
  since it's only called by iwlwifi in case of WoWLAN rekey offload
  which has its own KRACK protection, but still better to fix, do
  that by returning an error code and converting that to success on
  the cfg80211 boundary only, leaving the error for bad callers of
  ieee80211_gtk_rekey_add().
