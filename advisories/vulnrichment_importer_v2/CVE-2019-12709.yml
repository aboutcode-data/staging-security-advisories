aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in a CLI command related to the virtualization manager (VMAN) in Cisco
  IOS XR Software for Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers could allow an authenticated,
  local attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system with
  root privileges. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of arguments passed to
  a specific VMAN CLI command on an affected device. An attacker who has valid administrator
  access to an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by including malicious input
  as the argument of an affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run
  arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with root privileges, which may lead
  to complete system compromise.
