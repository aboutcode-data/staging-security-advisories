aliases: []
summary: |
  Access to TSplus Remote Access Admin Tool is restricted to administrators (unless "Disable UAC" option is enabled) and requires a PIN code. In versions below v18.40.6.17 the PIN's hash is stored in a system registry accessible to regular users, making it possible to perform a brute-force attack using rainbow tables, since the hash is not salted.
  LTS (Long-Term Support) versions also received patches in v17.2025.6.27 and v16.2025.6.27 releases.
