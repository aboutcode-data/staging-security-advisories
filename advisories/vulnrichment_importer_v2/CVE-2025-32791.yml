aliases: []
summary: The Backstage Scaffolder plugin houses types and utilities for building scaffolder-related
  modules. A vulnerability in the Backstage permission plugin backend allows callers to extract
  some information about the conditional decisions returned by the permission policy installed
  in the permission backend. If the permission system is not in use or if the installed permission
  policy does not use conditional decisions, there is no impact. This issue has been patched
  in version 0.6.0 of the permissions backend. A workaround includes having administrators of
  the permission policies ensure that they are crafted in such a way that conditional decisions
  do not contain any sensitive information.
