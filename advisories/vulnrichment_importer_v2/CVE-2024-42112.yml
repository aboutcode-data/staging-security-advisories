  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: txgbe: free isb resources at the right time

  When using MSI/INTx interrupt, the shared interrupts are still being
  handled in the device remove routine, before free IRQs. So isb memory
  is still read after it is freed. Thus move wx_free_isb_resources()
  from txgbe_close() to txgbe_remove(). And fix the improper isb free
  action in txgbe_open() error handling path.
