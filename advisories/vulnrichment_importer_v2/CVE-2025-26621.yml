summary: OpenCTI is an open source platform for managing cyber threat intelligence knowledge
  and observables. Prior to version 6.5.2, any user with the capability manage customizations
  can edit webhook that will execute javascript code. This can be abused to cause a denial of
  service attack by prototype pollution, making the node js server running the OpenCTI frontend
  become unavailable. Version 6.5.2 fixes the issue.
