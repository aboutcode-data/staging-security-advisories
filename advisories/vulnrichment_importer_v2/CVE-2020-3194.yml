aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for Microsoft Windows and Cisco
  Webex Player for Microsoft Windows could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on an
  affected system. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of certain elements
  with a Webex recording stored in either the Advanced Recording Format (ARF) or the Webex Recording
  Format (WRF). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a user a malicious ARF
  or WRF file through a link or email attachment and persuading the user to open the file with
  the affected software on the local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
  execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the targeted user.
