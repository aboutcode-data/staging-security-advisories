aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Vocera Report Server and Voice Server 5.x through 5.8. There
  is a Path Traversal for an Unzip operation. The Vocera Report Console contains a websocket
  function that allows for the restoration of the database from a ZIP archive that expects a
  SQL import file. During the unzip operation, the code takes file paths from the ZIP archive
  and writes them to a Vocera temporary directory. Unfortunately, the code does not properly
  check if the file paths include directory traversal payloads that would escape the intended
  destination.
