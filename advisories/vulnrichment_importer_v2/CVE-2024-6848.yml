aliases: []
summary: The Post and Page Builder by BoldGrid – Visual Drag and Drop Editor plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via file uploads in all versions up to, and including,
  1.26.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping affecting the boldgrid_canvas_image
  AJAX endpoint. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level
  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses the SVG file.
