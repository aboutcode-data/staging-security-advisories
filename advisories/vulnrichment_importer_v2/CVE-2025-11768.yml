aliases: []
summary: The Islamic Phrases plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the 'phrases' shortcode attribute in all versions up to, and including, 2.12.2015. This
  is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
  authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web
  scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
