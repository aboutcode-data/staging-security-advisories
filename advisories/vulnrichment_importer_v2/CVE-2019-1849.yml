aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Border Gateway Patrol (BGP) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)-based
  Ethernet VPN (EVPN) implementation of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated,
  adjacent attacker to trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The
  vulnerability is due to a logic error that occurs when the affected software processes specific
  EVPN routing information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious
  traffic patterns into the targeted EVPN network. A successful exploit could result in a crash
  of the l2vpn_mgr process on Provider Edge (PE) device members of the same EVPN instance (EVI).
  On each of the affected devices, a crash could lead to system instability and the inability
  to process or forward traffic through the device, resulting in a DoS condition that would
  require manual intervention to restore normal operating conditions.
