aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in which the HTTP web server for Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI) has
  unrestricted directory permissions could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to upload
  an arbitrary file. This file could allow the attacker to execute commands at the privilege
  level of the user prime. This user does not have administrative or root privileges. The vulnerability
  is due to an incorrect permission setting for important system directories. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by uploading a malicious file by using TFTP, which can be accessed
  via the web-interface GUI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run commands on
  the targeted application without authentication.
