aliases: []
summary: go-zero is a web and rpc framework. Go-zero allows user to specify a CORS Filter with
  a configurable allows param - which is an array of domains allowed in CORS policy. However,
  the `isOriginAllowed` uses `strings.HasSuffix` to check the origin, which leads to bypass
  via a malicious domain. This vulnerability is capable of breaking CORS policy and thus allowing
  any page to make requests and/or retrieve data on behalf of other users. Version 1.4.4 fixes
  this issue.
