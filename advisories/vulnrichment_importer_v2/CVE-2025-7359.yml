aliases: []
summary: 'The Counter live visitors for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
  file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the wcvisitor_get_block function
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to delete arbitrary files on the server. NOTE: This particular vulnerability deletes all the
  files in a targeted arbitrary directory rather than a specified arbitrary file, which can
  lead to loss of data or a denial of service condition.'
