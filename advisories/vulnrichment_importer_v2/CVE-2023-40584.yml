aliases: []
summary: Argo CD is a declarative continuous deployment for Kubernetes. All versions of ArgoCD
  starting from v2.4 have a bug where the ArgoCD repo-server component is vulnerable to a Denial-of-Service
  attack vector. Specifically, the said component extracts a user-controlled tar.gz file without
  validating the size of its inner files. As a result, a malicious, low-privileged user can
  send a malicious tar.gz file that exploits this vulnerability to the repo-server, thereby
  harming the system's functionality and availability. Additionally, the repo-server is susceptible
  to another vulnerability due to the fact that it does not check the extracted file permissions
  before attempting to delete them. Consequently, an attacker can craft a malicious tar.gz archive
  in a way that prevents the deletion of its inner files when the manifest generation process
  is completed. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in versions 2.6.15, 2.7.14,
  and 2.8.3. Users are advised to upgrade. The only way to completely resolve the issue is to
  upgrade, however users unable to upgrade should configure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
  and provide access for configuring applications only to a limited number of administrators.
  These administrators should utilize trusted and verified Helm charts.
