aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the web services interface for remote access VPN features of Cisco
  Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software
  could allow an authenticated, but unprivileged, remote attacker to elevate privileges to level
  15. This vulnerability is due to improper separation of authentication and authorization scopes.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTPS messages to the web
  services interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
  gain privilege level 15 access to the web management interface of the device. This includes
  privilege level 15 access to the device using management tools like the Cisco Adaptive Security
  Device Manager (ASDM) or the Cisco Security Manager (CSM). Note: With Cisco FTD Software,
  the impact is lower than the CVSS score suggests because the affected web management interface
  allows for read access only.'
