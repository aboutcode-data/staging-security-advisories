aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the egress MPLS packet processing function of Cisco IOS XE Software
  for Cisco Catalyst 3650, Catalyst 3850, and Catalyst 9000 Family Switches could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial
  of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of
  IPv4 traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed packet out
  of an affected MPLS-enabled interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause
  the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.
