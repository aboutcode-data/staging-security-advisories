aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the web services of Cisco Secure Firewall Adaptive Security Appliance\
  \ (ASA) Software, Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense (FTD) Software, Cisco IOS Software,\
  \ Cisco IOS XE Software, and Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote\
  \ attacker (Cisco ASA and FTD Software) or authenticated, remote attacker (Cisco IOS, IOS\
  \ XE, and IOS XR Software) with low user privileges to execute arbitrary code on an affected\
  \ device. \r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input in\
  \ HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests\
  \ to a targeted web service on an affected device after obtaining additional information about\
  \ the system, overcoming exploit mitigations, or both. A successful exploit could allow the\
  \ attacker to execute arbitrary code as root, which may lead to the complete compromise of\
  \ the affected device.\r\n\r For more information about this vulnerability, see the Details\
  \ [\"#details\"] section of this advisory."
