aliases: []
summary: The use-after-free vulnerability was found in the AuthentIC driver in OpenSC packages,
  occuring in the card enrolment process using pkcs15-init when a user or administrator enrols
  or modifies cards. An attacker must have physical access to the computer system and requires
  a crafted USB device or smart card to present the system with specially crafted responses
  to the APDUs, which are considered high complexity and low severity. This manipulation can
  allow for compromised card management operations during enrolment.
