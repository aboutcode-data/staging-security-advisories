aliases: []
summary: The Cyr to Lat plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authenticated SQL Injection via
  the 'ctl_sanitize_title' function in versions up to, and including, 3.5 due to insufficient
  escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing
  SQL query. This potentially allows authenticated users with the ability to add or modify terms
  or tags to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to
  extract sensitive information from the database. A partial patch became available in version
  3.6 and the issue was fully patched in version 3.7.
