summary: Nextcloud talk is a chat module for the Nextcloud server platform. In affected versions
  brute force protection of public talk conversation passwords can be bypassed, as there was
  an endpoint validating the conversation password without registering bruteforce attempts.
  It is recommended that the Nextcloud Talk app is upgraded to 15.0.8, 16.0.6 or 17.1.1. There
  are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
