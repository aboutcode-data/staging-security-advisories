aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol implementation for Cisco FXOS Software,
  Cisco IOS XR Software, and Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker
  to cause a reload of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
  The vulnerability is due to a missing check when the affected software processes Cisco Discovery
  Protocol messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco
  Discovery Protocol packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to exhaust system memory, causing the device to reload. Cisco Discovery Protocol is a Layer
  2 protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain
  as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).
