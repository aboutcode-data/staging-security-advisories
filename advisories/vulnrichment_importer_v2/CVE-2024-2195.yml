aliases: []
summary: A critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability was identified in the aimhubio/aim
  project, specifically within the `/api/runs/search/run/` endpoint, affecting versions >= 3.0.0.
  The vulnerability resides in the `run_search_api` function of the `aim/web/api/runs/views.py`
  file, where improper restriction of user access to the `RunView` object allows for the execution
  of arbitrary code via the `query` parameter. This issue enables attackers to execute arbitrary
  commands on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.
