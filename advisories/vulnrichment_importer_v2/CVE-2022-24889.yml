aliases: []
summary: Nextcloud Server is the file server software for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity
  platform. Prior to versions 21.0.8, 22.2.4, and 23.0.1, it is possible to trick administrators
  into enabling "recommended" apps for the Nextcloud server that they do not need, thus expanding
  their attack surface unnecessarily. This issue is fixed in versions 21.0.8 , 22.2.4, and 23.0.1.
