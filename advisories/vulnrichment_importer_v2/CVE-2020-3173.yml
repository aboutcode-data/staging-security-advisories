aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the local management (local-mgmt) CLI of Cisco UCS Manager Software
  could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying
  operating system (OS) on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input
  validation of command arguments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including
  crafted arguments to specific commands on the local management CLI. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying OS with the privileges
  of the currently logged-in user for all affected platforms excluding Cisco UCS 6400 Series
  Fabric Interconnects. On Cisco UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects, the injected commands
  are executed with root privileges.
