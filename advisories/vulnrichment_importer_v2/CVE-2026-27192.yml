aliases: []
summary: Feathersjs is a framework for creating web APIs and real-time applications with TypeScript
  or JavaScript. In versions 5.0.39 and below, origin validation uses startsWith() for comparison,
  allowing attackers to bypass the check by registering a domain that shares a common prefix
  with an allowed origin.The getAllowedOrigin() function checks if the Referer header starts
  with any allowed origin, and this comparison is insufficient as it only validates the prefix.
  This is exploitable when the origins array is configured and an attacker registers a domain
  starting with an allowed origin string (e.g., https://target.com.attacker.com bypasses https://target.com).
  On its own, tokens are still redirected to a configured origin. However, in specific scenarios
  an attacker can initiate the OAuth flow from an unauthorized origin and exfiltrate tokens,
  achieving full account takeover. This issue has bee fixed in version 5.0.40.
