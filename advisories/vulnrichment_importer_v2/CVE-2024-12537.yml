aliases: []
summary: In version 0.3.32 of open-webui/open-webui, the absence of authentication mechanisms
  allows any unauthenticated attacker to access the `api/v1/utils/code/format` endpoint. If
  a malicious actor sends a POST request with an excessively high volume of content, the server
  could become completely unresponsive. This could lead to severe performance issues, causing
  the server to become unresponsive or experience significant degradation, ultimately resulting
  in service interruptions for legitimate users.
