aliases: []
summary: The WP DB Booster plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to missing nonce validation on the
  cleanup_all AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete database
  records including post drafts, revisions, comments, and metadata via a forged request granted
  they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
