  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  m68k: mvme147,mvme16x: Don't wipe PCC timer config bits

  Don't clear the timer 1 configuration bits when clearing the interrupt flag
  and counter overflow. As Michael reported, "This results in no timer
  interrupts being delivered after the first. Initialization then hangs
  in calibrate_delay as the jiffies counter is not updated."

  On mvme16x, enable the timer after requesting the irq, consistent with
  mvme147.
