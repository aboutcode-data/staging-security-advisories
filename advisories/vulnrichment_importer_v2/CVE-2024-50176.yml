aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  remoteproc: k3-r5: Fix error handling when power-up failed

  By simply bailing out, the driver was violating its rule and internal
  assumptions that either both or no rproc should be initialized. E.g.,
  this could cause the first core to be available but not the second one,
  leading to crashes on its shutdown later on while trying to dereference
  that second instance.
