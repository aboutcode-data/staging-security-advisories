summary: Nextcloud Server is a self hosted personal cloud system. After an admin enables the
  default-disabled SVG preview provider, a malicious user could upload a manipulated SVG file
  referencing paths. If the file would exist the preview of the SVG would preview the other
  file instead. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 27.1.10, 28.0.6 or
  29.0.1 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server is upgraded to 24.0.12.15, 25.0.13.10, 26.0.13.4, 27.1.10,
  28.0.6 or 29.0.1.
