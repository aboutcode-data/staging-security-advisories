aliases: []
summary: 'lib/crypto/c_src/crypto_drv.c in erlang does not properly check the return value from
  the OpenSSL DSA_do_verify function, which might allow remote attackers to bypass validation
  of the certificate chain via a malformed SSL/TLS signature, a similar vulnerability to CVE-2008-5077.  NOTE:
  a package maintainer disputes this issue, reporting that there is a proper check within the
  only code that uses the applicable part of crypto_drv.c, and thus "this report is invalid.'
