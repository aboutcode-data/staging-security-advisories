aliases: []
summary: SoftEtherVPN is a an open-source cross-platform multi-protocol VPN Program. When SoftEtherVPN
  is deployed with L2TP enabled on a device, it introduces the possibility of the host being
  used for amplification/reflection traffic generation because it will respond to every packet
  with two response packets that are larger than the request packet size. These sorts of techniques
  are used by external actors who generate spoofed source IPs to target a destination on the
  internet. This vulnerability has been patched in version 5.02.5185.
