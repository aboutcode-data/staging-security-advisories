  scsi: lpfc: Fix a possible null pointer dereference

  In function lpfc_xcvr_data_show, the memory allocation with kmalloc might
  fail, thereby making rdp_context a null pointer. In the following context
  and functions that use this pointer, there are dereferencing operations,
  leading to null pointer dereference.

  To fix this issue, a null pointer check should be added. If it is null,
  use scnprintf to notify the user and return len.
