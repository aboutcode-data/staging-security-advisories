aliases: []
summary: Fresenius Kabi Vigilant Software Suite (Mastermed Dashboard) version 2.0.1.3 allows
  user input to be validated on the client side without authentication by the server. The server
  should not rely on the correctness of the data because users might not support or block JavaScript
  or intentionally bypass the client-side checks. An attacker with knowledge of the service
  user could circumvent the client-side control and login with service privileges.
