aliases: []
summary: Dify is an open-source LLM app development platform. In version 1.8.1, a broken access
  control vulnerability on the /console/api/apps/<APP_ID>chat-messages?conversation_id=<CONVERSATION_ID>&limit=10
  endpoint allows users in the same workspace to read chat messages of other users. A regular
  user is able to read the query data and the filename of the admins and probably other users
  chats, if they know the conversation_id. This impacts the confidentiality of chats. This issue
  has been patched in version 1.9.0.
