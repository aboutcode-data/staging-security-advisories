aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Image Signature Verification feature used in an NX-OS CLI command
  in Cisco Nexus 3000 Series and 9000 Series Switches could allow an authenticated, local attacker
  with administrator-level credentials to install a malicious software image on an affected
  device. The vulnerability exists because software digital signatures are not properly verified
  during CLI command execution. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to install an unsigned
  software image on an affected device. Note: If the device has not been patched for the vulnerability
  previously disclosed in the Cisco Security Advisory cisco-sa-20190306-nxos-sig-verif, a successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to boot a malicious software image.'
