aliases: []
summary: Group-Office is an enterprise customer relationship management and groupware tool.
  Prior to versions 6.8.119 and 25.0.20, a stored and blind XSS vulnerability exists in the
  Phone Number field of the user profile within the GroupOffice application. This allows a malicious
  actor to inject persistent JavaScript payloads, which are triggered in the context of another
  user when they view the Address Book. Successful exploitation enables actions such as forced
  redirects, unauthorized fetch requests, or other arbitrary JavaScript execution without user
  interaction. Versions 6.8.119 and 25.0.20 contain a fix for the issue.
