aliases: []
summary: |
  When asked to both use a `.netrc` file for credentials and to follow HTTP
  redirects, curl could leak the password used for the first host to the
  followed-to host under certain circumstances.

  This flaw only manifests itself if the netrc file has an entry that matches
  the redirect target hostname but the entry either omits just the password or
  omits both login and password.
