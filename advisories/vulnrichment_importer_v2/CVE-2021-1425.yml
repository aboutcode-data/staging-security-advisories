aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco&nbsp;AsyncOS Software\
  \ for Cisco&nbsp;Content Security Management Appliance (SMA) could allow an authenticated,\
  \ remote attacker to access sensitive information on an affected device.\r\nThe vulnerability\
  \ exists because confidential information is being included in HTTP requests that are exchanged\
  \ between the user and the device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by looking\
  \ at the raw HTTP requests that are sent to the interface. A successful exploit could allow\
  \ the attacker to obtain some of the passwords that are configured throughout the interface.Cisco&nbsp;has\
  \ released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that\
  \ address this vulnerability."
