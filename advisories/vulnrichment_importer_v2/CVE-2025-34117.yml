aliases: []
summary: A remote code execution vulnerability exists in multiple Netcore and Netis routers
  models with firmware released prior to August 2014 due to the presence of an undocumented
  backdoor listener on UDP port 53413. Exact version boundaries remain undocumented. An unauthenticated
  remote attacker can send specially crafted UDP packets to execute arbitrary commands on the
  affected device. This backdoor uses a hardcoded authentication mechanism and accepts shell
  commands post-authentication. Some device models include a non-standard implementation of
  the `echo` command, which may affect exploitability.
