aliases: []
summary: The Kiwi Social Share plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due
  to a missing capability check on the kiwi_social_share_get_option() function called via the
  kiwi_social_share_get_option AJAX action in version 2.1.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to read and modify arbitrary options on a WordPress site that can be used for complete
  site takeover. This was a previously fixed vulnerability that was reintroduced in this version.
