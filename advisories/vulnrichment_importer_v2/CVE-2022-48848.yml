  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  tracing/osnoise: Do not unregister events twice

  Nicolas reported that using:

   # trace-cmd record -e all -M 10 -p osnoise --poll

  Resulted in the following kernel warning:

   ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---

  The warning complains about an attempt to unregister an
  unregistered tracepoint.

  This happens on trace-cmd because it first stops tracing, and
  then switches the tracer to nop. Which is equivalent to:

    # cd /sys/kernel/tracing/
    # echo osnoise > current_tracer
    # echo 0 > tracing_on
    # echo nop > current_tracer

  The osnoise tracer stops the workload when no trace instance
  is actually collecting data. This can be caused both by
  disabling tracing or disabling the tracer itself.

  To avoid unregistering events twice, use the existing
  trace_osnoise_callback_enabled variable to check if the events
  (and the workload) are actually active before trying to
  deactivate them.
