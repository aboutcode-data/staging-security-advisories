aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Crater Invoice allows an unauthenticated attacker with knowledge
  of the APP_KEY to achieve remote command execution on the server by manipulating the laravel_session
  cookie, exploiting arbitrary deserialization through the encrypted session data. The exploitation
  vector of this vulnerability relies on an attacker obtaining Laravel's secret APP_KEY, which
  would allow them to decrypt and manipulate session cookies (laravel_session) containing serialized
  data. By altering this data and re-encrypting it with the APP_KEY, the attacker could trigger
  arbitrary deserialization on the server, potentially leading to remote command execution (RCE).
  The vulnerability is primarily exploited by accessing an exposed cookie and manipulating it
  using the secret key to gain malicious access to the server.
