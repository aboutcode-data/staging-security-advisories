aliases: []
summary: "Amazon Cloud Cam is a home security camera that was deprecated on December 2, 2022,\
  \ is end of life, and is no longer actively supported. \n\nWhen a user powers on the Amazon\
  \ Cloud Cam, the device attempts to connect to a remote service infrastructure that has been\
  \ deprecated due to end-of-life status. The device defaults to a pairing status in which an\
  \ arbitrary user can bypass SSL pinning to associate the device to an arbitrary network, allowing\
  \ for network traffic interception and modification.\n\nWe recommend customers discontinue\
  \ usage of any remaining Amazon Cloud Cams."
