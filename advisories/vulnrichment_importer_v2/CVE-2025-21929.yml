  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  HID: intel-ish-hid: Fix use-after-free issue in hid_ishtp_cl_remove()

  During the `rmmod` operation for the `intel_ishtp_hid` driver, a
  use-after-free issue can occur in the hid_ishtp_cl_remove() function.
  The function hid_ishtp_cl_deinit() is called before ishtp_hid_remove(),
  which can lead to accessing freed memory or resources during the
  removal process.

  Call Trace:
   ? ishtp_cl_send+0x168/0x220 [intel_ishtp]
   ? hid_output_report+0xe3/0x150 [hid]

   ishtp_cl_device_remove+0x4a/0x60 [intel_ishtp]
   ...

  Additionally, ishtp_hid_remove() is a HID level power off, which should
  occur before the ISHTP level disconnect.

  This patch resolves the issue by reordering the calls in
  hid_ishtp_cl_remove(). The function ishtp_hid_remove() is now
  called before hid_ishtp_cl_deinit().
