aliases: []
summary: The Responsive Filterable Portfolio plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
  file uploads due to missing file type validation via the HdnMediaSelection_image field in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.0.24. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's
  server which may make remote code execution possible.
