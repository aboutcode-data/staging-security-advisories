aliases: []
summary: Strimzi provides a way to run an Apache Kafka cluster on Kubernetes or OpenShift in
  various deployment configurations. In versions  0.49.0 through 0.50.0, when using a custom
  Cluster or Clients CA with a multistage CA chain consisting of multiple CAs, Strimzi incorrectly
  configures the trusted certificates for mTLS authentication on the internal as well as user-configured
  listeners. All CAs from the CA chain will be trusted. And users with certificates signed by
  any of the CAs in the chain will be able to authenticate. This issue affects only users using
  a custom Cluster or Clients CA with a multistage CA chain consisting of multiple CAs. It does
  not affect users using the Strimzi-managed Cluster and Clients CAs. It also does not affect
  users using custom Cluster or Clients CA with only a single CA (i.e., no CA chain with multiple
  CAs). This issue has been fixed in version 0.50.1. To workaround this issue, instead of providing
  the full CA chain as the custom CA, users can provide only the single CA that should be used.
