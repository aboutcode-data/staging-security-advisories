  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: rswitch: Avoid use-after-free in rswitch_poll()

  The use-after-free is actually in rswitch_tx_free(), which is inlined in
  rswitch_poll(). Since `skb` and `gq->skbs[gq->dirty]` are in fact the
  same pointer, the skb is first freed using dev_kfree_skb_any(), then the
  value in skb->len is used to update the interface statistics.

  Let's move around the instructions to use skb->len before the skb is
  freed.

  This bug is trivial to reproduce using KFENCE. It will trigger a splat
  every few packets. A simple ARP request or ICMP echo request is enough.
