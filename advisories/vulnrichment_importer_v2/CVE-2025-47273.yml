aliases: []
summary: setuptools is a package that allows users to download, build, install, upgrade, and
  uninstall Python packages. A path traversal vulnerability in `PackageIndex` is present in
  setuptools prior to version 78.1.1. An attacker would be allowed to write files to arbitrary
  locations on the filesystem with the permissions of the process running the Python code, which
  could escalate to remote code execution depending on the context. Version 78.1.1 fixes the
  issue.
