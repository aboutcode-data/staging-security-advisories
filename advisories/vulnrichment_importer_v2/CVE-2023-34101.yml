aliases: []
summary: 'Contiki-NG is an operating system for internet of things devices. In version 4.8 and
  prior, when processing ICMP DAO packets in the `dao_input_storing` function, the Contiki-NG
  OS does not verify that the packet buffer is big enough to contain the bytes it needs before
  accessing them. Up to 16 bytes can be read out of bounds in the `dao_input_storing` function.
  An attacker can truncate an ICMP packet so that it does not contain enough data, leading to
  an out-of-bounds read on these lines. The problem has been patched in the "develop" branch
  of Contiki-NG, and is expected to be included in release 4.9. As a workaround, one can apply
  the changes in Contiki-NG pull request #2435 to patch the system.'
