datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2025-49827
datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2025/49xxx/CVE-2025-49827.json
aliases: []
summary: Conjur provides secrets management and application identity for infrastructure. Conjur
  OSS versions 1.19.5 through 1.22.0 and Secrets Manager, Self-Hosted (formerly known as Conjur
  Enterprise) 13.1 through 13.5 and 13.6 are vulnerable to bypass of the IAM authenticator.
  An attacker who can manipulate the headers signed by AWS can take advantage of a malformed
  regular expression to redirect the authentication validation request that Secrets Manager,
  Self-Hosted sends to AWS to a malicious server controlled by the attacker. This redirection
  could result in a bypass of the Secrets Manager, Self-Hosted IAM Authenticator, granting the
  attacker the permissions granted to the client whose request was manipulated. This issue affects
  both Secrets Manager, Self-Hosted (formerly Conjur Enterprise) and Conjur OSS. Conjur OSS
  version 1.22.1 and Secrets Manager, Self-Hosted versions 13.5.1 and 13.6.1 fix the issue.
