aliases: []
summary: DPA countermeasures are unavailable for ECDH key agreement and EdDSA signing operations
  on Curve25519 and Curve448 on all Series 2 modules and SoCs due to a lack of hardware and
  software support. A successful DPA attack may result in exposure of confidential information.
  The best practice is to use the impacted crypto curves and operations with ephemeral keys
  to reduce the number of DPA traces that can be collected.
