aliases: []
summary: Mealie is a self hosted recipe manager and meal planner. Prior to 1.4.0, an attacker
  can point the image request to an arbitrarily large file. Mealie will attempt to retrieve
  this file in whole. If it can be retrieved, it may be stored on the file system in whole (leading
  to possible disk consumption), however the more likely scenario given resource limitations
  is that the container will OOM during file retrieval if the target file size is greater than
  the allocated memory of the container. At best this can be used to force the container to
  infinitely restart due to OOM (if so configured in `docker-compose.yml), or at worst this
  can be used to force the Mealie container to crash and remain offline. In the event that the
  file can be retrieved, the lack of rate limiting on this endpoint also permits an attacker
  to generate ongoing requests to any target of their choice, potentially contributing to an
  external-facing DoS attack. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.4.0.
