aliases: []
summary: Fedify is a TypeScript library for building federated server apps powered by ActivityPub.
  In versions below 1.3.20, 1.4.0-dev.585 through 1.4.12, 1.5.0-dev.636 through 1.5.4, 1.6.0-dev.754
  through 1.6.7, 1.7.0-pr.251.885 through 1.7.8 and 1.8.0-dev.909 through 1.8.4, an authentication
  bypass vulnerability allows any unauthenticated attacker to impersonate any ActivityPub actor
  by sending forged activities signed with their own keys. Activities are processed before verifying
  the signing key belongs to the claimed actor, enabling complete actor impersonation across
  all Fedify instances. This is fixed in versions 1.3.20, 1.4.13, 1.5.5, 1.6.8, 1.7.9 and 1.8.5.
