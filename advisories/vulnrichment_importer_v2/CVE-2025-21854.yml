  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  sockmap, vsock: For connectible sockets allow only connected

  sockmap expects all vsocks to have a transport assigned, which is expressed
  in vsock_proto::psock_update_sk_prot(). However, there is an edge case
  where an unconnected (connectible) socket may lose its previously assigned
  transport. This is handled with a NULL check in the vsock/BPF recv path.

  Another design detail is that listening vsocks are not supposed to have any
  transport assigned at all. Which implies they are not supported by the
  sockmap. But this is complicated by the fact that a socket, before
  switching to TCP_LISTEN, may have had some transport assigned during a
  failed connect() attempt. Hence, we may end up with a listening vsock in a
  sockmap, which blows up quickly:

  KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000120-0x0000000000000127]

  For connectible sockets, instead of relying solely on the state of
  vsk->transport, tell sockmap to only allow those representing established
  connections. This aligns with the behaviour for AF_INET and AF_UNIX.
