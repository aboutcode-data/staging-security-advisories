summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Secure Firewall Management\
  \ Center (FMC) Software, formerly Firepower Management Center Software, could allow an authenticated,\
  \ remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system as root.\r\
  \n\r This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of certain HTTP requests.\
  \ An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the web-based management\
  \ interface of an affected device and then sending a crafted HTTP request to the device. A\
  \ successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root permissions\
  \ on the underlying operating system of the Cisco FMC device or to execute commands on managed\
  \ Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) devices. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker\
  \ would need valid credentials for a user account with at least the role of Security Analyst\
  \ (Read Only)."
