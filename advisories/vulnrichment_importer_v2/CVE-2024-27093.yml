aliases: []
summary: Minder is a Software Supply Chain Security Platform. In version 0.0.31 and earlier,
  it is possible for an attacker to register a repository with a invalid or differing upstream
  ID, which causes Minder to report the repository as registered, but not remediate any future
  changes which conflict with policy (because the webhooks for the repo do not match any known
  repository in the database).  When attempting to register a repo with a different repo ID,
  the registered provider must have admin on the named repo, or a 404 error will result.  Similarly,
  if the stored provider token does not have repo access, then the remediations will not apply
  successfully.  Lastly, it appears that reconciliation actions do not execute against repos
  with this type of mismatch. This appears to primarily be a potential denial-of-service vulnerability.  This
  vulnerability is patched in version 0.20240226.1425+ref.53868a8.
