aliases: []
summary: ntpd-rs is an NTP implementation written in Rust. ntpd-rs does not validate the length
  of NTS cookies in received NTP packets to the server. An attacker can crash the server by
  sending a specially crafted NTP packet containing a cookie shorter than what the server expects.
  The server also crashes when it is not configured to handle NTS packets. The issue was caused
  by improper slice indexing. The indexing operations were replaced by safer alternatives that
  do not crash the ntpd-rs server process but instead properly handle the error condition. A
  patch was released in version 0.3.3.
