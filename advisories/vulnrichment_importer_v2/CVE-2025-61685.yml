aliases: []
summary: Mastra is a Typescript framework for building AI agents and assistants. Versions 0.13.8
  through 0.13.20-alpha.0 are vulnerable to a Directory Traversal attack that results in the
  disclosure of directory listings. The code contains a security check to prevent path traversal
  for reading file contents, but this check is effectively bypassed by subsequent logic that
  attempts to find directory suggestions. An attacker can leverage this flaw to list the contents
  of arbitrary directories on the user's filesystem, including the user's home directory, exposing
  sensitive information about the file system's structure. This issue is fixed in version 0.13.20.
