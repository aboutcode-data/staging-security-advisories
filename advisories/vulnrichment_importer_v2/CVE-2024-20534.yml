summary: "A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco Desk Phone 9800 Series, Cisco IP Phone 6800,\
  \ 7800, and 8800 Series, and Cisco Video Phone 8875 with Cisco Multiplatform Firmware could\
  \ allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks\
  \ against users.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the web UI of an affected device\
  \ does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could\
  \ allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface\
  \ or access sensitive, browser-based information.\r\nNote: To exploit this vulnerability,\
  \ Web Access must be enabled on the phone and the attacker must have Admin credentials on\
  \ the device. Web Access is disabled by default."
