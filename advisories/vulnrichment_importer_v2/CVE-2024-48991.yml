aliases: []
summary: Qualys discovered that needrestart, before version 3.8, allows local attackers to execute
  arbitrary code as root by winning a race condition and tricking needrestart into running their
  own, fake Python interpreter (instead of the system's real Python interpreter). The initial
  security fix (6ce6136) introduced a regression which was subsequently resolved (42af5d3).
