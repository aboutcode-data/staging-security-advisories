aliases: []
summary: The Shield Security – Smart Bot Blocking & Intrusion Prevention Security plugin for
  WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including,
  19.1.13. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the exec function. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to disable pin protection for the admin interface
  of the plugin via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
  an action such as clicking on a link.
