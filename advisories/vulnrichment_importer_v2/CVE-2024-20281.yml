summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Nexus Dashboard and\
  \ Cisco Nexus Dashboard hosted services could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to\
  \ conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system.\r\n\r This vulnerability\
  \ is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface on an affected\
  \ system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a malicious\
  \ link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the\
  \ privilege level of the affected user. If the affected user has administrative privileges,\
  \ these actions could include modifying the system configuration and creating new privileged\
  \ accounts.\r\n\r Note: There are internal security mechanisms in place that limit the scope\
  \ of this exploit, reducing the Security Impact Rating of this vulnerability."
