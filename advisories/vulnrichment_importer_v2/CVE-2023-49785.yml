aliases: []
summary: NextChat, also known as ChatGPT-Next-Web, is a cross-platform chat user interface for
  use with ChatGPT. Versions 2.11.2 and prior are vulnerable to server-side request forgery
  and cross-site scripting. This vulnerability enables read access to internal HTTP endpoints
  but also write access using HTTP POST, PUT, and other methods. Attackers can also use this
  vulnerability to mask their source IP by forwarding malicious traffic intended for other Internet
  targets through these open proxies. As of time of publication, no patch is available, but
  other mitigation strategies are available. Users may avoid exposing the application to the
  public internet or, if exposing the application to the internet, ensure it is an isolated
  network with no access to any other internal resources.
