aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business
  RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to
  execute arbitrary code or cause an affected device to restart unexpectedly. The vulnerabilities
  are due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface.
  An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected
  device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root
  user on the underlying operating system or cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial
  of service (DoS) condition. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have
  valid administrator credentials on the affected device. Cisco has not released software updates
  that address these vulnerabilities.
