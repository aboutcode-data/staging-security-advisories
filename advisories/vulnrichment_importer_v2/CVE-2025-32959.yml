aliases: []
summary: CUBA Platform is a high level framework for enterprise applications development. Prior
  to version 7.2.23, the local file storage implementation does not restrict the size of uploaded
  files. An attacker could exploit this by uploading excessively large files, potentially causing
  the server to run out of space and return HTTP 500 error, resulting in a denial of service.
  This issue has been patched in version 7.2.23. A workaround is provided on the Jmix documentation
  website.
