aliases: []
summary: Microsoft Playwright MCP Server versions prior to 0.0.40 fails to validate the Origin
  header on incoming connections. This allows an attacker to perform a DNS rebinding attack
  via a victim’s web browser and send unauthorized requests to a locally running MCP server,
  resulting in unintended invocation of MCP tool endpoints.
