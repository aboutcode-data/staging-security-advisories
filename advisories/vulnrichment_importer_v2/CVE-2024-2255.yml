aliases: []
summary: The Essential Blocks – Page Builder Gutenberg Blocks, Patterns & Templates plugin for
  WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's widgets in all versions
  up to, and including, 4.5.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on
  user supplied attributes such as listStyle. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
  with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that
  will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
