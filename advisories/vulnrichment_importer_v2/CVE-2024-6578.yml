aliases: []
summary: A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in aimhubio/aim version 3.19.3.
  The vulnerability arises from the improper neutralization of input during web page generation,
  specifically in the logs-tab for runs. The terminal output logs are displayed using the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
  function in React, which is susceptible to XSS attacks. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability
  by injecting malicious scripts into the logs, which will be executed when a user views the
  logs-tab.
