aliases: []
summary: Apptainer is an open source container platform. In Apptainer versions less than 1.4.5,
  a container can disable two of the forms of the little used --security option, in particular
  the forms --security=apparmor:<profile> and --security=selinux:<label> which otherwise put
  restrictions on operations that containers can do. The --security option has always been mentioned
  in Apptainer documentation as being a feature for the root user, although these forms do also
  work for unprivileged users on systems where the corresponding feature is enabled. Apparmor
  is enabled by default on Debian-based distributions and SElinux is enabled by default on RHEL-based
  distributions, but on SUSE it depends on the distribution version. This vulnerability is fixed
  in 1.4.5.
