aliases: []
summary: Jellyfin is a Free Software Media System for managing and streaming media. In affected
  versions there is an argument injection in the VideosController, specifically the `/Videos/<itemId>/stream`
  and `/Videos/<itemId>/stream.<container>` endpoints which are present in the current Jellyfin
  version. Additional endpoints in the AudioController might also be vulnerable, as they differ
  only slightly in execution. Those endpoints are reachable by an unauthenticated user. In order
  to exploit this vulnerability an unauthenticated attacker has to guess an itemId, which is
  a completely random GUID. It’s a very unlikely case even for a large media database with lots
  of items. Without an additional information leak, this vulnerability shouldn’t be directly
  exploitable, even if the instance is reachable from the Internet. There are a lot of query
  parameters that get accepted by the method. At least two of those, videoCodec and audioCodec
  are vulnerable to the argument injection. The values can be traced through a lot of code and
  might be changed in the process. However, the fallback is to always use them as-is, which
  means we can inject our own arguments. Those arguments land in the command line of FFmpeg.
  Because UseShellExecute is always set to false, we can’t simply terminate the FFmpeg command
  and execute our own. It should only be possible to add additional arguments to FFmpeg, which
  is powerful enough as it stands. There is probably a way of overwriting an arbitrary file
  with malicious content. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 10.8.13. Users are
  advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
