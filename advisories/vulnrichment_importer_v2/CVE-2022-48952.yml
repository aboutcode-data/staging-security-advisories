  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  PCI: mt7621: Add sentinel to quirks table

  Current driver is missing a sentinel in the struct soc_device_attribute
  array, which causes an oops when assessed by the
  soc_device_match(mt7621_pcie_quirks_match) call.

  This was only exposed once the CONFIG_SOC_MT7621 mt7621 soc_dev_attr
  was fixed to register the SOC as a device, in:

  commit 7c18b64bba3b ("mips: ralink: mt7621: do not use kzalloc too early")

  Fix it by adding the required sentinel.
