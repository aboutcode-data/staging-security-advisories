  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  scsi: lpfc: Fix use-after-free in lpfc_unreg_rpi() routine

  An error is detected with the following report when unloading the driver:
    "KASAN: use-after-free in lpfc_unreg_rpi+0x1b1b"

  The NLP_REG_LOGIN_SEND nlp_flag is set in lpfc_reg_fab_ctrl_node(), but the
  flag is not cleared upon completion of the login.

  This allows a second call to lpfc_unreg_rpi() to proceed with nlp_rpi set
  to LPFC_RPI_ALLOW_ERROR.  This results in a use after free access when used
  as an rpi_ids array index.

  Fix by clearing the NLP_REG_LOGIN_SEND nlp_flag in
  lpfc_mbx_cmpl_fc_reg_login().
