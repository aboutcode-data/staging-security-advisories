summary: Uncontrolled search path element vulnerability exists in pg_ivm versions prior to 1.5.1.
  When refreshing an IMMV, pg_ivm executes functions without specifying schema names. Under
  certain conditions, pg_ivm may be tricked to execute unexpected functions from other schemas
  with the IMMV owner's privilege. If this vulnerability is exploited, an unexpected function
  provided by an attacker may be executed with the privilege of the materialized view owner.
