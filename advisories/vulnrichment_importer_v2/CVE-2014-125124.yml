aliases: []
summary: An unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability exists in Pandora FMS versions
  up to and including 5.0RC1 via the Anyterm web interface, which listens on TCP port 8023.
  The anyterm-module endpoint accepts unsanitized user input via the p parameter and directly
  injects it into a shell command, allowing arbitrary command execution as the pandora user.
  In certain versions (notably 4.1 and 5.0RC1), the pandora user can elevate privileges to root
  without a password using a chain involving the artica user account. This account is typically
  installed without a password and is configured to run sudo without authentication. Therefore,
  full system compromise is possible without any credentials.
