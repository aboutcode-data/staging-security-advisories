aliases: []
summary: A timing attack vulnerability exists in the gradio-app/gradio repository, specifically
  within the login function in routes.py. The vulnerability arises from the use of a direct
  comparison operation (`app.auth[username] == password`) to validate user credentials, which
  can be exploited to guess passwords based on response times. Successful exploitation of this
  vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized
  access.
