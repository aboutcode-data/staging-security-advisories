aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability exists in the 'counterpart' library for Node.js and the browser due
  to insufficient sanitization of user-controlled input in translation key processing. The affected
  versions prior to 0.18.6 allow attackers to manipulate the library's translation functionality
  by supplying maliciously crafted keys containing prototype chain elements (e.g., __proto__
  ), leading to prototype pollution. This weakness enables adversaries to inject arbitrary properties
  into the JavaScript Object prototype through the first parameter of the translate method when
  combined with specific separator configurations, potentially resulting in denial-of-service
  conditions or remote code execution in vulnerable applications. The issue arises from the
  library's failure to properly validate or neutralize special characters in translation key
  inputs before processing.
