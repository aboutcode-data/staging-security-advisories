aliases: []
summary: Caddy is an extensible server platform that uses TLS by default. Prior to version 2.11.1,
  two swallowed errors in `ClientAuthentication.provision()` cause mTLS client certificate authentication
  to silently fail open when a CA certificate file is missing, unreadable, or malformed. The
  server starts without error but accepts any client certificate signed by any system-trusted
  CA, completely bypassing the intended private CA trust boundary. Any deployment using `trusted_ca_cert_file`
  or `trusted_ca_certs_pem_files` for mTLS will silently degrade to accepting any system-trusted
  client certificate if the CA file becomes unavailable. This can happen due to a typo in the
  path, file rotation, corruption, or permission changes. The server gives no indication that
  mTLS is misconfigured. Version 2.11.1 fixes the vulnerability.
