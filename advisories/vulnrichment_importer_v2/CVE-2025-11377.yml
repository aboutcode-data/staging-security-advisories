summary: The List category posts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure
  in all versions up to, and including, 0.92.0 via the 'catlist' shortcode due to insufficient
  restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with contributor-level access and above, to extract data from password protected, private,
  or draft posts that they should not have access to.
