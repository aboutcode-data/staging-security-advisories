summary: The Reusable Text Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via 'text-blocks' shortcode in versions up to, and including, 1.5.3 due to insufficient input
  sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers with author-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
  that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
