summary: A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the JavaScript engine of Foxit Software’s
  PDF Reader, version 11.1.0.52543. A specially-crafted PDF document can trigger an exception
  which is improperly handled, leaving the engine in an invalid state, which can lead to memory
  corruption and arbitrary code execution. An attacker needs to trick the user to open the malicious
  file to trigger this vulnerability. Exploitation is also possible if a user visits a specially-crafted,
  malicious site if the browser plugin extension is enabled.
