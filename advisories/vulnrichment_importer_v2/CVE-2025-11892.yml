  Server that allows DOM-based cross-site scripting via Issues search label filter that could
  lead to privilege escalation and unauthorized workflow triggers. Successful exploitation requires
  an attacker to have access to the target GitHub Enterprise Server instance and to entice a
  user, while operating in sudo mode, to click on a crafted malicious link to perform actions
  that require elevated privileges. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise
  Server prior to 3.18.1, 3.17.7, 3.16.10, 3.15.14, 3.14.19.
