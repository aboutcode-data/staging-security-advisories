aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software function that
  restores encapsulated option 82 information in DHCP Version 4 (DHCPv4) packets could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a
  Relay Reply denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability exists because the affected
  software performs incomplete input validation of encapsulated option 82 information that it
  receives in DHCPOFFER messages from DHCPv4 servers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a crafted DHCPv4 packet to an affected device, which the device would then forward
  to a DHCPv4 server. When the affected software processes the option 82 information that is
  encapsulated in the response from the server, an error could occur. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Cisco
