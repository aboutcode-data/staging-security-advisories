datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2024-13410
datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2024/13xxx/CVE-2024-13410.json
aliases: []
summary: The CozyStay and TinySalt plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to PHP Object Injection
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.0, and in all versions up to, and including 3.9.0,
  respectively, via deserialization of untrusted input in the 'ajax_handler' function. This
  makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain
  is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless
  another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is
  present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the
  attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute
  code depending on the POP chain present.
