aliases: []
summary: Metabase Enterprise Edition is the enterprise version of Metabase business intelligence
  and data analytics software. Starting in version 1.47.0 and prior to versions 1.50.36, 1.51.14,
  1.52.11, and 1.53.2 of Metabase Enterprise Edition, users with impersonation permissions may
  be able to see results of cached questions, even if their permissions don’t allow them to
  see the data. If some user runs a question which gets cached, and then an impersonated user
  runs that question, then the impersonated user sees the same results as the previous user.
  These cached results may include data the impersonated user should not have access to. This
  vulnerability only impacts the Enterprise Edition of Metabase and not the Open Source Edition.
  Versions 1.53.2, 1.52.11, 1.51.14, and 1.50.36 contains a patch. Versions on the 1.49.X, 1.48.X,
  and 1.47.X branches are vulnerable but do not have a patch available, so users should upgrade
  to a major version with an available fix. Disabling question caching is a workaround for this
  issue.
