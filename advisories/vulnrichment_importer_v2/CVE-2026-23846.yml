aliases: []
summary: Tugtainer is a self-hosted app for automating updates of Docker containers. In versions
  prior to 1.16.1, the password authentication mechanism transmits passwords via URL query parameters
  instead of the HTTP request body. This causes passwords to be logged in server access logs
  and potentially exposed through browser history, Referer headers, and proxy logs. Version
  1.16.1 patches the issue.
