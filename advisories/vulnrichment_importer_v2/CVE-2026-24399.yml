aliases: []
summary: 'ChatterMate is a no-code AI chatbot agent framework. In versions 1.0.8 and below,
  the chatbot accepts and executes malicious HTML/JavaScript payloads when supplied as chat
  input. Specifically, an <iframe> payload containing a javascript: URI can be processed and
  executed in the browser context. This allows access to sensitive client-side data such as
  localStorage tokens and cookies, resulting in client-side injection. This issue has been fixed
  in version 1.0.9.'
