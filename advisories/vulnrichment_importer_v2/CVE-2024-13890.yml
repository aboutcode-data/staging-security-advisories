aliases: []
summary: The Allow PHP Execute plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Code Injection in all
  versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to allowing PHP code to be entered by all
  users for whom unfiltered HTML is allowed. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Editor-level access and above, to inject PHP code into posts and pages.
