aliases: []
summary: The MainWP Child Reports plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 2.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the network_options_action() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to update arbitrary options that can be leveraged for privilege escalation via a forged request
  granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on
  a link. This is only exploitable on multisite instances.
