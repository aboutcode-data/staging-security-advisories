aliases: []
summary: 'The Blog2Social: Social Media Auto Post & Scheduler plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 8.7.2. This is due
  to a misconfigured authorization check on the ''getShipItemFullText'' function which only
  verifies that a user has the ''read'' capability (Subscriber-level) and a valid nonce, but
  fails to verify whether the user has permission to access the specific post being requested.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above,
  to extract data from password-protected, private, or draft posts.'
