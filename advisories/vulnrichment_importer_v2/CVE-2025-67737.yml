datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2025/67xxx/CVE-2025-67737.json
aliases: []
summary: AzuraCast is a self-hosted, all-in-one web radio management suite. Versions 0.23.1
  mistakenly include an API endpoint that is intended for internal use by the SFTP software
  sftpgo, exposing it to the public-facing HTTP API for AzuraCast installations. A user with
  specific internal knowledge of a station's operations can craft a custom HTTP request that
  would affect the contents of a station's database, without revealing any internal information
  about the station. In order to carry out an attack, a malicious user would need to know a
  valid SFTP station username and the coordinating internal filesystem structure. This issue
  is fixed in version 0.23.2.
