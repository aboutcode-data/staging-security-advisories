aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management
  Center (FMC) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct SQL injection
  attacks on an affected system. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management
  interface does not adequately validate user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by authenticating to the application and sending crafted SQL queries to an affected system.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain any data from the database, execute
  arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system, and elevate privileges to root. To
  exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need at least Read Only user credentials.
