aliases: []
summary: MobSF is a mobile application security testing tool used. In version 4.4.0, the GET
  /download/ route uses string path verification via os.path.commonprefix, which allows an authenticated
  user to download files outside the DWD_DIR download directory from "neighboring" directories
  whose absolute paths begin with the same prefix as DWD_DIR (e.g., .../downloads_bak, .../downloads.old).
  This is a Directory Traversal (escape) leading to a data leak. This issue has been patched
  in version 4.4.1.
