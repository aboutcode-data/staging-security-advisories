  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ceph: fix crash after fscrypt_encrypt_pagecache_blocks() error

  The function move_dirty_folio_in_page_array() was created by commit
  ce80b76dd327 ("ceph: introduce ceph_process_folio_batch() method") by
  moving code from ceph_writepages_start() to this function.

  This new function is supposed to return an error code which is checked
  by the caller (now ceph_process_folio_batch()), and on error, the
  caller invokes redirty_page_for_writepage() and then breaks from the
  loop.

  However, the refactoring commit has gone wrong, and it by accident, it
  always returns 0 (= success) because it first NULLs the pointer and
  then returns PTR_ERR(NULL) which is always 0.  This means errors are
  silently ignored, leaving NULL entries in the page array, which may
  later crash the kernel.

  The simple solution is to call PTR_ERR() before clearing the pointer.
