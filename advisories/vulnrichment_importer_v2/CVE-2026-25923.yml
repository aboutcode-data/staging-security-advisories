aliases: []
summary: my little forum is a PHP and MySQL based internet forum that displays the messages
  in classical threaded view. Prior to 20260208.1, the application fails to filter the phar://
  protocol in URL validation, allowing attackers to upload a malicious Phar Polyglot file (disguised
  as JPEG) via the image upload feature, trigger Phar deserialization through BBCode [img] tag
  processing, and exploit Smarty 4.1.0 POP chain to achieve arbitrary file deletion. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 20260208.1.
