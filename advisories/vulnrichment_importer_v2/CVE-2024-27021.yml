  r8169: fix LED-related deadlock on module removal

  Binding devm_led_classdev_register() to the netdev is problematic
  because on module removal we get a RTNL-related deadlock. Fix this
  by avoiding the device-managed LED functions.

  Note: We can safely call led_classdev_unregister() for a LED even
  if registering it failed, because led_classdev_unregister() detects
  this and is a no-op in this case.
