aliases: []
summary: The Admin and Site Enhancements (ASE) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
  Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 7.5.1 due
  to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with custom-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that
  will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file. This feature must be enabled, and for
  specific roles in order to be exploitable.
