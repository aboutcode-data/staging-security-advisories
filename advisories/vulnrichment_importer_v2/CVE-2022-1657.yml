aliases: []
summary: Vulnerable versions of the Jupiter (<= 6.10.1) and JupiterX (<= 2.0.6) Themes allow
  logged-in users, including subscriber-level users, to perform Path Traversal and Local File
  inclusion. In the JupiterX theme, the jupiterx_cp_load_pane_action AJAX action present in
  the lib/admin/control-panel/control-panel.php file calls the load_control_panel_pane function.
  It is possible to use this action to include any local PHP file via the slug parameter. The
  Jupiter theme has a nearly identical vulnerability which can be exploited via the mka_cp_load_pane_action
  AJAX action present in the framework/admin/control-panel/logic/functions.php file, which calls
  the mka_cp_load_pane_action function.
