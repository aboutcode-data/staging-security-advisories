aliases: []
summary: There exists a code execution vulnerability in the Car App Android Jetpack Library.
  CarAppService uses deserialization logic that allows construction of arbitrary java classes.
  This can lead to arbitrary code execution when combined with specific Java deserialization
  gadgets. An attacker needs to install a malicious application on victims device to be able
  to attack any application that uses vulnerable library. We recommend upgrading the library
  past version 1.7.0-beta02.
