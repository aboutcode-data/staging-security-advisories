summary: 'pwn.college DOJO is an education platform for learning cybersecurity. Prior to commit
  467db0b9ea0d9a929dc89b41f6eb59f7cfc68bef, the /workspace endpoint contains an improper authentication
  vulnerability that allows an attacker to access any active Windows VM without proper authorization.
  The vulnerability occurs in the view_desktop function where the user is retrieved via a URL
  parameter without verifying that the requester has administrative privileges. An attacker
  can supply any user ID and arbitrary password in the request parameters to impersonate another
  user. When requesting a Windows desktop service, the function does not validate the supplied
  password before generating access credentials, allowing the attacker to obtain an iframe source
  URL that grants full access to the target user''s Windows VM. This impacts all users with
  active Windows VMs, as an attacker can access and modify data on the Windows machine and in
  the home directory of the associated Linux machine via the Z: drive. This issue has been patched
  in commit 467db0b9ea0d9a929dc89b41f6eb59f7cfc68bef. No known workarounds exist.'
