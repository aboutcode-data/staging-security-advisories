aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Virtual Network Computing (VNC) console implementation of Cisco
  Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to access the VNC console session of an administrative user on an affected device. The vulnerability
  is due to an insufficient authentication mechanism used to establish a VNC session. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting an administrator VNC session request prior
  to login. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to watch the administrator console
  session or interact with it, allowing admin access to the affected device.
