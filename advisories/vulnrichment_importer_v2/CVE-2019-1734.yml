aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the implementation of a CLI diagnostic command in Cisco FXOS Software
  and Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view sensitive system
  files that should be restricted. The attacker could use this information to conduct additional
  reconnaissance attacks. The vulnerability is due to incomplete role-based access control (RBAC)
  verification. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device
  and issuing a specific CLI diagnostic command with crafted user-input parameters. An exploit
  could allow the attacker to perform an arbitrary read of a file on the device, and the file
  may contain sensitive information. The attacker needs valid device credentials to exploit
  this vulnerability.
