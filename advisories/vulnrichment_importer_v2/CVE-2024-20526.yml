summary: "A vulnerability in the SSH server of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software\
  \ could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition\
  \ for the SSH server of an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to a logic error\
  \ when an SSH session is established. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending\
  \ crafted SSH messages to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker\
  \ to exhaust available SSH resources on the affected device so that new SSH connections to\
  \ the device are denied, resulting in a DoS condition. Existing SSH connections to the device\
  \ would continue to function normally. The device must be rebooted manually to recover. However,\
  \ user traffic would not be impacted and could be managed using a remote application such\
  \ as Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM)."
