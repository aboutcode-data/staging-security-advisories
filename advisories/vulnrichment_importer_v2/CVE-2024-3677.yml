aliases: []
summary: The Ultimate 410 Gone Status Code plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the 410 entries in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.4 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
  execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.  Please note TinyWeb as a separate Web
  Browser is not affected, and only shares a name with the author of this plugin.
