aliases: []
summary: The Perfect Brands for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based
  SQL Injection via the `brands` attribute of the `products` shortcode in all versions up to,
  and including, 3.6.2 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack
  of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into
  already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
