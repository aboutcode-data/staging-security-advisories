aliases: []
summary: Bruno is an open source IDE for exploring and testing APIs. A bug in the assertion
  runtime caused assert expressions to run in Developer Mode, even if Safe Mode was selected.
  The bug resulted in the sandbox settings to be ignored for the particular case where a single
  request is run/sent. This vulnerability's attack surface is limited strictly to scenarios
  where users import collections from untrusted or malicious sources. The exploit requires deliberate
  action from the user—specifically, downloading and opening an externally provided malicious
  Bruno collection. The vulnerability is fixed in 1.39.1.
