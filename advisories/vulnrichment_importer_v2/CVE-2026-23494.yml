aliases: []
summary: Pimcore is an Open Source Data & Experience Management Platform. Prior to 12.3.1 and
  11.5.14, the application fails to enforce proper server-side authorization checks on the API
  endpoint responsible for reading or listing static routes. In Pimcore, static routes are custom
  URL patterns defined via the backend interface or the var/config/staticroutes.php file, including
  details like regex-based patterns, controllers, variables, and priorities. These routes are
  registered automatically through the PimcoreStaticRoutesBundle and integrated into the MVC
  routing system. Testing revealed that an authenticated backend user lacking explicit permissions
  was able to invoke the endpoint (e.g., GET /api/static-routes) and retrieve sensitive route
  configurations. This vulnerability is fixed in 12.3.1 and 11.5.14.
