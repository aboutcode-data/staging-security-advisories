  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/amdkfd: Use dynamic allocation for CU occupancy array in 'kfd_get_cu_occupancy()'

  The `kfd_get_cu_occupancy` function previously declared a large
  `cu_occupancy` array as a local variable, which could lead to stack
  overflows due to excessive stack usage. This commit replaces the static
  array allocation with dynamic memory allocation using `kcalloc`,
  thereby reducing the stack size.

  This change avoids the risk of stack overflows in kernel space,  in
  scenarios where `AMDGPU_MAX_QUEUES` is large. The  allocated memory is
  freed using `kfree` before the function returns  to prevent memory
  leaks.

  Fixes the below with gcc W=1:
  drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../amdkfd/kfd_process.c: In function ‘kfd_get_cu_occupancy’:
  drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../amdkfd/kfd_process.c:322:1: warning: the frame size of 1056 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
