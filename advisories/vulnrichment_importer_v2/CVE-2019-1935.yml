aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) Supervisor, Cisco UCS
  Director, and Cisco UCS Director Express for Big Data could allow an unauthenticated, remote
  attacker to log in to the CLI of an affected system by using the SCP User account (scpuser),
  which has default user credentials. The vulnerability is due to the presence of a documented
  default account with an undocumented default password and incorrect permission settings for
  that account. Changing the default password for this account is not enforced during the installation
  of the product. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the account to log in
  to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
  commands with the privileges of the scpuser account. This includes full read and write access
  to the system's database.
