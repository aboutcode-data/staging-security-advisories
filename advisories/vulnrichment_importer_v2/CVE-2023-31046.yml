summary: A Path Traversal vulnerability exists in PaperCut NG before 22.1.1 and PaperCut MF
  before 22.1.1. Under specific conditions, this could potentially allow an authenticated attacker

  /ui/static/..//.." reach getStaticContent in UIContentResource.class in the static-content-files
  servlet.
