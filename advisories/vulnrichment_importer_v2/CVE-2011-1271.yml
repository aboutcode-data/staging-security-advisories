aliases: []
summary: The JIT compiler in Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Gold and SP1, 3.5.1, and 4.0, when
  IsJITOptimizerDisabled is false, does not properly handle expressions related to null strings,
  which allows context-dependent attackers to bypass intended access restrictions, and consequently
  execute arbitrary code, in opportunistic circumstances by leveraging a crafted application,
  as demonstrated by (1) a crafted XAML browser application (aka XBAP), (2) a crafted ASP.NET
  application, or (3) a crafted .NET Framework application, aka ".NET Framework JIT Optimization
  Vulnerability."
