aliases: []
summary: Phproject is a high performance full-featured project management system. From 1.8.0
  to before 1.8.3, a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Planned Hours
  field when creating a new project. When sending a POST request to /issues/new/, the value
  provided in the Planned Hours field is included in the server response without any HTML encoding
  or sanitization. Because of this, an attacker can craft a malicious payload such as <script>alert(1)</script>
  and include it in the planned_hours parameter. The server reflects the input directly in the
  HTML of the project creation page, causing the browser to interpret and execute it. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 1.8.3.
