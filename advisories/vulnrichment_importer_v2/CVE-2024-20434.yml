aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent\
  \ attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on the control plane of an affected\
  \ device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper handling of frames with VLAN tag information.\
  \ An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted frames to an affected device.\
  \ A successful exploit could allow the attacker to render the control plane of the affected\
  \ device unresponsive. The device would not be accessible through the console or CLI, and\
  \ it would not respond to ping requests, SNMP requests, or requests from other control plane\
  \ protocols. Traffic that is traversing the device through the data plane is not affected.\
  \ A reload of the device is required to restore control plane services."
