aliases: []
summary: 'A cross-protocol scripting issue was discovered in the management interface in OpenVPN
  through 2.4.5. When this interface is enabled over TCP without a password, and when no other
  clients are connected to this interface, attackers can execute arbitrary management commands,
  obtain sensitive information, or cause a denial of service (SIGTERM) by triggering XMLHttpRequest
  actions in a web browser. This is demonstrated by a multipart/form-data POST to http://localhost:23000
  with a "signal SIGTERM" command in a TEXTAREA element. NOTE: The vendor disputes that this
  is a vulnerability. They state that this is the result of improper configuration of the OpenVPN
  instance rather than an intrinsic vulnerability, and now more explicitly warn against such
  configurations in both the management-interface documentation, and with a runtime warning'
