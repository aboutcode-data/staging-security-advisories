summary: "The Java OpenWire protocol marshaller is vulnerable to Remote Code \nExecution. This\
  \ vulnerability may allow a remote attacker with network \naccess to either a Java-based OpenWire\
  \ broker or client to run arbitrary\n shell commands by manipulating serialized class types\
  \ in the OpenWire \nprotocol to cause either the client or the broker (respectively) to \n\
  instantiate any class on the classpath.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade\n both brokers\
  \ and clients to version 5.15.16, 5.16.7, 5.17.6, or 5.18.3 \nwhich fixes this issue."
