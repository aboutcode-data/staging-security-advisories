aliases: []
summary: Tiny File Manager through 2.6 contains a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability
  in the URL upload feature. Due to insufficient validation of user-supplied URLs, an attacker
  can send crafted requests to localhost by using http://www.127.0.0.1.example.com/ or a similarly
  constructed domain name. This may lead to unauthorized port scanning or access to internal-only
  services.
