aliases: []
summary: Nagios XI versions prior to 5.7.2 allow PHP files to be uploaded to the Audio Import
  directory and executed from that location. The upload handler did not properly restrict file
  types or enforce storage outside of the webroot, and the web server permitted execution within
  the upload directory. An authenticated attacker with access to the audio import feature could
  upload a crafted PHP file and then request it to achieve remote code execution with the privileges
  of the application service.
