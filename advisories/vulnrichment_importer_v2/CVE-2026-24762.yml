aliases: []
summary: RustFS is a distributed object storage system built in Rust. From versions alpha.13
  to alpha.81, RustFS logs sensitive credential material (access key, secret key, session token)
  to application logs at INFO level. This results in credentials being recorded in plaintext
  in log output, which may be accessible to internal or external log consumers and could lead
  to compromise of sensitive credentials. This issue has been patched in version alpha.82.
