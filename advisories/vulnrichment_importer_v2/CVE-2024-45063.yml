advisory_id: CVE-2024-45063
datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2024-45063
datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2024/45xxx/CVE-2024-45063.json
aliases: []
summary: |
  The function ctl_write_buffer incorrectly set a flag which resulted in a kernel Use-After-Free when a command finished processing.

  Malicious software running in a guest VM that exposes virtio_scsi can exploit the vulnerabilities to achieve code execution on the host in the bhyve userspace process, which typically runs as root.  Note that bhyve runs in a Capsicum sandbox, so malicious code is constrained by the capabilities available to the bhyve process.  A malicious iSCSI initiator could achieve remote code execution on the iSCSI target host.
