aliases: []
summary: Mintty is a terminal emulator for Cygwin, MSYS, and WSL. In versions 2.3.6 through
  3.7.4, several escape sequences can cause the mintty process to access a file in a specific
  path. It is triggered by simply printing them out on bash. An attacker can specify an arbitrary
  network path, negotiate an ntlm hash out of the victim's machine to an attacker controlled
  remote host. An attacker can use password cracking tools or NetNTLMv2 hashes to Pass the Hash.
  Version 3.7.5 fixes the issue.
