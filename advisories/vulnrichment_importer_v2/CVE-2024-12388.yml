summary: A vulnerability in binary-husky/gpt_academic version 310122f allows for a Regular Expression
  Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. The application uses a regular expression to parse user
  input, which can take polynomial time to match certain crafted inputs. This allows an attacker
  to send a small malicious payload to the server, causing it to become unresponsive and unable
  to handle any requests from other users.
