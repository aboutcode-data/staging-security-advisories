aliases: []
summary: The CM Registration – Tailored tool for seamless login and invitation-based registrations
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Open Redirect in all versions up to, and including,
  2.5.6. This is due to insufficient validation on the redirect url supplied via the 'redirect_url'
  parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to redirect users to potentially
  malicious sites if they can successfully trick them into performing an action.
