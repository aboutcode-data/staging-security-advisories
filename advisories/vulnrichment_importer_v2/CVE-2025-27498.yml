aliases: []
summary: aes-gcm is a pure Rust implementation of the AES-GCM. In decrypt_in_place_detached,
  the decrypted ciphertext (which is the correct ciphertext) is exposed even if the tag is incorrect.
  This is because in decrypt_inplace in asconcore.rs, tag verification causes an error to be
  returned with the plaintext contents still in buffer. The vulnerability is fixed in 0.4.3.
