summary: A vulnerability in the web-based interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager
  and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (SME) could allow an authenticated,
  remote attacker to impact the confidentiality of an affected system by executing arbitrary
  SQL queries. The vulnerability exists because the affected software improperly validates user-supplied
  input in SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests
  that contain malicious SQL statements to the affected application. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to determine the presence of certain values in the database, impacting
  the confidentiality of the system.
