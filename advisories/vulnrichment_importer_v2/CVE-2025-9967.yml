aliases: []
summary: The Orion SMS OTP Verification plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
  via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.7. This is due to the plugin
  not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their password. This makes it
  possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's password to a one-time password
  if the attacker knows the user's phone number
