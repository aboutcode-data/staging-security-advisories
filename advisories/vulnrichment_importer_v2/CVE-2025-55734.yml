aliases: []
summary: 'flaskBlog is a blog app built with Flask. In 2.8.0 and earlier, the code checks if
  the userRole is "admin" only when visiting the /admin page, but not when visiting its subroutes.
  Specifically, only the file routes/adminPanel.py checks the user role when a user is trying
  to access the admin page, but that control is not done for the pages routes/adminPanelComments.py
  and routes/adminPanelPosts.py. Thus, an unauthorized user can bypass the intended restrictions,
  leaking sensitive data and accessing the following pages: /admin/posts, /adminpanel/posts,
  /admin/comments, and /adminpanel/comments.'
