aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the hardware initialization routines of Cisco IOS XE Software for
  Cisco 1100 Series Industrial Integrated Services Routers and Cisco ESR6300 Embedded Series
  Routers could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute unsigned code at system boot
  time. This vulnerability is due to incorrect validations of parameters passed to a diagnostic
  script that is executed when the device boots up. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by tampering with an executable file stored on a device. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to execute unsigned code at boot time and bypass the software image verification
  check part of the secure boot process of an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability,
  the attacker would need administrative level credentials (level 15) on the device.
