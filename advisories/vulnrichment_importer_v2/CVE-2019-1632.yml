summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Integrated Management
  Controller (IMC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request
  forgery (CSRF) attack and perform arbitrary actions on an affected device. The vulnerability
  is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of the affected

  of the user to perform arbitrary actions on the affected device.
