aliases: []
summary: 'dtprintinfo in Common Desktop Environment 1.6 has a bug in the parser of lpstat (an
  invoked external command) during listing of the names of available printers. This allows low-privileged
  local users to inject arbitrary printer names via the $HOME/.printers file. This injection
  allows those users to manipulate the control flow and disclose memory contents on Solaris
  10 systems. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by
  the maintainer.'
