aliases: []
summary: 'The tf_remapper_node component 1.1.1 for Robot Operating System (ROS) allows attackers,
  who control the source code of a different node in the same ROS application, to change a robot''s
  behavior. This occurs because a topic name depends on the attacker-controlled old_tf_topic_name
  and/or new_tf_topic_name parameter. NOTE: the vendor''s position is "it is the responsibility
  of the programmer to make sure that only known and required parameters are set and unexpected
  parameters are not."'
