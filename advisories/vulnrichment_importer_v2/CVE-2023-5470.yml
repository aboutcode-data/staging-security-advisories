summary: The Etsy Shop plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via
  'etsy-shop' shortcode in versions up to, and including, 3.0.4 due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in
  pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
