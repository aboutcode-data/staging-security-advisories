aliases: []
summary: NextChat contains a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the HTMLPreview component
  of artifacts.tsx that allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code when HTML content
  is rendered in the AI chat interface. The vulnerability occurs because user-influenced HTML
  from AI responses is rendered in an iframe with 'allow-scripts' sandbox permission without
  proper sanitization. This can be exploited through specifically crafted prompts that cause
  the AI to generate malicious HTML/JavaScript code. When a user views the HTML preview, the
  injected JavaScript executes in the user's browser context, potentially allowing attackers
  to exfiltrate sensitive information (including API keys stored in localStorage), perform actions
  on behalf of the user, and steal session data.
