aliases: []
summary: Apollo Gateway provides utilities for combining multiple GraphQL microservices into
  a single GraphQL endpoint. Prior to 2.10.1, a vulnerability in Apollo Gateway allowed queries
  with deeply nested and reused named fragments to be prohibitively expensive to query plan,
  specifically during named fragment expansion. Named fragments were being expanded once per
  fragment spread during query planning, leading to exponential resource usage when deeply nested
  and reused fragments were involved. This could lead to excessive resource consumption and
  denial of service. This has been remediated in @apollo/gateway version 2.10.1.
