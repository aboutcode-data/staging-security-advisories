aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Network Recording Player and Cisco Webex Player for
  Microsoft Windows could allow an attacker to cause a process crash resulting in a Denial of
  service (DoS) condition for the player application on an affected system. The vulnerability
  exists due to insufficient validation of certain elements with a Webex recording stored in
  either the Advanced Recording Format (ARF) or the Webex Recording Format (WRF). An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending a user a malicious ARF or WRF file through a link
  or email attachment and persuading the user to open the file with the affected software on
  the local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Webex player
  application to crash when trying to view the malicious file. This vulnerability affects Cisco
  Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player releases earlier than Release 3.0 MR3 Security
  Patch 2 and 4.0 MR3.
