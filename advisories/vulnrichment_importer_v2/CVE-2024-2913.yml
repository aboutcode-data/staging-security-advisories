aliases: []
summary: A race condition vulnerability exists in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm repository,
  specifically within the user invite acceptance process. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability
  by sending multiple concurrent requests to accept a single user invite, allowing the creation
  of multiple user accounts from a single invite link intended for only one user. This bypasses
  the intended security mechanism that restricts invite acceptance to a single user, leading
  to unauthorized user creation without detection in the invite tab. The issue is due to the
  lack of validation for concurrent requests in the backend.
