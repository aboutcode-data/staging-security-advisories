aliases: []
summary: MaterialX is an open standard for the exchange of rich material and look-development
  content across applications and renderers. In versions 1.39.2 and below, when parsing an MTLX
  file with multiple nested nodegraph implementations, the MaterialX XML parsing logic can potentially
  crash due to stack exhaustion. An attacker could intentionally crash a target program that
  uses OpenEXR by sending a malicious MTLX file. This is fixed in version 1.39.3.
