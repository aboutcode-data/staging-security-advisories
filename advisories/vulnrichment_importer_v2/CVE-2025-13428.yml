aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability exists in the SecOps SOAR server. The custom integrations feature\
  \ allowed an authenticated user with an \"IDE role\" to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE)\
  \ in the server. The flaw stemmed from weak validation of uploaded Python package code. An\
  \ attacker could upload a package containing a malicious setup.py file, which would execute\
  \ on the server during the installation process, leading to potential server compromise.\n\
  \nNo customer action is required. \n\n\nAll customers have been automatically upgraded to\
  \ the fixed version: 6.3.64 or higher."
