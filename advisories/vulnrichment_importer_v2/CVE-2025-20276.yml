summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified CCX could allow\
  \ an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device. To exploit\
  \ this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials.&nbsp;\r\n\r\
  \nThis vulnerability is due to insecure deserialization of Java objects by the affected software.\
  \ An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Java object to an affected\
  \ device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying\
  \ operating system of an affected device as a low-privilege user. A successful exploit could\
  \ also allow the attacker to undertake further actions to elevate their privileges to root."
