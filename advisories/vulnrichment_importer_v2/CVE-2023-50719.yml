aliases: []
summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in 7.2-milestone-2 and prior to
  versions 14.10.15, 15.5.2, and 15.7-rc-1, the Solr-based search in XWiki discloses the password
  hashes of all users to anyone with view right on the respective user profiles. By default,
  all user profiles are public. This vulnerability also affects any configurations used by extensions
  that contain passwords like API keys that are viewable for the attacker. Normally, such passwords
  aren't accessible but this vulnerability would disclose them as plain text.  This has been
  patched in XWiki 14.10.15, 15.5.2 and 15.7RC1. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
