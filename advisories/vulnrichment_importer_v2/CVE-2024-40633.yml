aliases: []
summary: 'Sylius is an Open Source eCommerce Framework on Symfony. A security vulnerability
  was discovered in the `/api/v2/shop/adjustments/{id}` endpoint, which retrieves order adjustments
  based on incremental integer IDs. The vulnerability allows an attacker to enumerate valid
  adjustment IDs and retrieve order tokens. Using these tokens, an attacker can access guest
  customer order details - sensitive guest customer information.  The issue is fixed in versions:
  1.12.19, 1.13.4 and above. The `/api/v2/shop/adjustments/{id}` will always return `404` status.
  Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may alter their config to mitigate this
  issue. Please see the linked GHSA for details.'
