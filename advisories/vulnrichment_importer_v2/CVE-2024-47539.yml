aliases: []
summary: GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An out-of-bounds
  write vulnerability was identified in the convert_to_s334_1a function in isomp4/qtdemux.c.
  The vulnerability arises due to a discrepancy between the size of memory allocated to the
  storage array and the loop condition i * 2 < ccpair_size. Specifically, when ccpair_size is
  even, the allocated size in storage does not match the loop's expected bounds, resulting in
  an out-of-bounds write. This bug allows for the overwriting of up to 3 bytes beyond the allocated
  bounds of the storage array. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.
