aliases: []
summary: Hono is a Web application framework that provides support for any JavaScript runtime.
  Prior to 4.11.4, there is a flaw in Hono’s JWK/JWKS JWT verification middleware allowed the
  algorithm specified in the JWT header to influence signature verification when the selected
  JWK did not explicitly define an algorithm. This could enable JWT algorithm confusion and,
  in certain configurations, allow forged tokens to be accepted. The JWK/JWKS JWT verification
  middleware has been updated to require an explicit allowlist of asymmetric algorithms when
  verifying tokens. The middleware no longer derives the verification algorithm from untrusted
  JWT header values. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.11.4.
