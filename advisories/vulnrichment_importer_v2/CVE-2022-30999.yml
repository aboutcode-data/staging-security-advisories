aliases: []
summary: FriendsofFlarum (FoF) Upload is an extension that handles file uploads intelligently
  for your forum. If FoF Upload prior to version 1.2.3 is configured to allow the uploading
  of SVG files ('image/svg+xml'), navigating directly to an SVG file URI could execute arbitrary
  Javascript code decided by an attacker. This Javascript code could include the execution of
  HTTP web requests to Flarum, or any other web service. This could allow data to be leaked
  by an authenticated Flarum user, or, possibly, for data to be modified maliciously. This issue
  has been patched with v1.2.3, which now sanitizes uploaded SVG files. As a workaround, remove
  the ability for users to upload SVG files through FoF Upload.
