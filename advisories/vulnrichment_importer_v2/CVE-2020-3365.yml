summary: A vulnerability in the directory permissions of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure
  Software (NFVIS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a directory traversal
  attack on a limited set of restricted directories. The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the
  logic that governs directory permissions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
  using capabilities that are not controlled by the role-based access control (RBAC) mechanisms
  of the software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite files on an affected
  device.
