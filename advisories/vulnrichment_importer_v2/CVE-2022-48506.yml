summary: 'A flawed pseudorandom number generator in Dominion Voting Systems ImageCast Precinct
  (ICP and ICP2) and ImageCast Evolution (ICE) scanners allows anyone to determine the order
  in which ballots were cast from public ballot-level data, allowing deanonymization of voted
  ballots, in several types of scenarios. This issue was observed for use of the following versions
  of Democracy Suite: 5.2, 5.4-NM, 5.5, 5.5-A, 5.5-B, 5.5-C, 5.5-D, 5.7-A, 5.10, 5.10A, 5.15.
