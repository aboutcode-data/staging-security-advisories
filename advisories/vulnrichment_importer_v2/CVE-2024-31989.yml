aliases: []
summary: Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. It has been
  discovered that an unprivileged pod in a different namespace on the same cluster could connect
  to the Redis server on port 6379. Despite having installed the latest version of the VPC CNI
  plugin on the EKS cluster, it requires manual enablement through configuration to enforce
  network policies. This raises concerns that many clients might unknowingly have open access
  to their Redis servers. This vulnerability could lead to Privilege Escalation to the level
  of cluster controller, or to information leakage, affecting anyone who does not have strict
  access controls on their Redis instance. This issue has been patched in version(s) 2.8.19,
  2.9.15 and 2.10.10.
