aliases: []
summary: The Modal Portfolio plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.4.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
  escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access
  and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
  an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
  has been disabled.
