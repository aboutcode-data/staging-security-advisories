  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  Avoid hw_desc array overrun in dw-axi-dmac

  I have a use case where nr_buffers = 3 and in which each descriptor is composed by 3
  segments, resulting in the DMA channel descs_allocated to be 9. Since axi_desc_put()
  handles the hw_desc considering the descs_allocated, this scenario would result in a
  kernel panic (hw_desc array will be overrun).

  To fix this, the proposal is to add a new member to the axi_dma_desc structure,
  where we keep the number of allocated hw_descs (axi_desc_alloc()) and use it in
  axi_desc_put() to handle the hw_desc array correctly.

  Additionally I propose to remove the axi_chan_start_first_queued() call after completing
  the transfer, since it was identified that unbalance can occur (started descriptors can
  be interrupted and transfer ignored due to DMA channel not being enabled).
