aliases: []
summary: 'Default and unremovable support credentials (user:nwk password:nwk2) allow attackers
  to gain total super user control of an IoT device through a TELNET session to products using
  the RadioRA 2 Lutron integration protocol Revision M to Revision Y. NOTE: The vendor disputes
  this id as not being a vulnerability because what can be done through the ports revolve around
  controlling lighting, not code execution. A certain set of commands are listed, which bear
  some similarity to code, but they are not arbitrary and do not allow admin-level control of
  a machine'
