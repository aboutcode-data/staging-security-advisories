aliases: []
summary: '`effectindex/tripreporter` is a community-powered, universal platform for submitting
  and analyzing trip reports. Prior to commit bd80ba833b9023d39ca22e29874296c8729dd53b, any
  user with an account on an instance of `effectindex/tripreporter`, e.g. `subjective.report`,
  may be affected by an improper password verification vulnerability. The vulnerability allows
  any user with a password matching the password requirements to log in as any user. This allows
  access to accounts / data loss of the user. This issue is patched in commit bd80ba833b9023d39ca22e29874296c8729dd53b.
  No action necessary for users of `subjective.report`, and anyone running their own instance
  should update to this commit or newer as soon as possible. As a workaround, someone running
  their own instance may apply the patch manually.'
