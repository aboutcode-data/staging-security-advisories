aliases: []
summary: AIOHTTP is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. Versions
  3.13.2 and below allow a request to be crafted in such a way that an AIOHTTP server's memory
  fills up uncontrollably during processing. If an application includes a handler that uses
  the Request.post() method, an attacker may be able to freeze the server by exhausting the
  memory. This issue is fixed in version 3.13.3.
