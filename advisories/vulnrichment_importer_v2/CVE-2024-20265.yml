aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the boot process of Cisco Access Point (AP) Software could allow\
  \ an unauthenticated, physical attacker to bypass the Cisco Secure Boot functionality and\
  \ load a software image that has been tampered with on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability\
  \ exists because unnecessary commands are available during boot time at the physical console.\
  \ An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by interrupting the boot process and executing\
  \ specific commands to bypass the Cisco Secure Boot validation checks and load an image that\
  \ has been tampered with. This image would have been previously downloaded onto the targeted\
  \ device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to load the image once. The Cisco\
  \ Secure Boot functionality is not permanently compromised."
