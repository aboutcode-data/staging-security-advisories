aliases: []
summary: An authorization bypass in b2evolution allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to
  predict password reset tokens for any user through the use of a bad randomness function. This
  allows the attacker to get valid sessions for arbitrary users, and optionally reset their
  password. Tested and confirmed in a default installation of version 7.2.3. Earlier versions
  are affected, possibly earlier major versions as well.
