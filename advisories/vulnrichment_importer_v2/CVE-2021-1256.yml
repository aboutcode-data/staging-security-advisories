aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow
  an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite files on the file system of an affected device
  by using directory traversal techniques. A successful exploit could cause system instability
  if important system files are overwritten. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation
  of user input for the file path in a specific CLI command. An attacker could exploit this
  vulnerability by logging in to a targeted device and issuing a specific CLI command with crafted
  user input. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on
  the file system of the affected device. The attacker would need valid user credentials on
  the device.
