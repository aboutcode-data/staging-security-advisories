aliases: []
summary: Elrond-GO is a go implementation for the Elrond Network protocol. Versions prior to
  1.3.50 are subject to a processing issue where nodes are affected when trying to process a
  cross-shard relayed transaction with a smart contract deploy transaction data. The problem
  was a bad correlation between the transaction caches and the processing component. If the
  above-mentioned transaction was sent with more gas than required, the smart contract result
  (SCR transaction) that should have returned the leftover gas, would have been wrongly added
  to a cache that the processing unit did not consider. The node stopped notarizing metachain
  blocks. The fix was actually to extend the SCR transaction search in all other caches if it
  wasn't found in the correct (expected) sharded-cache. There are no known workarounds at this
  time. This issue has been patched in version 1.3.50.
