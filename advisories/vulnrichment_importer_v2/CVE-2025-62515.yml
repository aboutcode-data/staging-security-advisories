aliases: []
summary: pyquokka is a framework for making data lakes work for time series. In versions 0.3.1
  and prior, the FlightServer class directly uses pickle.loads() to deserialize action bodies
  received from Flight clients without any sanitization or validation in the do_action() method.
  The vulnerable code is located in pyquokka/flight.py at line 283 where arbitrary data from
  Flight clients is directly passed to pickle.loads(). When FlightServer is configured to listen
  on 0.0.0.0, this allows attackers across the entire network to perform arbitrary remote code
  execution by sending malicious pickled payloads through the set_configs action. Additional
  vulnerability points exist in the cache_garbage_collect, do_put, and do_get functions where
  pickle.loads is used to deserialize untrusted remote data.
