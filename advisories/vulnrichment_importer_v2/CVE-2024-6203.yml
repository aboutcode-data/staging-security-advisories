aliases: []
summary: HaloITSM versions up to 2.146.1 are affected by a Password Reset Poisoning vulnerability.
  Poisoned password reset links can be sent to existing HaloITSM users (given their email address
  is known). When these poisoned links get accessed (e.g. manually by the victim or automatically
  by an email client software), the password reset token is leaked to the malicious actor, allowing
  them to set a new password for the victim's account.This potentially leads to account takeover
  attacks.HaloITSM versions past 2.146.1 (and patches starting from 2.143.61 ) fix the mentioned
  vulnerability.
