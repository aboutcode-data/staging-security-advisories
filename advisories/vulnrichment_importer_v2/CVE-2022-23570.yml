summary: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. When decoding a tensor from
  protobuf, TensorFlow might do a null-dereference if attributes of some mutable arguments to
  some operations are missing from the proto. This is guarded by a `DCHECK`. However, `DCHECK`
  is a no-op in production builds and an assertion failure in debug builds. In the first case
  execution proceeds to the dereferencing of the null pointer, whereas in the second case it
  results in a crash due to the assertion failure. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0.
  We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, and TensorFlow 2.6.3, as these are
  also affected and still in supported range.
