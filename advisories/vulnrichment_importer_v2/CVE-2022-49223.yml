  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  cxl/port: Hold port reference until decoder release

  KASAN + DEBUG_KOBJECT_RELEASE reports a potential use-after-free in
  cxl_decoder_release() where it goes to reference its parent, a cxl_port,
  to free its id back to port->decoder_ida.

   BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in to_cxl_port+0x18/0x90 [cxl_core]
   Read of size 8 at addr ffff888119270908 by task kworker/35:2/379

  The device core only guarantees parent lifetime until all children are
  unregistered. If a child needs a parent to complete its ->release()
  callback that child needs to hold a reference to extend the lifetime of
  the parent.
