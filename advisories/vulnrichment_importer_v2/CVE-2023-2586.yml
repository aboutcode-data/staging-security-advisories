aliases: []
summary: Teltonika’s Remote Management System versions 4.14.0 is vulnerable to an unauthorized
  attacker registering previously unregistered devices through the RMS platform. If the user
  has not disabled the "RMS management feature" enabled by default, then an attacker could register
  that device to themselves. This could enable the attacker to perform different operations
  on the user's devices, including remote code execution with 'root' privileges (using the 'Task
  Manager' feature on RMS).
