  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  x86/kvm: Teardown PV features on boot CPU as well

  Various PV features (Async PF, PV EOI, steal time) work through memory
  shared with hypervisor and when we restore from hibernation we must
  properly teardown all these features to make sure hypervisor doesn't
  write to stale locations after we jump to the previously hibernated kernel
  (which can try to place anything there). For secondary CPUs the job is
  already done by kvm_cpu_down_prepare(), register syscore ops to do
  the same for boot CPU.
