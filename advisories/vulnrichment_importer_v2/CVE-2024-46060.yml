aliases: []
summary: Anaconda3 macOS installers before 2024.06-1 contain a local privilege escalation vulnerability
  when installed outside the user's home directory. During installation, world-writable files
  are created and executed with root privileges. This allows a local low-privileged user to
  inject arbitrary commands, leading to code execution as the root user.
