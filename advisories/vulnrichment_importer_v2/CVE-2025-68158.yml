aliases: []
summary: Authlib is a Python library which builds OAuth and OpenID Connect servers. In version
  1.6.5 and prior, cache-backed state/request-token storage is not tied to the initiating user
  session, so CSRF is possible for any attacker that has a valid state (easily obtainable via
  an attacker-initiated authentication flow). When a cache is supplied to the OAuth client registry,
  FrameworkIntegration.set_state_data writes the entire state blob under _state_{app}_{state},
  and get_state_data ignores the caller’s session altogether. This issue has been patched in
  version 1.6.6.
