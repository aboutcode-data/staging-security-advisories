aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Cisco Fabric Services component of Cisco FXOS Software and
  Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to read sensitive memory
  content, create a denial of service (DoS) condition, or execute arbitrary code as root. The
  vulnerability exists because the affected software insufficiently validates Cisco Fabric Services
  packet headers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Cisco Fabric
  Services packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause
  a buffer overflow or buffer overread condition in the Cisco Fabric Services component, which
  could allow the attacker to read sensitive memory content, create a DoS condition, or execute
  arbitrary code as root. This vulnerability affects the following if configured to use Cisco
  Fabric Services: Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewalls, Firepower 9300 Security
  Appliance, MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches, Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders, Nexus
  3000 Series Switches, Nexus 3500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5600
  Platform Switches, Nexus 6000 Series Switches, Nexus 7000 Series Switches, Nexus 7700 Series
  Switches, Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode, Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards
  and Fabric Modules, UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnects, UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects,
  UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd69951, CSCve02459, CSCve02461, CSCve02463,
  CSCve02474, CSCve04859.'
