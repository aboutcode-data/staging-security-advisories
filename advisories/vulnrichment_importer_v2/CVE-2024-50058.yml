  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  serial: protect uart_port_dtr_rts() in uart_shutdown() too

  Commit af224ca2df29 (serial: core: Prevent unsafe uart port access, part
  3) added few uport == NULL checks. It added one to uart_shutdown(), so
  the commit assumes, uport can be NULL in there. But right after that
  protection, there is an unprotected "uart_port_dtr_rts(uport, false);"
  call. That is invoked only if HUPCL is set, so I assume that is the
  reason why we do not see lots of these reports.

  Or it cannot be NULL at this point at all for some reason :P.

  Until the above is investigated, stay on the safe side and move this
  dereference to the if too.

  I got this inconsistency from Coverity under CID 1585130. Thanks.
