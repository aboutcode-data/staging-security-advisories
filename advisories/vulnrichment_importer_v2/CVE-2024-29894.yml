aliases: []
summary: Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework. Versions of
  Cacti prior to 1.2.27 contain a residual cross-site scripting vulnerability caused by an incomplete
  fix for CVE-2023-50250. `raise_message_javascript` from `lib/functions.php` now uses purify.js
  to fix CVE-2023-50250 (among others). However, it still generates the code out of unescaped
  PHP variables `$title` and `$header`. If those variables contain single quotes, they can be
  used to inject JavaScript code. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could execute actions
  on behalf of other users. This ability to impersonate users could lead to unauthorized changes
  to settings. Version 1.2.27 fixes this issue.
