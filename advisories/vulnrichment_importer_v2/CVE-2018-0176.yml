aliases: []
summary: 'Multiple vulnerabilities in the CLI parser of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an
  authenticated, local attacker to gain access to the underlying Linux shell of an affected
  device and execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the device. The vulnerabilities
  are due to the affected software improperly sanitizing command arguments to prevent access
  to internal data structures on a device. An attacker who has user EXEC mode (privilege level
  1) access to an affected device could exploit these vulnerabilities on the device by executing
  CLI commands that contain crafted arguments. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to gain access to the underlying Linux shell of the affected device and execute arbitrary
  commands with root privileges on the device. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCtw85441, CSCus42252, CSCuv95370.'
