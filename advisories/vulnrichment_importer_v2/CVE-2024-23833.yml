aliases: []
summary: OpenRefine is a free, open source power tool for working with messy data and improving
  it. A jdbc attack vulnerability exists in OpenRefine(version<=3.7.7) where an attacker may
  construct a JDBC query which may read files on the host filesystem. Due to the newer MySQL
  driver library in the latest version of OpenRefine (8.0.30), there is no associated deserialization
  utilization point, so original code execution cannot be achieved, but attackers can use this
  vulnerability to read sensitive files on the target server. This issue has been addressed
  in version 3.7.8. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
