aliases: []
summary: webfinger.js is a TypeScript-based WebFinger client that runs in both browsers and
  Node.js environments. In versions 2.8.0 and below, the lookup function accepts user addresses
  for account checking. However, the ActivityPub specification requires preventing access to
  localhost services in production. This library does not prevent localhost access, only checking
  for hosts that start with "localhost" and end with a port. Users can exploit this by creating
  servers that send GET requests with controlled host, path, and port parameters to query services
  on the instance's host or local network, enabling blind SSRF attacks. This is fixed in version
  2.8.1.
