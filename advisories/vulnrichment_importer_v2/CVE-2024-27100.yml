aliases: []
summary: Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. In affected versions
  the endpoints for suspending users, silencing users and exporting CSV files weren't enforcing
  limits on the sizes of the parameters that they accept. This could lead to excessive resource
  consumption which could render an instance inoperable. A site could be disrupted by either
  a malicious moderator on the same site or a malicious staff member on another site in the
  same multisite cluster. This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed
  versions of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
  vulnerability.
