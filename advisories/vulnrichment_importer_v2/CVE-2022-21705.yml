aliases: []
summary: Octobercms is a self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. In affected
  versions user input was not properly sanitized before rendering. An authenticated user with
  the permissions to create, modify and delete website pages can exploit this vulnerability
  to bypass `cms.safe_mode` / `cms.enableSafeMode` in order to execute arbitrary code. This
  issue only affects admin panels that rely on safe mode and restricted permissions. To exploit
  this vulnerability, an attacker must first have access to the backend area. The issue has
  been patched in Build 474 (v1.0.474) and v1.1.10. Users unable to upgrade should apply https://github.com/octobercms/library/commit/c393c5ce9ca2c5acc3ed6c9bb0dab5ffd61965fe
  to your installation manually.
