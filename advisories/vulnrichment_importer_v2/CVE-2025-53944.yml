aliases: []
summary: AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create, deploy, and manage continuous artificial
  intelligence agents. In v0.6.15 and below, the external API's get_graph_execution_results
  endpoint has an authorization bypass vulnerability. While it correctly validates user access
  to the graph_id, it fails to verify ownership of the graph_exec_id parameter, allowing authenticated
  users to access any execution results by providing arbitrary execution IDs. The internal API
  implements proper validation for both parameters. This is fixed in v0.6.16.
