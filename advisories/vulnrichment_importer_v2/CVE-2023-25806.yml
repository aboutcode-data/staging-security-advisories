summary: OpenSearch Security is a plugin for OpenSearch that offers encryption, authentication
  and authorization. There is an observable discrepancy in the authentication response time
  between calls where the user provided exists and calls where it does not. This issue only
  affects calls using the internal basic identity provider (IdP), and not other externally configured
  IdPs. Patches were released in versions 1.3.9 and 2.6.0, there are no workarounds.
