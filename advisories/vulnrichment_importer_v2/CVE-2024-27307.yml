aliases: []
summary: JSONata is a JSON query and transformation language. Starting in version 1.4.0 and
  prior to version 1.8.7 and 2.0.4, a malicious expression can use the transform operator to
  override properties on the `Object` constructor and prototype. This may lead to denial of
  service, remote code execution or other unexpected behavior in applications that evaluate
  user-provided JSONata expressions. This issue has been fixed in JSONata versions 1.8.7 and
  2.0.4. Applications that evaluate user-provided expressions should update ASAP to prevent
  exploitation. As a workaround, one may apply the patch manually.
