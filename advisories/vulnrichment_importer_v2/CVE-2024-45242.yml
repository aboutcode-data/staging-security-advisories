summary: EnGenius ENH1350EXT A8J-ENH1350EXT devices through 3.9.3.2_c1.9.51 allow (blind) OS
  Command Injection via shell metacharacters to the Ping or Speed Test utility. During the time

  Wi-Fi network can exploit this window of time to execute arbitrary OS commands with root-level
  permissions.
