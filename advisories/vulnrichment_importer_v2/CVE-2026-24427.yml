aliases: []
summary: Shenzhen Tenda AC7 firmware version V03.03.03.01_cn and prior expose sensitive information
  in web management responses. Administrative credentials, including the router and/or admin
  panel password, are included in plaintext within configuration response bodies. In addition,
  responses lack appropriate Cache-Control directives, which may permit web browsers to cache
  pages containing these credentials and enable subsequent disclosure to an attacker with access
  to the client system or browser profile.
