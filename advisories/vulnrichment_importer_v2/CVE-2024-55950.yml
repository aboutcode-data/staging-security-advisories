aliases: []
summary: Tabby (formerly Terminus) is a highly configurable terminal emulator. Prior to 1.0.216,
  Tabby terminal emulator contains overly permissive entitlements that are unnecessary for its
  core functionality and plugin system, creating potential security vulnerabilities. The application
  currently holds powerful permissions including camera, microphone access, and the ability
  to access personal folders (Downloads, Documents, etc.) through Apple Events, while also maintaining
  dangerous entitlements that enable code injection. The concerning entitlements are com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables
  and com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation. Since Tabby's plugins and themes are
  NodeJS-based without native libraries or frameworks, and no environment variables are used
  in the codebase, it is recommended to review and remove at least one of the entitlements (com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation
  or com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables) to prevent DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES
  injection while maintaining full application functionality. This vulnerability is fixed in
  1.0.216.
