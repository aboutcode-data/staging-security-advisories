aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in HashiCorp Vault and Vault Enterprise before 1.11.3. A vulnerability
  in the Identity Engine was found where, in a deployment where an entity has multiple mount
  accessors with shared alias names, Vault may overwrite metadata to the wrong alias due to
  an issue with checking the proper alias assigned to an entity. This may allow for unintended
  access to key/value paths using that metadata in Vault.
