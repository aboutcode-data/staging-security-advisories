aliases: []
summary: OrangeHRM is a comprehensive human resource management (HRM) system. From version 5.0
  to 5.7, the application’s recruitment attachment retrieval endpoint does not enforce the required
  authorization checks before serving candidate files. Even users restricted to ESS-level access,
  who have no permission to view the Recruitment module, can directly access candidate attachment
  URLs. When an authenticated request is made to the attachment endpoint, the system validates
  the session but does not confirm that the requesting user has the necessary recruitment permissions.
  As a result, any authenticated user can download CVs and other uploaded documents for arbitrary
  candidates by issuing direct requests to the attachment endpoint, leading to unauthorized
  exposure of sensitive applicant data. This issue has been patched in version 5.8.
