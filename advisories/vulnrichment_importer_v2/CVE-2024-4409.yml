summary: The WP-ViperGB plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.6.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation

  the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
  performing an action such as clicking on a link.
