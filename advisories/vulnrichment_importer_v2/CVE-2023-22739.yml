summary: Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. Versions prior to 3.0.1
  (stable), 3.1.0.beta2 (beta), and 3.1.0.beta2 (tests-passed) are subject to Allocation of
  Resources Without Limits or Throttling. As there is no limit on data contained in a draft,
  a malicious user can create an arbitrarily large draft, forcing the instance to a crawl. This
  issue is patched in versions 3.0.1 (stable), 3.1.0.beta2 (beta), and 3.1.0.beta2 (tests-passed).
  There are no workarounds.
