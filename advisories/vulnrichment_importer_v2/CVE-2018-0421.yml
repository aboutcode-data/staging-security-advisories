aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in TCP connection management in Cisco Prime Access Registrar could
  allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition when
  the application unexpectedly restarts. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of incoming
  TCP SYN packets to specific listening ports. The improper handling of the TCP SYN packets
  could cause a system file description to be allocated and not freed. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by sending a crafted stream of TCP SYN packets to the application. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to cause the application to eventually restart if a file
  description cannot be obtained.
