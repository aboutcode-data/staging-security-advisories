aliases: []
summary: Nextcloud Server is a self hosted personal cloud system. MD5 hashes were used to check
  background jobs for their uniqueness. This increased the chances of a background job with
  arguments falsely being identified as already existing and not be queued for execution. By
  changing the Hash to SHA256 the probability was heavily decreased. It is recommended that
  the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 28.0.10, 29.0.7 or 30.0.0.
