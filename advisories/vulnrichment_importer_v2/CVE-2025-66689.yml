aliases: []
summary: A path traversal vulnerability exists in Zen MCP Server before 9.8.2 that allows authenticated
  attackers to read arbitrary files on the system. The vulnerability is caused by flawed logic
  in the is_dangerous_path() validation function that uses exact string matching against a blacklist
  of system directories. Attackers can bypass these restrictions by accessing subdirectories
  of blacklisted paths.
