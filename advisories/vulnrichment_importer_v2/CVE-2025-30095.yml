aliases: []
summary: VyOS 1.3 through 1.5 (fixed in 1.4.2) or any Debian-based system using dropbear in
  combination with live-build has the same Dropbear private host keys across different installations.
  Thus, an attacker can conduct active man-in-the-middle attacks against SSH connections if
  Dropbear is enabled as the SSH daemon. I n VyOS, this is not the default configuration for
  the system SSH daemon, but is for the console service. To mitigate this, one can run "rm -f
  /etc/dropbear/*key*" and/or "rm -f /etc/dropbear-initramfs/*key*" and then dropbearkey -t
  rsa -s 4096 -f /etc/dropbear_rsa_host_key and reload the service or reboot the system before
  using Dropbear as the SSH daemon (this clears out all keys mistakenly built into the release
  image) or update to the latest version of VyOS 1.4 or 1.5. Note that this vulnerability is
  not unique to VyOS and may appear in any Debian-based Linux distribution that uses Dropbear
  in combination with live-build, which has a safeguard against this behavior in OpenSSH but
  no equivalent one for Dropbear.
