aliases: []
summary: Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. Claude Code extensions in VSCode and forks (e.g.,
  Cursor, Windsurf, and VSCodium) and JetBrains IDEs (e.g., IntelliJ, Pycharm, and Android Studio)
  are vulnerable to unauthorized websocket connections from an attacker when visiting attacker-controlled
  webpages. Claude Code for VSCode IDE extensions versions 0.2.116 through 1.0.23 are vulnerable.
  For Jetbrains IDE plugins, Claude Code [beta] versions 0.1.1 through 0.1.8 are vulnerable.
  In VSCode (and forks), exploitation would allow an attacker to read arbitrary files, see the
  list of files open in the IDE, get selection and diagnostics events from the IDE, or execute
  code in limited situations where a user has an open Jupyter Notebook and accepts a malicious
  prompt. In JetBrains IDEs, an attacker could get selection events, a list of open files, and
  a list of syntax errors. Claude released a patch for this issue on June 13th, 2025. Although
  Claude Code auto-updates when a user launch it and auto-updates the extensions, users should
  take the following steps, though the exact steps depend on one's integrated development environment
  (IDE). For VSCode, Cursor, Windsurf, VSCodium, and other VSCode forks, check the extension
  Claude Code for VSCode. Open the list of Extensions (View->Extensions), look for Claude Code
  for VSCode among installed extensions, update or uninstall any version prior to 1.0.24, and
  restart the IDE. For JetBrains IDEs including IntelliJ, PyCharm, and Android Studio, check
  the plugin Claude Code [Beta]. Open the Plugins list, look for Claude Code [Beta] among installed
  extensions, update or uninstall any version prior to 0.1.9, and restart the IDE.
