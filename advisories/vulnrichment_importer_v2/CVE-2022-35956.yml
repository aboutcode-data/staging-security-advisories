aliases: []
summary: This Rails gem adds two methods to the ActiveRecord::Base class that allow you to update
  many records on a single database hit, using a case sql statement for it. Before version 0.1.3
  `update_by_case` gem used custom sql strings, and it was not sanitized, making it vulnerable
  to sql injection. Upgrade to version >= 0.1.3 that uses `Arel` instead to construct the resulting
  sql statement, with sanitized sql.
