aliases: []
summary: JumpServer is an open source bastion host and an operation and maintenance security
  audit system. Prior to v3.10.21-lts and v4.10.12-lts, a low-privileged authenticated user
  can invoke LDAP configuration tests and start LDAP synchronization by sending crafted messages
  to the /ws/ldap/ WebSocket endpoint, bypassing authorization checks and potentially exposing
  LDAP credentials or causing unintended sync operations. This vulnerability is fixed in v3.10.21-lts
  and v4.10.12-lts.
