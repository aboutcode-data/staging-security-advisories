aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Disk Check Tool (disk-check.sh) for Cisco Wide Area Application
  Services (WAAS) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate their privilege
  level to root. The attacker must have valid user credentials with super user privileges (level
  15) to log in to the device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of script
  files executed in the context of the Disk Check Tool. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by replacing one script file with a malicious script file while the affected tool is running.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain root-level privileges and take full
  control of the device. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvi72673.'
