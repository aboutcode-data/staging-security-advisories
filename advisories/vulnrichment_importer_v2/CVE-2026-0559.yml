summary: The MasterStudy LMS WordPress Plugin – for Online Courses and Education plugin for
  WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'stm_lms_courses_grid_display'
  shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 3.7.11 due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with contributor level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
  that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
