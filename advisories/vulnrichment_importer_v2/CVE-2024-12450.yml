aliases: []
summary: In infiniflow/ragflow versions 0.12.0, the `web_crawl` function in `document_app.py`
  contains multiple vulnerabilities. The function does not filter URL parameters, allowing attackers
  to exploit Full Read SSRF by accessing internal network addresses and viewing their content
  through the generated PDF files. Additionally, the lack of restrictions on the file protocol
  enables Arbitrary File Read, allowing attackers to read server files. Furthermore, the use
  of an outdated Chromium headless version with --no-sandbox mode enabled makes the application
  susceptible to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via known Chromium v8 vulnerabilities. These issues
  are resolved in version 0.14.0.
