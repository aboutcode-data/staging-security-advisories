aliases: []
summary: The Team Circle Image Slider With Lightbox plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery in version 1.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the
  circle_thumbnail_slider_with_lightbox_image_management_func() function. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to edit image data which can be used to inject malicious JavaScript,
  along with deleting images, and uploading malicious files via a forged request granted they
  can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
