aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Broadcom) LSI PCI-SV92EX Soft Modem Kernel Driver through
  2.2.100.1 (aka AGRSM64.sys). There is Local Privilege Escalation to SYSTEM via a Stack Overflow
  in RTLCopyMemory (IOCTL 0x1b2150). An attacker can exploit this to elevate privileges from
  a medium-integrity process to SYSTEM. This can also be used to bypass kernel-level protections
  such as AV or PPL, because exploit code runs with high-integrity privileges and can be used
  in coordinated BYOVD (bring your own vulnerable driver) ransomware campaigns.
