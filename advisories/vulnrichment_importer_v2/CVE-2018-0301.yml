  remote attacker to craft a packet to the management interface on an affected system, causing

  module of the NX-API subsystem. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a
  crafted HTTP or HTTPS packet to the management interface of an affected system with the NX-API
  feature enabled. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as root. Note:
