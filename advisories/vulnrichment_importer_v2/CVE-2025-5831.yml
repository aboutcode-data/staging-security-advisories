aliases: []
summary: The Droip plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing
  file type validation in the make_google_font_offline() function in all versions up to, and
  including, 2.2.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
  access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote
  code execution possible.
