summary: 'An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the backup configuration process
  where the SAS token is not masked in the configuration response. This oversight results in
  sensitive information leakage within the yb_backup log files, exposing the SAS token in plaintext.
  The leakage occurs during the backup procedure, leading to potential unauthorized access to
  resources associated with the SAS token. This issue affects YugabyteDB Anywhere: from 2.20.0.0
  before 2.20.7.0, from 2.23.0.0 before 2.23.1.0, from 2024.1.0.0 before 2024.1.3.0.'
