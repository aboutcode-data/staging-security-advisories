aliases: []
summary: "The underlying feedback mechanism of \n\nRockwell Automation's FactoryTalk System\
  \ Services that transfers the FactoryTalk Policy Manager rules to relevant devices on the\
  \ network does not verify that the origin of the communication is from a legitimate local\
  \ client device.  This may allow a threat actor to craft a malicious website that, when visited,\
  \ will send a malicious script that can connect to the local WebSocket endpoint and wait for\
  \ events as if it was a valid client device. If successfully exploited, this would allow a\
  \ threat actor to receive information including whether FactoryTalk Policy Manager is installed\
  \ and potentially the entire security policy."
