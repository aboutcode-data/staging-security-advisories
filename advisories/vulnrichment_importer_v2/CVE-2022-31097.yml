aliases: []
summary: Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Versions on the
  8.x and 9.x branch prior to 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10 are vulnerable to stored cross-site
  scripting via the Unified Alerting feature of Grafana. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability
  to escalate privilege from editor to admin by tricking an authenticated admin to click on
  a link. Versions 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10 contain a patch. As a workaround, it is
  possible to disable alerting or use legacy alerting.
