summary: The Shortcodes and extra features for Phlox theme plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's aux_contact_box and aux_gmaps shortcodes in
  all versions up to, and including, 2.16.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
  escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
  execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
