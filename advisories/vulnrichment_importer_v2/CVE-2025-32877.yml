aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered on COROS PACE 3 devices through 3.0808.0. It identifies itself
  as a device without input or output capabilities, which results in the use of the Just Works
  pairing method. This method does not implement any authentication, which therefore allows
  machine-in-the-middle attacks. Furthermore, this lack of authentication allows attackers to
  interact with the device via BLE without requiring prior authorization.
