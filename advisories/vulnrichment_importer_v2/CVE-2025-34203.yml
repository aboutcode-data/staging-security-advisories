aliases: []
summary: 'Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host versions prior to 22.0.1002
  and Application versions prior to 20.0.2614 (VA and SaaS deployments) contain multiple Docker
  containers that include outdated, end-of-life, unsupported, or otherwise vulnerable third-party
  components (examples: Nginx 1.17.x, OpenSSL 1.1.1d, various EOL Alpine/Debian/Ubuntu base
  images, and EOL Laravel/PHP libraries). These components are present across many container
  images and increase the product''s attack surface, enabling exploitation chains when leveraged
  by an attacker. Multiple distinct EOL versions and unpatched libraries across containers;
  Nginx binaries date from 2019 in several images and Laravel versions observed include EOL
  releases (for example Laravel 5.5.x, 5.7.x, 5.8.x). This vulnerability has been identified
  by the vendor as: V-2024-014 — Outdated Dependencies.'
