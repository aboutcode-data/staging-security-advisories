aliases: []
summary: Rapid7 InsightVM Console versions below 6.6.260 suffer from a protection mechanism
  failure whereby an attacker with network access to the InsightVM Console can cause it to overload
  or crash by sending repeated invalid REST requests in a short timeframe, to the Console's
  port 443 causing the console to enter an exception handling logging loop, exhausting the CPU.  There
  is no indication that an attacker can use this method to escalate privilege, acquire unauthorized
  access to data, or gain control of protected resources. This issue is fixed in version 6.6.261.
