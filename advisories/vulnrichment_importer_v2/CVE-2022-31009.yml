aliases: []
summary: wire-ios is an iOS client for the Wire secure messaging application. Invalid accent
  colors of Wire communication partners may render the iOS Wire Client partially unusable by
  causing it to crash multiple times on launch. These invalid accent colors can be used by and
  sent between Wire users. The root cause was an unnecessary assert statement when converting
  an integer value into the corresponding enum value, causing an exception instead of a fallback
  to a default value. This issue is fixed in [wire-ios](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios/commit/caa0e27dbe51f9edfda8c7a9f017d93b8cfddefb)
  and in Wire for iOS 3.100. There is no workaround available, but users may use other Wire
  clients (such as the [web app](https://app.wire.com)) to continue using Wire, or upgrade their
  client.
