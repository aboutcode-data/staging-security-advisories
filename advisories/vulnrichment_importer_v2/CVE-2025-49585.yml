aliases: []
summary: XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions before 15.10.16, 16.0.0-rc-1 through
  16.4.6, and 16.5.0-rc-1 through 16.10.1, when an attacker without script or programming right
  creates an XClass definition in XWiki (requires edit right), and that same document is later
  edited by a user with script, admin, or programming right, malicious code could be executed
  with the rights of the editing user without prior warning. In particular, this concerns custom
  display code, the script of computed properties and queries in database list properties. Note
  that warnings before editing documents with dangerous properties have only been introduced
  in XWiki 15.9, before that version, this was a known issue and the advice was simply to be
  careful. This has been patched in XWiki 16.10.2, 16.4.7 and 15.10.16 by adding an analysis
  for the respective XClass properties.
