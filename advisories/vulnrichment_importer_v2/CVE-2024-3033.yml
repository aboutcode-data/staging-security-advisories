aliases: []
summary: An improper authorization vulnerability exists in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm application,
  specifically within the '/api/v/' endpoint and its sub-routes. This flaw allows unauthenticated
  users to perform destructive actions on the VectorDB, including resetting the database and
  deleting specific namespaces, without requiring any authorization or permissions. The issue
  affects all versions up to and including the latest version, with a fix introduced in version
  1.0.0. Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to complete data loss of document embeddings
  across all workspaces, rendering workspace chats and embeddable chat widgets non-functional.
  Additionally, attackers can list all namespaces, potentially exposing private workspace names.
