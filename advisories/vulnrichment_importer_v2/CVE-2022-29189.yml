aliases: []
summary: Pion DTLS is a Go implementation of Datagram Transport Layer Security. Prior to version
  2.1.4, a buffer that was used for inbound network traffic had no upper limit. Pion DTLS would
  buffer all network traffic from the remote user until the handshake completes or timed out.
  An attacker could exploit this to cause excessive memory usage. Version 2.1.4 contains a patch
  for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds available.
