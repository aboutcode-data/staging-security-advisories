advisory_id: CVE-2026-0895
datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2026-0895
datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2026/0xxx/CVE-2026-0895.json
aliases: []
summary: The extension extends TYPO3’ FileSpool component, which was vulnerable to Insecure
  Deserialization prior to  TYPO3-CORE-SA-2026-004 https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2026-004
  . Since the related fix is overwritten by the extension, using the extension with a patched
  TYPO3 core version still allows for Insecure Deserialization, because the affected vulnerable
  code was extracted from TYPO3 core to the extension. More information about this vulnerability
  can be found in the related TYPO3 Core Security Advisory  TYPO3-CORE-SA-2026-004 https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2026-004
