aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Evolved Programmable\
  \ Network Manager (EPNM) and Cisco Prime Infrastructure could allow an authenticated, low-privileged,\
  \ remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of\
  \ the interface.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface\
  \ does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by injecting malicious code into a specific page of the interface. A successful exploit\
  \ could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected\
  \ interface or access sensitive browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability,\
  \ the attacker must have at least a low-privileged account on an affected device."
