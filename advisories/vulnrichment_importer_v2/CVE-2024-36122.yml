aliases: []
summary: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.2.3 on the `stable`
  branch and version 3.3.0.beta4 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, moderators using
  the review queue to review users may see a users email address even when the Allow moderators
  to view email addresses setting is disabled. This issue is patched in version 3.2.3 on the
  `stable` branch and version 3.3.0.beta4 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. As possible
  workarounds, either prevent moderators from accessing the review queue or disable the approve
  suspect users site setting and the must approve users site setting to prevent users from being
  added to the review queue.
