aliases: []
summary: LiquidFiles filetransfer server is vulnerable to a user enumeration issue in its password
  reset functionality. The application returns distinguishable responses for valid and invalid
  email addresses, allowing unauthenticated attackers to determine the existence of user accounts.
  Version 4.2 introduces user-based lockout mechanisms to mitigate brute-force attacks, user
  enumeration remains possible by default. In versions prior to 4.2, no such user-level protection
  is in place, only basic IP-based rate limiting is enforced. This IP-based protection can be
  bypassed by distributing requests across multiple IPs (e.g., rotating IP or proxies). Effectively
  bypassing both login and password reset security controls. Successful exploitation allows
  an attacker to enumerate valid email addresses registered for the application, increasing
  the risk of follow-up attacks such as password spraying.
