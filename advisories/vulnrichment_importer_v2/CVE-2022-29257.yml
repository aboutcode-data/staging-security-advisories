aliases: []
summary: Electron is a framework for writing cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript
  (JS), HTML, and CSS. A vulnerability in versions prior to 18.0.0-beta.6, 17.2.0, 16.2.6, and
  15.5.5 allows attackers who have control over a given apps update server / update storage
  to serve maliciously crafted update packages that pass the code signing validation check but
  contain malicious code in some components. This kind of attack would require significant privileges
  in a potential victim's own auto updating infrastructure and the ease of that attack entirely
  depends on the potential victim's infrastructure security. Electron versions 18.0.0-beta.6,
  17.2.0, 16.2.6, and 15.5.5 contain a fix for this issue. There are no known workarounds.
