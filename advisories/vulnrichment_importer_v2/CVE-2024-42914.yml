aliases: []
summary: A host header injection vulnerability exists in the forgot password functionality of
  ArrowCMS version 1.0.0. By sending a specially crafted host header in the forgot password
  request, it is possible to send password reset links to users which, once clicked, lead to
  an attacker-controlled server and thus leak the password reset token. This may allow an attacker
  to reset other users' passwords.
