aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the ingress traffic manager of Cisco IOS XE Software for Cisco
  Network Convergence System (NCS) 520 Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition in the web management interface of an affected
  device. This vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of certain IPv4 TCP traffic that
  is destined to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
  a large number of crafted TCP packets to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to cause the web management interface to become unavailable, resulting in a DoS
  condition. Note: This vulnerability does not impact traffic that is going through the device
  or going to the Management Ethernet interface of the device.'
