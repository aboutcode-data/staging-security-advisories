aliases: []
summary: The mcp-database-server (MCP Server) 1.1.0 and earlier, as distributed via the npm
  package @executeautomation/database-server, fails to implement adequate security controls
  to properly enforce a "read-only" mode. This vulnerability affects only the npm distribution;
  other distributions are not impacted. As a result, the server is susceptible to abuse and
  attacks on affected database systems such as PostgreSQL, and potentially others that expose
  elevated functionalities. These attacks may lead to denial of service and other unexpected
  behaviors.
