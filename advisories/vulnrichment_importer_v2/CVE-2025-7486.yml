aliases: []
summary: The Ebook Store plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via
  the Order Details in all versions up to, and including, 5.8012 due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level
  access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
  an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
  has been disabled.
