aliases: []
summary: Docling Core (or docling-core) is a library that defines core data types and transformations
  in the document processing application Docling. A PyYAML-related Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  vulnerability, namely CVE-2020-14343, is exposed in docling-core starting in version 2.21.0
  and prior to version 2.48.4, specifically only if the application uses pyyaml prior to version
  5.4 and invokes `docling_core.types.doc.DoclingDocument.load_from_yaml()` passing it untrusted
  YAML data. The vulnerability has been patched in docling-core version 2.48.4. The fix mitigates
  the issue by switching `PyYAML` deserialization from `yaml.FullLoader` to `yaml.SafeLoader`,
  ensuring that untrusted data cannot trigger code execution. Users who cannot immediately upgrade
  docling-core can alternatively ensure that the installed version of PyYAML is 5.4 or greater.
