summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications
  built on top of it. The rollback action is missing a right protection, a user can rollback
  to a previous version of the page to gain rights they don't have anymore. The problem has
  been patched in XWiki 14.10.17, 15.5.3 and 15.8-rc-1 by ensuring that the rights are checked
  before performing the rollback.
