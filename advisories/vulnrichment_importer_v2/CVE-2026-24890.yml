aliases: []
summary: OpenEMR is a free and open source electronic health records and medical practice management
  application. Prior to version 8.0.0, an authorization bypass vulnerability in the patient
  portal signature endpoint allows authenticated portal users to upload and overwrite provider
  signatures by setting `type=admin-signature` and specifying any provider user ID. This could
  potentially lead to signature forgery on medical documents, legal compliance violations, and
  fraud. The issue occurs when portal users are allowed to modify provider signatures without
  proper authorization checks. Version 8.0.0 fixes the issue.
