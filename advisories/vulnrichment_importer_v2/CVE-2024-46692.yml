  firmware: qcom: scm: Mark get_wq_ctx() as atomic call

  Currently get_wq_ctx() is wrongly configured as a standard call. When two
  SMC calls are in sleep and one SMC wakes up, it calls get_wq_ctx() to
  resume the corresponding sleeping thread. But if get_wq_ctx() is
  interrupted, goes to sleep and another SMC call is waiting to be allocated
  a waitq context, it leads to a deadlock.

  To avoid this get_wq_ctx() must be an atomic call and can't be a standard
  SMC call. Hence mark get_wq_ctx() as a fast call.
