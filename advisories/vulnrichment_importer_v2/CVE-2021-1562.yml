summary: A vulnerability in the XSI-Actions interface of Cisco BroadWorks Application Server
  could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information on an affected
  system. This vulnerability is due to improper input validation and authorization of specific
  commands that a user can execute within the XSI-Actions interface. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device and issuing a specific set of commands.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to join a Call Center instance and have calls
  that they do not have permissions to access distributed to them from the Call Center queue.
  At the time of publication, Cisco had not released updates that address this vulnerability
  for Cisco BroadWorks Application Server. However, firmware patches are available.
