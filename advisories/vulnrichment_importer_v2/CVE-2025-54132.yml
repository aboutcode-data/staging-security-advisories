aliases: []
summary: Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. In versions below 1.3, Mermaid
  (which is used to render diagrams) allows embedding images which then get rendered by Cursor
  in the chat box. An attacker can use this to exfiltrate sensitive information to a third-party
  attacker controlled server through an image fetch after successfully performing a prompt injection.
  A malicious model (or hallucination/backdoor) might also trigger this exploit at will. This
  issue requires prompt injection from malicious data (web, image upload, source code) in order
  to exploit. In that case, it can send sensitive information to an attacker-controlled external
  server. This is fixed in version 1.3.
