aliases: []
summary: FreshRSS is a free, self-hostable RSS aggregator. Versions 1.26.3 and below contain
  a vulnerability where a specially crafted page can trick a user into executing arbitrary JS
  code or promoting a user in FreshRSS by obscuring UI elements in iframes. If embedding an
  authenticated iframe is possible, this may lead to privilege escalation via obscuring the
  promote user button in the admin UI or XSS by tricking the user to drag content into the UserJS
  text area. This is fixed in version 1.27.0
