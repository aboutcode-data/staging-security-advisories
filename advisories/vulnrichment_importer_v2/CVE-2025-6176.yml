aliases: []
summary: Scrapy versions up to 2.13.2 are vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due
  to a flaw in its brotli decompression implementation. The protection mechanism against decompression
  bombs fails to mitigate the brotli variant, allowing remote servers to crash clients with
  less than 80GB of available memory. This occurs because brotli can achieve extremely high
  compression ratios for zero-filled data, leading to excessive memory consumption during decompression.
