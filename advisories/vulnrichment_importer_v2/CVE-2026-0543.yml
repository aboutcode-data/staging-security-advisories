aliases: []
summary: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20) in Kibana's Email Connector can allow an attacker
  to cause an Excessive Allocation (CAPEC-130) through a specially crafted email address parameter.
  This requires an attacker to have authenticated access with view-level privileges sufficient
  to execute connector actions. The application attempts to process specially crafted email
  format, resulting in complete service unavailability for all users until manual restart is
  performed.
