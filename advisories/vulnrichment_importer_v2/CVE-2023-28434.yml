aliases: []
summary: Minio is a Multi-Cloud Object Storage framework. Prior to RELEASE.2023-03-20T20-16-18Z,
  an attacker can use crafted requests to bypass metadata bucket name checking and put an object
  into any bucket while processing `PostPolicyBucket`. To carry out this attack, the attacker
  requires credentials with `arn:aws:s3:::*` permission, as well as enabled Console API access.
  This issue has been patched in RELEASE.2023-03-20T20-16-18Z. As a workaround, enable browser
  API access and turn off `MINIO_BROWSER=off`.
