aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 Mobility and Multihoming Protocol
  (MOBIKE) feature for the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower
  Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory
  leak or a reload of an affected device that leads to a denial of service (DoS) condition.
  The vulnerability is due to the incorrect processing of certain MOBIKE packets. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted MOBIKE packets to an affected device to
  be processed. A successful exploit could cause an affected device to continuously consume
  memory and eventually reload, resulting in a DoS condition. The MOBIKE feature is supported
  only for IPv4 addresses.
