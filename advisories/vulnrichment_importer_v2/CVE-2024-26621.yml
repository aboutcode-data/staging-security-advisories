  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mm: huge_memory: don't force huge page alignment on 32 bit

  commit efa7df3e3bb5 ("mm: align larger anonymous mappings on THP
  boundaries") caused two issues [1] [2] reported on 32 bit system or compat
  userspace.

  It doesn't make too much sense to force huge page alignment on 32 bit
  system due to the constrained virtual address space.
