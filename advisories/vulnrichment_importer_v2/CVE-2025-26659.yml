summary: SAP NetWeaver Application Server ABAP does not sufficiently encode user-controlled

  with no privileges, to craft a malicious web message that exploits WEBGUI functionality. On
  successful exploitation, the malicious JavaScript payload executes in the scope of victim�s
  browser potentially compromising their data and/or manipulating browser content. This leads
  to a limited impact on confidentiality and integrity. There is no impact on availability
