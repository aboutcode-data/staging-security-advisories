aliases: []
summary: A Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability exists in the gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt
  application, specifically within the functionality for uploading chat history. The vulnerability
  arises due to improper input validation when handling file paths during the chat history upload
  process. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by intercepting requests and manipulating
  the 'name' parameter to specify arbitrary file paths. This allows the attacker to read sensitive
  files on the server, leading to information leakage, including API keys and private information.
  The issue affects version 20240310 of the application.
