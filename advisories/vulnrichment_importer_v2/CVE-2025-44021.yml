aliases: []
summary: OpenStack Ironic before 29.0.1 can write unintended files to a target node disk during
  image handling (if a deployment was performed via the API). A malicious project assigned as
  a node owner can provide a path to any local file (readable by ironic-conductor), which may
  then be written to the target node disk. This is difficult to exploit in practice, because
  a node deployed in this manner should never reach the ACTIVE state, but it still represents
  a danger in environments running with non-default, insecure configurations such as with automated
  cleaning disabled. The fixed versions are 24.1.3, 26.1.1, and 29.0.1.
