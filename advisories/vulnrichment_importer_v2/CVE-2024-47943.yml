aliases: []
summary: "The firmware upgrade function in the admin web interface of the Rittal IoT Interface\
  \ & CMC III Processing Unit devices checks if \nthe patch files are signed before executing\
  \ the containing run.sh \nscript. The signing process is kind of an HMAC with a long string\
  \ as key\n which is hard-coded in the firmware and is freely available for \ndownload. This\
  \ allows crafting malicious \"signed\" .patch files in order \nto compromise the device and\
  \ execute arbitrary code."
