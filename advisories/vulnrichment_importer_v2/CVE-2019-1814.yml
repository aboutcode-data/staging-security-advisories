aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the interactions between the DHCP and TFTP features for Cisco Small
  Business 300 Series (Sx300) Managed Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to cause the device to become low on system memory, which in turn could lead to an unexpected
  reload of the device and result in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.
  The vulnerability is due to a failure to free system memory when an unexpected DHCP request
  is received. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DHCP packet
  to the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected
  reload of the device.
