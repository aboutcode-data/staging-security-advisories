aliases: []
summary: The Frontend Login and Registration Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege
  escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.7. This is due to
  the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating a password. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to change
  arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to
  their account.
