aliases: []
summary: The All-in-One WP Migration and Backup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object
  Injection in all versions up to, and including, 7.89 via deserialization of untrusted input
  in the 'replace_serialized_values' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP
  chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could
  allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. An
  administrator must export and restore a backup in order to trigger the exploit.
