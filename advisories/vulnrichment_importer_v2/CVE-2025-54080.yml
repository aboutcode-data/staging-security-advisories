aliases: []
summary: Exiv2 is a C++ library and a command-line utility to read, write, delete and modify
  Exif, IPTC, XMP and ICC image metadata. An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2 versions
  0.28.5 and earlier. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata
  into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause
  a denial of service by crashing Exiv2, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on
  a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which
  is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. The bug is fixed in version
  0.28.6.
