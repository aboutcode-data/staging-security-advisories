aliases: []
summary: Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) is an interactive video and image annotation
  tool for computer vision. In versions starting from 2.4.0 to before 2.38.0, an authenticated
  CVAT user may be able to retrieve the IDs and names of all tasks, projects, labels, and the
  IDs of all jobs and quality reports on the CVAT instance. In addition, if the instance contains
  many resources of a particular type, retrieving this information may tie up system resources,
  denying access to legitimate users. This issue has been patched in version 2.38.0.
