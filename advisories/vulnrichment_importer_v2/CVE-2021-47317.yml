  powerpc/bpf: Fix detecting BPF atomic instructions

  Commit 91c960b0056672 ("bpf: Rename BPF_XADD and prepare to encode other
  atomics in .imm") converted BPF_XADD to BPF_ATOMIC and added a way to
  distinguish instructions based on the immediate field. Existing JIT
  implementations were updated to check for the immediate field and to
  reject programs utilizing anything more than BPF_ADD (such as BPF_FETCH)
  in the immediate field.

  However, the check added to powerpc64 JIT did not look at the correct
  BPF instruction. Due to this, such programs would be accepted and
  incorrectly JIT'ed resulting in soft lockups, as seen with the atomic
  bounds test. Fix this by looking at the correct immediate value.
