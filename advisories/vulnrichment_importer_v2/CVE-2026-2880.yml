aliases: []
summary: |
  A vulnerability in @fastify/middie versions < 9.2.0 can result in authentication/authorization bypass when using path-scoped middleware (for example, app.use('/secret', auth)).

  When Fastify router normalization options are enabled (such as ignoreDuplicateSlashes, useSemicolonDelimiter, and related trailing-slash behavior), crafted request paths may bypass middleware checks while still being routed to protected handlers.
