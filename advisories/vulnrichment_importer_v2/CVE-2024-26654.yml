  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ALSA: sh: aica: reorder cleanup operations to avoid UAF bugs

  The dreamcastcard->timer could schedule the spu_dma_work and the
  spu_dma_work could also arm the dreamcastcard->timer.

  When the snd_pcm_substream is closing, the aica_channel will be
  deallocated. But it could still be dereferenced in the worker
  thread. The reason is that del_timer() will return directly
  regardless of whether the timer handler is running or not and
  the worker could be rescheduled in the timer handler. As a result,
  the UAF bug will happen. The racy situation is shown below:

        (Thread 1)                 |      (Thread 2)
  snd_aicapcm_pcm_close()          |
   ...                             |  run_spu_dma() //worker
                                   |    mod_timer()
    flush_work()                   |
    del_timer()                    |  aica_period_elapsed() //timer
    kfree(dreamcastcard->channel)  |    schedule_work()
                                   |  run_spu_dma() //worker
    ...                            |    dreamcastcard->channel-> //USE

  In order to mitigate this bug and other possible corner cases,
  call mod_timer() conditionally in run_spu_dma(), then implement
  PCM sync_stop op to cancel both the timer and worker. The sync_stop
  op will be called from PCM core appropriately when needed.
