summary: "Relative Path Traversal vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.\n\nThe fix for bug 60013 introduced\
  \ a regression where the       rewritten URL was normalized before it was decoded. This introduced\
  \ the       possibility that, for rewrite rules that rewrite query parameters to the     \
  \  URL, an attacker could manipulate the request URI to bypass security       constraints\
  \ including the protection for /WEB-INF/ and /META-INF/. If PUT requests were also enabled\
  \ then malicious files could be uploaded leading to remote code execution. PUT requests are\
  \ normally limited to trusted users and it is considered unlikely that PUT requests would\
  \ be enabled in conjunction with a rewrite that manipulated the URI.\n\n\n\nThis issue affects\
  \ Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.10, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.44, from 9.0.0.M11\
  \ through 9.0.108.\n\nThe following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but\
  \ are \nknown to be affected: 8.5.6 though 8.5.100. Other, older, EOL versions may also be\
  \ affected.\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.11 or later, 10.1.45 or later\
  \ or 9.0.109 or later, which fix the issue."
