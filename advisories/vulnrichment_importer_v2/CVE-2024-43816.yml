  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  scsi: lpfc: Revise lpfc_prep_embed_io routine with proper endian macro usages

  On big endian architectures, it is possible to run into a memory out of
  bounds pointer dereference when FCP targets are zoned.

  In lpfc_prep_embed_io, the memcpy(ptr, fcp_cmnd, sgl->sge_len) is
  referencing a little endian formatted sgl->sge_len value.  So, the memcpy
  can cause big endian systems to crash.

  Redefine the *sgl ptr as a struct sli4_sge_le to make it clear that we are
  referring to a little endian formatted data structure.  And, update the
  routine with proper le32_to_cpu macro usages.
