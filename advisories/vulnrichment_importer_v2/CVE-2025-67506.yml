aliases: []
summary: PipesHub is a fully extensible workplace AI platform for enterprise search and workflow
  automation. Versions prior to 0.1.0-beta expose POST /api/v1/record/buffer/convert through
  missing authentication. The endpoint accepts a file upload and converts it to PDF via LibreOffice
  by uploading payload to os.path.join(tmpdir, file.filename) without normalizing the filename.
  An attacker can submit a crafted filename containing ../ sequences to write arbitrary files
  anywhere the service account has permission, enabling remote file overwrite or planting malicious
  code. This issue is fixed in version 0.1.0-beta.
