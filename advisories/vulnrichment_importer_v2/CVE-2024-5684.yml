aliases: []
summary: An attacker with access to the private network (the charger is connected to) or local
  access to the Ethernet-Interface can exploit a faulty implementation of the JWT-library in
  order to bypass the password authentication to the web configuration interface and then has
  full access as the user would have. However, an attacker will not have developer or admin
  rights. If the implementation of the JWT-library is wrongly configured to accept "none"-algorithms,
  the server will pass insecure JWT. A local, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability
  to bypass the authentication mechanism.
