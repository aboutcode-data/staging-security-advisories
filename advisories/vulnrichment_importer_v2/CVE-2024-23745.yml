aliases: []
summary: 'In Notion Web Clipper 1.0.3(7), a .nib file is susceptible to the Dirty NIB attack.
  NIB files can be manipulated to execute arbitrary commands. Additionally, even if a NIB file
  is modified within an application, Gatekeeper may still permit the execution of the application,
  enabling the execution of arbitrary commands within the application''s context. NOTE: the
  vendor''s perspective is that this is simply an instance of CVE-2022-48505, cannot properly
  be categorized as a product-level vulnerability, and cannot have a product-level fix because
  it is about incorrect caching of file signatures on macOS.'
