aliases: []
summary: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.0.6 of the `stable`
  branch and version 3.1.0.beta7 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, in multiple controller
  actions, Discourse accepts limit params but does not impose any upper bound on the values
  being accepted. Without an upper bound, the software may allow arbitrary users to generate
  DB queries which may end up exhausting the resources on the server. The issue is patched in
  version 3.0.6 of the `stable` branch and version 3.1.0.beta7 of the `beta` and `tests-passed`
  branches. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
