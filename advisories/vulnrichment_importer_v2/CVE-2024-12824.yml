aliases: []
summary: The Nokri – Job Board WordPress Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege
  escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.2. This is due to
  the plugin not properly checking for an empty token value prior updating their details like
  password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's
  password, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.
