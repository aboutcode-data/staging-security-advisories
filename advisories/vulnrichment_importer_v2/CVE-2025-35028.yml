summary: By providing a command-line argument starting with a semi-colon ; to an API endpoint
  created by the EnhancedCommandExecutor class of the HexStrike AI MCP server, the resultant
  composed command is executed directly in the context of the MCP server’s normal privilege;

  of this MCP server at the affected version (as of commit 2f3a5512 in September of 2025).
