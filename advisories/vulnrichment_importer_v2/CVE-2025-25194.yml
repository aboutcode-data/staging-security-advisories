summary: Lemmy, a link aggregator and forum for the fediverse, is vulnerable to server-side
  request forgery via a dependency on activitypub_federation, a framework for ActivityPub federation
  in Rust. This vulnerability, which is present in versions 0.6.2 and prior of activitypub_federation
  and versions 0.19.8 and prior of Lemmy, allows a user to bypass any predefined hardcoded URL

  Port and URL using a Webfinger Request. As of time of publication, a fix has not been made
  available.
