  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  crypto: qcom-rng - fix infinite loop on requests not multiple of WORD_SZ

  The commit referenced in the Fixes tag removed the 'break' from the else
  branch in qcom_rng_read(), causing an infinite loop whenever 'max' is
  not a multiple of WORD_SZ. This can be reproduced e.g. by running:

      kcapi-rng -b 67 >/dev/null

  There are many ways to fix this without adding back the 'break', but
  they all seem more awkward than simply adding it back, so do just that.

  Tested on a machine with Qualcomm Amberwing processor.
