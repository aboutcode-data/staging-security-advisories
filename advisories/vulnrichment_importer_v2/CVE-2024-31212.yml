aliases: []
summary: InstantCMS is a free and open source content management system. A SQL injection vulnerability
  affects instantcms v2.16.2 in which an attacker with administrative privileges can cause the
  application to execute unauthorized SQL code. The vulnerability exists in index_chart_data
  action, which receives an input from user and passes it unsanitized to the core model `filterFunc`
  function that further embeds this data in an SQL statement. This allows attackers to inject
  unwanted SQL code into the statement. The `period` should be escaped before inserting it in
  the query. As of time of publication, a patched version is not available.
