aliases: []
summary: |
  When multiple devices share resources and one of them is to be passed
  through to a guest, security of the entire system and of respective
  guests individually cannot really be guaranteed without knowing
  internals of any of the involved guests.  Therefore such a configuration
  cannot really be security-supported, yet making that explicit was so far
  missing.

  Resources the sharing of which is known to be problematic include, but
  are not limited to
  - - PCI Base Address Registers (BARs) of multiple devices mapping to the
    same page (4k on x86),
  - - INTx lines.
