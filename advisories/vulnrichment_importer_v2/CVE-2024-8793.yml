aliases: []
summary: The Store Exporter for WooCommerce – Export Products, Export Orders, Export Subscriptions,
  and More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use
  of add_query_arg without appropriate escaping on the URL in all versions up to, and including,
  2.7.2.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
  in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such
  as clicking on a link.
