aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in kubevirt. A user within a virtual machine (VM), if the guest agent
  is active, can exploit this by causing the agent to report an excessive number of network
  interfaces. This action can overwhelm the system's ability to store VM configuration updates,
  effectively blocking changes to the Virtual Machine Instance (VMI). This allows the VM user
  to restrict the VM administrator's ability to manage the VM, leading to a denial of service
  for administrative operations.
