aliases: []
summary: The Popup builder with Gamification, Multi-Step Popups, Page-Level Targeting, and WooCommerce
  Triggers plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions
  up to, and including, 2.1.4. This is due to insufficient validation on the URLs supplied via
  the URL parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to make web requests
  to arbitrary locations originating from the web application and can be used to query and modify
  information from internal services, as well as conduct network reconnaissance. The vulnerability
  was partially patched in version 2.1.4.
