aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol implementation for Cisco NX-OS Software
  could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a reload
  on an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the Cisco Discovery Protocol parser
  does not properly validate input for certain fields in a Cisco Discovery Protocol message.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol
  packet to an affected device. An successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a stack
  overflow, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges
  on an affected device. Cisco Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit this vulnerability,
  an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).
