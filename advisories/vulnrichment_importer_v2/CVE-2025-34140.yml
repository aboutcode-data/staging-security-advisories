aliases: []
summary: An authorization bypass vulnerability exists in ETQ Reliance (legacy CG and NXG SaaS
  platforms). By appending a specific URI suffix to certain API endpoints, an unauthenticated
  attacker can bypass access control checks and retrieve limited sensitive resources. The root
  cause was a misconfiguration in API authorization logic, which has since been corrected in
  SE.2025.1 and 2025.1.2.
