aliases: []
summary: 'The InstaWP Connect – 1-click WP Staging & Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 0.1.0.44. This is due to insufficient
  verification of the API key. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in
  as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the username,
  and to perform a variety of other administrative tasks. NOTE: This vulnerability was partially
  fixed in 0.1.0.44, but was still exploitable via Cross-Site Request Forgery.'
