aliases: []
summary: Starting with diego-release 2.55.0 and up to 2.69.0, and starting with CF Deployment
  17.1 and up to 23.2.0, apps are accessible via another port on diego cells, allowing application
  ingress without a client certificate. If mTLS route integrity is enabled AND unproxied ports
  are turned off, then an attacker could connect to an application that should be only reachable
  via mTLS, without presenting a client certificate.
