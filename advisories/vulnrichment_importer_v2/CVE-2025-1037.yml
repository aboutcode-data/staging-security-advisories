summary: By making minor configuration changes to the TropOS 4th Gen device, an authenticated
  user with the ability to run user level shell commands can enable access via secure shell
  (SSH) to an unrestricted root shell. This is possible through abuse of a particular set of
  scripts and executables that allow for certain commands to be run as root from an unprivileged
  context.
