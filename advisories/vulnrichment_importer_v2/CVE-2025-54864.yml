aliases: []
summary: Hydra is a continuous integration service for Nix based projects. Prior to commit f7bda02,
  /api/push-github and /api/push-gitea are called by the corresponding forge without HTTP Basic
  authentication. Both forges do however feature HMAC signing with a secret key. Triggering
  an evaluation can be very taxing on the infrastructure when large evaluations are done, introducing
  potential denial of service attacks on the host running the evaluator. This issue has been
  patched by commit f7bda02. A workaround involves blocking /api/push-github and /api/push-gitea
  via a reverse proxy.
