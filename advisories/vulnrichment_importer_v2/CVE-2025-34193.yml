aliases: []
summary: Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host versions prior to 25.1.102
  and Application versions prior to 25.1.1413 include Windows client components (PrinterInstallerClientInterface.exe,
  PrinterInstallerClient.exe, PrinterInstallerClientLauncher.exe) that lack modern compile-time
  and runtime exploit mitigations and rely on outdated runtimes. These binaries are built as
  32-bit, without Data Execution Prevention (DEP), Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR),
  Control Flow Guard (CFG), or stack-protection, and they incorporate legacy technologies (Pascal/Delphi
  and Python 2) which are no longer commonly maintained. Several of these processes run with
  elevated privileges (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM for PrinterInstallerClient.exe and PrinterInstallerClientLauncher.exe),
  and the client automatically downloads and installs printer drivers. The absence of modern
  memory safety mitigations and the use of unmaintained runtimes substantially increase the
  risk that memory-corruption or other exploit primitives — for example from crafted driver
  content or maliciously crafted inputs — can be turned into remote or local code execution
  and privilege escalation to SYSTEM. This vulnerability has been confirmed to be remediated,
  but it is unclear as to when the patch was introduced.
