aliases: []
summary: Stored HTML injection in RISE Ultimate Project Manager & CRM allows authenticated users
  to inject arbitrary HTML into invoices and messages. Injected content renders in emails, PDFs,
  and messaging/chat modules sent to clients or team members, enabling phishing, credential
  theft, and business email compromise. Automated recurring invoices and messaging amplify the
  risk by distributing malicious content to multiple recipients.
