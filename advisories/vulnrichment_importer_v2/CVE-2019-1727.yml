aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Python scripting subsystem of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow
  an authenticated, local attacker to escape the Python parser and issue arbitrary commands
  to elevate the attacker's privilege level. The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization
  of user-supplied parameters that are passed to certain Python functions in the scripting sandbox
  of the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to escape the scripting
  sandbox and execute arbitrary commands to elevate the attacker's privilege level. To exploit
  this vulnerability, the attacker must have local access and be authenticated to the targeted
  device with administrative or Python execution privileges. These requirements could limit
  the possibility of a successful exploit.
