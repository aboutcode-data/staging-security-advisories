aliases: []
summary: Langflow is a tool for building and deploying AI-powered agents and workflows. A privilege
  escalation vulnerability exists in Langflow containers where an authenticated user with RCE
  access can invoke the internal CLI command langflow superuser to create a new administrative
  user. This results in full superuser access, even if the user initially registered through
  the UI as a regular (non-admin) account. A patched version has not been made public at this
  time.
