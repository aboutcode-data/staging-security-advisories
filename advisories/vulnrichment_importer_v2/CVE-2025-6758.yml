aliases: []
summary: The Real Spaces - WordPress Properties Directory Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable
  to privilege escalation via the 'imic_agent_register' function in all versions up to, and
  including, 3.6. This is due to a lack of restriction in the registration role. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to arbitrarily choose their role, including the
  Administrator role, during user registration.
