aliases: []
summary: An open redirect vulnerability is fixed in Rails 7.0.4.1 with the new protection against
  open redirects from calling redirect_to with untrusted user input. In prior versions the developer
  was fully responsible for only providing trusted input. However the check introduced could
  allow an attacker to bypass with a carefully crafted URL resulting in an open redirect vulnerability.
