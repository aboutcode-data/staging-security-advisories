  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  audit: don't deref the syscall args when checking the openat2 open_how::flags

  As reported by Jeff, dereferencing the openat2 syscall argument in
  audit_match_perm() to obtain the open_how::flags can result in an
  oops/page-fault.  This patch fixes this by using the open_how struct
  that we store in the audit_context with audit_openat2_how().

  Independent of this patch, Richard Guy Briggs posted a similar patch
  to the audit mailing list roughly 40 minutes after this patch was
  posted.
