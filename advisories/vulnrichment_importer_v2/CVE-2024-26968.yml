  clk: qcom: gcc-ipq9574: fix terminating of frequency table arrays

  The frequency table arrays are supposed to be terminated with an
  empty element. Add such entry to the end of the arrays where it
  is missing in order to avoid possible out-of-bound access when
  the table is traversed by functions like qcom_find_freq() or
  qcom_find_freq_floor().

  Only compile tested.
