summary: The Workreap plugin for WordPress, used by the Workreap - Freelance Marketplace WordPress
  Theme, is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the
  'workreap_temp_upload_to_media' function in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.2. This

  upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution
  possible.
