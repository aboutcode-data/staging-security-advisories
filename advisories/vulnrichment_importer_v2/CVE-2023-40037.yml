aliases: []
summary: Apache NiFi 1.21.0 through 1.23.0 support JDBC and JNDI JMS access in several Processors
  and Controller Services with connection URL validation that does not provide sufficient protection
  against crafted inputs. An authenticated and authorized user can bypass connection URL validation
  using custom input formatting. The resolution enhances connection URL validation and introduces
  validation for additional related properties. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 1.23.1 is the recommended
  mitigation.
