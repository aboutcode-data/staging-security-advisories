aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of the Cisco RV110W
  Wireless-N VPN Firewall, RV130 VPN Router, RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and
  RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary
  code on an affected device. The vulnerabilities are due to improper validation of user-supplied
  data in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities
  by sending malicious HTTP requests to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system of the affected
  device as a high-privilege user.
