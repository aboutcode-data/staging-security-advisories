summary: The Houzez Property Feed plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.21. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the "deleteexport" action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete
  property feed exports via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
  performing an action such as clicking on a link.
