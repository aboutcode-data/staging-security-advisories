aliases: []
summary: systeminformation is a System and OS information library for node.js. In affected versions
  SSIDs are not sanitized when before they are passed as a parameter to cmd.exe in the `getWindowsIEEE8021x`
  function. This means that malicious content in the SSID can be executed as OS commands. This
  vulnerability may enable an attacker, depending on how the package is used, to perform remote
  code execution or local privilege escalation. This issue has been addressed in version 5.23.7
  and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
