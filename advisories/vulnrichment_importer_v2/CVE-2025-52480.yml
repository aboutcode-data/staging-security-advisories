aliases: []
summary: Registrator is a GitHub app that automates creation of registration pull requests for
  julia packages to the General registry. Prior to version 1.9.5, if the clone URL returned
  by GitHub is malicious (or can be injected using upstream vulnerabilities), an argument injection
  is possible in the `gettreesha()` function. This can then lead to a potential remote code
  execution. Users should upgrade immediately to v1.9.5 to receive a patch. All prior versions
  are vulnerable. No known workarounds are available.
