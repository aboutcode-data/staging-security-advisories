aliases: []
summary: 'Astro is a web framework for content-driven websites. A bug in the build process allows
  any unauthenticated user to read parts of the server source code. During build, along with
  client assets such as css and font files, the sourcemap files **for the server code** are
  moved to a publicly-accessible folder. Any outside party can read them with an unauthorized
  HTTP GET request to the same server hosting the rest of the website. While some server files
  are hashed, making their access obscure, the files corresponding to the file system router
  (those in `src/pages`) are predictably named. For example. the sourcemap file for `src/pages/index.astro`
  gets named `dist/client/pages/index.astro.mjs.map`. This vulnerability is the root cause of
  issue #12703, which links to a simple stackblitz project demonstrating the vulnerability.
  Upon build, notice the contents of the `dist/client` (referred to as `config.build.client`
  in astro code) folder. All astro servers make the folder in question accessible to the public
  internet without any authentication. It contains `.map` files corresponding to the code that
  runs on the server. All **server-output** projects on Astro 5 versions **v5.0.3** through
  **v5.0.7**, that have **sourcemaps enabled**, either directly or through an add-on such as
  `sentry`, are affected. The fix for **server-output** projects was released in **astro@5.0.8**.
  Additionally, all **static-output** projects built using Astro 4 versions **4.16.17 or older**,
  or Astro 5 versions **5.0.8 or older**, that have **sourcemaps enabled** are also affected.
  The fix for **static-output** projects was released in **astro@5.0.9**, and backported to
  Astro v4 in **astro@4.16.18**. The immediate impact is limited to source code. Any secrets
  or environment variables are not exposed unless they are present verbatim in the source code.
  There is no immediate loss of integrity within the the vulnerable server. However, it is possible
  to subsequently discover another vulnerability via the revealed source code . There is no
  immediate impact to availability of the vulnerable server. However, the presence of an unsafe
  regular expression, for example, can quickly be exploited to subsequently compromise the availability.
  The fix for **server-output** projects was released in **astro@5.0.8**, and the fix for **static-output**
  projects was released in **astro@5.0.9** and backported to Astro v4 in **astro@4.16.18**.
  Users are advised to update immediately if they are using sourcemaps or an integration that
  enables sourcemaps.'
