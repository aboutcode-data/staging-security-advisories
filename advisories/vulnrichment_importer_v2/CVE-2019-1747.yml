aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the implementation of the Short Message Service (SMS) handling functionality
  of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is
  due to improper processing of SMS protocol data units (PDUs) that are encoded with a special
  character set. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious SMS message
  to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the wireless
  WAN (WWAN) cellular interface module on an affected device to crash, resulting in a DoS condition
  that would require manual intervention to restore normal operating conditions.
