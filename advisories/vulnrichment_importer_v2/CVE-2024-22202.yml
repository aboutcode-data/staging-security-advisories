aliases: []
summary: phpMyFAQ is an open source FAQ web application for PHP 8.1+ and MySQL, PostgreSQL and
  other databases. phpMyFAQ's user removal page allows an attacker to spoof another user's detail,
  and in turn make a compelling phishing case for removing another user's account. The front-end
  of this page doesn't allow changing the form details, an attacker can utilize a proxy to intercept
  this request and submit other data. Upon submitting this form, an email is sent to the administrator
  informing them that this user wants to delete their account. An administrator has no way of
  telling the difference between the actual user wishing to delete their account or the attacker
  issuing this for an account they do not control. This issue has been patched in version 3.2.5.
