aliases: []
summary: Vitess is a database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL. Users can either
  intentionally or inadvertently create a keyspace containing `/` characters such that from
  that point on, anyone who tries to view keyspaces from VTAdmin will receive an error. Trying
  to list all the keyspaces using `vtctldclient GetKeyspaces` will also return an error. Note
  that all other keyspaces can still be administered using the CLI (vtctldclient). This issue
  is fixed in version 16.0.1. As a workaround, delete the offending keyspace using a CLI client
  (vtctldclient).
