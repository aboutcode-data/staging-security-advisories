aliases: []
summary: |
  Due to a hardlink created in the ProgramData folder during the repair process of the software, the installer (MSI) of WARP Client for Windows (<= 2022.12.582.0) allowed a malicious attacker to forge the destination of the hardlink and escalate privileges, overwriting SYSTEM protected files.
  As Cloudflare WARP client for Windows (up to version 2022.5.309.0) allowed creation of mount points from its ProgramData folder, during installation of the WARP client, it was possible to escalate privileges and overwrite SYSTEM protected files.
