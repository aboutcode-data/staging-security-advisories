aliases: []
summary: Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. Prior to version 3.1.5, Werkzeug's
  safe_join function allows path segments with Windows device names that have file extensions
  or trailing spaces. On Windows, there are special device names such as CON, AUX, etc that
  are implicitly present and readable in every directory. Windows still accepts them with any
  file extension, such as CON.txt, or trailing spaces such as CON. This issue has been patched
  in version 3.1.5.
