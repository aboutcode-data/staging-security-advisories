aliases: []
summary: The Header and Footer Scripts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the _inpost_head_script parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.2
  due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
  that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
