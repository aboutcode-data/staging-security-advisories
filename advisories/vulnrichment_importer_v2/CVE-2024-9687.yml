summary: The WP 2FA with Telegram plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass
  in versions up to, and including, 3.0. This is due to insufficient validation of the user-controlled

  subscriber-level permissions and above, to log in as any existing user on the site, such as
  an administrator.
