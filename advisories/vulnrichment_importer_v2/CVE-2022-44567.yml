aliases: []
summary: A command injection vulnerability exists in Rocket.Chat-Desktop <3.8.14 that could
  allow an attacker to pass a malicious url of openInternalVideoChatWindow to shell.openExternal(),
  which may lead to remote code execution (internalVideoChatWindow.ts#L17). To exploit the vulnerability,
  the internal video chat window must be disabled or a Mac App Store build must be used (internalVideoChatWindow.ts#L14).
  The vulnerability may be exploited by an XSS attack because the function openInternalVideoChatWindow
  is exposed in the Rocket.Chat-Desktop-API.
