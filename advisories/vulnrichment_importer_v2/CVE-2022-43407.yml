aliases: []
summary: 'Jenkins Pipeline: Input Step Plugin 451.vf1a_a_4f405289 and earlier does not restrict
  or sanitize the optionally specified ID of the ''input'' step, which is used for the URLs
  that process user interactions for the given ''input'' step (proceed or abort) and is not
  correctly encoded, allowing attackers able to configure Pipelines to have Jenkins build URLs
  from ''input'' step IDs that would bypass the CSRF protection of any target URL in Jenkins
  when the ''input'' step is interacted with.'
