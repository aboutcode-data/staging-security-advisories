aliases: []
summary: The ITarian platform (SAAS / on-premise) offers the possibility to run code on agents
  via a function called procedures. It is possible to require a mandatory approval process.
  Due to a vulnerability in the approval process, present in any version prior to 6.35.37347.20040,
  a malicious actor (with a valid session token) can create a procedure, bypass approval, and
  execute the procedure. This results in the ability for any user with a valid session token
  to perform arbitrary code execution and full system take-over on all agents.
