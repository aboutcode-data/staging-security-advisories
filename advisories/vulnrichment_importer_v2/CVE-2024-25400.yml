summary: 'Subrion CMS 4.2.1 is vulnerable to SQL Injection via ia.core.mysqli.php. NOTE: this
  is disputed by multiple third parties because it refers to an HTTP request to a PHP file that
  only contains a class, without any mechanism for accepting external input, and the reportedly
  vulnerable method is not present in the file.'
