aliases: []
summary: FreshRSS is a free, self-hostable RSS aggregator. Versions 1.26.3 and below do not
  properly terminate the session during logout. After a user logs out, the session cookie remains
  active and unchanged. The unchanged cookie could be reused by an attacker if a new session
  were to be started. This failure to invalidate the session can lead to session hijacking and
  fixation vulnerabilities. This issue is fixed in version 1.27.0
