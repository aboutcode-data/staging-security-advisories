aliases: []
summary: The Essential Addons for Elementor  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege
  escalation in versions up to and including 4.6.4 due to a lack of restrictions on who can
  add a registration form and a custom registration role to an Elementor created page. This
  makes it possible for attackers with access to the Elementor page builder to create a new
  registration form that defaults to the user role being set to administrator and subsequently
  register as an administrative user.
