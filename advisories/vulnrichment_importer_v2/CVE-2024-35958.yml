  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: ena: Fix incorrect descriptor free behavior

  ENA has two types of TX queues:
  - queues which only process TX packets arriving from the network stack
  - queues which only process TX packets forwarded to it by XDP_REDIRECT
    or XDP_TX instructions

  The ena_free_tx_bufs() cycles through all descriptors in a TX queue
  and unmaps + frees every descriptor that hasn't been acknowledged yet
  by the device (uncompleted TX transactions).
  The function assumes that the processed TX queue is necessarily from
  the first category listed above and ends up using napi_consume_skb()
  for descriptors belonging to an XDP specific queue.

  This patch solves a bug in which, in case of a VF reset, the
  descriptors aren't freed correctly, leading to crashes.
