summary: It was possible to bypass  Lock WARP switch feature https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/warp-settings/#lock-warp-switch
   on the WARP iOS mobile client by enabling both "Disable for cellular networks" and "Disable
  for Wi-Fi networks" switches at once in the application settings. Such configuration caused
  the WARP client to disconnect and allowed the user to bypass restrictions and policies enforced
  by the Zero Trust platform.
