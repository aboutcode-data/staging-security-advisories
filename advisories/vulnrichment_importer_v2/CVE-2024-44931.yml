summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  gpio: prevent potential speculation leaks in gpio_device_get_desc()

  Userspace may trigger a speculative read of an address outside the gpio
  descriptor array.
  Users can do that by calling gpio_ioctl() with an offset out of range.
  Offset is copied from user and then used as an array index to get
  the gpio descriptor without sanitization in gpio_device_get_desc().

  This change ensures that the offset is sanitized by using
  array_index_nospec() to mitigate any possibility of speculative
  information leaks.

  This bug was discovered and resolved using Coverity Static Analysis
  Security Testing (SAST) by Synopsys, Inc.
