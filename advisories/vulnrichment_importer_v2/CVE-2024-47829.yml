aliases: []
summary: pnpm is a package manager. Prior to version 10.0.0, the path shortening function uses
  the md5 function as a path shortening compression function, and if a collision occurs, it
  will result in the same storage path for two different libraries. Although the real names
  are under the package name /node_modoules/, there are no version numbers for the libraries
  they refer to. This issue has been patched in version 10.0.0.
