aliases: []
summary: Applio is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.8-bugfix and prior are vulnerable to
  arbitrary file read in train.py's `export_pth` function. This issue may lead to reading arbitrary
  files on the Applio server. It can also be used in conjunction with blind server-side request
  forgery to read files from servers on the internal network that the Applio server has access
  to. As of time of publication, no known patches are available.
