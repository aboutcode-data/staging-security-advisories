summary: The ElementsKit Elementor addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the Image Accordion widget in all versions 3.0.7 through 3.1.2 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
  execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
