aliases: []
summary: 'Figma Desktop for Windows version 125.6.5 contains a command injection vulnerability
  in the local plugin loader. An attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands by setting a crafted
  build field in the plugin''s manifest.json. This field is passed to child_process.exec without
  validation, leading to possible RCE. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because the behavior
  only allows a local user to attack himself via a local plugin. The local build procedure,
  which is essential to the attack, is not executed for plugins shared to the Figma Community.'
