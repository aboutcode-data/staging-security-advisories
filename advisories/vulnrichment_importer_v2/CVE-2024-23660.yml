aliases: []
summary: The Binance Trust Wallet app for iOS in commit 3cd6e8f647fbba8b5d8844fcd144365a086b629f,
  git tag 0.0.4 misuses the trezor-crypto library and consequently generates mnemonic words
  for which the device time is the only entropy source, leading to economic losses, as exploited
  in the wild in July 2023. An attacker can systematically generate mnemonics for each timestamp
  within an applicable timeframe, and link them to specific wallet addresses in order to steal
  funds from those wallets.
