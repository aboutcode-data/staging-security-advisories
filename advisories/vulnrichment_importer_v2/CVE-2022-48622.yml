aliases: []
summary: In GNOME GdkPixbuf (aka gdk-pixbuf) through 2.42.10, the ANI (Windows animated cursor)
  decoder encounters heap memory corruption (in ani_load_chunk in io-ani.c) when parsing chunks
  in a crafted .ani file. A crafted file could allow an attacker to overwrite heap metadata,
  leading to a denial of service or code execution attack. This occurs in gdk_pixbuf_set_option()
  in gdk-pixbuf.c.
