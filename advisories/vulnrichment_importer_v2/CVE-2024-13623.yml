aliases: []
summary: The Order Export for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information
  Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 3.24 via the 'uploads' directory. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data stored insecurely in the
  /wp-content/uploads directory which can contain exported order information. The plugin is
  only vulnerable when 'Order data storage' is set to 'WordPress posts storage (legacy)', and
  cannot be exploited when the default option of 'High-performance order storage' is enabled.
