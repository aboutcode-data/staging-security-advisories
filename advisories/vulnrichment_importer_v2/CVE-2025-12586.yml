summary: The Conditional Maintenance Mode for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to missing

  attackers to enable or disable the site's maintenance mode via a forged request granted they
  can trick an administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
