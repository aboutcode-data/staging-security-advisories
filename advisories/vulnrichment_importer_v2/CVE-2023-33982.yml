aliases: []
summary: 'Bramble Handshake Protocol (BHP) in Briar before 1.5.3 is not forward secure: eavesdroppers
  can decrypt network traffic between two accounts if they later compromise both accounts. NOTE:
  the eavesdropping is typically impractical because BHP runs over an encrypted session that
  uses the Tor hidden service protocol.'
