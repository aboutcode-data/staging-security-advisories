aliases: []
summary: '@fastify/websocket provides WebSocket support for Fastify. Any application using @fastify/websocket
  could crash if a specific, malformed packet is sent. All versions of fastify-websocket are
  also impacted. That module is deprecated, so it will not be patched. This has been patched
  in version 7.1.1 (fastify v4) and version 5.0.1 (fastify v3). There are currently no known
  workarounds. However, it should be possible to attach the error handler manually. The recommended
  path is upgrading to the patched versions.'
