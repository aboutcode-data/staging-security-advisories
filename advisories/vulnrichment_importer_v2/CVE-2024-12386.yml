aliases: []
summary: The WP Abstracts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in
  all versions up to, and including, 2.7.3. This is due to missing nonce validation on multiple
  functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary accounts
  via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
  such as clicking on a link.
