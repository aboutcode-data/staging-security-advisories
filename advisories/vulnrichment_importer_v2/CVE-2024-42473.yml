aliases: []
summary: OpenFGA is an authorization/permission engine. OpenFGA v1.5.7 and v1.5.8 are vulnerable
  to authorization bypass when calling Check API with a model that uses `but not` and `from`
  expressions and a userset. Users should downgrade to v1.5.6 as soon as possible. This downgrade
  is backward compatible. As of time of publication, a patch is not available but OpenFGA's
  maintainers are planning a patch for inclusion in a future release.
