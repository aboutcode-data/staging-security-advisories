aliases: []
summary: 'Zimbra Collaboration Suite (ZCS) 8.8.15 and 9.0 has mboximport functionality that
  receives a ZIP archive and extracts files from it. By bypassing authentication (i.e., not
  having an authtoken), an attacker can upload arbitrary files to the system, leading to directory
  traversal and remote code execution. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix
  for CVE-2022-27925.'
