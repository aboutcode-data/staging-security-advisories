aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the offline access mode of Cisco Duo Two-Factor Authentication for
  macOS and Duo Authentication for Windows Logon and RDP could allow an unauthenticated, physical
  attacker to replay valid user session credentials and gain unauthorized access to an affected
  macOS or Windows device. This vulnerability exists because session credentials do not properly
  expire. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by replaying previously used multifactor
  authentication (MFA) codes to bypass MFA protection. A successful exploit could allow the
  attacker to gain unauthorized access to the affected device.
