  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net/smc: Transitional solution for clcsock race issue

  We encountered a crash in smc_setsockopt() and it is caused by
  accessing smc->clcsock after clcsock was released.

   BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000020
   #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode
   #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page
   PGD 0 P4D 0
   Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI

   RIP: 0010:smc_setsockopt+0x59/0x280 [smc]
   Call Trace:

  This patch tries to fix it by holding clcsock_release_lock and
  checking whether clcsock has already been released before access.

  In case that a crash of the same reason happens in smc_getsockopt()
  or smc_switch_to_fallback(), this patch also checkes smc->clcsock
  in them too. And the caller of smc_switch_to_fallback() will identify
  whether fallback succeeds according to the return value.
