aliases: []
summary: Meshtastic is an open source mesh networking solution. A fault in the handling of mesh
  packets containing invalid protobuf data can result in an attacker-controlled buffer overflow,
  allowing an attacker to hijack execution flow, potentially resulting in remote code execution.
  This attack does not require authentication or user interaction, as long as the target device
  rebroadcasts packets on the default channel. This vulnerability fixed in 2.6.2.
