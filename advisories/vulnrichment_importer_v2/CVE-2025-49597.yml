aliases: []
summary: handcraftedinthealps goodby-csv is a highly memory efficient, flexible and extendable
  open-source CSV import/export library. Prior to 1.4.3, goodby-csv could be used as part of
  a chain of methods that is exploitable when an insecure deserialization vulnerability exists
  in an application. This so-called "gadget chain" presents no direct threat but is a vector
  that can be used to achieve remote code execution if the application deserializes untrusted
  data due to another vulnerability. The problem is patched with Version 1.4.3.
