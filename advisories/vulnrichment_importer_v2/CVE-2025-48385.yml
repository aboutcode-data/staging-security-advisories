aliases: []
summary: Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich
  command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When cloning
  a repository Git knows to optionally fetch a bundle advertised by the remote server, which
  allows the server-side to offload parts of the clone to a CDN. The Git client does not perform
  sufficient validation of the advertised bundles, which allows the remote side to perform protocol
  injection. This protocol injection can cause the client to write the fetched bundle to a location
  controlled by the adversary. The fetched content is fully controlled by the server, which
  can in the worst case lead to arbitrary code execution. The use of bundle URIs is not enabled
  by default and can be controlled by the bundle.heuristic config option. Some cases of the
  vulnerability require that the adversary is in control of where a repository will be cloned
  to. This either requires social engineering or a recursive clone with submodules. These cases
  can thus be avoided by disabling recursive clones. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7,
  v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1.
