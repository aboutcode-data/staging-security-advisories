aliases: []
summary: A component for parsing OXMF templates could be abused to execute arbitrary system
  commands that would be executed as the non-privileged runtime user. Users and attackers could
  run system commands with limited privilege to gain unauthorized access to confidential information
  and potentially violate integrity by modifying resources. The template engine has been reconfigured
  to deny execution of harmful commands on a system level. No publicly available exploits are
  known.
