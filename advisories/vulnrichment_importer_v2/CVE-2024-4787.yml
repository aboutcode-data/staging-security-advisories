aliases: []
summary: The Cost Calculator Builder PRO for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary email sending
  vulnerability in versions up to, and including, 3.1.75. This is due to insufficient limitations
  on the email recipient and the content in the 'send_pdf' and the 'send_pdf_front' functions
  which are reachable via AJAX. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send
  emails with any content to any recipient.
