aliases: []
summary: 'Auth0-PHP provides the PHP SDK for Auth0 Authentication and Management APIs. Starting
  in version 8.0.0-BETA1 and prior to version 8.14.0, session cookies of applications using
  the Auth0-PHP SDK configured with CookieStore have authentication tags that can be brute forced,
  which may result in unauthorized access. Certain pre-conditions are required to be vulnerable
  to this issue: Applications using the Auth0-PHP SDK, or the Auth0/symfony, Auth0/laravel-auth0,
  and Auth0/wordpress SDKs that rely on the Auth0-PHP SDK; and session storage configured with
  CookieStore. Upgrade Auth0/Auth0-PHP to v8.14.0 to receive a patch. As an additional precautionary
  measure, rotating cookie encryption keys is recommended. Note that once updated, any previous
  session cookies will be rejected.'
