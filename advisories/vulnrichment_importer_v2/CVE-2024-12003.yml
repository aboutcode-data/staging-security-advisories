aliases: []
summary: The WP System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all
  versions up to, and including, 1.1.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the generate_wp_system_page_content() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site
  administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
