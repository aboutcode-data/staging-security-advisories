summary: "A vulnerability in the access control list (ACL) programming of Cisco IOS Software\
  \ running on Cisco Industrial Ethernet 4000, 4010, and 5000 Series Switches could allow an\
  \ unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured ACL.\r\n\r This vulnerability is\
  \ due to the incorrect handling of IPv4 ACLs on switched virtual interfaces when an administrator\
  \ enables and disables Resilient Ethernet Protocol (REP). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by attempting to send traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow\
  \ the attacker to bypass an ACL on the affected device."
