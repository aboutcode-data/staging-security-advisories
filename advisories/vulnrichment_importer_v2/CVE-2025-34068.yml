aliases: []
summary: An unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability exists in Samsung WLAN AP
  WEA453e firmware prior to version 5.2.4.T1 via improper input validation in the “Tech Support”
  diagnostic functionality. The command1 and command2 POST or GET parameters accept arbitrary
  shell commands that are executed with root privileges on the underlying operating system.
  An attacker can exploit this by crafting a request that injects shell commands to create output
  files in writable directories and then access their contents via the download endpoint. This
  flaw allows complete compromise of the device without authentication. Exploitation evidence
  was observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2025-02-04 UTC.
