aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered by Elastic whereby Beats and Elastic Agent would log a raw
  event in its own logs at the WARN or ERROR level if ingesting that event to Elasticsearch
  failed with any 4xx HTTP status code except 409 or 429. Depending on the nature of the event
  that Beats or Elastic Agent attempted to ingest, this could lead to the insertion of sensitive
  or private information in the Beats or Elastic Agent logs. Elastic has released 8.11.3 and
  7.17.16 that prevents this issue by limiting these types of logs to DEBUG level logging, which
  is disabled by default.
