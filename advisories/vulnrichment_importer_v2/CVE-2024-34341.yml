aliases: []
summary: Trix is a rich text editor. The Trix editor, versions prior to 2.1.1, is vulnerable
  to arbitrary code execution when copying and pasting content from the web or other documents
  with markup into the editor. The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of pasted
  content, allowing an attacker to embed malicious scripts which are executed within the context
  of the application. Users should upgrade to Trix editor version 2.1.1 or later, which incorporates
  proper sanitization of input from copied content.
