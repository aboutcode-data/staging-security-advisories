  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ax25: fix use-after-free bugs caused by ax25_ds_del_timer

  When the ax25 device is detaching, the ax25_dev_device_down()
  calls ax25_ds_del_timer() to cleanup the slave_timer. When
  the timer handler is running, the ax25_ds_del_timer() that
  calls del_timer() in it will return directly. As a result,
  the use-after-free bugs could happen, one of the scenarios
  is shown below:

        (Thread 1)          |      (Thread 2)
                            | ax25_ds_timeout()
  ax25_dev_device_down()    |
    ax25_ds_del_timer()     |
      del_timer()           |
    ax25_dev_put() //FREE   |
                            |  ax25_dev-> //USE

  In order to mitigate bugs, when the device is detaching, use
  timer_shutdown_sync() to stop the timer.
