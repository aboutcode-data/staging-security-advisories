  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  md/raid1: Fix data corruption for degraded array with slow disk

  read_balance() will avoid reading from slow disks as much as possible,
  however, if valid data only lands in slow disks, and a new normal disk
  is still in recovery, unrecovered data can be read:

  raid1_read_request
   read_balance
    raid1_should_read_first
    -> return false
    choose_best_rdev
    -> normal disk is not recovered, return -1
    choose_bb_rdev
    -> missing the checking of recovery, return the normal disk
   -> read unrecovered data

  Root cause is that the checking of recovery is missing in
  choose_bb_rdev(). Hence add such checking to fix the problem.

  Also fix similar problem in choose_slow_rdev().
