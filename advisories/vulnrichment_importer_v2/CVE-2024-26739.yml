summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net/sched: act_mirred: don't override retval if we already lost the skb

  If we're redirecting the skb, and haven't called tcf_mirred_forward(),
  yet, we need to tell the core to drop the skb by setting the retcode
  to SHOT. If we have called tcf_mirred_forward(), however, the skb
  is out of our hands and returning SHOT will lead to UaF.

  Move the retval override to the error path which actually need it.
