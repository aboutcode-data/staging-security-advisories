summary: The SiteOrigin Widgets Bundle plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the `data-url` DOM Element Attribute in all versions up to, and including, 1.68.4

  attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
  that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
