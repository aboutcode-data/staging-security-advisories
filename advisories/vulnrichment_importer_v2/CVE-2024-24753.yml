aliases: []
summary: Bref enable serverless PHP on AWS Lambda. When Bref is used in combination with an
  API Gateway with the v2 format, it does not handle multiple values headers. If PHP generates
  a response with two headers having the same key but different values only the latest one is
  kept. If an application relies on multiple headers with the same key being set for security
  reasons, then Bref would lower the application security. For example, if an application sets
  multiple `Content-Security-Policy` headers, then Bref would just reflect the latest one. This
  vulnerability is patched in 2.1.13.
