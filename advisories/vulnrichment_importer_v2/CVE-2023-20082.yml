aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in Cisco IOS XE Software for Cisco Catalyst 9300 Series Switches could
  allow an authenticated, local attacker with level-15 privileges or an unauthenticated attacker
  with physical access to the device to execute persistent code at boot time and break the chain
  of trust. This vulnerability is due to errors that occur when retrieving the public release
  key that is used for image signature verification. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by modifying specific variables in the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) flash memory of an
  affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute persistent code
  on the underlying operating system. Note: In Cisco IOS XE Software releases 16.11.1 and later,
  the complexity of an attack using this vulnerability is high. However, an attacker with level-15
  privileges could easily downgrade the Cisco IOS XE Software on a device to a release that
  would lower the attack complexity.'
