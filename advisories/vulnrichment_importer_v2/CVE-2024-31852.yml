aliases: []
summary: 'LLVM before 18.1.3 generates code in which the LR register can be overwritten without
  data being saved to the stack, and thus there can sometimes be an exploitable error in the
  flow of control. This affects the ARM backend and can be demonstrated with Clang. NOTE: the
  vendor perspective is "we don''t have strong objections for a CVE to be created ... It does
  seem that the likelihood of this miscompile enabling an exploit remains very low, because
  the miscompile resulting in this JOP gadget is such that the function is most likely to crash
  on most valid inputs to the function. So, if this function is covered by any testing, the
  miscompile is most likely to be discovered before the binary is shipped to production."'
