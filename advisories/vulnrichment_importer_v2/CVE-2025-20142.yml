aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the IPv4 access control list (ACL) feature and quality of service\
  \ (QoS) policy feature of Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services\
  \ Routers, ASR 9902 Compact High-Performance Routers, and ASR 9903 Compact High-Performance\
  \ Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a line card to reset, resulting\
  \ in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to the incorrect\
  \ handling of malformed IPv4 packets that are received on line cards where the interface has\
  \ either an IPv4 ACL or QoS policy applied. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by\
  \ sending crafted IPv4 packets through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow\
  \ the attacker to cause network processor errors, resulting in a reset or shutdown of the\
  \ network process. Traffic over that line card would be lost while the line card reloads.\r\
  \nNote: This vulnerability has predominantly been observed in Layer 2 VPN (L2VPN) environments\
  \ where an IPv4 ACL or QoS policy has been applied to the bridge virtual interface. Layer\
  \ 3 configurations where the interface has either an IPv4 ACL or QoS policy applied are also\
  \ affected, though the vulnerability has not been observed."
