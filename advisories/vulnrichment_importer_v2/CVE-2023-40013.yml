aliases: []
summary: SVG Loader is a javascript library that fetches SVGs using XMLHttpRequests and injects
  the SVG code in the tag's place. According to the docs, svg-loader will strip all JS code
  before injecting the SVG file for security reasons but the input sanitization logic is not
  sufficient and can be trivially bypassed. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious SVG
  which can result in Cross-site Scripting (XSS). When trying to sanitize the svg the lib removes
  event attributes such as `onmouseover`, `onclick` but the list of events is not exhaustive.  Any
  website which uses external-svg-loader and allows its users to provide svg src, upload svg
  files would be susceptible to stored XSS attack. This issue has been addressed in commit `d3562fc08`
  which is included in releases from 1.6.9. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
  workarounds for this vulnerability.
