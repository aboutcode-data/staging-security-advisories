aliases: []
summary: MCP TypeScript SDK is the official TypeScript SDK for Model Context Protocol servers
  and clients. Prior to 1.24.0, The Model Context Protocol (MCP) TypeScript SDK does not enable
  DNS rebinding protection by default for HTTP-based servers. When an HTTP-based MCP server
  is run on localhost without authentication with StreamableHTTPServerTransport or SSEServerTransport
  and has not enabled enableDnsRebindingProtection, a malicious website could exploit DNS rebinding
  to bypass same-origin policy restrictions and send requests to the local MCP server. This
  could allow an attacker to invoke tools or access resources exposed by the MCP server on behalf
  of the user in those limited circumstances. Note that running HTTP-based MCP servers locally
  without authentication is not recommended per MCP security best practices. This issue does
  not affect servers using stdio transport. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.0.
