aliases: []
summary: h2o is an HTTP server with support for HTTP/1.x, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. When an HTTP request
  using TLS/1.3 early data on top of TCP Fast Open or QUIC 0-RTT packets is received and the
  IP-address-based access control is used, the access control does not detect and prohibit HTTP
  requests conveyed by packets with a spoofed source address. This behavior allows attackers
  on the network to execute HTTP requests from addresses that are otherwise rejected by the
  address-based access control. The vulnerability has been addressed in commit 15ed15a. Users
  may disable the use of TCP FastOpen and QUIC to mitigate the issue.
