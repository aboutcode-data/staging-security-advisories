aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Universal Plug-and-Play (UPnP) service of Cisco Small Business
  RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to execute arbitrary code or cause an affected device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in
  a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of incoming
  UPnP traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted UPnP request
  to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
  code as the root user on the underlying operating system or cause the device to reload, resulting
  in a DoS condition. Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability.
