aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Aironet Access Points (APs) could allow an authenticated,
  local attacker to access sensitive information stored in an AP. The vulnerability is due to
  improper sanitization of user-supplied input in specific CLI commands. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by accessing the CLI of an affected AP with administrator privileges and
  issuing crafted commands that result in directory traversal. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to view system files on the affected device, which could contain sensitive information.
  Software versions 8.8 and 8.9 are affected.
