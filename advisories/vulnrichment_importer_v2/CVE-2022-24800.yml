aliases: []
summary: October/System is the system module for October CMS, a self-hosted CMS platform based
  on the Laravel PHP Framework. Prior to versions 1.0.476, 1.1.12, and 2.2.15, when the developer
  allows the user to specify their own filename in the `fromData` method, an unauthenticated
  user can perform remote code execution (RCE) by exploiting a race condition in the temporary
  storage directory. This vulnerability affects plugins that expose the `October\Rain\Database\Attach\File::fromData`
  as a public interface and does not affect vanilla installations of October CMS since this
  method is not exposed or used by the system internally or externally. The issue has been patched
  in Build 476 (v1.0.476), v1.1.12, and v2.2.15. Those who are unable to upgrade may apply with
  patch to their installation manually as a workaround.
