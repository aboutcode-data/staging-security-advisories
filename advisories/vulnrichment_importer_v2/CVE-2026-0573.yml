aliases: []
summary: An URL redirection vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed
  attacker-controlled redirects to leak sensitive authorization tokens. The repository_pages
  API insecurely followed HTTP redirects when fetching artifact URLs, preserving the authorization
  header containing a privileged JWT. An authenticated user could redirect these requests to
  an attacker-controlled domain, exfiltrate the Actions.ManageOrgs JWT, and leverage it for
  potential remote code execution. Attackers would require access to the target GitHub Enterprise
  Server instance and the ability to exploit a legacy redirect to an attacker-controlled domain.
  This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.19 and was
  fixed in versions 3.19.2, 3.18.4, 3.17.10, 3.16.13, 3.15.17, and 3.14.22. This vulnerability
  was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.
