aliases: []
summary: The backup ZIPs are not signed by the application, leading to the possibility that
  an attacker can download a backup ZIP, modify and re-upload it. This allows the attacker to
  disrupt the application by configuring  the  services  in  a  way  that  they  are  unable  to  run,  making  the  application
  unusable. They can redirect traffic that is meant to be internal to their own hosted services
  and gathering information.
