aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) feature of Cisco NX-OS\
  \ Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause the LLDP process to\
  \ restart, which could cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability\
  \ is due to improper handling of specific fields in an LLDP frame. An attacker could exploit\
  \ this vulnerability by sending a crafted LLDP packet to an interface of an affected device.\
  \ A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in\
  \ a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\nNote:&nbsp;LLDP is a Layer 2 link protocol. To exploit\
  \ this vulnerability, an attacker would need to be&nbsp;directly connected to an interface\
  \ of an affected device, either physically or logically (for example, through a Layer 2 Tunnel\
  \ configured to transport the LLDP protocol)."
