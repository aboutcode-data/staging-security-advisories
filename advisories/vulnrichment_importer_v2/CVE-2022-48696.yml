summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  regmap: spi: Reserve space for register address/padding

  Currently the max_raw_read and max_raw_write limits in regmap_spi struct
  do not take into account the additional size of the transmitted register
  address and padding.  This may result in exceeding the maximum permitted
  SPI message size, which could cause undefined behaviour, e.g. data
  corruption.

  Fix regmap_get_spi_bus() to properly adjust the above mentioned limits
  by reserving space for the register address/padding as set in the regmap
  configuration.
