summary: "Spring Framework MVC applications can be vulnerable to a “Path Traversal Vulnerability”\
  \ when deployed on a non-compliant Servlet container.\n\nAn application can be vulnerable\
  \ when all the following are true:\n\n  *  the application is deployed as a WAR or with an\
  \ embedded Servlet container\n  *  the Servlet container  does not reject suspicious sequences\
  \ https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/6.1/jakarta-servlet-spec-6.1.html#uri-path-canonicalization\
  \ \n  *  the application  serves static resources https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-config/static-resources.html#page-title\
  \  with Spring resource handling\n\n\nWe have verified that applications deployed on Apache\
  \ Tomcat or Eclipse Jetty are not vulnerable, as long as default security features are not\
  \ disabled in the configuration. Because we cannot check exploits against all Servlet containers\
  \ and configuration variants, we strongly recommend upgrading your application."
