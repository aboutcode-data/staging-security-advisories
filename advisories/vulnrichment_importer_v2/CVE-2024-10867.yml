summary: The Borderless – Widgets, Elements, Templates and Toolkit for Elementor & Gutenberg
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.5.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output

  above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
  the SVG file.
