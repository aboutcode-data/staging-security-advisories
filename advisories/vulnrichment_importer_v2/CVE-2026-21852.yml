aliases: []
summary: Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. Prior to version 2.0.65, vulnerability in Claude
  Code's project-load flow allowed malicious repositories to exfiltrate data including Anthropic
  API keys before users confirmed trust. An attacker-controlled repository could include a settings
  file that sets ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL to an attacker-controlled endpoint and when the repository
  was opened, Claude Code would read the configuration and immediately issue API requests before
  showing the trust prompt, potentially leaking the user's API keys. Users on standard Claude
  Code auto-update have received this fix already. Users performing manual updates are advised
  to update to version 2.0.65, which contains a patch, or to the latest version.
