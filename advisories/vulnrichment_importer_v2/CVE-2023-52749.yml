  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  spi: Fix null dereference on suspend

  A race condition exists where a synchronous (noqueue) transfer can be
  active during a system suspend. This can cause a null pointer
  dereference exception to occur when the system resumes.

  Example order of events leading to the exception:
  1. spi_sync() calls __spi_transfer_message_noqueue() which sets
     ctlr->cur_msg
  2. Spi transfer begins via spi_transfer_one_message()
  3. System is suspended interrupting the transfer context
  4. System is resumed
  6. spi_controller_resume() calls spi_start_queue() which resets cur_msg
     to NULL
  7. Spi transfer context resumes and spi_finalize_current_message() is
     called which dereferences cur_msg (which is now NULL)

  Wait for synchronous transfers to complete before suspending by
  acquiring the bus mutex and setting/checking a suspend flag.
