aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the video endpoint API (xAPI) of Cisco TelePresence Collaboration
  Endpoint (CE) Software, Cisco TelePresence Codec (TC) Software, and Cisco RoomOS Software
  could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct directory traversal attacks on an
  affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input
  to the xAPI of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
  a crafted request to the xAPI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read and write
  arbitrary files in the system. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need either
  an In-Room Control or administrator account.
