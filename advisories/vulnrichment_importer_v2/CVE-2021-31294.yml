aliases: []
summary: 'Redis before 6cbea7d allows a replica to cause an assertion failure in a primary server
  by sending a non-administrative command (specifically, a SET command). NOTE: this was fixed
  for Redis 6.2.x and 7.x in 2021. Versions before 6.2 were not intended to have safety guarantees
  related to this.'
