aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in Cisco Meeting Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to gain unauthorized access to components of, or sensitive information in, an affected system,
  leading to Remote Code Execution. The vulnerability is due to incorrect default configuration
  of the device, which can expose internal interfaces and ports on the external interface of
  the system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthenticated access to
  configuration and database files as well as sensitive meeting information on an affected system.
  Additionally, if the Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN) service is enabled and utilizing Transport
  Layer Security (TLS) connections, an attacker could utilize TURN credentials to forward traffic
  to device daemons, allowing for remote exploitation. This vulnerability affects Cisco Meeting
  Server (CMS) Acano X-series platforms that are running a CMS Software release prior to 2.2.11.
