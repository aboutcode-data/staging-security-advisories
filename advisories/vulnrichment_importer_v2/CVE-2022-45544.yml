aliases: []
summary: 'Insecure Permission vulnerability in Schlix Web Inc SCHLIX CMS 2.2.7-2 allows attacker
  to upload arbitrary files and execute arbitrary code via the tristao parameter. NOTE: this
  is disputed by the vendor because an admin is intentionally allowed to upload new executable
  PHP code, such as a theme that was obtained from a trusted source or was developed for their
  own website. Only an admin can upload such code, not someone else in an "attacker" role.'
