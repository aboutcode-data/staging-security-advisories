aliases: []
summary: Rembg is a tool to remove images background. In Rembg 2.0.57 and earlier, the CORS
  middleware is setup incorrectly. All origins are reflected, which allows any website to send
  cross site requests to the rembg server and thus query any API. Even if authentication were
  to be enabled, allow_credentials is set to True, which would allow any website to send authenticated
  cross site requests.
