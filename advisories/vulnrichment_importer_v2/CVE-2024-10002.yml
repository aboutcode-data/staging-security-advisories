aliases: []
summary: The Rover IDX plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in versions
  up to, and including, 3.0.0.2905. This is due to insufficient validation and capability check
  on the 'rover_idx_refresh_social_callback' function. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to log in to administrator. The vulnerability
  is partially patched in version 3.0.0.2905 and fully patched in version 3.0.0.2906.
