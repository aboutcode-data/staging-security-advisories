aliases: []
summary: 'SpiceDB is an open source database system for creating and managing security-critical
  application permissions. Prior to version 1.47.1, if a schema includes the following characteristics:
  permission defined in terms of a union (+) and that union references the same relation on
  both sides (but one side arrows to a different permission). Then SpiceDB may have missing
  LookupResources results when checking the permission. This only affects LookupResources; other
  APIs calculate permissionship correctly. The issue is fixed in version 1.47.1.'
