aliases: []
summary: codeium-chrome is an open source code completion plugin for the chrome web browser.
  The service worker of the codeium-chrome extension doesn't check the sender when receiving
  an external message. This allows an attacker to host a website that will steal the user's
  Codeium api-key, and thus impersonate the user on the backend autocomplete server. This issue
  has not been addressed. Users are advised to monitor the usage of their API key.
