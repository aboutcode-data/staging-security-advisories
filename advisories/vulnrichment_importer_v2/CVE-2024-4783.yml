summary: The jQuery T(-) Countdown Widget plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the plugin's tminus shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.25 due

  it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject
  arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
