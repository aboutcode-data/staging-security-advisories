aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web UI of the Cisco SD-WAN vManage software could allow an authenticated,
  remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based
  management interface of the vManage software. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation
  of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this
  vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface
  or access sensitive, browser-based information.
