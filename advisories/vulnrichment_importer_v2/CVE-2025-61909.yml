aliases: []
summary: 'Icinga 2 is an open source monitoring system. From 2.10.0 to before 2.15.1, 2.14.7,
  and 2.13.13, the safe-reload script (also used during systemctl reload icinga2) and logrotate
  configuration shipped with Icinga 2 read the PID of the main Icinga 2 process from a PID file
  writable by the daemon user, but send the signal as the root user. This can allow the Icinga
  user to send signals to processes it would otherwise not permitted to. A fix is included in
  the following Icinga 2 versions: 2.15.1, 2.14.7, and 2.13.13.'
