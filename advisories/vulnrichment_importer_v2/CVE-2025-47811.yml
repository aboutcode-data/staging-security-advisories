aliases: []
summary: 'In Wing FTP Server through 7.4.4, the administrative web interface (listening by default
  on port 5466) runs as root or SYSTEM by default. The web application itself offers several
  legitimate ways to execute arbitrary system commands (i.e., through the web console or the
  task scheduler), and they are automatically executed in the highest possible privilege context.
  Because administrative users of the web interface are not necessarily also system administrators,
  one might argue that this is a privilege escalation. (If a privileged application role is
  not available to an attacker, CVE-2025-47812 can be leveraged.) NOTE: the vendor reportedly
  considers this behavior "fine to keep."'
