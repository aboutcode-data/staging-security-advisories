summary: Pimcore is an Open Source Data & Experience Management Platform. In versions up to
  and including 11.5.14.1 and 12.3.2, the filter query parameter in the dependency listing endpoints
  is JSON-decoded and the value field is concatenated directly into RLIKE clauses without sanitization
  or parameterized queries. Exploiting this issue requires admin authentication. An attacker
  with admin panel access can extract the full database including password hashes of other admin
  users. Version 12.3.3 contains a patch.
