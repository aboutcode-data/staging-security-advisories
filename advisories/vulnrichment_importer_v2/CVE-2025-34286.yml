aliases: []
summary: Nagios XI versions prior to 2026R1  contain a remote code execution vulnerability in
  the Core Config Manager (CCM) Run Check command. Insufficient validation/escaping of parameters
  used to build backend command lines allows an authenticated administrator to inject shell
  metacharacters that are executed on the server. Successful exploitation results in arbitrary
  command execution with the privileges of the Nagios XI web application user and can be leveraged
  to gain control of the underlying host operating system.
