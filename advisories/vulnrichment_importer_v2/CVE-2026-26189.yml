aliases: []
summary: Trivy Action runs Trivy as GitHub action to scan a Docker container image for vulnerabilities.
  A command injection vulnerability exists in `aquasecurity/trivy-action` versions 0.31.0 through
  0.33.1 due to improper handling of action inputs when exporting environment variables. The
  action writes `export VAR=<input>` lines to `trivy_envs.txt` based on user-supplied inputs
  and subsequently sources this file in `entrypoint.sh`. Because input values are written without
  appropriate shell escaping, attacker-controlled input containing shell metacharacters (e.g.,
  `$(...)`, backticks, or other command substitution syntax) may be evaluated during the sourcing
  process. This can result in arbitrary command execution within the GitHub Actions runner context.
  Version 0.34.0 contains a patch for this issue. The vulnerability is exploitable when a consuming
  workflow passes attacker-controlled data into any action input that is written to `trivy_envs.txt`.
  Access to user input is required by the malicious actor. Workflows that do not pass attacker-controlled
  data into `trivy-action` inputs, workflows that upgrade to a patched version that properly
  escapes shell values or eliminates the `source ./trivy_envs.txt` pattern, and workflows where
  user input is not accessible are not affected.
