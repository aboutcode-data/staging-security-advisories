aliases: []
summary: KEDA is a Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaling component. Prior to versions 2.17.3
  and 2.18.3, an Arbitrary File Read vulnerability has been identified in KEDA, potentially
  affecting any KEDA resource that uses TriggerAuthentication to configure HashiCorp Vault authentication.
  The vulnerability stems from an incorrect or insufficient path validation when loading the
  Service Account Token specified in spec.hashiCorpVault.credential.serviceAccount. An attacker
  with permissions to create or modify a TriggerAuthentication resource can exfiltrate the content
  of any file from the node's filesystem (where the KEDA pod resides) by directing the file's
  content to a server under their control, as part of the Vault authentication request. The
  potential impact includes the exfiltration of sensitive system information, such as secrets,
  keys, or the content of files like /etc/passwd. This issue has been patched in versions 2.17.3
  and 2.18.3.
