aliases: []
summary: OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. The proposal
  creation entrypoint (`propose`) in `GovernorCompatibilityBravo` allows the creation of proposals
  with a `signatures` array shorter than the `calldatas` array. This causes the additional elements
  of the latter to be ignored, and if the proposal succeeds the corresponding actions would
  eventually execute without any calldata. The `ProposalCreated` event correctly represents
  what will eventually execute, but the proposal parameters as queried through `getActions`
  appear to respect the original intended calldata. This issue has been patched in 4.8.3. As
  a workaround, ensure that all proposals that pass through governance have equal length `signatures`
  and `calldatas` parameters.
