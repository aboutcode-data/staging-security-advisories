aliases: []
summary: The SKT PayPal for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Payment Bypass
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.4. This is due to the plugin only enforcing client
  side controls instead of server-side controls when processing payments. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to make confirmed purchases without actually paying for them.
