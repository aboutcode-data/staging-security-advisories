aliases: []
summary: The Checkout Field Manager (Checkout Manager) for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to authorization bypass in versions up to, and including, 7.8.5. This is due
  to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to delete an attachment combined
  with flawed guest order ownership validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to delete attachments associated with guest orders using only the publicly available wooccm_upload
  nonce and attachment ID.
