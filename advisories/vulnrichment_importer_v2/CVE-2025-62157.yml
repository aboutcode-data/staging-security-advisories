aliases: []
summary: Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating
  parallel jobs on Kubernetes. Argo Workflows versions prior to 3.6.12 and versions 3.7.0 through
  3.7.2 expose artifact repository credentials in plaintext in workflow-controller pod logs.
  An attacker with permissions to read pod logs in a namespace running Argo Workflows can read
  the workflow-controller logs and obtain credentials to the artifact repository. Update to
  versions 3.6.12 or 3.7.3 to remediate the vulnerability. No known workarounds exist.
