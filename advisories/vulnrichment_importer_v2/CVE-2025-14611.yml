datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2025/14xxx/CVE-2025-14611.json
aliases: []
summary: Gladinet CentreStack and Triofox prior to version 16.12.10420.56791 used hardcoded
  values for their implementation of the AES cryptoscheme. This degrades security for public
  exposed endpoints that may make use of it and may offer arbitrary local file inclusion when
  provided a specially crafted request without authentication. This opens the door for future
  exploitation and can be leveraged with previous vulnerabilities to gain a full system compromise.
