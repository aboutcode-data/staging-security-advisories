aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the implementation of the IPv4 fragmentation reassembly code in\
  \ Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial\
  \ of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper\
  \ management of resources during fragment reassembly. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by sending specific sizes of fragmented packets to an affected device or through a Virtual\
  \ Fragmentation Reassembly (VFR)-enabled interface on an affected device. A successful exploit\
  \ could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\
  \r Note: This vulnerability affects Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers and\
  \ Cisco cBR-8 Converged Broadband Routers if they are running Cisco IOS XE Software Release\
  \ 17.12.1 or 17.12.1a."
