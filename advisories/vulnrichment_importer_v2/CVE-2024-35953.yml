  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  accel/ivpu: Fix deadlock in context_xa

  ivpu_device->context_xa is locked both in kernel thread and IRQ context.
  It requires XA_FLAGS_LOCK_IRQ flag to be passed during initialization
  otherwise the lock could be acquired from a thread and interrupted by
  an IRQ that locks it for the second time causing the deadlock.

  This deadlock was reported by lockdep and observed in internal tests.
