aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the CLI parser of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated,
  local attacker to gain access to the underlying Linux shell of an affected device and execute
  arbitrary commands with root privileges on the device. The vulnerability is due to the affected
  software improperly sanitizing command arguments to prevent access to internal data structures
  on a device. An attacker who has privileged EXEC mode (privilege level 15) access to an affected
  device could exploit this vulnerability on the device by executing CLI commands that contain
  crafted arguments. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to the underlying
  Linux shell of the affected device and execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on
  the device. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve74432.'
