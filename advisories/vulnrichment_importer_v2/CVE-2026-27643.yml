aliases: []
summary: free5GC UDR is the user data repository (UDR) for free5GC, an an open-source project
  for 5th generation (5G) mobile core networks. In versions up to and including 1.4.1, the NEF
  component reliably leaks internal parsing error details (e.g., invalid character 'n' after
  top-level value) to remote clients, which can aid attackers in service fingerprinting. All
  deployments of free5GC  using the Nnef_PfdManagement service may be affected. free5gc/udr
  pull request 56 contains a patch for the issue. There is no direct workaround at the application
  level. The recommendation is to apply the provided patch.
