aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the internal packet processing of Cisco Aironet Series Access Points
  (APs) could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS)
  condition on an affected AP if the switch interface where the AP is connected has port security
  configured. The vulnerability exists because the AP forwards some malformed wireless client
  packets outside of the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) tunnel.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted wireless packets to an affected
  AP. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a security violation on the adjacent
  switch port, which could result in a DoS condition. Note: Though the Common Vulnerability
  Scoring System (CVSS) score corresponds to a High Security Impact Rating (SIR), this vulnerability
  is considered Medium because a workaround is available and exploitation requires a specific
  switch configuration. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.'
