aliases: []
summary: GeoServer is an open source software server written in Java that allows users to share
  and edit geospatial data. A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in versions
  prior to 2.23.2 and 2.24.1 that enables an authenticated administrator with workspace-level
  privileges to store a JavaScript payload in the GeoServer catalog that will execute in the
  context of another administrator’s browser when viewed in the GWC Seed Form. Access to the
  GWC Seed Form is limited to full administrators by default and granting non-administrators
  access to this endpoint is not recommended. Versions 2.23.2 and 2.24.1 contain a fix for this
  issue.
