aliases: []
summary: 'react-dev-utils on Windows allows developers to run a local webserver for accepting
  various commands, including a command to launch an editor. The input to that command was not
  properly sanitized, allowing an attacker who can make a network request to the server (either
  via CSRF or by direct request) to execute arbitrary commands on the targeted system. This
  issue affects multiple branches: 1.x.x prior to 1.0.4, 2.x.x prior to 2.0.2, 3.x.x prior to
  3.1.2, 4.x.x prior to 4.2.2, and 5.x.x prior to 5.0.2.'
