aliases: []
summary: FastAPI Api Key provides a backend-agnostic library that provides an API key system.
  Version 1.1.0 has a timing side-channel vulnerability in verify_key(). The method applied
  a random delay only on verification failures, allowing an attacker to statistically distinguish
  valid from invalid API keys by measuring response latencies. With enough repeated requests,
  an adversary could infer whether a key_id corresponds to a valid key, potentially accelerating
  brute-force or enumeration attacks. All users relying on verify_key() for API key authentication
  prior to the fix are affected. Users should upgrade to version 1.1.0 to receive a patch. The
  patch applies a uniform random delay (min_delay to max_delay) to all responses regardless
  of outcome, eliminating the timing correlation. Some workarounds are available. Add an application-level
  fixed delay or random jitter to all authentication responses (success and failure) before
  the fix is applied and/or use rate limiting to reduce the feasibility of statistical timing
  attacks.
