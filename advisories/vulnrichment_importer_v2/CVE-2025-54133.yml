aliases: []
summary: Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. In versions 1.17 through 1.2,
  there is a UI information disclosure vulnerability in Cursor's MCP (Model Context Protocol)
  deeplink handler, allowing attackers to execute 2-click arbitrary system commands through
  social engineering attacks. When users click malicious `cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install`
  links, the installation dialog does not show the arguments being passed to the command being
  run. If a user clicks a malicious deeplink, then examines the installation dialog and clicks
  through, the full command including the arguments will be executed on the machine. This is
  fixed in version 1.3.
