  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  vsock: remove vsock from connected table when connect is interrupted by a signal

  vsock_connect() expects that the socket could already be in the
  TCP_ESTABLISHED state when the connecting task wakes up with a signal
  pending. If this happens the socket will be in the connected table, and
  it is not removed when the socket state is reset. In this situation it's
  common for the process to retry connect(), and if the connection is
  successful the socket will be added to the connected table a second
  time, corrupting the list.

  Prevent this by calling vsock_remove_connected() if a signal is received
  while waiting for a connection. This is harmless if the socket is not in
  the connected table, and if it is in the table then removing it will
  prevent list corruption from a double add.

  Note for backporting: this patch requires d5afa82c977e ("vsock: correct
  removal of socket from the list"), which is in all current stable trees
  except 4.9.y.
