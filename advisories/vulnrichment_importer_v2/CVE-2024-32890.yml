aliases: []
summary: librespeed/speedtest is an open source, self-hosted speed test for HTML5. In affected
  versions missing neutralization of the ISP information in a speedtest result leads to stored
  Cross-site scripting in the JSON API. The `processedString` field in the `ispinfo` parameter
  is missing neutralization. It is stored when a user submits a speedtest result to the telemetry
  API (`results/telemetry.php`) and returned in the JSON API (`results/json.php`). This vulnerability
  has been introduced in commit 3937b94. This vulnerability affects LibreSpeed speedtest instances
  running version 5.2.5 or higher which have telemetry enabled and has been addressed in version
  5.3.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
