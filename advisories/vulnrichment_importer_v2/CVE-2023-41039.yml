aliases: []
summary: RestrictedPython is a restricted execution environment for Python to run untrusted
  code. Python's "format" functionality allows someone controlling the format string to "read"
  all objects accessible through recursive attribute lookup and subscription from objects he
  can access. This can lead to critical information disclosure. With `RestrictedPython`, the
  format functionality is available via the `format` and `format_map` methods of `str` (and
  `unicode`) (accessed either via the class or its instances) and via `string.Formatter`. All
  known versions of `RestrictedPython` are vulnerable. This issue has been addressed in commit
  `4134aedcff1` which has been included in the 5.4 and 6.2 releases. Users are advised to upgrade.
  There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
