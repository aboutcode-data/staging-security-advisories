aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in one of the diagnostic test CLI commands on Cisco Industrial Ethernet
  4010 Series Switches running Cisco IOS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker
  to impact the stability of the device. This could result in arbitrary code execution or a
  denial of service (DoS) condition. The attacker has to have valid user credentials at privilege
  level 15. The vulnerability is due to a diagnostic test CLI command that allows the attacker
  to write to the device memory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating
  to the targeted device and issuing a specific diagnostic test command at the CLI. An exploit
  could allow the attacker to overwrite system memory locations, which could have a negative
  impact on the stability of the device. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf71150.'
