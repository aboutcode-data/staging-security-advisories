aliases: []
summary: pypdf is a free and open-source pure-python PDF library. Prior to version 6.6.0, pypdf
  has possible long runtimes for missing /Root object with large /Size values. An attacker who
  uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to possibly long runtimes for actually
  invalid files. This can be achieved by omitting the /Root entry in the trailer, while using
  a rather large /Size value. Only the non-strict reading mode is affected. This issue has been
  patched in version 6.6.0.
