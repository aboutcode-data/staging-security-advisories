aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) management of Cisco IOS Software
  and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to prevent an affected
  device from resolving ARP entries for legitimate hosts on the connected subnets. This vulnerability
  exists because ARP entries are mismanaged. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
  continuously sending traffic that results in incomplete ARP entries. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to cause ARP requests on the device to be unsuccessful for legitimate
  hosts, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
