aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the TCP throttling process of Cisco Prime Network could allow an
  unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected
  device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient rate limiting protection for TCP listening
  ports. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending the affected device a high
  rate of TCP SYN packets to the local IP address of the targeted application. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to consume a high amount of memory and
  become slow, or to stop accepting new TCP connections to the application. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg48152.'
