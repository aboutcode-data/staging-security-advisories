aliases: []
summary: "Apache OpenOffice documents can contain links. A missing Authorization vulnerability\
  \ in Apache OpenOffice allowed an attacker to craft a document that would cause external links\
  \ \nto be loaded without prompt. Such links could also be used to transmit system information,\
  \ such as environment variables or configuration settings.\n\nIn the affected versions of\
  \ Apache OpenOffice, documents that used a certain URI scheme linking to external files would\
  \ \nload the contents of such files without prompting the user for \npermission to do so.\
  \ Such URI scheme allows to include system configuration data, that is not supposed to be\
  \ transmitted externally.\n\nThis issue affects Apache OpenOffice: through 4.1.15.\n\nUsers\
  \ are recommended to upgrade to version 4.1.16, which fixes the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LibreOffice\
  \ suite reported this issue as CVE-2024-12426."
