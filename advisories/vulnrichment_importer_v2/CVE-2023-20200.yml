summary: "A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) service of Cisco\
  \ FXOS Software for Firepower 4100 Series and Firepower 9300 Security Appliances and of Cisco\
  \ UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause\
  \ a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due\
  \ to the improper handling of specific SNMP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by sending a crafted SNMP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow\
  \ the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\
  \ Note: This vulnerability affects all supported SNMP versions. To exploit this vulnerability\
  \ through SNMPv2c or earlier, an attacker must know the SNMP community string that is configured\
  \ on an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability through SNMPv3, the attacker must have\
  \ valid credentials for an SNMP user who is configured on the affected device."
