summary: A vulnerability has been identified in SINEC NMS (All versions >= V1.0.3 < V2.0), SINEC
  NMS (All versions < V1.0.3), SINEMA Server V14 (All versions). The affected system allows
  to upload JSON objects that are deserialized to Java objects. Due to insecure deserialization
  of user-supplied content by the affected software, a privileged attacker could exploit this
  vulnerability by sending a maliciously crafted serialized Java object. This could allow the
  attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device with root privileges.
