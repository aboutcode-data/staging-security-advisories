aliases: []
summary: Umbraco, a free and open source .NET content management system, has a cross-site scripting
  vulnerability starting in version 14.0.0 and prior to versions 14.3.1 and 15.0.0. This can
  be leveraged to gain access to higher-privilege endpoints, e.g. if you get a user with admin
  privileges to run the code, you can potentially elevate all users and grant them admin privileges
  or access protected content. Versions 14.3.1 and 15.0.0 contain a patch. As a workaround,
  ensure that access to the Dictionary section is only granted to trusted users.
