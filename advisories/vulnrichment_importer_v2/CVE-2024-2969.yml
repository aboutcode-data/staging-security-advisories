aliases: []
summary: The WP-Eggdrop plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in
  all versions up to, and including, 0.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the wpegg_updateOptions() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to update the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
