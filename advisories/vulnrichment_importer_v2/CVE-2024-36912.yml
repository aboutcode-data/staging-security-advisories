  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  Drivers: hv: vmbus: Track decrypted status in vmbus_gpadl

  In CoCo VMs it is possible for the untrusted host to cause
  set_memory_encrypted() or set_memory_decrypted() to fail such that an
  error is returned and the resulting memory is shared. Callers need to
  take care to handle these errors to avoid returning decrypted (shared)
  memory to the page allocator, which could lead to functional or security
  issues.

  In order to make sure callers of vmbus_establish_gpadl() and
  vmbus_teardown_gpadl() don't return decrypted/shared pages to
  allocators, add a field in struct vmbus_gpadl to keep track of the
  decryption status of the buffers. This will allow the callers to
  know if they should free or leak the pages.
