summary: The iframe forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the 'iframe' shortcode in versions up to, and including, 1.0 due to insufficient input
  sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
  contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute
  whenever a user accesses an injected page.
