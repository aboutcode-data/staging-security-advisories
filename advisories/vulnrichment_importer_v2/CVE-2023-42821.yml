aliases: []
summary: The package `github.com/gomarkdown/markdown` is a Go library for parsing Markdown text
  and rendering as HTML. Prior to pseudoversion `0.0.0-20230922105210-14b16010c2ee`, which corresponds
  with commit `14b16010c2ee7ff33a940a541d993bd043a88940`, parsing malformed markdown input with
  parser that uses parser.Mmark extension could result in out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
  To exploit the vulnerability, parser needs to have `parser.Mmark` extension set. The panic
  occurs inside the `citation.go` file on the line 69 when the parser tries to access the element
  past its length. This can result in a denial of service. Commit `14b16010c2ee7ff33a940a541d993bd043a88940`/pseudoversion
  `0.0.0-20230922105210-14b16010c2ee` contains a patch for this issue.
