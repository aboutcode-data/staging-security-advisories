aliases: []
summary: Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open Information
  Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. In versions from 8.0.0 to before 8.0.2, a
  NULL dereference can occur when the entropy keyword is used in conjunction with base64_data.
  This issue has been patched in version 8.0.2. A workaround involves disabling rules that use
  entropy in conjunction with base64_data.
