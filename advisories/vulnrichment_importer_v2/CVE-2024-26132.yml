aliases: []
summary: Element Android is an Android Matrix Client. A third-party malicious application installed
  on the same phone can force Element Android, version 0.91.0 through 1.6.12, to share files
  stored under the `files` directory in the application's private data directory to an arbitrary
  room. The impact of the attack is reduced by the fact that the databases stored in this folder
  are encrypted. However, it contains some other potentially sensitive information, such as
  the FCM token. Forks of Element Android which have set `android:exported="false"` in the `AndroidManifest.xml`
  file for the `IncomingShareActivity` activity are not impacted. This issue is fixed in Element
  Android 1.6.12. There is no known workaround to mitigate the issue.
