summary: 'Multiple vulnerabilities in the implementation of the Common Industrial Protocol (CIP)
  feature in Cisco IOS 12.4 through 15.6 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
  cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The
  vulnerabilities are due to the improper parsing of crafted CIP packets destined to an affected
  device. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted CIP packets to
  be processed by an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause
  the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc43709.'
