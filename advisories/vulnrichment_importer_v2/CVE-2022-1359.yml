aliases: []
summary: The affected On-Premise cnMaestro is vulnerable to an arbitrary file-write through
  improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory inside a specific route. If an
  attacker supplied path traversal charters (../) as part of a filename, the server will save
  the file where the attacker chooses. This could allow an attacker to write any data to any
  file in the server.
