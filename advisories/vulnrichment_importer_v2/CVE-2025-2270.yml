summary: The Countdown, Coming Soon, Maintenance – Countdown & Clock plugin for WordPress is
  vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.9.1 via the createCdObj
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute files
  with the specific filenames on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those
  files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code
  execution in some cases.
