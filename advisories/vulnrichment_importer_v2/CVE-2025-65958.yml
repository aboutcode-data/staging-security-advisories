aliases: []
summary: Open WebUI is a self-hosted artificial intelligence platform designed to operate entirely
  offline. Prior to 0.6.37, a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Open WebUI
  allows any authenticated user to force the server to make HTTP requests to arbitrary URLs.
  This can be exploited to access cloud metadata endpoints (AWS/GCP/Azure), scan internal networks,
  access internal services behind firewalls, and exfiltrate sensitive information. No special
  permissions beyond basic authentication are required. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.37.
