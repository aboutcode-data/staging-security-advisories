aliases: []
summary: Moxa Arm-based industrial computers running Moxa Industrial Linux Secure use a device-unique
  bootloader password provided on the device. An attacker with physical access to the device
  could use this information to access the bootloader menu via a serial interface.  Access to
  the bootloader menu does not allow full system takeover or privilege escalation. The bootloader
  enforces digital signature verification and only permits flashing of Moxa-signed images. As
  a result, an attacker cannot install malicious firmware or execute arbitrary code. The primary
  impact is limited to a potential temporary denial-of-service condition if a valid image is
  reflashed. Remote exploitation is not possible.
