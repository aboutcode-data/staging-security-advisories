aliases: []
summary: "Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. \n\nUsing public\
  \ dashboards users can query multiple distinct data sources using mixed queries. However such\
  \ query has a possibility of crashing a Grafana instance.\n\nThe only feature that uses mixed\
  \ queries at the moment is public dashboards, but it's also possible to cause this by calling\
  \ the query API directly.\n\nThis might enable malicious users to crash Grafana instances\
  \ through that endpoint.\n\nUsers may upgrade to version 9.4.12 and 9.5.3 to receive a fix."
