  x86/MCE/AMD: Fix memory leak when threshold_create_bank() fails

  In mce_threshold_create_device(), if threshold_create_bank() fails, the
  previously allocated threshold banks array @bp will be leaked because
  the call to mce_threshold_remove_device() will not free it.

  This happens because mce_threshold_remove_device() fetches the pointer
  through the threshold_banks per-CPU variable but bp is written there
  only after the bank creation is successful, and not before, when
  threshold_create_bank() fails.

  Add a helper which unwinds all the bank creation work previously done
  and pass into it the previously allocated threshold banks array for
  freeing.
