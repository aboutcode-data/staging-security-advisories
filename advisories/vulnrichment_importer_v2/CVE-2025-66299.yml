aliases: []
summary: Grav is a file-based Web platform. Prior to 1.8.0-beta.27, Grav CMS is vulnerable to
  a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) that allows any authenticated user with editor permissions
  to execute arbitrary code on the remote server, bypassing the existing security sandbox. Since
  the security sandbox does not fully protect the Twig object, it is possible to interact with
  it (e.g., call methods, read/write attributes) through maliciously crafted Twig template directives
  injected into a web page. This allows an authenticated editor to add arbitrary functions to
  the Twig attribute system.twig.safe_filters, effectively bypassing the Grav CMS sandbox. This
  vulnerability is fixed in 1.8.0-beta.27.
