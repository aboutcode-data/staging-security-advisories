aliases: []
summary: GitPython is a python library used to interact with Git repositories. There is an incomplete
  fix for CVE-2023-40590. On Windows, GitPython uses an untrusted search path if it uses a shell
  to run `git`, as well as when it runs `bash.exe` to interpret hooks. If either of those features
  are used on Windows, a malicious `git.exe` or `bash.exe` may be run from an untrusted repository.
  This issue has been patched in version 3.1.41.
