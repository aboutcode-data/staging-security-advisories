summary: The WPML plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions
  up to, and including, 4.6.12 via the Twig Server-Side Template Injection. This is due to missing
  input validation and sanitization on the render function. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to execute code on the server.
