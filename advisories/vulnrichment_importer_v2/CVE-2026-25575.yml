summary: NavigaTUM is a website and API to search for rooms, buildings and other places. Prior
  to commit 86f34c7, there is a path traversal vulnerability in the propose_edits endpoint allows
  unauthenticated users to overwrite files in directories writable by the application user (e.g.,
  /cdn). By supplying unsanitized file keys containing traversal sequences (e.g., ../../) in
  the JSON payload, an attacker can escape the intended temporary directory and replace public
  facing images or fill the server's storage. This issue has been patched via commit 86f34c7.
