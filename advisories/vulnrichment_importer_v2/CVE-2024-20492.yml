aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the restricted shell of Cisco Expressway Series could allow an\
  \ authenticated, local attacker to perform command injection attacks on the underlying operating\
  \ system and elevate privileges to root. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must\
  \ have Administrator-level credentials with read-write privileges on an affected device.\r\
  \n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker\
  \ could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a series of crafted CLI commands. A successful\
  \ exploit could allow the attacker to escape the restricted shell and gain root privileges\
  \ on the underlying operating system of the affected device.\r\nNote: Cisco Expressway Series\
  \ refers to Cisco Expressway Control (Expressway-C) devices and Cisco Expressway Edge (Expressway-E)\
  \ devices."
