summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  io_uring: ensure task_work gets run as part of cancelations

  If we successfully cancel a work item but that work item needs to be
  processed through task_work, then we can be sleeping uninterruptibly
  in io_uring_cancel_generic() and never process it. Hence we don't
  make forward progress and we end up with an uninterruptible sleep
  warning.

  While in there, correct a comment that should be IFF, not IIF.
