  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net/mlx5: DR, Fix slab-out-of-bounds in mlx5_cmd_dr_create_fte

  When adding a rule with 32 destinations, we hit the following out-of-band
  access issue:

    BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in mlx5_cmd_dr_create_fte+0x18ee/0x1e70

  This patch fixes the issue by both increasing the allocated buffers to
  accommodate for the needed actions and by checking the number of actions
  to prevent this issue when a rule with too many actions is provided.
