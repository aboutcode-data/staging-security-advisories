  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  nfc: nci: Fix uninit-value in nci_dev_up and nci_ntf_packet

  syzbot reported the following uninit-value access issue [1][2]:

  nci_rx_work() parses and processes received packet. When the payload
  length is zero, each message type handler reads uninitialized payload
  and KMSAN detects this issue. The receipt of a packet with a zero-size
  payload is considered unexpected, and therefore, such packets should be
  silently discarded.

  This patch resolved this issue by checking payload size before calling
  each message type handler codes.
