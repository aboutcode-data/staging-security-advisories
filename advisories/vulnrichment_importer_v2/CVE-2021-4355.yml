aliases: []
summary: The Welcart e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due
  to missing capability checks on the download_orderdetail_list(), change_orderlist(), and download_member_list()
  functions called via admin_init hooks in versions up to, and including, 2.2.7. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to download lists of members, products and orders.
