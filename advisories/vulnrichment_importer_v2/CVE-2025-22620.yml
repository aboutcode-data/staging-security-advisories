aliases: []
summary: gitoxide is an implementation of git written in Rust. Prior to 0.17.0, gix-worktree-state
  specifies 0777 permissions when checking out executable files, intending that the umask will
  restrict them appropriately. But one of the strategies it uses to set permissions is not subject
  to the umask. This causes files in a repository to be world-writable in some situations. This
  vulnerability is fixed in 0.17.0.
