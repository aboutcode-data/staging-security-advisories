aliases: []
summary: Prior to Apache Commons Net 3.9.0, Net's FTP client trusts the host from PASV response
  by default. A malicious server can redirect the Commons Net code to use a different host,
  but the user has to connect to the malicious server in the first place. This may lead to leakage
  of information about services running on the private network of the client. The default in
  version 3.9.0 is now false to ignore such hosts, as cURL does. See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NET-711.
