aliases: []
summary: Airlink's Daemon interfaces with Docker and the Panel to provide secure access for
  controlling instances via the Panel. In version 1.0.0, an attacker with access to the affected
  container can create symbolic links inside the mounted directory (/app/data). Because the
  container bind-mounts an arbitrary host path, these symlinks can point to sensitive locations
  on the host filesystem. When the application or other processes follow these symlinks, the
  attacker can gain unauthorized read access to host files outside the container. This issue
  has been patched in version 1.0.1.
