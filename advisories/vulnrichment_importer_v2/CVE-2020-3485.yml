aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the role-based access control (RBAC) functionality of the web management
  software of Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director could allow an authenticated, remote attacker
  to access resources that they should not be able to access and perform actions that they should
  not be able to perform. The vulnerability exists because the web management software does
  not properly handle RBAC. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted
  HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view
  and delete certain screen content on the system that the attacker would not normally have
  privileges to access.
