summary: SiYuan is a personal knowledge management system. Prior to 3.5.5, the /api/file/getFile
  endpoint uses case-sensitive string equality checks to block access to sensitive files. On
  case-insensitive file systems such as Windows, attackers can bypass restrictions using mixed-case
  paths and read protected configuration files. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.5.5.
