aliases: []
summary: LobeHub is an open source human-and-AI-agent network. Prior to version 1.143.3, the
  file upload feature in `Knowledge Base > File Upload` does not validate the integrity of the
  upload request, allowing users to intercept and modify the request parameters. As a result,
  it is possible to create arbitrary files in abnormal or unintended paths. In addition, since
  `lobechat.com` relies on the size parameter from the request to calculate file usage, an attacker
  can manipulate this value to misrepresent the actual file size, such as uploading a `1 GB`
  file while reporting it as `10 MB`, or falsely declaring a `10 MB` file as a `1 GB` file.
  By manipulating the size value provided in the client upload request, it is possible to bypass
  the monthly upload quota enforced by the server and continuously upload files beyond the intended
  storage and traffic limits. This abuse can result in a discrepancy between actual resource
  consumption and billing calculations, causing direct financial impact to the service operator.
  Additionally, exhaustion of storage or related resources may lead to degraded service availability,
  including failed uploads, delayed content delivery, or temporary suspension of upload functionality
  for legitimate users. A single malicious user can also negatively affect other users or projects
  sharing the same subscription plan, effectively causing an indirect denial of service (DoS).
  Furthermore, excessive and unaccounted-for uploads can distort monitoring metrics and overload
  downstream systems such as backup processes, malware scanning, and media processing pipelines,
  ultimately undermining overall operational stability and service reliability. Version 1.143.3
  contains a patch for the issue.
