aliases: []
summary: A command injection flaw was found in the "Host Init Config" template in the Foreman
  application via the "Install Packages" field on the "Register Host" page. This flaw allows
  an attacker with the necessary privileges to inject arbitrary commands into the configuration,
  potentially allowing unauthorized command execution during host registration. Although this
  issue requires user interaction to execute injected commands, it poses a significant risk
  if an unsuspecting user runs the generated registration script.
