aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the implementation of the system login block-for command for Cisco
  NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a login process to
  unexpectedly restart, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due
  to a logic error in the implementation of the system login block-for command when an attack
  is detected and acted upon. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing a brute-force
  login attack on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause
  a login process to reload, which could result in a delay during authentication to the affected
  device.
