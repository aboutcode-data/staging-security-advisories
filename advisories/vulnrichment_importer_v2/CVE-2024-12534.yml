aliases: []
summary: In version v0.3.32 of open-webui/open-webui, the application allows users to submit
  large payloads in the email and password fields during the sign-in process due to the lack
  of character length validation on these inputs. This vulnerability can lead to a Denial of
  Service (DoS) condition when a user submits excessively large strings, exhausting server resources
  such as CPU, memory, and disk space, and rendering the service unavailable for legitimate
  users. This makes the server susceptible to resource exhaustion attacks without requiring
  authentication.
