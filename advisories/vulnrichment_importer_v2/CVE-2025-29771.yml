aliases: []
summary: HtmlSanitizer is a client-side HTML Sanitizer. Versions prior to 2.0.3 have a cross-site
  scripting vulnerability when the sanitizer is used with a `contentEditable` element to set
  the elements `innerHTML` to a sanitized string produced by the package. If the code is particularly
  crafted to abuse the code beautifier, that runs AFTER sanitation. The issue is patched in
  version 2.0.3.
