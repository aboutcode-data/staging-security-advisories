summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ptdma: pt_core_execute_cmd() should use spinlock

  The interrupt handler (pt_core_irq_handler()) of the ptdma
  driver can be called from interrupt context. The code flow
  in this function can lead down to pt_core_execute_cmd() which
  will attempt to grab a mutex, which is not appropriate in
  interrupt context and ultimately leads to a kernel panic.
  The fix here changes this mutex to a spinlock, which has
  been verified to resolve the issue.
