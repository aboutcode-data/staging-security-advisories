  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  fs/proc: fix softlockup in __read_vmcore (part 2)

  Since commit 5cbcb62dddf5 ("fs/proc: fix softlockup in __read_vmcore") the
  number of softlockups in __read_vmcore at kdump time have gone down, but
  they still happen sometimes.

  In a memory constrained environment like the kdump image, a softlockup is
  not just a harmless message, but it can interfere with things like RCU
  freeing memory, causing the crashdump to get stuck.

  The second loop in __read_vmcore has a lot more opportunities for natural
  sleep points, like scheduling out while waiting for a data write to
  happen, but apparently that is not always enough.

  Add a cond_resched() to the second loop in __read_vmcore to (hopefully)
  get rid of the softlockups.
