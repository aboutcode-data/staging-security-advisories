  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  x86/fpu: Keep xfd_state in sync with MSR_IA32_XFD

  Commit 672365477ae8 ("x86/fpu: Update XFD state where required") and
  commit 8bf26758ca96 ("x86/fpu: Add XFD state to fpstate") introduced a
  per CPU variable xfd_state to keep the MSR_IA32_XFD value cached, in
  order to avoid unnecessary writes to the MSR.

  On CPU hotplug MSR_IA32_XFD is reset to the init_fpstate.xfd, which
  wipes out any stale state. But the per CPU cached xfd value is not
  reset, which brings them out of sync.

  As a consequence a subsequent xfd_update_state() might fail to update
  the MSR which in turn can result in XRSTOR raising a #NM in kernel
  space, which crashes the kernel.

  To fix this, introduce xfd_set_state() to write xfd_state together
  with MSR_IA32_XFD, and use it in all places that set MSR_IA32_XFD.
