aliases: []
summary: tj-actions/branch-names is a Github actions repository that contains workflows to retrieve
  branch or tag names with support for all events. In versions 8.2.1 and below, a critical vulnerability
  has been identified in the tj-actions/branch-names' GitHub Action workflow which allows arbitrary
  command execution in downstream workflows. This issue arises due to inconsistent input sanitization
  and unescaped output, enabling malicious actors to exploit specially crafted branch names
  or tags. While internal sanitization mechanisms have been implemented, the action outputs
  remain vulnerable, exposing consuming workflows to significant security risks. This is fixed
  in version 9.0.0
