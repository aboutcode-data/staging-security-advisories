aliases: []
summary: The Memos application, up to version v0.24.3, allows for the embedding of markdown
  images with arbitrary URLs. When a user views a memo containing such an image, their browser
  automatically fetches the image URL without explicit user consent or interaction beyond viewing
  the memo. This can be exploited by an attacker to disclose the viewing user's IP address,
  browser User-Agent string, and potentially other request-specific information to the attacker-controlled
  server, leading to information disclosure and user tracking.
