aliases: []
summary: 'An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Packet
  Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on ACX7000 Series allows an unauthenticated
  network-based attacker to cause a partial Denial of Service (DoS). On receipt of specific
  IPv6 transit traffic, Junos OS Evolved on ACX7100-48L, ACX7100-32C and ACX7509 sends this
  traffic to the Routing Engine (RE) instead of forwarding it, leading to increased CPU utilization
  of the RE and a partial DoS. This issue only affects systems configured with IPv6. This issue
  does not affect ACX7024 which is supported from 22.3R1-EVO onwards where the fix has already
  been incorporated as indicated in the solution section. This issue affects Juniper Networks
  Junos OS Evolved on ACX7100-48L, ACX7100-32C, ACX7509: 21.1-EVO versions prior to 21.1R3-S2-EVO;
  21.2-EVO versions prior to 21.2R3-S2-EVO; 21.3-EVO versions prior to 21.3R3-EVO; 21.4-EVO
  versions prior to 21.4R1-S1-EVO, 21.4R2-EVO. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos
  OS Evolved versions prior to 21.1R1-EVO.'
