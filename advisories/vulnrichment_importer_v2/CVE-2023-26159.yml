aliases: []
summary: Versions of the package follow-redirects before 1.15.4 are vulnerable to Improper Input
  Validation due to the improper handling of URLs by the url.parse() function. When new URL()
  throws an error, it can be manipulated to misinterpret the hostname. An attacker could exploit
  this weakness to redirect traffic to a malicious site, potentially leading to information
  disclosure, phishing attacks, or other security breaches.
