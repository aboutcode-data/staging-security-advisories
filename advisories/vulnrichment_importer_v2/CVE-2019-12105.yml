summary: 'In Supervisor through 4.0.2, an unauthenticated user can read log files or restart
  a service. Note: The maintainer responded that the affected component, inet_http_server, is
  not enabled by default but if the user enables it and does not set a password, Supervisor
  logs a warning message. The maintainer indicated the ability to run an open server will not
  be removed but an additional warning was added to the documentation'
