aliases: []
summary: MinIO Java SDK is a Simple Storage Service (aka S3) client to perform bucket and object
  operations to any Amazon S3 compatible object storage service. In minio-java versions prior
  to 8.6.0, XML tag values containing references to system properties or environment variables
  were automatically substituted with their actual values during processing. This unintended
  behavior could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, including credentials, file
  paths, or system configuration details, if such references were present in XML content from
  untrusted sources. This is fixed in version 8.6.0.
