aliases: []
summary: Contacts app for Nextcloud easily syncs contacts from various devices with your Nextcloud
  and allows editing. The unsanitized SVG is converted to a JavaScript blob (in memory data)
  that the Avatar can't render. Due to this constellation the missing sanitization does not
  seem to be exploitable. It is recommended that the Contacts app is upgraded to 5.0.3 or 4.2.4
