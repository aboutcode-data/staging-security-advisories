aliases: []
summary: 'Untrusted search path vulnerability in the installation functionality in Ruby 1.9.3-p194,
  when installed in the top-level C:\ directory, might allow local users to gain privileges
  via a Trojan horse DLL in the C:\Ruby193\bin directory, which may be added to the PATH system
  environment variable by an administrator, as demonstrated by a Trojan horse wlbsctrl.dll file
  used by the "IKE and AuthIP IPsec Keying Modules" system service in Windows Vista SP1, Windows
  Server 2008 SP2, Windows 7 SP1, and Windows 8 Release Preview.  NOTE: CVE disputes this issue
  because the unsafe PATH is established only by a separate administrative action that is not
  a default part of the Ruby installation'
