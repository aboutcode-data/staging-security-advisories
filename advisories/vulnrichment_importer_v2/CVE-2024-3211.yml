aliases: []
summary: The Shopping Cart & eCommerce Store plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection
  via the 'productid' attribute of the ec_addtocart shortcode in all versions up to, and including,
  5.6.3 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation
  on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
  access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can
  be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
