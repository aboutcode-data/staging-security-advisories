summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Integrated Management
  Controller (IMC) Supervisor, Cisco UCS Director, and Cisco UCS Director Express for Big Data
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.
  The vulnerability is due to a missing authentication check in an API call. An attacker who
  can send a request to an affected system could cause all currently authenticated users to
  be logged off. Repeated exploitation could cause the inability to maintain a session in the
  web-based management portal.
