aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in powermail extension through 12.3.5 for TYPO3. Several actions
  in the OutputController can directly be called, due to missing or insufficiently implemented
  access checks, resulting in Broken Access Control. Depending on the configuration of the Powermail
  Frontend plugins, an unauthenticated attacker can exploit this to edit, update, delete, or
  export data of persisted forms. This can only be exploited when the Powermail Frontend plugins
  are used. The fixed versions are 7.5.0, 8.5.0, 10.9.0, and 12.4.0.
