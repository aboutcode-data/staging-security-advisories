aliases: []
summary: The Essential Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object
  Injection in all versions up to, and including, 5.9.13 via deserialization of untrusted input
  from the 'error_resetpassword' attribute of the "Login | Register Form" widget (disabled by
  default). This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and
  above, to inject a PHP Object. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme
  installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve
  sensitive data, or execute code.
