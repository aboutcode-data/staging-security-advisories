  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  Bluetooth: hci_core: cancel all works upon hci_unregister_dev()

  syzbot is reporting that calling hci_release_dev() from hci_error_reset()
  due to hci_dev_put() from hci_error_reset() can cause deadlock at
  destroy_workqueue(), for hci_error_reset() is called from
  hdev->req_workqueue which destroy_workqueue() needs to flush.

  We need to make sure that hdev->{rx_work,cmd_work,tx_work} which are
  queued into hdev->workqueue and hdev->{power_on,error_reset} which are
  queued into hdev->req_workqueue are no longer running by the moment

         destroy_workqueue(hdev->workqueue);
         destroy_workqueue(hdev->req_workqueue);

  are called from hci_release_dev().

  Call cancel_work_sync() on these work items from hci_unregister_dev()
  as soon as hdev->list is removed from hci_dev_list.
