  wifi: rtw89: chan: fix soft lockup in rtw89_entity_recalc_mgnt_roles()

  During rtw89_entity_recalc_mgnt_roles(), there is a normalizing process
  which will re-order the list if an entry with target pattern is found.
  And once one is found, should have aborted the list_for_each_entry. But,
  `break` just aborted the inner for-loop. The outer list_for_each_entry
  still continues. Normally, only the first entry will match the target
  pattern, and the re-ordering will change nothing, so there won't be
  soft lockup. However, in some special cases, soft lockup would happen.

  Fix it by `goto fill` to break from the list_for_each_entry.

  The following is a sample of kernel log for this problem.
