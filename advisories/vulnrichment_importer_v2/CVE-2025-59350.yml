aliases: []
summary: Dragonfly is an open source P2P-based file distribution and image acceleration system.
  Prior to 2.1.0, the access control mechanism for the Proxy feature uses simple string comparisons
  and is therefore vulnerable to timing attacks. An attacker may try to guess the password one
  character at a time by sending all possible characters to a vulnerable mechanism and measuring
  the comparison instruction’s execution times. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.1.0.
