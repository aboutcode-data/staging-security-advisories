aliases: []
summary: Password recovery vulnerability in SICK SIM1004 Partnumber 1098148 with firmware version
  <2.0.0 allows an unprivileged remote attacker to gain access to the userlevel defined as RecoverableUserLevel
  by invocating the password recovery mechanism method. This leads to an increase in their privileges
  on the system and thereby affecting the confidentiality integrity and availability of the
  system. An attacker can expect repeatable success by exploiting the vulnerability. The recommended
  solution is to update the firmware to a version >= 2.0.0 as soon as possible (available in
  SICK Support Portal).
