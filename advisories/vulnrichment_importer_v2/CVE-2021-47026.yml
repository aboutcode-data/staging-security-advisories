  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  RDMA/rtrs-clt: destroy sysfs after removing session from active list

  A session can be removed dynamically by sysfs interface "remove_path" that
  eventually calls rtrs_clt_remove_path_from_sysfs function.  The current
  rtrs_clt_remove_path_from_sysfs first removes the sysfs interfaces and
  frees sess->stats object. Second it removes the session from the active
  list.

  Therefore some functions could access non-connected session and access the
  freed sess->stats object even-if they check the session status before
  accessing the session.

  For instance rtrs_clt_request and get_next_path_min_inflight check the
  session status and try to send IO to the session.  The session status
  could be changed when they are trying to send IO but they could not catch
  the change and update the statistics information in sess->stats object,
  and generate use-after-free problem.
  (see: "RDMA/rtrs-clt: Check state of the rtrs_clt_sess before reading its
  stats")

  This patch changes the rtrs_clt_remove_path_from_sysfs to remove the
  session from the active session list and then destroy the sysfs
  interfaces.

  Each function still should check the session status because closing or
  error recovery paths can change the status.
