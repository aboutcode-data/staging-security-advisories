aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in zola 0.13.0 through 0.17.2. The custom implementation of
  a web server, available via the "zola serve" command, allows directory traversal. The handle_request
  function, used by the server to process HTTP requests, does not account for sequences of special
  path control characters (../) in the URL when serving a file, which allows one to escape the
  webroot of the server and read arbitrary files from the filesystem.
