aliases: []
summary: The WP Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file update due to missing
  file path validation in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.9.1. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to overwrite arbitrary
  files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible assuming
  the files can be written to by the web server.
