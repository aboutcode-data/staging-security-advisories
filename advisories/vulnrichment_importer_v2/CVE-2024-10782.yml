summary: The Theme Builder For Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.2 via the 'elementor-template' shortcode due to
  insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract data from private or draft
  posts created by Elementor that they should not have access to.
