aliases: []
summary: A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the input parsing logic of Arcserve
  Unified Data Protection (UDP). This flaw can be triggered without authentication by sending
  specially crafted input to the target system. Improper bounds checking allows an attacker
  to overwrite heap memory, potentially leading to application crashes or remote code execution.
  Exploitation occurs in the context of the affected process and does not require user interaction.
  The vulnerability poses a high risk due to its pre-authentication nature and potential for
  full compromise. This vulnerability affects all UDP versions prior to 10.2. UDP 10.2 includes
  the necessary patches and requires no action. Versions 8.0 through 10.1 are supported and
  require either patch application or upgrade to 10.2. Versions 7.x and earlier are unsupported
  or out of maintenance and must be upgraded to 10.2 to remediate the issue.
