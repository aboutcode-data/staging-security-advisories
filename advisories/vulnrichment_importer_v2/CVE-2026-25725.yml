aliases: []
summary: Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. Prior to version 2.1.2, Claude Code's bubblewrap
  sandboxing mechanism failed to properly protect the .claude/settings.json configuration file
  when it did not exist at startup. While the parent directory was mounted as writable and .claude/settings.local.json
  was explicitly protected with read-only constraints, settings.json was not protected if it
  was missing. This allowed malicious code running inside the sandbox to create this file and
  inject persistent hooks (such as SessionStart commands) that would execute with host privileges
  when Claude Code was restarted. This issue has been patched in version 2.1.2.
