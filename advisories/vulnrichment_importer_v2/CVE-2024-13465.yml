summary: The aBlocks – WordPress Gutenberg Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
  Cross-Site Scripting via the "Table Of Content" Block, specifically in the "markerView" attribute,
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
  escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access
  and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
  an injected page.
