summary: 'Reolink Video Doorbell WiFi DB_566128M5MP_W performs insufficient validation of firmware
  update signatures. This allows attackers to load malicious firmware images, resulting in arbitrary
  code execution with root privileges. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because the integrity
  of updates is instead assured via a "private encryption algorithm" and other "tamper-proof
  verification."'
