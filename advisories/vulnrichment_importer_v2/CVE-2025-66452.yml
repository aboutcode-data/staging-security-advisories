aliases: []
summary: LibreChat is a ChatGPT clone with additional features. In versions 0.8.0 and below,
  there is no handler for JSON parsing errors; SyntaxError from express.json() includes user
  input in the error message, which gets reflected in responses. User input (including HTML/JavaScript)
  can be exposed in error responses, creating an XSS risk if Content-Type isn't strictly enforced.
  This issue does not have a fix at the time of publication.
