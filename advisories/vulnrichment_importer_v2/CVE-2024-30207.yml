summary: "A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780-0DA00)\
  \ (All versions < V3.0.1.1), SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780-0DA10) (All versions <\
  \ V3.0.1.1), SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780-0DA20) (All versions < V3.0.1.1), SIMATIC\
  \ RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780-0DA30) (All versions < V3.0.1.1), SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager\
  \ (6GT2780-1EA10) (All versions < V3.0.1.1), SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780-1EA20)\
  \ (All versions < V3.0.1.1), SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780-1EA30) (All versions <\
  \ V3.0.1.1). The affected systems use symmetric cryptography with a hard-coded key to protect\
  \ the communication between client and server. This could allow an unauthenticated remote\
  \ attacker to compromise confidentiality and integrity of the communication and, subsequently,\
  \ availability of the system.\r\nA successful exploit requires the attacker to gain knowledge\
  \ of the hard-coded key and to be able to intercept the communication between client and server\
  \ on the network."
