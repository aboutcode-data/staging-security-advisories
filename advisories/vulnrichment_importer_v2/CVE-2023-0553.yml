summary: The Quick Restaurant Menu plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via its settings parameters in versions up to, and including, 2.0.2 due to insufficient input
  sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
  administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
  execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
