aliases: []
summary: The User Role Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 4.64.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the update_roles() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add
  or remove roles for arbitrary users, including escalating their privileges to administrator,
  via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
  such as clicking on a link.
