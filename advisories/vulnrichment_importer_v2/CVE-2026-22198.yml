aliases: []
summary: GestSup versions prior to 3.2.60 contain a pre-authentication stored cross-site scripting
  (XSS) vulnerability in the API error logging functionality. By sending an API request with
  a crafted X-API-KEY header value (for example, to /api/v1/ticket.php), an unauthenticated
  attacker can cause attacker-controlled HTML/JavaScript to be written to log entries. When
  an administrator later views the affected logs in the web interface, the injected content
  is rendered without proper output encoding, resulting in arbitrary script execution in the
  administrator’s browser session.
