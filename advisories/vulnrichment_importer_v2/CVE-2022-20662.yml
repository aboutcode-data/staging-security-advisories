aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the smart card login authentication of Cisco Duo for macOS could
  allow an unauthenticated attacker with physical access to bypass authentication. This vulnerability
  exists because the assigned user of a smart card is not properly matched with the authenticating
  user. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by configuring a smart card login to bypass
  Duo authentication. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use any personal identity
  verification (PIV) smart card for authentication, even if the smart card is not assigned to
  the authenticating user.
