aliases: []
summary: "Unchecked Error Condition vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. If Tomcat is configured\
  \ to use a custom Jakarta Authentication (formerly JASPIC) ServerAuthContext component which\
  \ may throw an exception during the authentication process without explicitly setting an HTTP\
  \ status to indicate failure, the authentication may not fail, allowing the user to bypass\
  \ the authentication process. There are no known Jakarta Authentication components that behave\
  \ in this way.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M26, from\
  \ 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.30, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.95.\n\nThe following versions were\
  \ EOL at the time the CVE was created but are \nknown to be affected: 8.5.0 though 8.5.100. Other\
  \ EOL versions may also be affected.\n\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0,\
  \ 10.1.31 or 9.0.96, which fix the issue."
