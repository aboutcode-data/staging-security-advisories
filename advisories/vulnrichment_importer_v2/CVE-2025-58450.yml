aliases: []
summary: pREST (PostgreSQL REST), is an API that delivers an application on top of a Postgres
  database. SQL injection is possible in versions prior to 2.0.0-rc3. The validation present
  in versions prior to 2.0.0-rc3 does not provide adequate protection from injection attempts.
  Version 2.0.0-rc3 contains a patch to mitigate such attempts.
