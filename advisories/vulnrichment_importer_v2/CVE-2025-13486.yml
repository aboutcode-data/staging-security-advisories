aliases: []
summary: 'The Advanced Custom Fields: Extended plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote
  Code Execution in versions 0.9.0.5 through 0.9.1.1 via the prepare_form() function. This is
  due to the function accepting user input and then passing that through call_user_func_array().
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server,
  which can be leveraged to inject backdoors or create new administrative user accounts.'
