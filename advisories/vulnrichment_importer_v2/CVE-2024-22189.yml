aliases: []
summary: quic-go is an implementation of the QUIC protocol in Go. Prior to version 0.42.0, an
  attacker can cause its peer to run out of memory sending a large number of `NEW_CONNECTION_ID`
  frames that retire old connection IDs. The receiver is supposed to respond to each retirement
  frame with a `RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID` frame. The attacker can prevent the receiver from sending
  out (the vast majority of) these `RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID` frames by collapsing the peers congestion
  window (by selectively acknowledging received packets) and by manipulating the peer's RTT
  estimate. Version 0.42.0 contains a patch for the issue. No known workarounds are available.
