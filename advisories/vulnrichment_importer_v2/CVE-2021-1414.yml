aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco RV340, RV340W,
  RV345, and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker
  to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges equivalent to the web service process on
  an affected device. These vulnerabilities exist because HTTP requests are not properly validated.
  An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web-based
  management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to remotely execute arbitrary code on the device.
