aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the IPv6 implementation of Cisco StarOS could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability
  is due to insufficient validation of incoming IPv6 traffic. An attacker could exploit this
  vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv6 packet to an affected device with the goal of reaching
  the vulnerable section of the input buffer. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability is specific
  to IPv6 traffic. IPv4 traffic is not affected.
