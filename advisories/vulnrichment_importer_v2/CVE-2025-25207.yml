aliases: []
summary: The Authorino service in the Red Hat Connectivity Link is the authorization service
  for zero trust API security. Authorino allows the users with developer persona to add callbacks
  to be executed to HTTP endpoints once the authorization process is completed. It was found
  that an attacker with developer persona access can add a large number of those callbacks to
  be executed by Authorino and as the authentication policy is enforced by a single instance
  of the service, this leada to a Denial of Service in Authorino while processing the post-authorization
  callbacks.
