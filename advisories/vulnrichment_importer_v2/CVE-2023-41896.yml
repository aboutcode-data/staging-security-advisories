aliases: []
summary: Home assistant is an open source home automation. Whilst auditing the frontend code
  to identify hidden parameters, Cure53 detected `auth_callback=1`, which is leveraged by the
  WebSocket authentication logic in tandem with the `state` parameter. The state parameter contains
  the `hassUrl`, which is subsequently utilized to establish a WebSocket connection. This behavior
  permits an attacker to create a malicious Home Assistant link with a modified state parameter
  that forces the frontend to connect to an alternative WebSocket backend. Henceforth, the attacker
  can spoof any WebSocket responses and trigger cross site scripting (XSS). Since the XSS is
  executed on the actual Home Assistant frontend domain, it can connect to the real Home Assistant
  backend, which essentially represents a comprehensive takeover scenario. Permitting the site
  to be iframed by other origins, as discussed in GHSA-935v-rmg9-44mw, renders this exploit
  substantially covert since a malicious website can obfuscate the compromise strategy in the
  background. However, even without this, the attacker can still send the `auth_callback` link
  directly to the victim user. To mitigate this issue, Cure53 advises modifying the WebSocket
  code’s authentication flow. An optimal implementation in this regard would not trust the `hassUrl`
  passed in by a GET parameter. Cure53 must stipulate the significant time required of the Cure53
  consultants to identify an XSS vector, despite holding full control over the WebSocket responses.
  In many areas, data from the WebSocket was properly sanitized, which hinders post-exploitation.
  The audit team eventually detected the `js_url` for custom panels, though generally, the frontend
  exhibited reasonable security hardening. This issue has been addressed in Home Assistant Core
  version 2023.8.0 and in the npm package home-assistant-js-websocket in version 8.2.0. Users
  are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
