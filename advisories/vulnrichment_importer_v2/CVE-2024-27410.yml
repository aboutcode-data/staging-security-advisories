  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  wifi: nl80211: reject iftype change with mesh ID change

  It's currently possible to change the mesh ID when the
  interface isn't yet in mesh mode, at the same time as
  changing it into mesh mode. This leads to an overwrite
  of data in the wdev->u union for the interface type it
  currently has, causing cfg80211_change_iface() to do
  wrong things when switching.

  We could probably allow setting an interface to mesh
  while setting the mesh ID at the same time by doing a
  different order of operations here, but realistically
  there's no userspace that's going to do this, so just
  disallow changes in iftype when setting mesh ID.
