aliases: []
summary: The Ads Pro Plugin - Multi-Purpose WordPress Advertising Manager plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 4.89 via the 'bsa_template'
  parameter of the `bsa_preview_callback` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of
  any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive
  data, or achieve code execution in cases .php files can can be uploaded and included, or already
  exist on the site.
