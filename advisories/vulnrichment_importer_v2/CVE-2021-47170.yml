summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  USB: usbfs: Don't WARN about excessively large memory allocations

  Syzbot found that the kernel generates a WARNing if the user tries to
  submit a bulk transfer through usbfs with a buffer that is way too
  large.  This isn't a bug in the kernel; it's merely an invalid request
  from the user and the usbfs code does handle it correctly.

  In theory the same thing can happen with async transfers, or with the
  packet descriptor table for isochronous transfers.

  To prevent the MM subsystem from complaining about these bad
  allocation requests, add the __GFP_NOWARN flag to the kmalloc calls
  for these buffers.
