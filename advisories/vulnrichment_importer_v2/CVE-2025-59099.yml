aliases: []
summary: "The Access Manager is using the open source web server CompactWebServer written in\
  \ C#. This web server is affected by a path traversal vulnerability, which allows an attacker\
  \ to directly access files via simple GET requests without prior authentication. \n\nHence,\
  \ it is possible to retrieve all files stored on the file system, including the SQLite database\
  \ Database.sq3, containing badge information and the corresponding PIN codes. Additionally,\
  \ when trying to access certain files, the web server crashes and becomes unreachable for\
  \ about 60 seconds. This can be abused to continuously send the request and cause denial of\
  \ service."
