summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfork: defer\
  \ linking file vma until vma is fully initialized\n\nThorvald reported a WARNING [1]. And\
  \ the root cause is below race:\n\n CPU 1\t\t\t\t\tCPU 2\n fork\t\t\t\t\thugetlbfs_fallocate\n\
  \  dup_mmap\t\t\t\t hugetlbfs_punch_hole\n   i_mmap_lock_write(mapping);\n   vma_interval_tree_insert_after\
  \ -- Child vma is visible through i_mmap tree.\n   i_mmap_unlock_write(mapping);\n   hugetlb_dup_vma_private\
  \ -- Clear vma_lock outside i_mmap_rwsem!\n\t\t\t\t\t i_mmap_lock_write(mapping);\n   \t\t\
  \t\t\t hugetlb_vmdelete_list\n\t\t\t\t\t  vma_interval_tree_foreach\n\t\t\t\t\t   hugetlb_vma_trylock_write\
  \ -- Vma_lock is cleared.\n   tmp->vm_ops->open -- Alloc new vma_lock outside i_mmap_rwsem!\n\
  \t\t\t\t\t   hugetlb_vma_unlock_write -- Vma_lock is assigned!!!\n\t\t\t\t\t i_mmap_unlock_write(mapping);\n\
  \nhugetlb_dup_vma_private() and hugetlb_vm_op_open() are called outside\ni_mmap_rwsem lock\
  \ while vma lock can be used in the same time.  Fix this\nby deferring linking file vma until\
  \ vma is fully initialized.  Those vmas\nshould be initialized first before they can be used."
