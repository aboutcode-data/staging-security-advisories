summary: 'An Out-of-Bounds Write vulnerability in Flow Processing Daemon (flowd) of Juniper
  Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause Denial of Service
  (DoS). On SRX Series devices using Unified Policies with IPv6, when a specific IPv6 packet
  goes through a dynamic-application filter which will generate an ICMP deny message, the flowd
  core is observed and the PFE is restarted. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS on
  SRX Series: 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R3-S6; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S6; 19.4 versions
