aliases: []
summary: Minio is a Multi-Cloud Object Storage framework. Starting with RELEASE.2020-12-23T02-24-12Z
  and prior to RELEASE.2023-03-13T19-46-17Z, a user with `consoleAdmin` permissions can potentially
  create a user that matches the root credential `accessKey`. Once this user is created successfully,
  the root credential ceases to work appropriately. The issue is patched in RELEASE.2023-03-13T19-46-17Z.
  There are ways to work around this via adding higher privileges to the disabled root user
  via `mc admin policy set`.
