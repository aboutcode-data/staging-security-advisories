summary: "** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED **\n\nWhen using the Chainsaw or SocketAppender components\
  \ with Log4j 1.x on JRE less than 1.7, an attacker that manages to cause a logging entry involving\
  \ a specially-crafted (ie, deeply nested) \nhashmap or hashtable (depending on which logging\
  \ component is in use) to be processed could exhaust the available memory in the virtual machine\
  \ and achieve Denial of Service when the object is deserialized.\n\nThis issue affects Apache\
  \ Log4j before 2. Affected users are recommended to update to Log4j 2.x.\n\nNOTE: This vulnerability\
  \ only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer."
