summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  gfs2: Fix slab-use-after-free in gfs2_qd_dealloc

  In gfs2_put_super(), whether withdrawn or not, the quota should
  be cleaned up by gfs2_quota_cleanup().

  Otherwise, struct gfs2_sbd will be freed before gfs2_qd_dealloc (rcu
  callback) has run for all gfs2_quota_data objects, resulting in
  use-after-free.

  Also, gfs2_destroy_threads() and gfs2_quota_cleanup() is already called
  by gfs2_make_fs_ro(), so in gfs2_put_super(), after calling
  gfs2_make_fs_ro(), there is no need to call them again.
