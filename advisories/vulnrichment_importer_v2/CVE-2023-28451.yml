aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Technitium 11.0.2. There is a vulnerability (called BadDNS)
  in DNS resolving software, which triggers a resolver to ignore valid responses, thus causing
  DoS (denial of service) for normal resolution. The effects of an exploit would be widespread
  and highly impactful, because the attacker could just forge a response targeting the source
  port of a vulnerable resolver without the need to guess the correct TXID.
