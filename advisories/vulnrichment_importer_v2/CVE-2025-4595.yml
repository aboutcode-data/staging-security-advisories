aliases: []
summary: The FastSpring plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via
  the plugin's 'fastspring/block-fastspringblocks-complete-product-catalog' block in all versions
  up to, and including, 3.0.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on
  the 'color' attribute. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses an injected page.
