aliases: []
summary: 'n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. Versions starting with 0.211.0
  and prior to 1.120.4, 1.121.1, and 1.122.0 contain a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  vulnerability in their workflow expression evaluation system. Under certain conditions, expressions
  supplied by authenticated users during workflow configuration may be evaluated in an execution
  context that is not sufficiently isolated from the underlying runtime. An authenticated attacker
  could abuse this behavior to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the n8n process.
  Successful exploitation may lead to full compromise of the affected instance, including unauthorized
  access to sensitive data, modification of workflows, and execution of system-level operations.
  This issue has been fixed in versions 1.120.4, 1.121.1, and 1.122.0. Users are strongly advised
  to upgrade to a patched version, which introduces additional safeguards to restrict expression
  evaluation. If upgrading is not immediately possible, administrators should consider the following
  temporary mitigations: Limit workflow creation and editing permissions to fully trusted users
  only; and/or deploy n8n in a hardened environment with restricted operating system privileges
  and network access to reduce the impact of potential exploitation. These workarounds do not
  fully eliminate the risk and should only be used as short-term measures.'
