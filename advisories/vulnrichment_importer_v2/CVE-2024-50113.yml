  firewire: core: fix invalid port index for parent device

  In a commit 24b7f8e5cd65 ("firewire: core: use helper functions for self
  ID sequence"), the enumeration over self ID sequence was refactored with
  some helper functions with KUnit tests. These helper functions are
  guaranteed to work expectedly by the KUnit tests, however their application
  includes a mistake to assign invalid value to the index of port connected
  to parent device.

  This bug affects the case that any extra node devices which has three or
  more ports are connected to 1394 OHCI controller. In the case, the path
  to update the tree cache could hits WARN_ON(), and gets general protection
  fault due to the access to invalid address computed by the invalid value.

  This commit fixes the bug to assign correct port index.
