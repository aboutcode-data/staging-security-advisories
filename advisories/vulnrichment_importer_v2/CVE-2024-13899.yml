aliases: []
summary: The Mambo Importer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all
  versions up to, and including, 1.0 via deserialization of untrusted input via the $data parameter
  in the fImportMenu function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level
  access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable
  software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing
  a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or
  theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete
  arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present.
