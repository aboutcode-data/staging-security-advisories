aliases: []
summary: Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP
  components. Symfony's HttpFoundation component defines an object-oriented layer for the HTTP
  specification. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 5.4.50, 6.4.29, and 7.3.7, the
  `Request` class improperly interprets some `PATH_INFO` in a way that leads to representing
  some URLs with a path that doesn't start with a `/`. This can allow bypassing some access
  control rules that are built with this `/`-prefix assumption. Starting in versions 5.4.50,
  6.4.29, and 7.3.7, the `Request` class now ensures that URL paths always start with a `/`.
