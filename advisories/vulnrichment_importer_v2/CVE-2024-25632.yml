aliases: []
summary: eLabFTW is an open source electronic lab notebook for research labs. In the context
  of eLabFTW, an administrator is a user account with certain privileges to manage users and
  content in their assigned team/teams. A user may be an administrator in one team and a regular
  user in another. The vulnerability allows a regular user to become administrator of a team
  where they are a member, under a reasonable configuration. Additionally, in eLabFTW versions
  subsequent to v5.0.0, the vulnerability may allow an initially unauthenticated user to gain
  administrative privileges over an arbitrary team. The vulnerability does not affect system
  administrator status. Users should upgrade to version 5.1.0. System administrators are advised
  to turn off local user registration, saml_team_create and not allow administrators to import
  users into teams, unless strictly required.
