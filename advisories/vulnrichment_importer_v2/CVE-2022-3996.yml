aliases: []
summary: |
  If an X.509 certificate contains a malformed policy constraint and
  policy processing is enabled, then a write lock will be taken twice
  recursively.  On some operating systems (most widely: Windows) this
  results in a denial of service when the affected process hangs.  Policy
  processing being enabled on a publicly facing server is not considered
  to be a common setup.

  Policy processing is enabled by passing the `-policy'
  argument to the command line utilities or by calling the
  `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.

  Update (31 March 2023): The description of the policy processing enablement
  was corrected based on CVE-2023-0466.
