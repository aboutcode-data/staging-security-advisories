aliases: []
summary: The Hubbub Lite – Fast, free social sharing and follow buttons plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'dpsp_list_attention_search' parameter
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.36.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
  escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
  in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such
  as clicking on a link.
