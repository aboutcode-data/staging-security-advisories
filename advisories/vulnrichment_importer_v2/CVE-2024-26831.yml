  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net/handshake: Fix handshake_req_destroy_test1

  Recently, handshake_req_destroy_test1 started failing:

  Expected handshake_req_destroy_test == req, but
      handshake_req_destroy_test == 0000000000000000
      req == 0000000060f99b40
  not ok 11 req_destroy works

  This is because "sock_release(sock)" was replaced with "fput(filp)"
  to address a memory leak. Note that sock_release() is synchronous
  but fput() usually delays the final close and clean-up.

  The delay is not consequential in the other cases that were changed
  but handshake_req_destroy_test1 is testing that handshake_req_cancel()
  followed by closing the file actually does call the ->hp_destroy
  method. Thus the PTR_EQ test at the end has to be sure that the
  final close is complete before it checks the pointer.

  We cannot use a completion here because if ->hp_destroy is never
  called (ie, there is an API bug) then the test will hang.
