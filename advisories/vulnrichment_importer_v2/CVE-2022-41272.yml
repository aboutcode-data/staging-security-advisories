aliases: []
summary: An unauthenticated attacker over the network can attach to an open interface exposed
  through JNDI by the User Defined Search (UDS) of SAP NetWeaver Process Integration (PI) -
  version 7.50 and make use of an open naming and directory API to access services which can
  be used to perform unauthorized operations affecting users and data across the entire system.
  This allows the attacker to have full read access to user data, make limited modifications
  to user data, and degrade the performance of the system, leading to a high impact on confidentiality
  and a limited impact on the availability and integrity of the application.
