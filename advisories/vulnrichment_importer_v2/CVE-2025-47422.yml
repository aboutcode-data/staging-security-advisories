aliases: []
summary: Advanced Installer before 22.6 has an uncontrolled search path element local privilege
  escalation vulnerability. When running as SYSTEM in certain configurations, Advanced Installer
  looks in standard-user writable locations for non-existent binaries and executes them as SYSTEM.
  A low-privileged attacker can place a malicious binary in a targeted folder; when the installer
  is executed, the attacker achieves arbitrary SYSTEM code execution.
