summary: Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows NT-based
  operating systems. In versions 1.16.1 and below, a critical security vulnerability exists
  in password handling mechanisms. During encrypted sandbox creation, user passwords are transmitted
  via shared memory, exposing them to potential interception. The vulnerability is particularly
  severe during password modification operations, where both old and new passwords are passed
  as plaintext command-line arguments to the Imbox process without any encryption or obfuscation.
  This implementation flaw allows any process within the user session, including unprivileged
  processes, to retrieve these sensitive credentials by reading the command-line arguments,
  thereby bypassing standard privilege requirements and creating a significant security risk.
  This is fixed in version 1.16.2.
