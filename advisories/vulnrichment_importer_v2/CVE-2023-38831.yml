aliases: []
summary: RARLAB WinRAR before 6.23 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code when a user attempts
  to view a benign file within a ZIP archive. The issue occurs because a ZIP archive may include
  a benign file (such as an ordinary .JPG file) and also a folder that has the same name as
  the benign file, and the contents of the folder (which may include executable content) are
  processed during an attempt to access only the benign file. This was exploited in the wild
  in April through October 2023.
