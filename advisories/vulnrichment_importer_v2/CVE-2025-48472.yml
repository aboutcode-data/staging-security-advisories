summary: FreeScout is a free self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. Prior to version 1.8.179,
  there is no check to ensure that the user is disabling notifications for the mailbox to which
  they already have access. Moreover, the code explicitly implements functionality that if the
  user does not have access to the mailbox, then after disabling (enabling) notifications for
  this mailbox, the user will gain access to it. This issue has been patched in version 1.8.179.
