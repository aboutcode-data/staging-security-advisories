aliases: []
summary: Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime with secure defaults. Insufficient
  validation of parameters in `Deno.makeTemp*` APIs would allow for creation of files outside
  of the allowed directories. This may allow the user to overwrite important files on the system
  that may affect other systems. A user may provide a prefix or suffix to a `Deno.makeTemp*`
  API containing path traversal characters. This is fixed in Deno 1.41.1.
