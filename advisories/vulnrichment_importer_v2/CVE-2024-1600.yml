aliases: []
summary: A Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability exists in the parisneo/lollms-webui application,
  specifically within the `/personalities` route. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability
  by crafting a URL that includes directory traversal sequences (`../../`) followed by the desired
  system file path, URL encoded. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to read any file
  on the filesystem accessible by the web server. This issue arises due to improper control
  of filename for include/require statement in the application.
