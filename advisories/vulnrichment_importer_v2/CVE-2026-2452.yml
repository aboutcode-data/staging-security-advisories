aliases: []
summary: "Emails sent by pretix can utilize placeholders that will be filled with customer data.\
  \ For example, when {name}\n is used in an email template, it will  be replaced with the buyer's\
  \ \nname for the final email. This mechanism contained a security-relevant bug:\n\nIt was\
  \ possible to exfiltrate information about the pretix system through specially crafted placeholder\
  \ names such as {{event.__init__.__code__.co_filename}}.\n This way, an attacker with the\
  \ ability to control email templates \n(usually every user of the pretix backend) could retrieve\
  \ sensitive \ninformation from the system configuration, including even database \npasswords\
  \ or API keys. pretix does include mechanisms to prevent the usage of such \nmalicious placeholders,\
  \ however due to a mistake in the code, they were \nnot fully effective for this plugin.\n\
  \nOut of caution, we recommend that you rotate all passwords and API keys contained in your\
  \  pretix.cfg https://docs.pretix.eu/self-hosting/config/  file."
