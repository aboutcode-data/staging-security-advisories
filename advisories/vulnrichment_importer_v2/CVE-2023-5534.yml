summary: The AI ChatBot plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in
  versions up to, and including, 4.8.9 and 4.9.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce

  to invoke those functions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
