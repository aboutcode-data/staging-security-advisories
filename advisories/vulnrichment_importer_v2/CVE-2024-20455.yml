aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the process that classifies traffic that is going to the Unified\
  \ Threat Defense (UTD) component of Cisco IOS XE Software in controller mode could allow an\
  \ unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected\
  \ device.\r\n\r This vulnerability exists because UTD improperly handles certain packets as\
  \ those packets egress an SD-WAN IPsec tunnel. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by sending crafted traffic through an SD-WAN IPsec tunnel that is configured on an affected\
  \ device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting\
  \ in a DoS condition.\r\n\r Note: SD-WAN tunnels that are configured with Generic Routing\
  \ Encapsulation (GRE) are not affected by this vulnerability."
