summary: "Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.Tomcat from 11.0.0-M1 through\
  \ 11.0.0-M11, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.13, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.81 and from 8.5.0\
  \ through 8.5.93 did not correctly parse HTTP trailer headers. A specially \ncrafted, invalid\
  \ trailer header could cause Tomcat to treat a single \nrequest as multiple requests leading\
  \ to the possibility of request \nsmuggling when behind a reverse proxy.\n\nOlder, EOL versions\
  \ may also be affected.\n\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M12 onwards,\
  \ 10.1.14 onwards, 9.0.81 onwards or 8.5.94 onwards, which fix the issue."
