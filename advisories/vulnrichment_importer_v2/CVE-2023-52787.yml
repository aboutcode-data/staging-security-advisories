aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  blk-mq: make sure active queue usage is held for bio_integrity_prep()

  blk_integrity_unregister() can come if queue usage counter isn't held
  for one bio with integrity prepared, so this request may be completed with
  calling profile->complete_fn, then kernel panic.

  Another constraint is that bio_integrity_prep() needs to be called
  before bio merge.

  Fix the issue by:

  - call bio_integrity_prep() with one queue usage counter grabbed reliably

  - call bio_integrity_prep() before bio merge
