  Improper Authentication vulnerability in Apache Software Foundation Apache Pulsar Broker allows a client to stay connected to a broker after authentication data expires if the client connected through the Pulsar Proxy when the broker is configured with authenticateOriginalAuthData=false or if a client connects directly to a broker with a specially crafted connect command when the broker is configured with authenticateOriginalAuthData=false.

  This issue affects Apache Pulsar: through 2.9.4, from 2.10.0 through 2.10.3, 2.11.0.

  2.9 Pulsar Broker users should upgrade to at least 2.9.5.
