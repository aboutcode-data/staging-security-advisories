  freezer,umh: Fix call_usermode_helper_exec() vs SIGKILL

  Tetsuo-San noted that commit f5d39b020809 ("freezer,sched: Rewrite
  core freezer logic") broke call_usermodehelper_exec() for the KILLABLE
  case.

  Specifically it was missed that the second, unconditional,
  wait_for_completion() was not optional and ensures the on-stack
  completion is unused before going out-of-scope.
