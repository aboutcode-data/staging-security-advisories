aliases: []
summary: There's a vulnerability in the CRI-O application where when container is launched with
  securityContext.runAsUser specifying a non-existent user, CRI-O attempts to create the user,
  reading the container's entire /etc/passwd file into memory. If this file is excessively large,
  it can cause the a high memory consumption leading applications to be killed due to out-of-memory.
  As a result a denial-of-service can be achieved, possibly disrupting other pods and services
  running in the same host.
