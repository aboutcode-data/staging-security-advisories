aliases: []
summary: XWiki through version 17.3.0 is vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
  in the Administration interface, specifically within the HTTP Meta Info field of the Global
  Preferences Presentation section. An authenticated administrator can inject crafted Apache
  Velocity template code, which is rendered on the server side without proper validation or
  sandboxing. This enables the execution of arbitrary template logic, which may expose internal
  server information or, in specific configurations, lead to further exploitation such as remote
  code execution or sensitive data leakage. The vulnerability resides in improper handling of
  dynamic template rendering within user-supplied configuration fields.
