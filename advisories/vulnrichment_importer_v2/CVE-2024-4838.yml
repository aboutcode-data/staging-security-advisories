aliases: []
summary: The ConvertPlus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions
  up to, and including, 3.5.26 via deserialization of untrusted input from the 'settings_encoded'
  attribute of the 'smile_modal' shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with contributor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in
  the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed
  on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive
  data, or execute code.
