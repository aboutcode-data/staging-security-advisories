aliases: []
summary: ESF-IDF is the Espressif Internet of Things (IOT) Development Framework. An integer
  underflow vulnerability has been identified in the ESP-NOW protocol implementation within
  the ESP Wi-Fi component of versions 5.4.1, 5.3.3, 5.2.5, and 5.1.6 of the ESP-IDF framework.
  This issue stems from insufficient validation of user-supplied data length in the packet receive
  function. Under certain conditions, this may lead to out-of-bounds memory access and may allow
  arbitrary memory write operations. On systems without a memory protection scheme, this behavior
  could potentially be used to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the target device. In
  versions 5.4.2, 5.3.4, 5.2.6, and 5.1.6, ESP-NOW has added more comprehensive validation logic
  on user-supplied data length during packet reception to prevent integer underflow caused by
  negative value calculations. For ESP-IDF v5.3 and earlier, a workaround can be applied by
  validating that the `data_len` parameter received in the RX callback (registered via `esp_now_register_recv_cb()`)
  is a positive value before further processing. For ESP-IDF v5.4 and later, no application-level
  workaround is available. Users are advised to upgrade to a patched version of ESP-IDF to take
  advantage of the built-in mitigation.
