aliases: []
summary: The Piotnet Addons For Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information
  Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.32 via the 'pafe-template' shortcode due
  to insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract data from private or draft
  posts created by Elementor that they should not have access to.
