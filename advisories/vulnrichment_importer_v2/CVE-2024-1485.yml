aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in the decompression function of registry-support. This issue can
  be triggered if an unauthenticated remote attacker tricks a user into parsing a devfile which
  uses the `parent` or `plugin` keywords. This could download a malicious archive and cause
  the cleanup process to overwrite or delete files outside of the archive, which should not
  be allowed.
