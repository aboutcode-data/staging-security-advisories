aliases: []
summary: The gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt application is vulnerable to a path traversal attack
  due to its use of an outdated gradio component. The application is designed to restrict user
  access to resources within the `web_assets` folder. However, the outdated version of gradio
  it employs is susceptible to path traversal, as identified in CVE-2023-51449. This vulnerability
  allows unauthorized users to bypass the intended restrictions and access sensitive files,
  such as `config.json`, which contains API keys. The issue affects the latest version of chuanhuchatgpt
  prior to the fixed version released on 20240305.
