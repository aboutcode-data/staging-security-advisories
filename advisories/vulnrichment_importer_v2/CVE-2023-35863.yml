aliases: []
summary: In MADEFORNET HTTP Debugger through 9.12, the Windows service does not set the seclevel
  registry key before launching the driver. Thus, it is possible for an unprivileged application
  to obtain a handle to the NetFilterSDK wrapper before the service obtains exclusive access.
