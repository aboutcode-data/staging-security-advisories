summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  spi: spi-zynqmp-gqspi: fix use-after-free in zynqmp_qspi_exec_op

  When handling op->addr, it is using the buffer "tmpbuf" which has been
  freed. This will trigger a use-after-free KASAN warning. Let's use
  temporary variables to store op->addr.val and op->cmd.opcode to fix
  this issue.
