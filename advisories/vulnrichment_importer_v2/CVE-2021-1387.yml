datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2021-1387
datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2021/1xxx/CVE-2021-1387.json
aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the network stack of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability
  exists because the software improperly releases resources when it processes certain IPv6 packets
  that are destined to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
  multiple crafted IPv6 packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could cause the
  network stack to run out of available buffers, impairing operations of control plane and management
  plane protocols and resulting in a DoS condition. Manual intervention would be required to
  restore normal operations on the affected device. For more information about the impact of
  this vulnerability, see the Details section of this advisory.
