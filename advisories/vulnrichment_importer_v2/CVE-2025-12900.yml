summary: The FileBird – WordPress Media Library Folders & File Manager plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to missing authorization in all versions up to, and including, 6.5.1 via the
  "ConvertController::insertToNewTable" function due to missing validation on a user controlled
  key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author level access and above,
  to inject global folders and reassign arbitrary media attachments to those folders under certain
  circumstances.
