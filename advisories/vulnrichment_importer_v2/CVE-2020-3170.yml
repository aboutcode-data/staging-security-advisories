aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the NX-API feature of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to cause an NX-API system process to unexpectedly restart. The vulnerability
  is due to incorrect validation of the HTTP header of a request that is sent to the NX-API.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the NX-API
  on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of
  service (DoS) condition in the NX-API service; however, the Cisco NX-OS device itself would
  still be available and passing network traffic. Note: The NX-API feature is disabled by default.'
