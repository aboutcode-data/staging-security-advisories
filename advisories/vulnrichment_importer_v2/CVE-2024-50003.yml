  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/amd/display: Fix system hang while resume with TBT monitor

  [Why]
  Connected with a Thunderbolt monitor and do the suspend and the system
  may hang while resume.

  The TBT monitor HPD will be triggered during the resume procedure
  and call the drm_client_modeset_probe() while
  struct drm_connector connector->dev->master is NULL.

  It will mess up the pipe topology after resume.

  [How]
  Skip the TBT monitor HPD during the resume procedure because we
  currently will probe the connectors after resume by default.

  (cherry picked from commit 453f86a26945207a16b8f66aaed5962dc2b95b85)
