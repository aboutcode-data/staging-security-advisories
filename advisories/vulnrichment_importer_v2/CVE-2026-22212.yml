aliases: []
summary: TinyOS versions up to and including 2.1.2 contain a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability
  in the mcp2200gpio utility. The vulnerability is caused by unsafe use of strcpy() and strcat()
  functions when constructing device paths during automatic device discovery. A local attacker
  can exploit this by creating specially crafted filenames under /dev/usb/, leading to stack
  memory corruption and application crashes.
