aliases: []
summary: "The Versa Director SD-WAN orchestration platform provides direct web-based access\
  \ to uCPE virtual machines through the Director GUI. By default, the websockify service is\
  \ exposed on port 6080 and accessible from the internet. This exposure introduces significant\
  \ risk, as websockify has known weaknesses that can be exploited, potentially leading to remote\
  \ code execution. \r\n\r\nVersa Networks is not aware of any reported instance where this\
  \ vulnerability was exploited. Proof of concept for this vulnerability has been disclosed\
  \ by third party security researchers.  \r\n\r\nWorkarounds or Mitigation: \r\n\r\nRestrict\
  \ access to TCP port 6080 if uCPE console access is not necessary. Versa recommends that Director\
  \ be upgraded to one of the remediated software versions."
