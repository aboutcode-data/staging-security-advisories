  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  crypto: iaa - Fix potential use after free bug

  The free_device_compression_mode(iaa_device, device_mode) function frees
  "device_mode" but it iss passed to iaa_compression_modes[i]->free() a few
  lines later resulting in a use after free.

  The good news is that, so far as I can tell, nothing implements the
  ->free() function and the use after free happens in dead code.  But, with
  this fix, when something does implement it, we'll be ready.  :)
