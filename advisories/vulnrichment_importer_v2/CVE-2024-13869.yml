aliases: []
summary: 'The Migration, Backup, Staging – WPvivid Backup & Migration plugin for WordPress is
  vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the ''upload_files''
  function in all versions up to, and including, 0.9.112. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected
  site''s server which may make remote code execution possible. NOTE: Uploaded files are only
  accessible on WordPress instances running on the NGINX web server as the existing .htaccess
  within the target file upload folder prevents access on Apache servers.'
