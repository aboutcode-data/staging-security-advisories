summary: 'An Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation vulnerability in the Juniper
  Networks Deep Packet Inspection-Decoder (JDPI-Decoder) Application Signature component of
  Junos OS''s AppID service on SRX Series devices will stop the JDPI-Decoder from identifying
  dynamic application traffic, allowing an unauthenticated network-based attacker to send traffic
  to the target device using the JDPI-Decoder, designed to inspect dynamic application traffic
  and take action upon this traffic, to instead begin to not take action and to pass the traffic
  through. An example session can be seen by running the following command and evaluating the
  output. user@device# run show security flow session source-prefix <address/mask> extensive
  Session ID: <session ID>, Status: Normal, State: Active Policy name: <name of policy> Dynamic
  application: junos:UNKNOWN, <<<<< LOOK HERE Please note, the JDPI-Decoder and the AppID SigPack
  are both affected and both must be upgraded along with the operating system to address the
  matter. By default, none of this is auto-enabled for automatic updates. This issue affects:
  Juniper Networks any version of the JDPI-Decoder Engine prior to version 5.7.0-47 with the
  JDPI-Decoder enabled using any version of the AppID SigPack prior to version 1.550.2-31 (SigPack
  3533) on Junos OS on SRX Series: All versions prior to 19.1R3-S10; 19.2 versions prior to
  19.2R3-S7; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S8; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S11; 20.1 version
  20.1R1 and later versions prior to 20.2R3-S7; 20.3 version 20.3R1 and later versions prior
