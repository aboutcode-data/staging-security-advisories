aliases: []
summary: A missing authentication vulnerability in the GFIAgent component of GFI Kerio Control
  9.4.5 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to perform privileged operations. The GFIAgent
  service, responsible for integration with GFI AppManager, exposes HTTP services on ports 7995
  and 7996 without proper authentication. The /proxy handler on port 7996 allows arbitrary forwarding
  to administrative endpoints when provided with an Appliance UUID, which itself can be retrieved
  from port 7995. This results in a complete authentication bypass, permitting access to sensitive
  administrative APIs.
