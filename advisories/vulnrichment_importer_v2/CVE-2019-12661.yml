aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in a Virtualization Manager (VMAN) related CLI command of Cisco IOS
  XE Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands on
  the underlying Linux operating system with a privilege level of root. The vulnerability is
  due to insufficient validation of arguments passed to a specific VMAN CLI command on the affected
  device. An attacker who has administrator access to an affected device could exploit this
  vulnerability by including malicious input as the argument of an affected command. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device with root privileges,
  which may lead to complete system compromise.
