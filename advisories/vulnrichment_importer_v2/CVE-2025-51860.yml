aliases: []
summary: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in TelegAI (telegai.com) 2025-05-26 in its chat component
  and character container component. An attacker can achieve arbitrary client-side script execution
  by crafting an AI Character with SVG XSS payloads in either description, greeting, example
  dialog, or system prompt(instructing the LLM to embed XSS payload in its chat response). When
  a user interacts with such a malicious AI Character or just browse its profile, the script
  executes in the user's browser. Successful exploitation can lead to the theft of sensitive
  information, such as session tokens, potentially resulting in account hijacking.
