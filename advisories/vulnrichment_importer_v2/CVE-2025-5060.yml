aliases: []
summary: The Bravis User plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in all
  versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to the plugin not properly logging a user
  in with the data that was previously verified through the facebook_ajax_login_callback().
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as administrative users, as
  long as they have an existing account on the site, and access to the administrative user's
  email.
