aliases: []
summary: ReCrystallize Server 5.10.0.0 uses a authorization mechanism that relies on the value
  of a cookie, but it does not bind the cookie value to a session ID. Attackers can easily modify
  the cookie value, within a browser or by implementing client-side code outside of a browser.
  Attackers can bypass the authentication mechanism by modifying the cookie to contain an expected
  value.
