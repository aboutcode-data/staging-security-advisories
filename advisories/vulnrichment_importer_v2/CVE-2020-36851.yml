aliases: []
summary: 'Rob -- W / cors-anywhere instances configured as an open proxy allow unauthenticated
  external users to induce the server to make HTTP requests to arbitrary targets (SSRF). Because
  the proxy forwards requests and headers, an attacker can reach internal-only endpoints and
  link-local metadata services, retrieve instance role credentials or other sensitive metadata,
  and interact with internal APIs and services that are not intended to be internet-facing.
  The vulnerability is exploitable by sending crafted requests to the proxy with the target
  resource encoded in the URL; many cors-anywhere deployments forward arbitrary methods and
  headers (including PUT), which can permit exploitation of IMDSv2 workflows as well as access
  to internal management APIs. Successful exploitation can result in theft of cloud credentials,
  unauthorized access to internal services, remote code execution or privilege escalation (depending
  on reachable backends), data exfiltration, and full compromise of cloud resources. Mitigation
  includes: restricting the proxy to trusted origins or authentication, whitelisting allowed
  target hosts, preventing access to link-local and internal IP ranges, removing support for
  unsafe HTTP methods/headers, enabling cloud provider mitigations, and deploying network-level
  protections.'
