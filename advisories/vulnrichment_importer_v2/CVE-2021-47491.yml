  mm: khugepaged: skip huge page collapse for special files

  The read-only THP for filesystems will collapse THP for files opened
  readonly and mapped with VM_EXEC.  The intended usecase is to avoid TLB
  misses for large text segments.  But it doesn't restrict the file types
  so a THP could be collapsed for a non-regular file, for example, block
  device, if it is opened readonly and mapped with EXEC permission.  This
  may cause bugs, like [1] and [2].

  This is definitely not the intended usecase, so just collapse THP for
  regular files in order to close the attack surface.
