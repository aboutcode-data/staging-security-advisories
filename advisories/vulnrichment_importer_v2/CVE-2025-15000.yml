aliases: []
summary: The Page Keys plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via
  the ‘page_key’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.3 due to insufficient input
  sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
  administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
  a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations
  where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
