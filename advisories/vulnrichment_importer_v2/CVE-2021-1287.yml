datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2021/1xxx/CVE-2021-1287.json
aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco RV132W ADSL2+ Wireless-N
  VPN Routers and Cisco RV134W VDSL2 Wireless-AC VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote
  attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device or cause the device to restart unexpectedly.
  The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate
  user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP
  requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
  code as the root user on the underlying operating system or cause the device to reload, resulting
  in a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.
