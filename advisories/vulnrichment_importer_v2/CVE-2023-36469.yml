aliases: []
summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications
  built on top of it. Any user who can edit their own user profile and notification settings
  can execute arbitrary script macros including Groovy and Python macros that allow remote code
  execution including unrestricted read and write access to all wiki contents. This has been
  patched in XWiki 14.10.6 and 15.2RC1. Users are advised to update. As a workaround the main
  security fix can be manually applied by patching the affected document `XWiki.Notifications.Code.NotificationRSSService`.
  This will break the link to the differences, though as this requires additional changes to
  Velocity templates as shown in the patch. While the default template is available in the instance
  and can be easily patched, the template for mentions is contained in a `.jar`-file and thus
  cannot be fixed without replacing that jar.
