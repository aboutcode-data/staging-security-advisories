aliases: []
summary: CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security
  Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running
  the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. Prior to version 1.4.3, CryptoLib’s KMC
  crypto service integration is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow when decoding Base64-encoded
  ciphertext/cleartext fields returned by the KMC service. The decode destination buffer is
  sized using an expected output length (len_data_out), but the Base64 decoder writes output
  based on the actual Base64 input length and does not enforce any destination size limit. An
  oversized Base64 string in the KMC JSON response can cause out-of-bounds writes on the heap,
  resulting in process crash and potentially code execution under certain conditions. This issue
  has been patched in version 1.4.3.
