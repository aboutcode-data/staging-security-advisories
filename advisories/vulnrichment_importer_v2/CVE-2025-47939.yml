aliases: []
summary: TYPO3 is an open source, PHP based web content management system. By design, the file
  management module in TYPO3’s backend user interface has historically allowed the upload of
  any file type, with the exception of those that are directly executable in a web server context.
  This lack of restriction means it is possible to upload files that may be considered potentially
  harmful, such as executable binaries (e.g., `.exe` files), or files with inconsistent file
  extensions and MIME types (for example, a file incorrectly named with a `.png` extension but
  actually carrying the MIME type `application/zip`) starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to
  versions 9.5.51 ELTS, 10.4.50 ELTS, 11.5.44 ELTS, 12.4.31 LTS, and 13.4.12 LTS. Although such
  files are not directly executable through the web server, their presence can introduce indirect
  risks. For example, third-party services such as antivirus scanners or malware detection systems
  might flag or block access to the website for end users if suspicious files are found. This
  could negatively affect the availability or reputation of the site. Users should update to
  TYPO3 version 9.5.51 ELTS, 10.4.50 ELTS, 11.5.44 ELTS, 12.4.31 LTS, or 13.4.12 LTS to fix
  the problem.
