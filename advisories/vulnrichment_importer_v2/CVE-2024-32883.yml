aliases: []
summary: MCUboot is a secure bootloader for 32-bits microcontrollers. MCUboot uses a TLV (tag-length-value)
  structure to represent the meta data associated with an image.  The TLVs themselves are divided
  into two sections, a protected and an unprotected section. The protected TLV entries are included
  as part of the image signature to avoid tampering. However, the code does not distinguish
  which TLV entries should be protected or not, so it is possible for an attacker to add unprotected
  TLV entries that should be protected. Currently, the primary protected TLV entries should
  be the dependency indication, and the boot record. An injected dependency value would primarily
  result in an otherwise acceptable image being rejected. A boot record injection could allow
  fields in a later attestation record to include data not intended, which could cause an image
  to appear to have properties that it should not have. As a workaround, disable the boot record
  functionality.
