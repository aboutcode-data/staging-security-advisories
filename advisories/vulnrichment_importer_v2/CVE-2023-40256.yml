aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability was discovered in Veritas NetBackup Snapshot Manager before 10.2.0.1
  that allowed untrusted clients to interact with the RabbitMQ service. This was caused by improper
  validation of the client certificate due to misconfiguration of the RabbitMQ service. Exploiting
  this impacts the confidentiality and integrity of messages controlling the backup and restore
  jobs, and could result in the service becoming unavailable. This impacts only the jobs controlling
  the backup and restore activities, and does not allow access to (or deletion of) the backup
  snapshot data itself. This vulnerability is confined to the NetBackup Snapshot Manager feature
  and does not impact the RabbitMQ instance on the NetBackup primary servers.
