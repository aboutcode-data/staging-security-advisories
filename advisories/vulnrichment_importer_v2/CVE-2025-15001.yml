aliases: []
summary: The FS Registration Password plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
  via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to the plugin
  not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their password. This makes it
  possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators,
  and leverage that to gain access to their account.
