summary: 'Integer overflow vulnerability in tool_operate.c in curl 7.65.2 via a large value
  as the retry delay. NOTE: many parties report that this has no direct security impact on the
  curl user; however, it may (in theory) cause a denial of service to associated systems or
  networks if, for example, --retry-delay is misinterpreted as a value much smaller than what
  was intended. This is not especially plausible because the overflow only happens if the user
  was trying to specify that curl should wait weeks (or longer) before trying to recover from
  a transient error.'
