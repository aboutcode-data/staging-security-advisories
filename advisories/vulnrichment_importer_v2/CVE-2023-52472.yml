summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  crypto: rsa - add a check for allocation failure

  Static checkers insist that the mpi_alloc() allocation can fail so add
  a check to prevent a NULL dereference.  Small allocations like this
  can't actually fail in current kernels, but adding a check is very
  simple and makes the static checkers happy.
