  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mptcp: really cope with fastopen race

  Fastopen and PM-trigger subflow shutdown can race, as reported by
  syzkaller.

  In my first attempt to close such race, I missed the fact that
  the subflow status can change again before the subflow_state_change
  callback is invoked.

  Address the issue additionally copying with all the states directly
  reachable from TCP_FIN_WAIT1.
