aliases: []
summary: Umbraco is an ASP.NET CMS. Due to unsafe handling and deletion of temporary files in
  versions 10.0.0 through 13.12.0, during the dictionary upload process an attacker with access
  to the backoffice can trigger predictable requests to temporary file paths. The application’s
  error responses (HTTP 500 when a file exists, 404 when it does not) allow the attacker to
  enumerate the existence of arbitrary files on the server’s filesystem. This vulnerability
  does not allow reading or writing file contents. In certain configurations, incomplete clean-up
  of temporary upload files may additionally expose the NTLM hash of the Windows account running
  the Umbraco application. This issue is fixed in version 13.12.1.
