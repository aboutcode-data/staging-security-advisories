aliases: []
summary: gotortc is a camera streaming application. Versions 1.8.5 and prior are vulnerable
  to DOM-based cross-site scripting. The index page (`index.html`) shows the available streams
  by fetching the API in the client side. Then, it uses `Object.entries` to iterate over the
  result whose first item (`name`) gets appended using `innerHTML`. In the event of a victim
  visiting the server in question, their browser will execute the request against the go2rtc
  instance. After the request, the browser will be redirected to go2rtc, in which the XSS would
  be executed in the context of go2rtc’s origin. As of time of publication, no patch is available.
