aliases: []
summary: The Sell Media plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via
  the plugin's 'sell_media_search_form_gutenberg' shortcode in all versions up to, and including,
  2.5.8.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above,
  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page.
