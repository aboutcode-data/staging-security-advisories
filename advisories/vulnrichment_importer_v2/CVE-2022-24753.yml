  in Stripe CLI exists on Windows when certain commands are run in a directory where an attacker
  has planted files. The commands are `stripe login`, `stripe config -e`, `stripe community`,
  and `stripe open`. MacOS and Linux are unaffected. An attacker who successfully exploits the
  vulnerability can run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. The update addresses
  the vulnerability by throwing an error in these situations before the code can run.Users are
  advised to upgrade to version 1.7.13. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
