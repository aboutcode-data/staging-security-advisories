summary: The PowerPress Podcasting plugin by Blubrry plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected
  Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘media_url’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 11.9.10

  attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick
  a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
