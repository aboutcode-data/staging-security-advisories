summary: |
  A Missing Authorization vulnerability in Juniper Networks Security Director allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to read or tamper with multiple sensitive resources via the web interface.

  Numerous endpoints on the Juniper Security Director appliance do not validate authorization and will deliver information to the caller that is outside their authorization level. An attacker can access data that is outside the user's authorization level. The information obtained can be used to gain access to additional information or perpetrate other attacks, impacting downstream managed devices.



  This issue affects Security Director version 24.4.1.
