aliases: []
summary: CubeFS is an open-source cloud-native file storage system. CubeFS prior to version
  3.3.1 was found to leak users secret keys and access keys in the logs in multiple components.
  When CubeCS creates new users, it leaks the users secret key. This could allow a lower-privileged
  user with access to the logs to retrieve sensitive information and impersonate other users
  with higher privileges than themselves. The issue has been patched in v3.3.1. There is no
  other mitigation than upgrading CubeFS.
