aliases: []
summary: wasmCloud Host Runtime is a server process that securely hosts and provides dispatch
  for web assembly (WASM) actors and capability providers. In versions prior to 0.52.2 actors
  can bypass capability authorization. Actors are normally required to declare their capabilities
  for inbound invocations, but with this vulnerability actor capability claims are not verified
  upon receiving invocations. This compromises the security model for actors as they can receive
  unauthorized invocations from linked capability providers. The problem has been patched in
  versions `0.52.2` and greater. There is no workaround and users are advised to upgrade to
  an unaffected version as soon as possible.
