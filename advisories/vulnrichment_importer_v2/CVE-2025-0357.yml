aliases: []
summary: The WPBookit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient
  file type validation in the 'WPB_Profile_controller::handle_image_upload' function in versions
  up to, and including, 1.6.9. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload
  arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
