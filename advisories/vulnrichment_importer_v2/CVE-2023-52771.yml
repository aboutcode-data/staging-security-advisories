  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  cxl/port: Fix delete_endpoint() vs parent unregistration race

  The CXL subsystem, at cxl_mem ->probe() time, establishes a lineage of
  ports (struct cxl_port objects) between an endpoint and the root of a
  CXL topology. Each port including the endpoint port is attached to the
  cxl_port driver.

  Given that setup, it follows that when either any port in that lineage
  goes through a cxl_port ->remove() event, or the memdev goes through a
  cxl_mem ->remove() event. The hierarchy below the removed port, or the
  entire hierarchy if the memdev is removed needs to come down.

  The delete_endpoint() callback is careful to check whether it is being
  called to tear down the hierarchy, or if it is only being called to
  teardown the memdev because an ancestor port is going through
  ->remove().

  That care needs to take the device_lock() of the endpoint's parent.
  Which requires 2 bugs to be fixed:

  1/ A reference on the parent is needed to prevent use-after-free
     scenarios like this signature:

  2/ In the case of RCH topologies, the parent device that needs to be
     locked is not always @port->dev as returned by cxl_mem_find_port(), use
     endpoint->dev.parent instead.
