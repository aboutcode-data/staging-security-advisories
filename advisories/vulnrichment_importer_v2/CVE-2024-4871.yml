aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability was found in Satellite. When running a remote execution job on a host,
  the host's SSH key is not being checked. When the key changes, the Satellite still connects
  it because it uses "-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no". This flaw can lead to a man-in-the-middle
  attack (MITM), denial of service, leaking of secrets the remote execution job contains, or
  other issues that may arise from the attacker's ability to forge an SSH key. This issue does
  not directly allow unauthorized remote execution on the Satellite, although it can leak secrets
  that may lead to it.
