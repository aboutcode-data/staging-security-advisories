  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  bpf, arm64: Fix trampoline for BPF_TRAMP_F_CALL_ORIG

  When BPF_TRAMP_F_CALL_ORIG is set, the trampoline calls
  __bpf_tramp_enter() and __bpf_tramp_exit() functions, passing them
  the struct bpf_tramp_image *im pointer as an argument in R0.

  The trampoline generation code uses emit_addr_mov_i64() to emit
  instructions for moving the bpf_tramp_image address into R0, but
  emit_addr_mov_i64() assumes the address to be in the vmalloc() space
  and uses only 48 bits. Because bpf_tramp_image is allocated using
  kzalloc(), its address can use more than 48-bits, in this case the
  trampoline will pass an invalid address to __bpf_tramp_enter/exit()
  causing a kernel crash.

  Fix this by using emit_a64_mov_i64() in place of emit_addr_mov_i64()
  as it can work with addresses that are greater than 48-bits.
