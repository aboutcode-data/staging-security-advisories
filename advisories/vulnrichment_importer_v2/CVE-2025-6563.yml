aliases: []
summary: A cross-site scripting vulnerability is present in the hotspot of MikroTik's RouterOS
  on versions below 7.19.2. An attacker can inject the `javascript` protocol in the `dst` parameter.
  When the victim browses to the malicious URL and logs in, the XSS executes. The POST request
  used to login, can also be converted to a GET request, allowing an attacker to send a specifically
  crafted URL that automatically logs in the victim (into the attacker's account) and triggers
  the payload.
