summary: |
  A NULL Pointer Dereference vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on ACX7024, ACX7100-32C and ACX7100-48L allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

  If a specific IPv4 UDP packet is received and sent to the Routing Engine (RE) packetio crashes and restarts which causes a momentary traffic interruption. Continued receipt of such packets will lead to a sustained DoS.

  This issue does not happen with IPv6 packets.
