aliases: []
summary: FreeScout is a free self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. Prior to version 1.8.180,
  the application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to incorrect input
  validation and sanitization of user-input data during mail signature sanitization. An attacker
  can inject arbitrary HTML code, including JavaScript scripts, into the page processed by the
  user's browser, allowing them to steal sensitive data, hijack user sessions, or conduct other
  malicious activities. Additionally, if an administrator accesses one of these emails with
  a modified signature, it could result in a subsequent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
  This issue has been patched in version 1.8.180.
