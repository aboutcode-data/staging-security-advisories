aliases: []
summary: The Login Lockdown & Protection plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to IP Block Bypass
  in all versions up to, and including, 2.14. This is due to $unblock_key key being insufficiently
  random allowing unauthenticated users, with access to an administrative user email, to generate
  valid unblock keys for their IP Address. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to bypass blocks due to invalid login attempts.
