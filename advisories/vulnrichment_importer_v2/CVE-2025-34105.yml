aliases: []
summary: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the built-in web interface of
  DiskBoss Enterprise versions 7.4.28, 7.5.12, and 8.2.14. The vulnerability arises from improper
  bounds checking on the path component of HTTP GET requests. By sending a specially crafted
  long URI, a remote unauthenticated attacker can trigger a buffer overflow, potentially leading
  to arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges on vulnerable Windows hosts.
