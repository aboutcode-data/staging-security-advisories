summary: iccDEV provides libraries and tools for interacting with, manipulating, and applying
  ICC color management profiles. Versions 2.3.1.1 and below have Undefined Behavior and Null
  Pointer Deference in CIccProfileXml::ParseBasic(). This occurs when user-controllable input
  is unsafely incorporated into ICC profile data or other structured binary blobs. Successful
  exploitation may allow an attacker to perform DoS, manipulate data, bypass application logic
  and Code Execution. This issue has been fixed in version 2.3.1.2.
