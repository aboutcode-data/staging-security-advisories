aliases: []
summary: 'Contiki-NG is an operating system for internet-of-things devices. In versions 4.9
  and prior, when a packet is received, the Contiki-NG network stack attempts to start the periodic
  TCP timer if it is a TCP packet with the SYN flag set. But the implementation does not first
  verify that a full TCP header has been received. Specifically, the implementation attempts
  to access the flags field from the TCP buffer in the following conditional expression in the
  `check_for_tcp_syn` function. For this reason, an attacker can inject a truncated TCP packet,
  which will lead to an out-of-bound read from the packet buffer. As of time of publication,
  a patched version is not available. As a workaround, one can apply the changes in Contiki-NG
  pull request #2510 to patch the system.'
