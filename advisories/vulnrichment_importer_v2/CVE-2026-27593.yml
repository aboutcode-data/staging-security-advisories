aliases: []
summary: Statmatic is a Laravel and Git powered content management system (CMS). Prior to versions
  6.3.3 and 5.73.10, an attacker may leverage a vulnerability in the password reset feature
  to capture a user's token and reset the password on their behalf. The attacker must know the
  email address of a valid account on the site, and the actual user must blindly click the link
  in their email even though they didn't request the reset. This has been fixed in 6.3.3 and
  5.73.10.
