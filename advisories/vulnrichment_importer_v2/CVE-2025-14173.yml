aliases: []
summary: The Perfit WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to missing authorization checks on
  the `logout` function called via the `actions` function hooked to `admin_init`. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary plugin settings via the `action`
  parameter.
