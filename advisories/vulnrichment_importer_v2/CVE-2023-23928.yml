aliases: []
summary: reason-jose is a JOSE implementation in ReasonML and OCaml.`Jose.Jws.validate` does
  not check HS256 signatures. This allows tampering of JWS header and payload data if the service
  does not perform additional checks. Such tampering could expose applications using reason-jose
  to authorization bypass. Applications relying on JWS claims assertion to enforce security
  boundaries may be vulnerable to privilege escalation. This issue has been patched in version
  0.8.2.
