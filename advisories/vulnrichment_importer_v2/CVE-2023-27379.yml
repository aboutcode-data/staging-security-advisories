aliases: []
summary: A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the JavaScript engine of Foxit Software’s
  PDF Reader, version 12.1.2.15332. By prematurely deleting objects associated with pages, a
  specially crafted PDF document can trigger the reuse of previously freed memory, which can
  lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious
  file to trigger this vulnerability. Exploitation is also possible if a user visits a specially
  crafted, malicious site if the browser plugin extension is enabled.
