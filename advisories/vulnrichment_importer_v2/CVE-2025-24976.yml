aliases: []
summary: Distribution is a toolkit to pack, ship, store, and deliver container content. Systems
  running registry versions 3.0.0-beta.1 through 3.0.0-rc.2 with token authentication enabled
  may be vulnerable to an issue in which token authentication allows an attacker to inject an
  untrusted signing key in a JSON web token (JWT). The issue lies in how the JSON web key (JWK)
  verification is performed. When a JWT contains a JWK header without a certificate chain, the
  code only checks if the KeyID (`kid`) matches one of the trusted keys, but doesn't verify
  that the actual key material matches. A fix for the issue is available at commit 5ea9aa028db65ca5665f6af2c20ecf9dc34e5fcd
  and expected to be a part of version 3.0.0-rc.3. There is no way to work around this issue
  without patching if the system requires token authentication.
