aliases: []
summary: 'The Customizer Export/Import plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
  uploads due to missing file type validation in the ''_import'' function in all versions up
  to, and including, 0.9.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level
  access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site''s server which may make
  remote code execution possible. NOTE: This vulnerability is only exploitable when used in
  conjunction with a race condition as the uploaded file is deleted shortly after it is created.'
