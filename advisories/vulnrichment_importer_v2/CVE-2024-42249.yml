  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  spi: don't unoptimize message in spi_async()

  Calling spi_maybe_unoptimize_message() in spi_async() is wrong because
  the message is likely to be in the queue and not transferred yet. This
  can corrupt the message while it is being used by the controller driver.

  spi_maybe_unoptimize_message() is already called in the correct place
  in spi_finalize_current_message() to balance the call to
  spi_maybe_optimize_message() in spi_async().
