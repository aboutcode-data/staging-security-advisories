summary: "Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Crosswork\
  \ Network Controller could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting\
  \ (XSS) attacks against users of the interface of an affected system.\r\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities\
  \ exist because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied\
  \ input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by inserting malicious data into\
  \ specific data fields in the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to\
  \ execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive,\
  \ browser-based information. To exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker must have valid\
  \ administrative credentials.\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities.\
  \ There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities."
