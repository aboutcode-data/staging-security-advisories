aliases: []
summary: ContentKeeper Web Appliance (now maintained by Impero Software) versions prior to 125.10
  are vulnerable to remote command execution due to insecure handling of file uploads via the
  mimencode CGI utility. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to upload and execute
  arbitrary scripts as the Apache user. Additionally, the exploit can optionally escalate privileges
  by abusing insecure PATH usage in the benetool binary, resulting in root-level access if successful.
