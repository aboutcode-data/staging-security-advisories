  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  media: ti: j721e-csi2rx: Fix races while restarting DMA

  After the frame is submitted to DMA, it may happen that the submitted
  list is not updated soon enough, and the DMA callback is triggered
  before that.

  This can lead to kernel crashes, so move everything in a single
  lock/unlock section to prevent such races.
