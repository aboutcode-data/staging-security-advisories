aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in huggingface/text-generation-inference version 3.3.6 allows unauthenticated
  remote attackers to exploit unbounded external image fetching during input validation in VLM
  mode. The issue arises when the router scans inputs for Markdown image links and performs
  a blocking HTTP GET request, reading the entire response body into memory and cloning it before
  decoding. This behavior can lead to resource exhaustion, including network bandwidth saturation,
  memory inflation, and CPU overutilization. The vulnerability is triggered even if the request
  is later rejected for exceeding token limits. The default deployment configuration, which
  lacks memory usage limits and authentication, exacerbates the impact, potentially crashing
  the host machine. The issue is resolved in version 3.3.7.
