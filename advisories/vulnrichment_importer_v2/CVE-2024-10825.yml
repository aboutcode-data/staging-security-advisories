summary: The Hide My WP Ghost – Security & Firewall plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected
  Cross-Site Scripting via the URL in all versions up to, and including, 5.3.01 due to insufficient

  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick an administrative
  user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
