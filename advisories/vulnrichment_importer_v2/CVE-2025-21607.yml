aliases: []
summary: Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the EVM. When the Vyper Compiler uses
  the precompiles EcRecover (0x1) and Identity (0x4), the success flag of the call is not checked.
  As a consequence an attacker can provide a specific amount of gas to make these calls fail
  but let the overall execution continue. Then the execution result can be incorrect. Based
  on EVM's rules, after the failed precompile the remaining code has only 1/64 of the pre-call-gas
  left (as 63/64 were forwarded and spent). Hence, only fairly simple executions can follow
  the failed precompile calls. Therefore, we found no significantly impacted real-world contracts.
  None the less an advisory has been made out of an abundance of caution. There are no actions
  for users to take.
