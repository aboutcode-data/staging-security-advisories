aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered on G-Net Dashcam BB GONX devices. A Public Domain name is Used
  for the Internal Domain Name. It uses an unregistered public domain name as an internal domain,
  creating a security risk. This domain was not owned by GNET originally, allowing an attacker
  to register it and potentially intercept sensitive device traffic (it has since been registered
  by the vulnerability discoverer). If the dashcam or related services attempt to resolve this
  domain over the public Internet instead of locally, it could lead to data exfiltration or
  man-in-the-middle attacks.
