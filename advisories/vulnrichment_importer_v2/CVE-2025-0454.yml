aliases: []
summary: A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability was identified in the Requests utility
  of significant-gravitas/autogpt versions prior to v0.4.0. The vulnerability arises due to
  a hostname confusion between the `urlparse` function from the `urllib.parse` library and the
  `requests` library. A malicious user can exploit this by submitting a specially crafted URL,
  such as `http://localhost:\@google.com/../`, to bypass the SSRF check and perform an SSRF
  attack.
