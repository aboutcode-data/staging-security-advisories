aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric
  Infrastructure (ACI) Mode could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a queue
  wedge on a leaf switch, which could result in critical control plane traffic to the device
  being dropped. This could result in one or more leaf switches being removed from the fabric.
  This vulnerability is due to mishandling of ingress TCP traffic to a specific port. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending a stream of TCP packets to a specific port on
  a Switched Virtual Interface (SVI) configured on the device. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to cause a specific packet queue to queue network buffers but never process them,
  leading to an eventual queue wedge. This could cause control plane traffic to be dropped,
  resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition where the leaf switches are unavailable.
  Note: This vulnerability requires a manual intervention to power-cycle the device to recover.'
