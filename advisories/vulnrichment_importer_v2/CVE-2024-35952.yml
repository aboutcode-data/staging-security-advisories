  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/ast: Fix soft lockup

  There is a while-loop in ast_dp_set_on_off() that could lead to
  infinite-loop. This is because the register, VGACRI-Dx, checked in
  this API is a scratch register actually controlled by a MCU, named
  DPMCU, in BMC.

  These scratch registers are protected by scu-lock. If suc-lock is not
  off, DPMCU can not update these registers and then host will have soft
  lockup due to never updated status.

  DPMCU is used to control DP and relative registers to handshake with
  host's VGA driver. Even the most time-consuming task, DP's link
  training, is less than 100ms. 200ms should be enough.
