aliases: []
summary: Apptainer is an open source container platform. Version 1.2.0-rc.2 introduced an ineffective
  privilege drop when requesting container network setup, therefore subsequent functions are
  called with root privileges, the attack surface is rather limited for users but an attacker
  could possibly craft a starter config to delete any directory on the host filesystems. A security
  fix has been included in Apptainer 1.2.1. There is no known workaround outside of upgrading
  to Apptainer 1.2.1.
