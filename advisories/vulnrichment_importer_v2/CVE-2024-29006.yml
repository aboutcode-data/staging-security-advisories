aliases: []
summary: By default the CloudStack management server honours the x-forwarded-for HTTP header
  and logs it as the source IP of an API request. This could lead to authentication bypass and
  other operational problems should an attacker decide to spoof their IP address this way. Users
  are recommended to upgrade to CloudStack version 4.18.1.1 or 4.19.0.1, which fixes this issue.
