aliases: []
summary: In Jenkins 2.499 and earlier, LTS 2.492.1 and earlier, redirects starting with backslash
  (`\`) characters are considered safe, allowing attackers to perform phishing attacks by having
  users go to a Jenkins URL that will forward them to a different site, because browsers interpret
  these characters as part of scheme-relative redirects.
