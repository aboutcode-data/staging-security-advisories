  igb: Fix NULL pointer dereference in ethtool loopback test

  The igb driver currently causes a NULL pointer dereference when executing
  the ethtool loopback test. This occurs because there is no associated
  q_vector for the test ring when it is set up, as interrupts are typically
  not added to the test rings.

  Since commit 5ef44b3cb43b removed the napi_id assignment in
  __xdp_rxq_info_reg(), there is no longer a need to pass a napi_id to it.
  Therefore, simply use 0 as the last parameter.
