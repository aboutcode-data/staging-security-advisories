aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the locally significant certificate (LSC) provisioning feature of
  Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controllers that are running Cisco IOS XE Software could
  allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak that could lead to a denial
  of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of certain public
  key infrastructure (PKI) packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
  crafted Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could
  cause an affected device to continuously consume memory, which could result in a memory allocation
  failure that leads to a crash and causes a DoS condition.
