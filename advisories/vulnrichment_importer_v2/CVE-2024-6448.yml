aliases: []
summary: The Mollie Payments for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to information
  exposure in all versions up to, and including, 7.7.0. This is due to the error reporting being
  enabled by default in multiple plugin files. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to obtain the full path to instances, which they may be able to use in combination with other
  vulnerabilities or to simplify reconnaissance work. On its own, this information is of very
  limited use.
