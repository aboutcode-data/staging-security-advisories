aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for Microsoft Windows
  and Cisco Webex Player for Microsoft Windows could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
  code on an affected system. The vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient validation of certain
  elements with a Webex recording stored in either the Advanced Recording Format (ARF) or the
  Webex Recording Format (WRF). An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a
  user a malicious ARF or WRF file through a link or email attachment and persuading the user
  to open the file with the affected software on the local system. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of
  the targeted user.
