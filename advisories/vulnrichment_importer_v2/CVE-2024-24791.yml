aliases: []
summary: 'The net/http HTTP/1.1 client mishandled the case where a server responds to a request
  with an "Expect: 100-continue" header with a non-informational (200 or higher) status. This
  mishandling could leave a client connection in an invalid state, where the next request sent
  on the connection will fail. An attacker sending a request to a net/http/httputil.ReverseProxy
  proxy can exploit this mishandling to cause a denial of service by sending "Expect: 100-continue"
  requests which elicit a non-informational response from the backend. Each such request leaves
  the proxy with an invalid connection, and causes one subsequent request using that connection
  to fail.'
