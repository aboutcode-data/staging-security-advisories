  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  SUNRPC: Fix a slow server-side memory leak with RPC-over-TCP

  Jan Schunk reports that his small NFS servers suffer from memory
  exhaustion after just a few days. A bisect shows that commit
  e18e157bb5c8 ("SUNRPC: Send RPC message on TCP with a single
  sock_sendmsg() call") is the first bad commit.

  That commit assumed that sock_sendmsg() releases all the pages in
  the underlying bio_vec array, but the reality is that it doesn't.
  svc_xprt_release() releases the rqst's response pages, but the
  record marker page fragment isn't one of those, so it is never
  released.

  This is a narrow fix that can be applied to stable kernels. A
  more extensive fix is in the works.
