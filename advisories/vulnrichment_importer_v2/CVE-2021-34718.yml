aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the SSH Server process of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an authenticated,
  remote attacker to overwrite and read arbitrary files on the local device. This vulnerability
  is due to insufficient input validation of arguments that are supplied by the user for a specific
  file transfer method. An attacker with lower-level privileges could exploit this vulnerability
  by specifying Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) parameters when authenticating to a device. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to elevate their privileges and retrieve and upload files
  on a device that they should not have access to.
