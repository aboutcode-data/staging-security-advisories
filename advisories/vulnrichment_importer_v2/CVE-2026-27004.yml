aliases: []
summary: 'OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to version 2026.2.15, in some shared-agent
  deployments, OpenClaw session tools (`sessions_list`, `sessions_history`, `sessions_send`)
  allowed broader session targeting than some operators intended. This is primarily a configuration/visibility-scoping
  issue in multi-user environments where peers are not equally trusted. In Telegram webhook
  mode, monitor startup also did not fall back to per-account `webhookSecret` when only the
  account-level secret was configured. In shared-agent, multi-user, less-trusted environments:
  session-tool access could expose transcript content across peer sessions. In single-agent
  or trusted environments, practical impact is limited. In Telegram webhook mode, account-level
  secret wiring could be missed unless an explicit monitor webhook secret override was provided.
  Version 2026.2.15 fixes the issue.'
