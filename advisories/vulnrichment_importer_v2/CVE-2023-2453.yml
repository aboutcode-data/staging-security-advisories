aliases: []
summary: There is insufficient sanitization of tainted file names that are directly concatenated
  with a path that is subsequently passed to a ‘require_once’ statement. This allows arbitrary
  files with the ‘.php’ extension for which the absolute path is known to be included and executed.
  There are no known means in PHPFusion through which an attacker can upload and target a ‘.php’
  file payload.
