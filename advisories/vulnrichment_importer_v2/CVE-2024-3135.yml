aliases: []
summary: A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the mudler/localai application,
  allowing attackers to craft malicious webpages that, when visited by a victim, perform unauthorized
  actions on the victim's local LocalAI instance without their consent. This vulnerability enables
  attackers to exhaust system resources, consume credits, and fill disk space by making numerous
  resource-intensive API calls, such as generating images or uploading files. The vulnerability
  stems from the application's acceptance of simple request content-types without requiring
  CSRF tokens or implementing other CSRF mitigation measures. Successful exploitation does not
  require network access to the vulnerable LocalAI environment.
