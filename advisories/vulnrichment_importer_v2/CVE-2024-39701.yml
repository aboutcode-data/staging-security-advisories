aliases: []
summary: 'Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Directus
  >=9.23.0, <=v10.5.3 improperly handles _in, _nin operators. It evaluates empty arrays as valid
  so expressions like {"role": {"_in": $CURRENT_USER.some_field}} would evaluate to true allowing
  the request to pass. This results in Broken Access Control because the rule fails to do what
  it was intended to do: Pass rule if **field** matches any of the **values**. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 10.6.0.'
