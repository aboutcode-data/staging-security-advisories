aliases: []
summary: The Website Builder by SeedProd — Theme Builder, Landing Page Builder, Coming Soon
  Page, Maintenance Mode plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of
  data due to a missing capability check on the seedprod_lite_new_lpage function in all versions
  up to, and including, 6.15.21. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change
  the contents of coming-soon, maintenance pages, login and 404 pages set up with the plugin.
  Version 6.15.22 addresses this issue but introduces a bug affecting admin pages. We suggest
  upgrading to 6.15.23.
