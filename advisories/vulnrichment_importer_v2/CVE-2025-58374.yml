aliases: []
summary: Roo Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent that lives in users' editors. Versions
  3.25.23 and below contain a default list of allowed commands that do not need manual approval
  if auto-approve is enabled, and npm install is included in that list. Because npm install
  executes lifecycle scripts, if a repository’s package.json file contains a malicious postinstall
  script, it would be executed automatically without user approval. This means that enabling
  auto-approved commands and opening a malicious repo could result in arbitrary code execution.
  This is fixed in version 3.26.0.
