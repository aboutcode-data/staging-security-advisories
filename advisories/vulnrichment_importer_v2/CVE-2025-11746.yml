aliases: []
summary: The XStore theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions
  up to, and including, 9.5.4 via theet_ajax_required_plugins_popup() function. This makes it
  possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to include and
  execute arbitrary .php files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those
  files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code
  execution in cases where .php file types can be uploaded and included.
