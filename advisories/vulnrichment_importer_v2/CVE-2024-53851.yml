aliases: []
summary: Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. In affected versions
  the endpoint for generating inline oneboxes for URLs wasn't enforcing limits on the number
  of URLs that it accepted, allowing a malicious user to inflict denial of service on some parts
  of the app. This vulnerability is only exploitable by authenticated users. This issue has
  been patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse. Users are
  advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should turn off the `enable inline onebox on all
  domains` site setting and remove all entries from the `allowed inline onebox domains` site
  setting.
