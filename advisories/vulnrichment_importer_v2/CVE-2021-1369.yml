aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM) On-Box Software
  could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain read and write access to information
  that is stored on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to the improper handling of
  XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by sending malicious requests that contain references in XML entities to
  an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve files from the
  local system, resulting in the disclosure of sensitive information or causing a partial denial
  of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.
