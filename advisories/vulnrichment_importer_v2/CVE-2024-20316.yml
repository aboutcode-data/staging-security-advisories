aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the data model interface (DMI) services of Cisco IOS XE Software\
  \ could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access resources that should have been\
  \ protected by a configured IPv4 access control list (ACL).\r\n\r This vulnerability is due\
  \ to improper handling of error conditions when a successfully authorized device administrator\
  \ updates an IPv4 ACL using the NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol, and the update would reorder\
  \ access control entries (ACEs) in the updated ACL. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by accessing resources that should have been protected across an affected device."
