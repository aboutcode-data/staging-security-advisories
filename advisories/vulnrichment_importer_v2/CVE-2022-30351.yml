aliases: []
summary: PDFZorro PDFZorro Online r20220428 using TCPDF 6.2.5, despite having workflows claiming
  to correctly remove redacted information from a supplied PDF file, does not properly sanitize
  this information in all cases, causing redacted information, including images and text embedded
  in the PDF file, to be leaked unintentionally. In cases where PDF text objects are present
  it is possible to copy-paste redacted information into the system clipboard. Once a document
  is "locked" and marked for redaction once, all redactions performed after this feature is
  triggered are vulnerable.
