summary: A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in binary-husky/gpt_academic
  version git 310122f. The application has a functionality to download papers from arxiv.org,
  but the URL validation is incomplete. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to make the

  and can escalate local exploits to network-based attacks.
