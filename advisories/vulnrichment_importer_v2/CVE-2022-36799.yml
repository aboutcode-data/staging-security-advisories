aliases: []
summary: This issue exists to document that a security improvement in the way that Jira Server
  and Data Center use templates has been implemented. Affected versions of Atlassian Jira Server
  and Data Center allowed remote attackers with system administrator permissions to execute
  arbitrary code via Template Injection leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in the Email
  Templates feature. In this case the security improvement was to protect against using the
  XStream library to be able to execute arbitrary code in velocity templates. The affected versions
  are before version 8.13.19, from version 8.14.0 before 8.20.7, and from version 8.21.0 before
  8.22.1.
