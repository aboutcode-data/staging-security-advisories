aliases: []
summary: The BA Book Everything plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary password reset
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.20. This is due to the reset_user_password() function
  not verifying a user's identity prior to setting a password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to reset any user's passwords, including administrators. It's important to note
  that the attacker will not have access to the generated password, therefore, privilege escalation
  is not possible.
