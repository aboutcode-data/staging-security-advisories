aliases: []
summary: 'An unauthenticated command injection vulnerability exists in VICIdial versions 2.9
  RC1 through 2.13 RC1, within the vicidial_sales_viewer.php component when password encryption
  is enabled (a non-default configuration). The application improperly passes the HTTP Basic
  Authentication password directly to a call to exec() without adequate sanitation. This allows
  remote attackers to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands as the web server
  user. NOTE: This vulnerability was mitigated in 2017.'
