aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in OpenSlides before 4.2.5. During login at the /system/auth/login/
  endpoint, the system's response times differ depending on whether a user exists in the system.
  The timing discrepancy stems from the omitted hashing of the password (e.g., more than 100
  milliseconds).
