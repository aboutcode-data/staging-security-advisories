aliases: []
summary: The Bit Form – Contact Form Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
  workflow execution due to missing authorization in the triggerWorkFlow function in all versions
  up to, and including, 2.21.6. This is due to a logic flaw in the nonce verification where
  the security check only blocks requests when both the nonce verification fails and the user
  is logged in. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to replay form workflow
  executions and trigger all configured integrations including webhooks, email notifications,
  CRM integrations, and automation platforms via the bitforms_trigger_workflow AJAX action granted
  they can obtain the entry ID and log IDs from a legitimate form submission response.
