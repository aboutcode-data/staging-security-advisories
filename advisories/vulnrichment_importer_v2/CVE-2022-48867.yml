summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndmaengine:\
  \ idxd: Prevent use after free on completion memory\n\nOn driver unload any pending descriptors\
  \ are flushed at the\ntime the interrupt is freed:\nidxd_dmaengine_drv_remove() ->\n\tdrv_disable_wq()\
  \ ->\n\t\tidxd_wq_free_irq() ->\n\t\t\tidxd_flush_pending_descs().\n\nIf there are any descriptors\
  \ present that need to be flushed this\nflow triggers a \"not present\" page fault as below:\n\
  \n BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ff391c97c70c9040\n #PF: supervisor read access\
  \ in kernel mode\n #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\n\nThe address that triggers\
  \ the fault is the address of the\ndescriptor that was freed moments earlier via:\ndrv_disable_wq()->idxd_wq_free_resources()\n\
  \nFix the use after free by freeing the descriptors after any possible\nusage. This is done\
  \ after idxd_wq_reset() to ensure that the memory\nremains accessible during possible completion\
  \ writes by the device."
