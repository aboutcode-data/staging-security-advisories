aliases: []
summary: Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. In versions 1.7.52 and below,
  manipulating internal settings may lead to RCE. Cursor detects path manipulation via forward
  slashes (./.cursor/./././././mcp.json etc.), and requires human approval to complete the operation.
  However, the same kind of manipulation using backslashes was not correctly detected, allowing
  an attacker who had already achieved prompt injection or some other level of control to overwrite
  sensitive editor files without approval on Windows machines. This issue is fixed in version
  2.0.
