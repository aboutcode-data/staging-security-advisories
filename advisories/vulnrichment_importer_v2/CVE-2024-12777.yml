aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in aimhubio/aim version 3.25.0 allows for a denial of service through
  the misuse of the sshfs-client. The tracking server, which is single-threaded, can be made
  unresponsive by requesting it to connect to an unresponsive socket via sshfs. The lack of
  an additional timeout setting in the sshfs-client causes the server to hang for a significant
  amount of time, preventing it from responding to other requests.
