  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a device to reload. The vulnerability is due
  to the way fragmented packets are handled in the firewall code. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by sending fragmented IP Version 4 or IP Version 6 packets through an affected
  device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to crash, resulting in a denial
  of service (DoS) condition. The following releases of Cisco IOS XE Software are vulnerable:
