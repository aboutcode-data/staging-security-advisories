summary: A Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in janeczku/calibre-web, specifically
  in the file `edit_books.js`. The vulnerability occurs when editing book properties, such as
  uploading a cover or a format. The affected code directly inserts user input into the DOM
  without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code. This
  can lead to various attacks, including stealing cookies. The issue is present in the code
  handling the `#btn-upload-cover` change event.
