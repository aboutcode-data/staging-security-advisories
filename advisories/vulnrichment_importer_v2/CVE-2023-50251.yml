aliases: []
summary: php-svg-lib is an SVG file parsing / rendering library. Prior to version 0.5.1, when
  parsing the attributes passed to a `use` tag inside an svg document, an attacker can cause
  the system to go to an infinite recursion. Depending on the system configuration and attack
  pattern this could exhaust the memory available to the executing process and/or to the server
  itself. An attacker sending multiple request to a system to render the above payload can potentially
  cause resource exhaustion to the point that the system is unable to handle incoming request.
  Version 0.5.1 contains a patch for this issue.
