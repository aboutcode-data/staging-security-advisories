aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in the authentication enforcement mechanism of a model inference API
  in ai-inference-server. All /v1/* endpoints are expected to enforce API key validation. However,
  the POST /invocations endpoint failed to do so, resulting in an authentication bypass. This
  vulnerability allows unauthorized users to access the same inference features available on
  protected endpoints, potentially exposing sensitive functionality or allowing unintended access
  to backend resources.
