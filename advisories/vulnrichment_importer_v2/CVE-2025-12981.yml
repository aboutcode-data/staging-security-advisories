aliases: []
summary: The Listee theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions
  up to, and including, 1.1.6. This is due to a broken validation check in the bundled listee-core
  plugin's user registration function that fails to properly sanitize the user_role parameter.
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register as Administrator by manipulating
  the user_role parameter during registration.
