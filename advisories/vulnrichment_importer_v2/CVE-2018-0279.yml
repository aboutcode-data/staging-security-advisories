aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) server of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure
  Software (NFVIS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access the shell of the
  underlying Linux operating system on the affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper
  input validation of command arguments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using
  crafted arguments when opening a connection to the affected device. An exploit could allow
  the attacker to gain shell access with a non-root user account to the underlying Linux operating
  system on the affected device. Due to the system design, access to the Linux shell could allow
  execution of additional attacks that may have a significant impact on the affected system.
  This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running release 3.7.1, 3.6.3, or earlier
  releases of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) when access to the SCP server
  is allowed on the affected device. Cisco NFVIS Releases 3.5.x and 3.6.x do allow access to
  the SCP server by default, while Cisco NFVIS Release 3.7.1 does not. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvh25026.'
