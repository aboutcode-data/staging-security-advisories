aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the implementation of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) functionality
  in Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial
  of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of a BGP update
  message that contains a specific BGP attribute. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending BGP update messages that include a specific, malformed attribute to be processed
  by an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the BGP process
  to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. The Cisco implementation of BGP accepts
  incoming BGP traffic only from explicitly defined peers. To exploit this vulnerability, the
  malicious BGP update message would need to come from a configured, valid BGP peer or would
  need to be injected by the attacker into the victim&rsquo;s BGP network on an existing, valid
  TCP connection to a BGP peer.
