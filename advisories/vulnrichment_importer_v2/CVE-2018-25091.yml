aliases: []
summary: 'urllib3 before 1.24.2 does not remove the authorization HTTP header when following
  a cross-origin redirect (i.e., a redirect that differs in host, port, or scheme). This can
  allow for credentials in the authorization header to be exposed to unintended hosts or transmitted
  in cleartext. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-20060 (which
  was case-sensitive).'
