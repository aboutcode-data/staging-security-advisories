aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the self-healing functionality of Cisco IOS XE Software for Embedded
  Wireless Controllers on Catalyst Access Points could allow an authenticated, local attacker
  to escape the restricted controller shell and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying
  operating system of the access point. This vulnerability is due to improper checks throughout
  the restart of certain system processes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging
  on to an affected device and executing certain CLI commands. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying OS as root. To successfully exploit
  this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid credentials for a privilege level 15 user
  of the wireless controller.
