aliases: []
summary: urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. Prior to 2.5.0, it is possible
  to disable redirects for all requests by instantiating a PoolManager and specifying retries
  in a way that disable redirects. By default, requests and botocore users are not affected.
  An application attempting to mitigate SSRF or open redirect vulnerabilities by disabling redirects
  at the PoolManager level will remain vulnerable. This issue has been patched in version 2.5.0.
