aliases: []
summary: The simplified implementation of blocking reads and writes introduced in Tomcat 10
  and back-ported to Tomcat 9.0.47 onwards exposed a long standing (but extremely hard to trigger)
  concurrency bug in Apache Tomcat 10.1.0 to 10.1.0-M12, 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.18, 9.0.0-M1 to 9.0.60
  and 8.5.0 to 8.5.77 that could cause client connections to share an Http11Processor instance
  resulting in responses, or part responses, to be received by the wrong client.
