aliases: []
summary: When generating the systemd service units for the docker snap (and other similar snaps),
  snapd does not specify Delegate=yes - as a result systemd will move processes from the containers
  created and managed by these snaps into the cgroup of the main daemon within the snap itself
  when reloading system units. This may grant additional privileges to a container within the
  snap that were not originally intended.
