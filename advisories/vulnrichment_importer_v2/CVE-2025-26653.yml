summary: SAP NetWeaver Application Server ABAP does not sufficiently encode user-controlled
  inputs, leading to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This enables an attacker,
  without requiring any privileges, to inject malicious JavaScript into a website. When a user
  visits the compromised page, the injected script gets executed, potentially compromising the
  confidentiality and integrity within the scope of the victim�s browser. Availability is not
  impacted.
