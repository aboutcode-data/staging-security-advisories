aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the detection engine of Cisco Firepower System Software could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured file action policy that is intended
  to drop the Server Message Block Version 2 (SMB2) and SMB Version 3 (SMB3) protocols if malware
  is detected. The vulnerability is due to incorrect detection of an SMB2 or SMB3 file based
  on the total file length. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted
  SMB2 or SMB3 transfer request through the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker
  to pass SMB2 or SMB3 files that could be malware even though the device is configured to block
  them. This vulnerability does not exist for SMB Version 1 (SMB1) files. This vulnerability
  affects Cisco Firepower System Software when one or more file action policies are configured,
  on software releases prior to 6.2.3. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg68807.'
