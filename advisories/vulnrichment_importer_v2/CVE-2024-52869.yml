aliases: []
summary: Certain Teradata account-handling code through 2024-11-04, used with SUSE Enterprise
  Linux Server, mismanages groups. Specifically, when there is an operating system move from
  SUSE Enterprise Linux Server (SLES) 12 Service Pack (SP) 2 or 3 to SLES 15 SP2 on Teradata
  Database systems, some service/system user accounts, and possibly systems administrator created
  user accounts, are incorrectly assigned to groups that allow higher system-level privileges
  than intended for those user accounts. Depending on the usage of these accounts, this may
  lead to full system compromise.
