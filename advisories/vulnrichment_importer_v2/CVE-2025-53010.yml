aliases: []
summary: MaterialX is an open standard for the exchange of rich material and look-development
  content across applications and renderers. In version 1.39.2, when parsing shader nodes in
  a MTLX file, the MaterialXCore code accesses a potentially null pointer, which can lead to
  crashes with maliciously crafted files. An attacker could intentionally crash a target program
  that uses OpenEXR by sending a malicious MTLX file. This is fixed in version 1.39.3.
