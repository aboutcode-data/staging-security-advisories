aliases: []
summary: Deck Mate 1 executes firmware directly from an external EEPROM without verifying authenticity
  or integrity. An attacker with physical access can replace or reflash the EEPROM to run arbitrary
  code that persists across reboots. Because this design predates modern secure-boot or signed-update
  mechanisms, affected systems should be physically protected or retired from service. The vendor
  has not indicated that firmware updates are available for this legacy model.
