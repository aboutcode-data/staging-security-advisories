aliases: []
summary: iccDEV provides libraries and tools for interacting with, manipulating, and applying
  ICC color management profiles. In versions 2.3.1.1 and below, an integer overflow vulnerability
  exists in icValidateStatus CIccProfile::CheckHeader() when user-controllable input is incorporated
  into profile data unsafely. Tampering with tag tables, offsets, or size fields can trigger
  parsing errors, memory corruption, or DoS, potentially enabling arbitrary Code Execution or
  bypassing application logic. This issue has been fixed in version 2.3.1.2.
