aliases: []
summary: An exposure of sensitive information vulnerability exists in the Rockwell Automation
  FactoryTalk® System Service. A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability by starting
  a back-up or restore process, which temporarily exposes private keys, passwords, pre-shared
  keys, and database folders when they are temporarily copied to an interim folder. This vulnerability
  is due to the lack of explicit permissions set on the backup folder. If private keys are obtained
  by a malicious user, they could impersonate resources on the secured network.
