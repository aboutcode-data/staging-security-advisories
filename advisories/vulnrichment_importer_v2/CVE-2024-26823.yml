  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  irqchip/gic-v3-its: Restore quirk probing for ACPI-based systems

  While refactoring the way the ITSs are probed, the handling of quirks
  applicable to ACPI-based platforms was lost. As a result, systems such as
  HIP07 lose their GICv4 functionnality, and some other may even fail to
  boot, unless they are configured to boot with DT.

  Move the enabling of quirks into its_probe_one(), making it common to all
  firmware implementations.
