aliases: []
summary: The SQL Expressions experimental feature of Grafana allows for the evaluation of `duckdb`
  queries containing user input. These queries are insufficiently sanitized before being passed
  to `duckdb`, leading to a command injection and local file inclusion vulnerability. Any user
  with the VIEWER or higher permission is capable of executing this attack.  The `duckdb` binary
  must be present in Grafana's $PATH for this attack to function; by default, this binary is
  not installed in Grafana distributions.
