aliases: []
summary: D-Link D-View 8 versions 2.0.1.107 and below contain an uncontrolled search path vulnerability
  in the installer. When executed with elevated privileges via UAC, the installer attempts to
  load version.dll from its execution directory, allowing DLL preloading. An attacker can supply
  a malicious version.dll alongside the legitimate installer so that, when a victim runs the
  installer and approves the UAC prompt, attacker-controlled code executes with administrator
  privileges. This can lead to full system compromise.
