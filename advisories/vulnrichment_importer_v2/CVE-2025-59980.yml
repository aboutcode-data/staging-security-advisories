  An Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness

  in the FTP server of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to get limited read-write access to files on the device.
  When the FTP server is enabled and a user named "ftp" or "anonymous" is configured, that user can login without providing the configured password and then has read-write access to their home directory.

  This issue affects Junos OS: 



    *  all versions before 22.4R3-S8,
    *  23.2 versions before 23.2R2-S3,
    *  23.4 versions before 23.4R2.
