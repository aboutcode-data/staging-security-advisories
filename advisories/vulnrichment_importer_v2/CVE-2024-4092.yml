aliases: []
summary: The Slider Revolution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the ‘htmltag’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 6.7.7 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page. By default, this can only be exploited by administrators, but the ability to use and
  configure Slider Revolution can be extended to authors.
