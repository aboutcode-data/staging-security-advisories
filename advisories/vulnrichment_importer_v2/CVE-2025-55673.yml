aliases: []
summary: |
  When a guest user accesses a chart in Apache Superset, the API response from the /chart/data endpoint includes a query field in its payload. This field contains the underlying query, which improperly discloses database schema information, such as table names, to the low-privileged guest user.

  This issue affects Apache Superset: before 4.1.3.

  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.1.3, which fixes the issue.
