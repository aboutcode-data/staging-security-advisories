aliases: []
summary: The Events Made Easy plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due
  to a missing capability check on several functions related to AJAX actions in versions up
  to, and including, 2.3.16. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level
  permissions and above, to invoke those functions intended for administrator use. While the
  plugin is still pending review from the WordPress repository, site owners can download a copy
  of the patched version directly from the developer's Github at https://github.com/liedekef/events-made-easy
