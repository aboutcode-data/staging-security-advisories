  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  nbd: fix race between timeout and normal completion

  If request timetout is handled by nbd_requeue_cmd(), normal completion
  has to be stopped for avoiding to complete this requeued request, other
  use-after-free can be triggered.

  Fix the race by clearing NBD_CMD_INFLIGHT in nbd_requeue_cmd(), meantime
  make sure that cmd->lock is grabbed for clearing the flag and the
  requeue.
