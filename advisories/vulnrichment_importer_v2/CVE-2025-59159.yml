aliases: []
summary: 'SillyTavern is a locally installed user interface that allows users to interact with
  text generation large language models, image generation engines, and text-to-speech voice
  models. In versions prior to 1.13.4, the web user interface for SillyTavern is susceptible
  to DNS rebinding, allowing attackers to perform actions like install malicious extensions,
  read chats, inject arbitrary HTML for phishing attacks, etc. The vulnerability has been patched
  in the version 1.13.4 by introducing a server configuration setting that enables a validation
  of host names in inbound HTTP requests according to the provided list of allowed hosts: `hostWhitelist.enabled`
  in config.yaml file or `SILLYTAVERN_HOSTWHITELIST_ENABLED` environment variable. While the
  setting is disabled by default to honor a wide variety of existing user configurations and
  maintain backwards compatibility, existing and new users are encouraged to review their server
  configurations and apply necessary changes to their setup, especially if hosting over the
  local network while not using SSL.'
