  gpio: mockup: fix NULL pointer dereference when removing debugfs

  We now remove the device's debugfs entries when unbinding the driver.
  This now causes a NULL-pointer dereference on module exit because the
  platform devices are unregistered *after* the global debugfs directory
  has been recursively removed. Fix it by unregistering the devices first.
