aliases: []
summary: Icinga 2 is a monitoring system which checks the availability of network resources,
  notifies users of outages, and generates performance data for reporting. Prior to versions
  2.12.12, 2.13.12, and 2.14.6, the VerifyCertificate() function can be tricked into incorrectly
  treating certificates as valid. This allows an attacker to send a malicious certificate request
  that is then treated as a renewal of an already existing certificate, resulting in the attacker
  obtaining a valid certificate that can be used to impersonate trusted nodes. This only occurs
  when Icinga 2 is built with OpenSSL older than version 1.1.0. This issue has been patched
  in versions 2.12.12, 2.13.12, and 2.14.6.
