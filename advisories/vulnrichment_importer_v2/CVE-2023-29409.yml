aliases: []
summary: Extremely large RSA keys in certificate chains can cause a client/server to expend
  significant CPU time verifying signatures. With fix, the size of RSA keys transmitted during
  handshakes is restricted to <= 8192 bits. Based on a survey of publicly trusted RSA keys,
  there are currently only three certificates in circulation with keys larger than this, and
  all three appear to be test certificates that are not actively deployed. It is possible there
  are larger keys in use in private PKIs, but we target the web PKI, so causing breakage here
  in the interests of increasing the default safety of users of crypto/tls seems reasonable.
