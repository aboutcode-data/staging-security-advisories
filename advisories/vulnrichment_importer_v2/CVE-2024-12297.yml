aliases: []
summary: Moxa’s Ethernet switch is vulnerable to an authentication bypass because of flaws in
  its authorization mechanism. Although both client-side and back-end server verification are
  involved in the process, attackers can exploit weaknesses in its implementation. These vulnerabilities
  may enable brute-force attacks to guess valid credentials or MD5 collision attacks to forge
  authentication hashes, potentially compromising the security of the device.
