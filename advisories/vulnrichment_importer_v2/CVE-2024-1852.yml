aliases: []
summary: The WP-Members Membership Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the X-Forwarded-For header in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.9.2 due
  to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
  an injected page which is the edit users page. This vulnerability was partially patched in
  version 3.4.9.2, and was fully patched in 3.4.9.3.
