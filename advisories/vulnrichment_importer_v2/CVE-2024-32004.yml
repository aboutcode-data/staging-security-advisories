aliases: []
summary: Git is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2,
  2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, an attacker can prepare a local repository in such a way that,
  when cloned, will execute arbitrary code during the operation. The problem has been patched
  in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4. As a workaround, avoid
  cloning repositories from untrusted sources.
