summary: 'An Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in the PFE management daemon (evo-pfemand)
  of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to
  cause an FPC crash leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). When a specific SNMP GET operation
  or a specific CLI command is executed this will cause a GUID resource leak, eventually leading
  to exhaustion and result in an FPC crash and reboot. GUID exhaustion will trigger a syslog
  message like one of the following for example: evo-pfemand[<pid>]: get_next_guid: Ran out
  of Guid Space ... evo-aftmand-zx[<pid>]: get_next_guid: Ran out of Guid Space ... This leak
  can be monitored by running the following command and taking note of the value in the rightmost
  column labeled Guids: user@host> show platform application-info allocations app evo-pfemand
