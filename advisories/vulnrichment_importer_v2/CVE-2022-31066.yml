aliases: []
summary: EdgeX Foundry is an open source project for building a common open framework for Internet
  of Things edge computing. Prior to version 2.1.1, the /api/v2/config endpoint exposes message
  bus credentials to local unauthenticated users. In security-enabled mode, message bus credentials
  are supposed to be kept in the EdgeX secret store and require authentication to access. This
  vulnerability bypasses the access controls on message bus credentials when running in security-enabled
  mode. (No credentials are required when running in security-disabled mode.) As a result, attackers
  could intercept data or inject fake data into the EdgeX message bus. Users should upgrade
  to EdgeXFoundry Kamakura release (2.2.0) or to the June 2022 EdgeXFoundry LTS Jakarta release
  (2.1.1) to receive a patch. More information about which go modules, docker containers, and
  snaps contain patches is available in the GitHub Security Advisory. There are currently no
  known workarounds for this issue.
