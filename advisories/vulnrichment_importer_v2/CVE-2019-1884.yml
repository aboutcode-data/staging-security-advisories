summary: A vulnerability in the web proxy functionality of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco
  Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial
  of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  input validation mechanisms for certain fields in HTTP/HTTPS requests sent through an affected
  device. A successful attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious HTTP/HTTPS
  request through an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to force the device
  to stop processing traffic, resulting in a DoS condition.
