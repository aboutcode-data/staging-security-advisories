  net: ethernet: mtk_eth_soc: fix PPE hanging issue

  A patch to resolve an issue was found in MediaTek's GPL-licensed SDK:
  In the mtk_ppe_stop() function, the PPE scan mode is not disabled before
  disabling the PPE. This can potentially lead to a hang during the process
  of disabling the PPE.

  Without this patch, the PPE may experience a hang during the reboot test.
