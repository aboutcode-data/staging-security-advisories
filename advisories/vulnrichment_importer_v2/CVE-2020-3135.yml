summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications
  Manager (UCM) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request
  forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF

  level of the targeted user.
