aliases: []
summary: EasyFTP Server 1.7.0.11 and earlier contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability
  in its HTTP interface. When processing a GET request to list.html, the server fails to properly
  validate the length of the path parameter. Supplying an excessively long value causes a buffer
  overflow on the stack, potentially corrupting control flow structures. The vulnerability is
  exposed through the embedded web server and does not require authentication due to default
  anonymous access. The issue was resolved in version 1.7.0.12, after which the product was
  renamed to UplusFtp.
