aliases: []
summary: Helm is a tool for managing Charts, pre-configured Kubernetes resources. Versions prior
  to 3.10.3 are subject to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, resulting in Denial of Service.
  Input to functions in the _strvals_ package can cause a stack overflow. In Go, a stack overflow
  cannot be recovered from. Applications that use functions from the _strvals_ package in the
  Helm SDK can have a Denial of Service attack when they use this package and it panics. This
  issue has been patched in 3.10.3. SDK users can validate strings supplied by users won't create
  large arrays causing significant memory usage before passing them to the _strvals_ functions.
