  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  nilfs2: do not write dirty data after degenerating to read-only

  According to syzbot's report, mark_buffer_dirty() called from
  nilfs_segctor_do_construct() outputs a warning with some patterns after
  nilfs2 detects metadata corruption and degrades to read-only mode.

  After such read-only degeneration, page cache data may be cleared through
  nilfs_clear_dirty_page() which may also clear the uptodate flag for their
  buffer heads.  However, even after the degeneration, log writes are still
  performed by unmount processing etc., which causes mark_buffer_dirty() to
  be called for buffer heads without the "uptodate" flag and causes the
  warning.

  Since any writes should not be done to a read-only file system in the
  first place, this fixes the warning in mark_buffer_dirty() by letting
  nilfs_segctor_do_construct() abort early if in read-only mode.

  This also changes the retry check of nilfs_segctor_write_out() to avoid
  unnecessary log write retries if it detects -EROFS that
  nilfs_segctor_do_construct() returned.
