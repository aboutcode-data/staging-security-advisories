summary: RomM is a self-hosted rom manager and player. Versions prior to 3.10.3 and 4.0.0-beta.3
  have an authenticated path traversal vulnerability in the `/api/raw` endpoint. Anyone running
  the latest version of RomM and has multiple users, even unprivileged users, such as the kiosk
  user in the official implementation, may be affected. This allows the leakage of passwords
  and users that may be stored on the system. Versions 3.10.3 and 4.0.0-beta.3 contain a patch.
