datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2022/43xxx/CVE-2022-43627.json
aliases: []
summary: This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected
  installations of D-Link DIR-1935 1.03 routers. Although authentication is required to exploit
  this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The specific flaw
  exists within the handling of SetStaticRouteIPv4Settings requests to the web management portal.
  When parsing subelements within the StaticRouteIPv4Data element, the process does not properly
  validate a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can
  leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-16147.
