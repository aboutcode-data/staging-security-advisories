aliases: []
summary: FluxCP is a web-based Control Panel for rAthena servers written in PHP. A critical
  Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the FluxCP-based website template
  used by multiple rAthena/Ragnarok servers. State-changing POST endpoints accept browser-initiated
  requests that are authorized solely by the session cookie without per-request anti-CSRF tokens
  or robust Origin/Referer validation. An attacker who can lure a logged-in user to an attacker-controlled
  page can cause that user to perform sensitive actions without their intent. This vulnerability
  is fixed with commit e3f130c.
