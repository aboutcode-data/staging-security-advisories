summary: A vulnerability in certain web pages of Cisco Webex Meetings could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to modify a web page in the context of a user's browser. The vulnerability
  is due to improper checks on parameter values in affected pages. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a crafted link that is designed to pass

  the contents of a web page to redirect the user to potentially malicious websites, or the
  attacker could use this vulnerability to conduct further client-side attacks.
