datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2024-54660
datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2024/54xxx/CVE-2024-54660.json
aliases: []
summary: A JNDI injection issue was discovered in Cloudera JDBC Connector for Hive before 2.6.26
  and JDBC Connector for Impala before 2.6.35. Attackers can inject malicious parameters into
  the JDBC URL, triggering JNDI injection during the process when the JDBC Driver uses this
  URL to connect to the database. This could lead to remote code execution. JNDI injection is
  possible via the JDBC connection property krbJAASFile for the Java Authentication and Authorization
  Service (JAAS). Using untrusted parameters in the krbJAASFile and/or remote host can trigger
  JNDI injection in the JDBC URL through the krbJAASFile.
