  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  kdb: Fix buffer overflow during tab-complete

  Currently, when the user attempts symbol completion with the Tab key, kdb
  will use strncpy() to insert the completed symbol into the command buffer.
  Unfortunately it passes the size of the source buffer rather than the
  destination to strncpy() with predictably horrible results. Most obviously
  if the command buffer is already full but cp, the cursor position, is in
  the middle of the buffer, then we will write past the end of the supplied
  buffer.

  Fix this by replacing the dubious strncpy() calls with memmove()/memcpy()
  calls plus explicit boundary checks to make sure we have enough space
  before we start moving characters around.
