aliases: []
summary: "The Report Builder component of the application stores user input directly in a web\
  \ page and displays it to other users, which raised concerns about a possible Cross-Site Scripting\
  \ (XSS) attack. Proper management of this functionality helps ensure a secure and seamless\
  \ user experience.  Although the user input is not validated in the report creation, these\
  \ scripts are not executed when the report is run by end users. The script is executed when\
  \ the report is modified through the report builder by a user with edit permissions. \n\n\n\
  \n\nThe Report Builder is part of the WebConsole.  The WebConsole package is currently end\
  \ of life, and is no longer maintained. We strongly recommend against installing or using\
  \ it in any production environment. However, if you choose to install it, for example, to\
  \ access functionality like the Report Builder, it must be deployed within a fully isolated\
  \ network that has no access to sensitive data or internet connectivity. This is a critical\
  \ security precaution, as the retired package may contain unpatched vulnerabilities and is\
  \ no longer supported with updates or fixes."
