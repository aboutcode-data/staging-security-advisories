summary: A vulnerability in the web UI feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to conduct a cross-site WebSocket hijacking (CSWSH) attack and cause a denial
  of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient
  HTTP protections in the web UI on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
