aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Unidirectional Link Detection (UDLD) feature of Cisco FXOS
  Software and Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute
  arbitrary code with administrative privileges or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition
  on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Cisco UDLD protocol packets to a directly
  connected, affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
  code with administrative privileges or cause the Cisco UDLD process to crash and restart multiple
  times, causing the affected device to reload and resulting in a DoS condition. Note: The UDLD
  feature is disabled by default, and the conditions to exploit this vulnerability are strict.
  The attacker needs full control of a directly connected device. That device must be connected
  over a port channel that has UDLD enabled. To trigger arbitrary code execution, both the UDLD-enabled
  port channel and specific system conditions must exist. In the absence of either the UDLD-enabled
  port channel or the system conditions, attempts to exploit this vulnerability will result
  in a DoS condition. It is possible, but highly unlikely, that an attacker could control the
  necessary conditions for exploitation. The CVSS score reflects this possibility. However,
  given the complexity of exploitation, Cisco has assigned a Medium Security Impact Rating (SIR)
  to this vulnerability.'
