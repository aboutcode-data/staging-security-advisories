aliases: []
summary: In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users
  to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper
  access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete
  evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing
  permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations.
