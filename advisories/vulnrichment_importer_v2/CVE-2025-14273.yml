summary: 'Mattermost versions 11.1.x <= 11.1.0, 11.0.x <= 11.0.5, 10.12.x <= 10.12.3, 10.11.x
  <= 10.11.7 with the Jira plugin enabled and Mattermost Jira plugin versions <=4.4.0 fail to
  enforce authentication and issue-key path restrictions in the Jira plugin, which allows an
  unauthenticated attacker who knows a valid user ID to issue authenticated GET and POST requests
  to the Jira server via crafted plugin payloads that spoof the user ID and inject arbitrary
  issue key paths. Mattermost Advisory ID: MMSA-2025-00555'
