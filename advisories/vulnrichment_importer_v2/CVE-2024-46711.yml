summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mptcp: pm: fix ID 0 endp usage after multiple re-creations

  'local_addr_used' and 'add_addr_accepted' are decremented for addresses
  not related to the initial subflow (ID0), because the source and
  destination addresses of the initial subflows are known from the
  beginning: they don't count as "additional local address being used" or
  "ADD_ADDR being accepted".

  It is then required not to increment them when the entrypoint used by
  the initial subflow is removed and re-added during a connection. Without
  this modification, this entrypoint cannot be removed and re-added more
  than once.
