aliases: []
summary: OpenSearch is a community-driven, open source fork of Elasticsearch and Kibana. There
  is an issue with the implementation of fine-grained access control rules (document-level security,
  field-level security and field masking) where they are not correctly applied to the indices
  that back data streams potentially leading to incorrect access authorization. OpenSearch 1.3.7
  and 2.4.0 contain a fix for this issue. Users are advised to update. There are no known workarounds
  for this issue.
