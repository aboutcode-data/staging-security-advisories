summary: The Simple Featured Image plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the ‘slideshow’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.1 due to insufficient

  with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
  execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
