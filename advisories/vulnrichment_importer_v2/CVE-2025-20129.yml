aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based chat interface of Cisco Customer Collaboration Platform\
  \ (CCP), formerly Cisco SocialMiner, could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to persuade\
  \ users to disclose sensitive data.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper sanitization\
  \ of HTTP requests that are sent to the web-based chat interface. An attacker could exploit\
  \ this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the chat interface of a targeted\
  \ user on a vulnerable server. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to redirect chat\
  \ traffic to a server that is under their control, resulting in sensitive information being\
  \ redirected to the attacker."
