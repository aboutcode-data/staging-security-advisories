summary: CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security
  Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running
  the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. A critical heap buffer overflow vulnerability
  was identified in the `Crypto_TC_Prep_AAD` function of CryptoLib versions 1.3.3 and prior.
  This vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) or potentially
  execute arbitrary code (RCE) by providing a maliciously crafted telecommand (TC) frame that
  causes an unsigned integer underflow. The vulnerability lies in the function `Crypto_TC_Prep_AAD`,
  specifically during the computation of `tc_mac_start_index`. The affected code incorrectly
  calculates the MAC start index without ensuring it remains within the bounds of the `ingest`
  buffer. When `tc_mac_start_index` underflows due to an incorrect length calculation, the function
  attempts to access an out-of-bounds memory location, leading to a segmentation fault. The
  vulnerability is still present in the repository as of commit `d3cc420ace96d02a5b7e83d88cbd2e48010d5723`.
