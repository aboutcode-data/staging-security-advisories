aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Vaultwarden (formerly Bitwarden_RS) 1.30.3. A stored cross-site
  scripting (XSS) or, due to the default CSP, HTML injection vulnerability has been discovered
  in the admin dashboard. This potentially allows an authenticated attacker to inject malicious
  code into the dashboard, which is then executed or rendered in the context of an administrator's
  browser when viewing the injected content. However, it is important to note that the default
  Content Security Policy (CSP) of the application blocks most exploitation paths, significantly
  mitigating the potential impact.
