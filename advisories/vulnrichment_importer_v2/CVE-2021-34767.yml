aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in IPv6 traffic processing of Cisco IOS XE Wireless Controller Software
  for Cisco Catalyst 9000 Family Wireless Controllers could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent
  attacker to cause a Layer 2 (L2) loop in a configured VLAN, resulting in a denial of service
  (DoS) condition for that VLAN. The vulnerability is due to a logic error when processing specific
  link-local IPv6 traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted
  IPv6 packet that would flow inbound through the wired interface of an affected device. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to cause traffic drops in the affected VLAN, thus triggering
  the DoS condition.
