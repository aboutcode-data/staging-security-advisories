aliases: []
summary: 'The Page Builder: Pagelayer – Drag and Drop website builder plugin for WordPress is
  vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ''pagelayer_header_code'', ''pagelayer_body_open_code'',
  and ''pagelayer_footer_code'' meta fields in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.8 due
  to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject
  arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
  This appears to be a reintroduction of a vulnerability patched in version 1.7.7.'
