aliases: []
summary: An OS command injection vulnerability exists in the Blue Angel Software Suite running
  on embedded Linux devices via the ping_addr parameter in the webctrl.cgi script. The application
  fails to properly sanitize input before passing it to the system-level ping command. An authenticated
  attacker can inject arbitrary commands by appending shell metacharacters to the ping_addr
  parameter in a crafted GET request to /cgi-bin/webctrl.cgi?action=pingtest_update. The command's
  output is reflected in the application's web interface, enabling attackers to view results
  directly. Default and backdoor credentials can be used to access the interface and exploit
  the issue. Successful exploitation results in arbitrary command execution as the root user.
  Exploitation evidence was observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2025-01-26 UTC.
