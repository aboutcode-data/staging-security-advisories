summary: The Ultimate Addons for WPBakery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the plugin's ult_team shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 3.19.20

  makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to
  inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page.
