aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the sftunnel functionality of Cisco Firepower Management Center
  (FMC) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to obtain the device registration hash. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  sftunnel negotiation protection during initial device registration. An attacker in a man-in-the-middle
  position could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting a specific flow of the sftunnel
  communication between an FMC device and an FTD device. A successful exploit could allow the
  attacker to decrypt and modify the sftunnel communication between FMC and FTD devices, allowing
  the attacker to modify configuration data sent from an FMC device to an FTD device or alert
  data sent from an FTD device to an FMC device.
