aliases: []
summary: CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security
  Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running
  the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. In 1.3.3 and earlier, a heap buffer overflow
  vulnerability persists in the Crypto_TC_ApplySecurity function due to an incomplete validation
  check on the fl (frame length) field. Although CVE-2025-29912 addressed an underflow issue
  involving fl, the patch fails to fully prevent unsafe calculations. As a result, an attacker
  can still craft malicious frames that cause a negative tf_payload_len, which is then interpreted
  as a large unsigned value, leading to a heap buffer overflow in a memcpy call.
