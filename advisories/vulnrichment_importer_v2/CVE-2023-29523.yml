aliases: []
summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications
  built on top of it. Any user who can edit their own user profile can execute arbitrary script
  macros including Groovy and Python macros that allow remote code execution including unrestricted
  read and write access to all wiki contents. The same vulnerability can also be exploited in
  other contexts where the `display` method on a document is used to display a field with wiki
  syntax, for example in applications created using `App Within Minutes`. This has been patched
  in XWiki 13.10.11, 14.4.8, 14.10.2 and 15.0RC1. There is no workaround apart from upgrading.
