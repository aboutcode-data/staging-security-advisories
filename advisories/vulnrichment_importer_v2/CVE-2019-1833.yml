summary: A vulnerability in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol
  parser of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote
  attacker to bypass configured policies. The vulnerability is due to improper parsing of specific

  malicious TLS messages to the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to bypass the configured policies for the system, which could allow traffic to flow through
  without being inspected.
