aliases: []
summary: The Secure Flag passed to Versal™ Adaptive SoC’s Trusted Firmware for Cortex®-A processors
  (TF-A) for Arm’s Power State Coordination Interface (PSCI) commands were incorrectly set to
  secure instead of using the processor’s actual security state. This would allow the PSCI requests
  to appear they were from processors in the secure state instead of the non-secure state.
