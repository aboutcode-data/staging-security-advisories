summary: The Post Lockdown plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all
  versions up to, and including, 4.0.2 via the 'pl_autocomplete' AJAX action due to insufficient
  restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Subscriber-level access and above, to extract data from password protected, private,
  or draft posts that they should not have access to.
