aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Data Center Network
  Manager (DCNM) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request
  forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF
  protections for the web-based management interface on an affected device. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious link
  while having an active session on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the
  attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the targeted user.
