aliases: []
summary: Firecrawl turns entire websites into LLM-ready markdown or structured data. Prior to
  version 2.0.1, a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability was discovered in Firecrawl's
  webhook functionality. Authenticated users could configure a webhook to an internal URL and
  send POST requests with arbitrary headers, which may have allowed access to internal systems.
  This has been fixed in version 2.0.1. If upgrading is not possible, it is recommend to isolate
  Firecrawl from any sensitive internal systems.
