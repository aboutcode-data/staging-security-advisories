summary: Notepad++ is a free and open-source source code editor. An Unsafe Search Path vulnerability
  (CWE-426) exists in versions prior to 8.9.2 when launching Windows Explorer without an absolute
  executable path. This may allow execution of a malicious explorer.exe if an attacker can control
  the process working directory. Under certain conditions, this could lead to arbitrary code
  execution in the context of the running application. Version 8.9.2 patches the issue.
