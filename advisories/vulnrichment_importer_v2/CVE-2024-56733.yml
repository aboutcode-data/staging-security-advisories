aliases: []
summary: Password Pusher is an open source application to communicate sensitive information
  over the web. A vulnerability has been reported in versions 1.50.3 and prior where an attacker
  can copy the session cookie before a user logs out, potentially allowing session hijacking.
  Although the session token is replaced and invalidated upon logout, if an attacker manages
  to capture the session cookie before this process, they can use the token to gain unauthorized
  access to the user's session until the token expires or is manually cleared. This vulnerability
  hinges on the attacker's ability to access the session cookie during an active session, either
  through a man-in-the-middle attack, by exploiting another vulnerability like XSS, or via direct
  access to the victim's device. Although there is no direct resolution to this vulnerability,
  it is recommended to always use the latest version of Password Pusher to best mitigate risk.
  If self-hosting, ensure Password Pusher is hosted exclusively over SSL connections to encrypt
  traffic and prevent session cookies from being intercepted in transit. Additionally, implement
  best practices in local security to safeguard user systems, browsers, and data against unauthorized
  access.
