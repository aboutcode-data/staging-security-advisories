  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  sched/debug: fix dentry leak in update_sched_domain_debugfs

  Kuyo reports that the pattern of using debugfs_remove(debugfs_lookup())
  leaks a dentry and with a hotplug stress test, the machine eventually
  runs out of memory.

  Fix this up by using the newly created debugfs_lookup_and_remove() call
  instead which properly handles the dentry reference counting logic.
