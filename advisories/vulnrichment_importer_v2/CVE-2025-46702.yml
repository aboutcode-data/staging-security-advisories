aliases: []
summary: Mattermost versions 10.5.x <= 10.5.5, 9.11.x <= 9.11.15, 10.8.x <= 10.8.0, 10.7.x <=
  10.7.2, 10.6.x <= 10.6.5 fail to properly enforce channel member management permissions when
  adding participants to playbook runs. This allows authenticated users with member-level permissions
  to bypass system admin restrictions and add or remove users to/from private channels via the
  playbook run participants feature, even when the 'Manage Members' permission has been explicitly
  removed. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive channel content and allow guest
  users to gain channel management privileges.
