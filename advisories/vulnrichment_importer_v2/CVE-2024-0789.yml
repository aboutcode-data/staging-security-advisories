aliases: []
summary: The WP Maintenance plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to IP Address Spoofing in all
  versions up to, and including, 6.1.9.2 due to insufficient IP address validation and use of
  user-supplied HTTP headers as a primary method for IP retrieval. This makes it possible for
  unauthenticated attackers to bypass maintenance mode.
