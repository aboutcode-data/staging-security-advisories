  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  comedi: Fix memory leak in compat_insnlist()

  `compat_insnlist()` handles the 32-bit version of the `COMEDI_INSNLIST`
  ioctl (whenwhen `CONFIG_COMPAT` is enabled).  It allocates memory to
  temporarily hold an array of `struct comedi_insn` converted from the
  32-bit version in user space.  This memory is only being freed if there
  is a fault while filling the array, otherwise it is leaked.

  Add a call to `kfree()` to fix the leak.
