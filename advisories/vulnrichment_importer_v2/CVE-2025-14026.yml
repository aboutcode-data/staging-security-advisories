aliases: []
summary: Forcepoint One DLP Client, version 23.04.5642 (and possibly newer versions), includes
  a restricted version of Python 2.5.4 that prevents use of the ctypes library. ctypes is a
  foreign function interface (FFI) for Python, enabling calls to DLLs/shared libraries, memory
  allocation, and direct code execution. It was demonstrated that these restrictions could be
  bypassed.
