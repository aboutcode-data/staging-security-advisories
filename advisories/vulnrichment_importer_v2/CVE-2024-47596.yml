aliases: []
summary: GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An OOB-read
  has been discovered in the qtdemux_parse_svq3_stsd_data function within qtdemux.c. In the
  FOURCC_SMI_ case, seqh_size is read from the input file without proper validation. If seqh_size
  is greater than the remaining size of the data buffer, it can lead to an OOB-read in the following
  call to gst_buffer_fill, which internally uses memcpy. This vulnerability can result in reading
  up to 4GB of process memory or potentially causing a segmentation fault (SEGV) when accessing
  invalid memory. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.
