aliases: []
summary: 'Electron is a framework which lets you write cross-platform desktop applications using
  JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Electron apps using `contextIsolation` and `contextBridge` are affected.
  This is a context isolation bypass, meaning that code running in the main world context in
  the renderer can reach into the isolated Electron context and perform privileged actions.
  This issue is only exploitable if an API exposed to the main world via `contextBridge` can
  return an object or array that contains a javascript object which cannot be serialized, for
  instance, a canvas rendering context. This would normally result in an exception being thrown
  `Error: object could not be cloned`. The app side workaround is to ensure that such a case
  is not possible. Ensure all values returned from a function exposed over the context bridge
  are supported. This issue has been fixed in versions `25.0.0-alpha.2`, `24.0.1`, `23.2.3`,
  and `22.3.6`.'
