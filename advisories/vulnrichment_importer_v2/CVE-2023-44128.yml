aliases: []
summary: he vulnerability is to delete arbitrary files in LGInstallService ("com.lge.lginstallservies")
  app. The app contains the exported "com.lge.lginstallservies.InstallService" service that
  exposes an AIDL interface. All its "installPackage*" methods are finally calling the "installPackageVerify()"
  method that performs signature validation after the delete file method. An attacker can control
  conditions so this security check is never performed and an attacker-controlled file is deleted.
