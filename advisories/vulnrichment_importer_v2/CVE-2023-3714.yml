aliases: []
summary: The ProfileGrid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of
  data due to a missing capability check on the 'edit_group' handler in versions up to, and
  including, 5.5.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with group ownership,
  to update group options, including the 'associate_role' parameter, which defines the member's
  role. This issue was partially patched in version 5.5.2 preventing privilege escalation, however,
  it was fully patched in 5.5.3.
