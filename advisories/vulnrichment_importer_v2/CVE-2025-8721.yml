aliases: []
summary: The Workable Api plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the plugin's workable_jobs shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.4 due to
  insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject
  arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
