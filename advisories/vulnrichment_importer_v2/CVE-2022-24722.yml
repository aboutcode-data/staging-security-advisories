aliases: []
summary: VIewComponent is a framework for building view components in Ruby on Rails. Versions
  prior to 2.31.2 and 2.49.1 contain a cross-site scripting vulnerability that has the potential
  to impact anyone using translations with the view_component gem. Data received via user input
  and passed as an interpolation argument to the `translate` method is not properly sanitized
  before display. Versions 2.31.2 and 2.49.1 have been released and fully mitigate the vulnerability.
  As a workaround, avoid passing user input to the `translate` function, or sanitize the inputs
  before passing them.
