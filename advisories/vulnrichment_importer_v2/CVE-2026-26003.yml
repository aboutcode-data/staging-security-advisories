aliases: []
summary: FastGPT is an AI Agent building platform. From 4.14.0 to 4.14.5, attackers can directly
  access the plugin system through FastGPT/api/plugin/xxx without authentication, thereby threatening
  the plugin system. This may cause the plugin system to crash and the loss of plugin installation
  status, but it will not result in key leakage. For older versions, as there are only operation
  interfaces for obtaining information, the impact is almost negligible. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 4.14.5-fix.
