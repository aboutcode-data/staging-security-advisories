  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  comedi: vmk80xx: fix transfer-buffer overflows

  The driver uses endpoint-sized USB transfer buffers but up until
  recently had no sanity checks on the sizes.

  Commit e1f13c879a7c ("staging: comedi: check validity of wMaxPacketSize
  of usb endpoints found") inadvertently fixed NULL-pointer dereferences
  when accessing the transfer buffers in case a malicious device has a
  zero wMaxPacketSize.

  Make sure to allocate buffers large enough to handle also the other
  accesses that are done without a size check (e.g. byte 18 in
  vmk80xx_cnt_insn_read() for the VMK8061_MODEL) to avoid writing beyond
  the buffers, for example, when doing descriptor fuzzing.

  The original driver was for a low-speed device with 8-byte buffers.
  Support was later added for a device that uses bulk transfers and is
  presumably a full-speed device with a maximum 64-byte wMaxPacketSize.
