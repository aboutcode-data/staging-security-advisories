  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/mediatek: Clean dangling pointer on bind error path

  mtk_drm_bind() can fail, in which case drm_dev_put() is called,
  destroying the drm_device object. However a pointer to it was still
  being held in the private object, and that pointer would be passed along
  to DRM in mtk_drm_sys_prepare() if a suspend were triggered at that
  point, resulting in a panic. Clean the pointer when destroying the
  object in the error path to prevent this from happening.
