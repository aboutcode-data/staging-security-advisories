summary: The Set Bulk Post Categories plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1. This is due to missing nonce validation

  to modify post categories in bulk via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
