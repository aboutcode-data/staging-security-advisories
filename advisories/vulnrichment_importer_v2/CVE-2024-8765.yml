aliases: []
summary: In lunary-ai/lunary, the privilege check mechanism is flawed in version git afc5df4.
  The system incorrectly identifies certain endpoints as public if the path contains '/auth/'
  anywhere within it. This allows unauthenticated attackers to access sensitive endpoints by
  including '/auth/' in the path. As a result, attackers can obtain and modify sensitive data
  and utilize other organizations' resources without proper authentication.
