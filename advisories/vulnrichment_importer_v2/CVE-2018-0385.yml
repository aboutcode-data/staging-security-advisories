summary: 'A vulnerability in the detection engine parsing of Security Socket Layer (SSL) protocol
  packets for Cisco Firepower System Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition due to the Snort process unexpectedly restarting.
  The vulnerability is due to improper input handling of the SSL traffic. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SSL traffic to the detection engine on the
  targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition if the Snort
  process restarts and traffic inspection is bypassed or traffic is dropped. Cisco Bug IDs:
