summary: The All in One SEO – Best WordPress SEO Plugin – Easily Improve SEO Rankings & Increase
  Traffic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's
  shortcode(s) in all versions up to, and including, 4.6.0 due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
  that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
