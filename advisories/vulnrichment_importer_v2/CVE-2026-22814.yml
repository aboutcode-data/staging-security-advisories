summary: '@adonisjs/lucid is an SQL ORM for AdonisJS built on top of Knex. Prior to 21.8.2 and
  22.0.0-next.6, there is a Mass Assignment vulnerability in AdonisJS Lucid which may allow
  a remote attacker who can influence data that is passed into Lucid model assignments to overwrite
  the internal ORM state. This may lead to logic bypasses and unauthorized record modification
  within a table or model. This affects @adonisjs/lucid through version 21.8.1 and 22.x pre-release
  versions prior to 22.0.0-next.6. This has been patched in @adonisjs/lucid versions 21.8.2
  and 22.0.0-next.6.'
