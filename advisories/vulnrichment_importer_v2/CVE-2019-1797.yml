aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller
  (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request
  forgery (CSRF) attack and perform arbitrary actions on the device with the privileges of the
  user, including modifying the device configuration. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an interface user to follow a crafted link.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on the device with
  the privileges of the user. Software versions prior to 8.3.150.0, 8.5.135.0, and 8.8.100.0
  are affected.
