summary: A vulnerability in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) VPN feature for Cisco Small Business
  RV VPN Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to unexpectedly
  restart, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a lack of

  sending a crafted HTTP request over an SSL connection to the targeted device. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload, resulting in a DoS condition.
