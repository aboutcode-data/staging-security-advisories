aliases: []
summary: Beego is an open-source web framework for the Go programming language. Prior to 2.3.6,
  a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Beego's RenderForm() function due to
  improper HTML escaping of user-controlled data. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject
  malicious JavaScript code that executes in victims' browsers, potentially leading to session
  hijacking, credential theft, or account takeover. The vulnerability affects any application
  using Beego's RenderForm() function with user-provided data. Since it is a high-level function
  generating an entire form markup, many developers would assume it automatically escapes attributes
  (the way most frameworks do). This vulnerability is fixed in 2.3.6.
