aliases: []
summary: Softing Secure Integration Server, edgeConnector, and edgeAggregator software ships
  with the default administrator credentials as `admin` and password as `admin`. This allows
  Softing to log in to the server directly to perform administrative functions. Upon installation
  or upon first login, the application does not ask the user to change the `admin` password.
  There is no warning or prompt to ask the user to change the default password, and to change
  the password, many steps are required.
