aliases: []
summary: OpenCTI is an open cyber threat intelligence (CTI) platform. Prior to version 6.4.11
  any user with the capability `manage customizations` can execute commands on the underlying
  infrastructure where OpenCTI is hosted and can access internal server side secrets by misusing
  the web-hooks. Since the malicious user gets a root shell inside a container this opens up
  the the infrastructure environment for further attacks and exposures. Version 6.4.11 fixes
  the issue.
