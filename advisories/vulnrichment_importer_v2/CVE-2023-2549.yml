aliases: []
summary: The Feather Login Page plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in versions starting from 1.0.7 up to, and including, 1.1.1. This is due to missing nonce
  validation in the 'createTempAccountLink' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to create a new user with administrator role via a forged request granted they can
  trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. An attacker
  can leverage CVE-2023-2545 to get the login link or request a password reset to the new user's
  email address.
