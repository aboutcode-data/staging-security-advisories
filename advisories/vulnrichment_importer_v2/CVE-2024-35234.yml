summary: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.2.3 on the `stable`
  branch and version 3.3.0.beta3 on the `tests-passed` branch, an attacker can execute arbitrary
  JavaScript on users’ browsers by posting a specific URL containing maliciously crafted meta
  tags. This issue only affects sites with Content Security Polic (CSP) disabled. The problem
  has been patched in version 3.2.3 on the `stable` branch and version 3.3.0.beta3 on the `tests-passed`
  branch. As a workaround, ensure CSP is enabled on the forum.
