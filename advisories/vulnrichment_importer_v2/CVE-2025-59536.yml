aliases: []
summary: Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. Versions before 1.0.111 were vulnerable to Code
  Injection due to a bug in the startup trust dialog implementation. Claude Code could be tricked
  to execute code contained in a project before the user accepted the startup trust dialog.
  Exploiting this requires a user to start Claude Code in an untrusted directory. Users on standard
  Claude Code auto-update will have received this fix automatically. Users performing manual
  updates are advised to update to the latest version. This issue is fixed in version 1.0.111.
