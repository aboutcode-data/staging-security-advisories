aliases: []
summary: Fleet is open source device management software. In versions prior to 4.80.1, a vulnerability
  in Fleet’s Android MDM Pub/Sub handling could allow unauthenticated requests to trigger device
  unenrollment events. This may result in unauthorized removal of individual Android devices
  from Fleet management. If Android MDM is enabled, an attacker could send a crafted request
  to the Android Pub/Sub endpoint to unenroll a targeted Android device from Fleet without authentication.
  This issue does not grant access to Fleet, allow execution of commands, or provide visibility
  into device data. Impact is limited to disruption of Android device management for the affected
  device. Version 4.80.1 fixes the issue. If an immediate upgrade is not possible, affected
  Fleet users should temporarily disable Android MDM.
