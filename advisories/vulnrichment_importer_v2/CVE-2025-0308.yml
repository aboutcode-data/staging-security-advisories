aliases: []
summary: The Ultimate Member – User Profile, Registration, Login, Member Directory, Content
  Restriction & Membership Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection
  via the search parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.1 due to insufficient escaping
  on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This
  makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already
  existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
