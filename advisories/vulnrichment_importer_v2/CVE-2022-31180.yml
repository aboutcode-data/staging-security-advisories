aliases: []
summary: 'Shescape is a simple shell escape package for JavaScript. Affected versions were found
  to have insufficient escaping of white space when interpolating output. This issue only impacts
  users that use the `escape` or `escapeAll` functions with the `interpolation` option set to
  `true`. The result is that if an attacker is able to include whitespace in their input they
  can: 1. Invoke shell-specific behaviour through shell-specific special characters inserted
  directly after whitespace. 2. Invoke shell-specific behaviour through shell-specific special
  characters inserted or appearing after line terminating characters. 3. Invoke arbitrary commands
  by inserting a line feed character. 4. Invoke arbitrary commands by inserting a carriage return
  character. Behaviour number 1 has been patched in [v1.5.7] which you can upgrade to now. No
  further changes are required. Behaviour number 2, 3, and 4 have been patched in [v1.5.8] which
  you can upgrade to now. No further changes are required. The best workaround is to avoid having
  to use the `interpolation: true` option - in most cases using an alternative is possible,
  see [the recipes](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape#recipes) for recommendations.
  Alternatively, users may strip all whitespace from user input. Note that this is error prone,
  for example: for PowerShell this requires stripping `''\u0085''` which is not included in
  JavaScript''s definition of `\s` for Regular Expressions.'
