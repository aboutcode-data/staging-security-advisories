aliases: []
summary: The Indeed Ultimate Learning Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL
  Injection via the ‘post_id’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.9 due to insufficient
  escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing
  SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access
  and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used
  to extract sensitive information from the database.
