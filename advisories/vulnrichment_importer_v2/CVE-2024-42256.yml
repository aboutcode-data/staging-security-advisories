  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  cifs: Fix server re-repick on subrequest retry

  When a subrequest is marked for needing retry, netfs will call
  cifs_prepare_write() which will make cifs repick the server for the op
  before renegotiating credits; it then calls cifs_issue_write() which
  invokes smb2_async_writev() - which re-repicks the server.

  If a different server is then selected, this causes the increment of
  server->in_flight to happen against one record and the decrement to happen
  against another, leading to misaccounting.

  Fix this by just removing the repick code in smb2_async_writev().  As this
  is only called from netfslib-driven code, cifs_prepare_write() should
  always have been called first, and so server should never be NULL and the
  preparatory step is repeated in the event that we do a retry.

  The problem manifests as a warning looking something like:

   WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 72896 at fs/smb/client/smb2ops.c:97 smb2_add_credits+0x3f0/0x9e0 [cifs]
   ...
   RIP: 0010:smb2_add_credits+0x3f0/0x9e0 [cifs]
   ...

    kthread+0x187/0x1d0
    ret_from_fork+0x34/0x60
    ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30

  Which may be triggered by a number of different xfstests running against an
  Azure server in multichannel mode.  generic/249 seems the most repeatable,
  but generic/215, generic/249 and generic/308 may also show it.
