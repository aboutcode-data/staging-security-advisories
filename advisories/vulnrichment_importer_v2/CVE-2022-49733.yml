  ALSA: pcm: oss: Fix race at SNDCTL_DSP_SYNC

  There is a small race window at snd_pcm_oss_sync() that is called from
  OSS PCM SNDCTL_DSP_SYNC ioctl; namely the function calls
  snd_pcm_oss_make_ready() at first, then takes the params_lock mutex
  for the rest.  When the stream is set up again by another thread
  between them, it leads to inconsistency, and may result in unexpected
  results such as NULL dereference of OSS buffer as a fuzzer spotted
  recently.

  The fix is simply to cover snd_pcm_oss_make_ready() call into the same
  params_lock mutex with snd_pcm_oss_make_ready_locked() variant.
