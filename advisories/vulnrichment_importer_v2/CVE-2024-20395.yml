aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the media retrieval functionality of Cisco Webex App could allow\
  \ an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to gain access to sensitive session information.\r\
  \n\r This vulnerability is due to insecure transmission of requests to backend services when\
  \ the app accesses embedded media, such as images. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by sending a message with embedded media that is stored on a messaging server to a targeted\
  \ user. If the attacker can observe transmitted traffic in a privileged network position,\
  \ a successful exploit could allow the attacker to capture session token information from\
  \ insecurely transmitted requests and possibly reuse the captured session information to take\
  \ further actions as the targeted user."
