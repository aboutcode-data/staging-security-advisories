aliases: []
summary: GN4 Publishing System versions prior to 2.6 contain an insecure direct object reference
  (IDOR) vulnerability via the API. Authenticated requests to the API's object endpoints allow
  an authenticated user to request arbitrary user IDs and receive sensitive account data for
  those users, including the stored password and the account's security question and answer.
  The exposed recovery data and encrypted password may be used to reset or take over the target
  account.
