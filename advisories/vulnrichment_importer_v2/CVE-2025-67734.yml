summary: Frappe Learning Management System (LMS) is a learning system that helps users structure
  their content. Versions prior to 2.42.0 allowed authenticated attackers to enter JavaScript

  could then be executed in the browsers of users who opened the malicious job posting. This
  issue is fixed in version 2.42.0.
