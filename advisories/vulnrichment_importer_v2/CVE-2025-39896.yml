  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  accel/ivpu: Prevent recovery work from being queued during device removal

  Use disable_work_sync() instead of cancel_work_sync() in ivpu_dev_fini()
  to ensure that no new recovery work items can be queued after device
  removal has started. Previously, recovery work could be scheduled even
  after canceling existing work, potentially leading to use-after-free
  bugs if recovery accessed freed resources.

  Rename ivpu_pm_cancel_recovery() to ivpu_pm_disable_recovery() to better
  reflect its new behavior.
