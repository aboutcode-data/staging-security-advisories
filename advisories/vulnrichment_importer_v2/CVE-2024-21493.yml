aliases: []
summary: All versions of the package github.com/greenpau/caddy-security are vulnerable to Improper
  Validation of Array Index when parsing a Caddyfile. Multiple parsing functions in the affected
  library do not validate whether their input values are nil before attempting to access elements,
  which can lead to a panic (index out of range). Panics during the parsing of a configuration
  file may introduce ambiguity and vulnerabilities, hindering the correct interpretation and
  configuration of the web server.
