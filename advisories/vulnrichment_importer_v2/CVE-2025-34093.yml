datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2025-34093
datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2025/34xxx/CVE-2025-34093.json
aliases: []
summary: An authenticated command injection vulnerability exists in the Polycom HDX Series command
  shell interface accessible over Telnet. The lan traceroute command in the devcmds console
  accepts unsanitized input, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary system commands. By injecting
  shell metacharacters through the traceroute interface, an attacker can achieve remote code
  execution under the context of the root user. This flaw affects systems where Telnet access
  is enabled and either unauthenticated access is allowed or credentials are known.
