aliases: []
summary: 'Reolink desktop application 8.18.12 contains a vulnerability in its local authentication
  mechanism. The application implements lock screen password logic entirely on the client side
  using JavaScript within an Electron resource file. Because the password is stored and returned
  via a modifiable JavaScript property(a.settingsManager.lockScreenPassword), an attacker can
  patch the return value to bypass authentication. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because
  the lock-screen bypass would only occur if the local user modified his own instance of the
  application.'
