aliases: []
summary: RIOT OS versions up to and including 2026.01-devel-317 contain a stack-based buffer
  overflow vulnerability in the tapslip6 utility. The vulnerability is caused by unsafe string
  concatenation in the devopen() function, which constructs a device path using unbounded user-controlled
  input. The utility uses strcpy() and strcat() to concatenate the fixed prefix '/dev/' with
  a user-supplied device name provided via the -s command-line option without bounds checking.
  This allows an attacker to supply an excessively long device name and overflow a fixed-size
  stack buffer, leading to process crashes and memory corruption.
