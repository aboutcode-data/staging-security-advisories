  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net/tcp_ao: Don't leak ao_info on error-path

  It seems I introduced it together with TCP_AO_CMDF_AO_REQUIRED, on
  version 5 [1] of TCP-AO patches. Quite frustrative that having all these
  selftests that I've written, running kmemtest & kcov was always in todo.
