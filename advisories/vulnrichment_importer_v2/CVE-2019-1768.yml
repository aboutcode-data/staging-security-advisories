aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the implementation of a specific CLI command for Cisco NX-OS Software
  could allow an authenticated, local attacker with administrator credentials to cause a buffer
  overflow condition or perform command injection. This could allow the attacker to execute
  arbitrary commands with elevated privileges on the underlying operating system of an affected
  device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of arguments passed to a certain
  CLI command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including malicious input as
  the argument of the affected CLI command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
  execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with root privileges. An attacker
  would need valid administrator credentials to exploit these vulnerabilities.
