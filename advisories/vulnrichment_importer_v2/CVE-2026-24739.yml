aliases: []
summary: Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP
  components. Prior to versions 5.4.51, 6.4.33, 7.3.11, 7.4.5, and 8.0.5, the Symfony Process
  component did not correctly treat some characters (notably `=`) as “special” when escaping
  arguments on Windows. When PHP is executed from an MSYS2-based environment (e.g. Git Bash)
  and Symfony Process spawns native Windows executables, MSYS2’s argument/path conversion can
  mis-handle unquoted arguments containing these characters. This can cause the spawned process
  to receive corrupted/truncated arguments compared to what Symfony intended. If an application
  (or tooling such as Composer scripts) uses Symfony Process to invoke file-management commands
  (e.g. `rmdir`, `del`, etc.) with a path argument containing `=`, the MSYS2 conversion layer
  may alter the argument at runtime. In affected setups this can result in operations being
  performed on an unintended path, up to and including deletion of the contents of a broader
  directory or drive. The issue is particularly relevant when untrusted input can influence
  process arguments (directly or indirectly, e.g. via repository paths, extracted archive paths,
  temporary directories, or user-controlled configuration). Versions 5.4.51, 6.4.33, 7.3.11,
  7.4.5, and 8.0.5 contains a patch for the issue. Some workarounds are available. Avoid running
  PHP/one's own tooling from MSYS2-based shells on Windows; prefer cmd.exe or PowerShell for
  workflows that spawn native executables. Avoid passing paths containing `=` (and similar MSYS2-sensitive
  characters) to Symfony Process when operating under Git Bash/MSYS2. Where applicable, configure
  MSYS2 to disable or restrict argument conversion (e.g. via `MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL`), understanding
  this may affect other tooling behavior.
