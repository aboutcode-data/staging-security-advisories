aliases: []
summary: The vulnerability is an intent redirection in LG ThinQ Service ("com.lge.lms2") in
  the "com/lge/lms/things/ui/notification/NotificationManager.java" file. This vulnerability
  could be exploited by a third-party app installed on an LG device by sending a broadcast with
  the action "com.lge.lms.things.notification.ACTION". Additionally, this vulnerability is very
  dangerous because LG ThinQ Service is a system app (having android:sharedUserId="android.uid.system"
  setting). Intent redirection in this app leads to accessing arbitrary not exported activities
  of absolutely all apps.
