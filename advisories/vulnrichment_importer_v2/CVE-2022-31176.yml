aliases: []
summary: Grafana Image Renderer is a Grafana backend plugin that handles rendering of panels
  & dashboards to PNGs using a headless browser (Chromium/Chrome). An internal security review
  identified an unauthorized file disclosure vulnerability. It is possible for a malicious user
  to retrieve unauthorized files under some network conditions or via a fake datasource (if
  user has admin permissions in Grafana). All Grafana installations should be upgraded to version
  3.6.1 as soon as possible. As a workaround it is possible to [disable HTTP remote rendering](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-grafana/#plugingrafana-image-renderer).
