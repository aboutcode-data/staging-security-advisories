aliases: []
summary: opentelemetry-go-contrib is a collection of extensions for OpenTelemetry-Go. The v0.38.0
  release of `go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/net/http/otelhttp` uses the `httpconv.ServerRequest`
  function to annotate metric measurements for the `http.server.request_content_length`, `http.server.response_content_length`,
  and `http.server.duration` instruments. The `ServerRequest` function sets the `http.target`
  attribute value to be the whole request URI (including the query string)[^1]. The metric instruments
  do not "forget" previous measurement attributes when `cumulative` temporality is used, this
  means the cardinality of the measurements allocated is directly correlated with the unique
  URIs handled. If the query string is constantly random, this will result in a constant increase
  in memory allocation that can be used in a denial-of-service attack. This issue has been addressed
  in version 0.39.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
