aliases: []
summary: Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. All unpatched
  versions of Argo CD starting with 1.0.0 are vulnerable to an improper access control bug,
  allowing a malicious user to potentially escalate their privileges to admin-level. Versions
  starting with 0.8.0 and 0.5.0 contain limited versions of this issue. To perform exploits,
  an authorized Argo CD user must have push access to an Application's source git or Helm repository
  or `sync` and `override` access to an Application. Once a user has that access, different
  exploitation levels are possible depending on their other RBAC privileges. A patch for this
  vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.2, 2.2.8, and 2.1.14. Some mitigation
  measures are available but do not serve as a substitute for upgrading. To avoid privilege
  escalation, limit who has push access to Application source repositories or `sync` + `override`
  access to Applications; and limit which repositories are available in projects where users
  have `update` access to Applications. To avoid unauthorized resource inspection/tampering,
  limit who has `delete`, `get`, or `action` access to Applications.
