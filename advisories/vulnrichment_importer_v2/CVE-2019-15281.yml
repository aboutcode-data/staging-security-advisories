  (ISE) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected
  device. The attacker must have valid administrator credentials. The vulnerability is due to
  insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the

  into a troubleshooting file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
  script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
