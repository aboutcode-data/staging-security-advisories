aliases: []
summary: 'OpenEMR is a free and open source electronic health records and medical practice management
  application. Prior to version 8.0.0, in `portal/portal_payment.php`, the patient id used for
  the page is taken from the request (`$pid = $_REQUEST[''pid''] ?? $pid` and `$pid = ($_REQUEST[''hidden_patient_code'']
  ?? null) > 0 ? $_REQUEST[''hidden_patient_code''] : $pid`) instead of being fixed to the authenticated
  portal user. The portal session already has a valid `$pid` for the logged-in patient. Overwriting
  it with user-supplied values and using it without authorization allows a portal user to view
  and interact with another patient''s demographics, invoices, and payment history—horizontal
  privilege escalation and IDOR. Version 8.0.0 contains a fix for the issue.'
