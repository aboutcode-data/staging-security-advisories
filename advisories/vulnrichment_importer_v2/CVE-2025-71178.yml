aliases: []
summary: Crucial Storage Executive installer versions prior to 11.08.082025.00 contain a DLL
  preloading vulnerability. During installation, the installer runs with elevated privileges
  and loads Windows DLLs using an uncontrolled search path, which can cause a malicious DLL
  placed alongside the installer to be loaded instead of the intended system library. A local
  attacker who can convince a victim to run the installer from a directory containing the attacker-supplied
  DLL can achieve arbitrary code execution with administrator privileges.
