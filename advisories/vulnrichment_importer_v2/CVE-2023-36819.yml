aliases: []
summary: Knowage is the professional open source suite for modern business analytics over traditional
  sources and big data systems. The endpoint `_/knowage/restful-services/dossier/importTemplateFile_`
  allows authenticated users to download template hosted on the server. However, starting in
  the 6.x.x branch and prior to version 8.1.8, the application does not sanitize the `_templateName_
  `parameter allowing an attacker to use `*../*` in it, and escaping the directory the template
  are normally placed and download any file from the system. This vulnerability allows a low
  privileged attacker to exfiltrate sensitive configuration file. This issue has been patched
  in Knowage version 8.1.8.
