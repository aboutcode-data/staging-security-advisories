aliases: []
summary: 'Kimi Agent SDK is a set of libraries that expose the Kimi Code (Kimi CLI) agent runtime
  in applications. The vsix-publish.js and ovsx-publish.js scripts pass filenames to execSync()
  as shell command strings. Prior to version 0.1.6, filenames containing shell metacharacters
  like $(cmd) could execute arbitrary commands. Note: This vulnerability exists only in the
  repository''s development scripts. The published VSCode extension does not include these files
  and end users are not affected. This is fixed in version 0.1.6 by replacing execSync with
  execFileSync using array arguments. As a workaround, ensure .vsix files in the project directory
  have safe filenames before running publish scripts.'
