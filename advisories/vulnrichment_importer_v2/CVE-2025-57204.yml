aliases: []
summary: Stocky POS with Inventory Management & HRM (ui-lib) version 5.0 is affected by a Stored
  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the Products module available to authenticated
  users. The vulnerability resides in the product name parameter submitted to the product-creation
  endpoint via a standard POST form. Due to insufficient input sanitization and output encoding,
  attackers can inject HTML/JS payloads. The payload is stored and subsequently rendered unsanitized
  in downstream views, leading to JavaScript execution in other users' browsers when they access
  the affected product pages. This issue allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary
  JavaScript in the context of another user, potentially enabling session hijacking, privilege
  escalation within the application, data exfiltration, or administrative account takeover.
  The application also lacks a restrictive Content Security Policy (CSP), increasing exploitability.
