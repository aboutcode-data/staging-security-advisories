aliases: []
summary: 'Easy!Appointments is a self hosted appointment scheduler. In 1.5.2 and earlier, application/core/EA_Security.php::csrf_verify()
  only enforces CSRF for POST requests and returns early for non-POST methods. Several application
  endpoints perform state-changing operations while accepting parameters from GET (or $_REQUEST),
  so an attacker can perform CSRF by forcing a victim''s browser to issue a crafted GET request.
  Impact: creation of admin accounts, modification of admin email/password, and full admin account
  takeover.'
