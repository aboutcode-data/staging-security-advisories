aliases: []
summary: 'The Electron framework enables writing cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript,
  HTML and CSS. In versions prior to 21.0.0-beta.1, 20.0.1, 19.0.11, and 18.3.7, Electron is
  vulnerable to Exposure of Sensitive Information. When following a redirect, Electron delays
  a check for redirecting to file:// URLs from other schemes. The contents of the file is not
  available to the renderer following the redirect, but if the redirect target is a SMB URL
  such as `file://some.website.com/`, then in some cases, Windows will connect to that server
  and attempt NTLM authentication, which can include sending hashed credentials.This issue has
  been patched in versions: 21.0.0-beta.1, 20.0.1, 19.0.11, and 18.3.7. Users are recommended
  to upgrade to the latest stable version of Electron. If upgrading isn''t possible, this issue
  can be addressed without upgrading by preventing redirects to file:// URLs in the `WebContents.on(''will-redirect'')`
  event, for all WebContents as a workaround.'
