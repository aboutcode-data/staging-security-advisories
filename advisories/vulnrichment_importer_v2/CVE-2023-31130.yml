aliases: []
summary: c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. ares_inet_net_pton() is vulnerable to a
  buffer underflow for certain ipv6 addresses, in particular "0::00:00:00/2" was found to cause
  an issue.  C-ares only uses this function internally for configuration purposes which would
  require an administrator to configure such an address via ares_set_sortlist(). However, users
  may externally use ares_inet_net_pton() for other purposes and thus be vulnerable to more
  severe issues. This issue has been fixed in 1.19.1.
