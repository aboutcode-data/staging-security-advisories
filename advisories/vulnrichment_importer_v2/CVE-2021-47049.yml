summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  Drivers: hv: vmbus: Use after free in __vmbus_open()

  The "open_info" variable is added to the &vmbus_connection.chn_msg_list,
  but the error handling frees "open_info" without removing it from the
  list.  This will result in a use after free.  First remove it from the
  list, and then free it.
