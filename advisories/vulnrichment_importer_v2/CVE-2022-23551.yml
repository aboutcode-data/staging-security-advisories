aliases: []
summary: 'aad-pod-identity assigns Azure Active Directory identities to Kubernetes applications
  and has now been deprecated as of 24 October 2022. The NMI component in AAD Pod Identity intercepts
  and validates token requests based on regex. In this case, a token request made with backslash
  in the request (example: `/metadata/identity\oauth2\token/`) would bypass the NMI validation
  and be sent to IMDS allowing a pod in the cluster to access identities that it shouldn''t
  have access to. This issue has been fixed and has been included in AAD Pod Identity release
  version 1.8.13. If using the AKS pod-managed identities add-on, no action is required. The
  clusters should now be running the version 1.8.13 release.'
