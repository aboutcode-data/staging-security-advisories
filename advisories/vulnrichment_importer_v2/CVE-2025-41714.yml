aliases: []
summary: The upload endpoint insufficiently validates the 'Upload-Key' request header. By supplying
  path traversal sequences, an authenticated attacker can cause the server to create upload-related
  artifacts outside the intended storage location. In certain configurations this enables arbitrary
  file write and may be leveraged to achieve remote code execution.
