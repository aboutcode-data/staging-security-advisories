aliases: []
summary: ssoready is a single sign on provider implemented via docker. Affected versions are
  vulnerable to XML signature bypass attacks. An attacker can carry out signature bypass if
  you have access to certain IDP-signed messages. The underlying mechanism exploits differential
  behavior between XML parsers. Users of https://ssoready.com, the public hosted instance of
  SSOReady, are unaffected. We advise folks who self-host SSOReady to upgrade to 7f92a06 or
  later. Do so by updating your SSOReady Docker images from sha-... to sha-7f92a06. There are
  no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
