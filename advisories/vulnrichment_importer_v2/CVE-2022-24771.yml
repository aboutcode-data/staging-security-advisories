aliases: []
summary: Forge (also called `node-forge`) is a native implementation of Transport Layer Security
  in JavaScript. Prior to version 1.3.0, RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification code is lenient
  in checking the digest algorithm structure. This can allow a crafted structure that steals
  padding bytes and uses unchecked portion of the PKCS#1 encoded message to forge a signature
  when a low public exponent is being used. The issue has been addressed in `node-forge` version
  1.3.0. There are currently no known workarounds.
