aliases: []
summary: An XSS issue was discovered in Backdrop CMS 1.28.x before 1.28.5 and 1.29.x before
  1.29.3. It doesn't sufficiently isolate long text content when the CKEditor 5 rich text editor
  is used. This allows a potential attacker to craft specialized HTML and JavaScript that may
  be executed when an administrator attempts to edit a piece of content. This vulnerability
  is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have the ability to create long text content
  (such as through the node or comment forms) and an administrator must edit (not view) the
  content that contains the malicious content. This problem only exists when using the CKEditor
  5 module.
