aliases: []
summary: 'DHIS 2 is an open source information system for data capture, management, validation,
  analytics and visualization. In affected versions an authenticated DHIS2 user can craft a
  request to DHIS2 to instruct the server to make requests to external resources (like third
  party servers). This could allow an attacker, for example, to identify vulnerable services
  which might not be otherwise exposed to the public internet or to determine whether a specific
  file is present on the DHIS2 server. DHIS2 administrators should upgrade to the following
  hotfix releases: 2.36.12.1, 2.37.8.1, 2.38.2.1, 2.39.0.1. At this time, there is no known
  workaround or mitigation for this vulnerability.'
