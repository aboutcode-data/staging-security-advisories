aliases: []
summary: A remote code execution vulnerability exists in mintplex-labs/anything-llm due to improper
  handling of environment variables. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary
  environment variables via the `POST /api/system/update-env` endpoint, which allows for the
  execution of arbitrary code on the host running anything-llm. The vulnerability is present
  in the latest version of anything-llm, with the latest commit identified as fde905aac1812b84066ff72e5f2f90b56d4c3a59.
  This issue has been fixed in version 1.0.0. Successful exploitation could lead to code execution
  on the host, enabling attackers to read and modify data accessible to the user running the
  service, potentially leading to a denial of service.
