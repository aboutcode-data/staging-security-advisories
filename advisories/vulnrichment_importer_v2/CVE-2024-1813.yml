aliases: []
summary: The Simple Job Board plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in
  all versions up to, and including, 2.11.0 via deserialization of untrusted input in the job_board_applicant_list_columns_value
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. If
  a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it
  could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code
  when a submitted job application is viewed.
