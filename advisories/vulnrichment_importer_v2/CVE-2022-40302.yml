aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in bgpd in FRRouting (FRR) through 8.4. By crafting a BGP OPEN
  message with an option of type 0xff (Extended Length from RFC 9072), attackers may cause a
  denial of service (assertion failure and daemon restart, or out-of-bounds read). This is possible
  because of inconsistent boundary checks that do not account for reading 3 bytes (instead of
  2) in this 0xff case.
