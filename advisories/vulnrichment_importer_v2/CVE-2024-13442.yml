aliases: []
summary: The Service Finder Bookings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
  via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 5.0. This is due to the plugin
  not properly validating a user's identity prior to (1) performing a post-booking auto-login
  or (2) updating their profile details (e.g. password). This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to (1) login as an arbitrary user if their email address is known or (2) change
  an arbitrary user's password, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to
  their account.
