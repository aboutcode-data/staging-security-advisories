summary: The Jobify - Job Board WordPress Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
  access and modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'download_image_via_ai'
  and 'generate_image_via_ai' functions in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.7. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating
  from the web application to upload files in an image format, and to generate AI images using
  the site's OpenAI key.
