aliases: []
summary: The Web Stories for WordPress plugin supports the WordPress built-in functionality
  of protecting content with a password. The content is then only accessible to website visitors
  after entering the password. In WordPress, users with the "Author" role can create stories,
  but don't have the ability to edit password protected stories. The vulnerability allowed users
  with said role to bypass this permission check when trying to duplicate the protected story
  in the plugin's own dashboard, giving them access to the seemingly protected content. We recommend
  upgrading to version 1.32 or beyond commit  ad49781c2a35c5c92ef704d4b621ab4e5cb77d68 https://github.com/GoogleForCreators/web-stories-wp/commit/ad49781c2a35c5c92ef704d4b621ab4e5cb77d68
