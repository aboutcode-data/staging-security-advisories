aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the vDaemon process in Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a buffer overflow on an affected device. This
  vulnerability is due to insufficient bounds checking when an affected device processes traffic.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic to the device. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow and possibly execute arbitrary
  commands with root-level privileges, or cause the device to reload, which could result in
  a denial of service condition.
