  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  Bluetooth: vhci: Prevent use-after-free by removing debugfs files early

  Move the creation of debugfs files into a dedicated function, and ensure
  they are explicitly removed during vhci_release(), before associated
  data structures are freed.

  Previously, debugfs files such as "force_suspend", "force_wakeup", and
  others were created under hdev->debugfs but not removed in
  vhci_release(). Since vhci_release() frees the backing vhci_data
  structure, any access to these files after release would result in
  use-after-free errors.

  Although hdev->debugfs is later freed in hci_release_dev(), user can
  access files after vhci_data is freed but before hdev->debugfs is
  released.
