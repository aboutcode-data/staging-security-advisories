aliases: []
summary: Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications,
  and databases. Prior to version 4.0.0-beta.361, the missing authorization allows any authenticated
  user to attach any existing private key on a coolify instance to his own server. If the server
  configuration of IP / domain, port (most likely 22) and user (root) matches with the victim's
  server configuration, then the attacker can use the `Terminal` feature and execute arbitrary
  commands on the victim's server. Version 4.0.0-beta.361 fixes the issue.
