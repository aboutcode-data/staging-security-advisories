  net: batman-adv: fix error handling

  Syzbot reported ODEBUG warning in batadv_nc_mesh_free(). The problem was
  in wrong error handling in batadv_mesh_init().

  Before this patch batadv_mesh_init() was calling batadv_mesh_free() in case
  of any batadv_*_init() calls failure. This approach may work well, when
  there is some kind of indicator, which can tell which parts of batadv are
  initialized; but there isn't any.

  All written above lead to cleaning up uninitialized fields. Even if we hide
  ODEBUG warning by initializing bat_priv->nc.work, syzbot was able to hit
  GPF in batadv_nc_purge_paths(), because hash pointer in still NULL. [1]

  To fix these bugs we can unwind batadv_*_init() calls one by one.
  It is good approach for 2 reasons: 1) It fixes bugs on error handling
  path 2) It improves the performance, since we won't call unneeded
  batadv_*_free() functions.

  So, this patch makes all batadv_*_init() clean up all allocated memory
  before returning with an error to no call correspoing batadv_*_free()
  and open-codes batadv_mesh_free() with proper order to avoid touching
  uninitialized fields.
