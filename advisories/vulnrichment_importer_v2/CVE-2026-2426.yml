aliases: []
summary: The WP-DownloadManager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Path Traversal in all
  versions up to, and including, 1.69 via the 'file' parameter in the file deletion functionality.
  This is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied file paths, allowing directory traversal
  sequences. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access
  and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can lead to remote code execution
  when critical files like wp-config.php are deleted.
