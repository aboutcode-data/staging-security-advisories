aliases: []
summary: n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. Prior to versions 2.10.1, 2.9.3,
  and 1.123.22, additional exploits in the expression evaluation of n8n have been identified
  and patched following CVE-2025-68613. An authenticated user with permission to create or modify
  workflows could abuse crafted expressions in workflow parameters to trigger unintended system
  command execution on the host running n8n. The issues have been fixed in n8n versions 2.10.1,
  2.9.3, and 1.123.22. Users should upgrade to one of these versions or later to remediate all
  known vulnerabilities. If upgrading is not immediately possible, administrators should consider
  the following temporary mitigations. Limit workflow creation and editing permissions to fully
  trusted users only, and/or deploy n8n in a hardened environment with restricted operating
  system privileges and network access to reduce the impact of potential exploitation. These
  workarounds do not fully remediate the risk and should only be used as short-term mitigation
  measures.
