aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in ICMP Version 6 (ICMPv6) processing in Cisco NX-OS Software could
  allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a slow system memory leak, which over time
  could lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to improper error
  handling when an IPv6-configured interface receives a specific type of ICMPv6 packet. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending a sustained rate of crafted ICMPv6 packets to
  a local IPv6 address on a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
  cause a system memory leak in the ICMPv6 process on the device. As a result, the ICMPv6 process
  could run out of system memory and stop processing traffic. The device could then drop all
  ICMPv6 packets, causing traffic instability on the device. Restoring device functionality
  would require a device reboot.
