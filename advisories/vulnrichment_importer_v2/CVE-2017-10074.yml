  Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code
  that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability
  does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code
  (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 8.3 (Confidentiality, Integrity
