aliases: []
summary: Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. Prior to version 1.0.111, Claude Code contained
  insufficient URL validation in its trusted domain verification mechanism for WebFetch requests.
  The application used a startsWith() function to validate trusted domains (e.g., docs.python.org,
  modelcontextprotocol.io), this could have enabled attackers to register domains like modelcontextprotocol.io.example.com
  that would pass validation. This could enable automatic requests to attacker-controlled domains
  without user consent, potentially leading to data exfiltration. This issue has been patched
  in version 1.0.111.
