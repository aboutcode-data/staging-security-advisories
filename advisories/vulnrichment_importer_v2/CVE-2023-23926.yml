aliases: []
summary: APOC (Awesome Procedures on Cypher) is an add-on library for Neo4j. An XML External
  Entity (XXE) vulnerability found in the apoc.import.graphml procedure of APOC core plugin
  prior to version 5.5.0 and 4.4.0.14 (4.4 branch) in Neo4j graph database. XML External Entity
  (XXE) injection occurs when the XML parser allows external entities to be resolved. The XML
  parser used by the apoc.import.graphml procedure was not configured in a secure way and therefore
  allowed this. External entities can be used to read local files, send HTTP requests, and perform
  denial-of-service attacks on the application. Abusing the XXE vulnerability enabled assessors
  to read local files remotely. Although with the level of privileges assessors had this was
  limited to one-line files. With the ability to write to the database, any file could have
  been read. Additionally, assessors noted, with local testing, the server could be crashed
  by passing in improperly formatted XML. The minimum version containing a patch for this vulnerability
  is 5.5.0. Those who cannot upgrade the library can control the allowlist of the procedures
  that can be used in your system.
