aliases: []
summary: hyper-bump-it is a command line tool for updating the version in project files.`hyper-bump-it`
  reads a file glob pattern from the configuration file. That is combined with the project root
  directory to construct a full glob pattern that is used to find files that should be edited.
  These matched files should be contained within the project root directory, but that is not
  checked. This could result in changes being written to files outside of the project. The default
  behaviour of `hyper-bump-it` is to display the planned changes and prompt the user for confirmation
  before editing any files. However, the configuration file provides a field that can be used
  cause files to be edited without displaying the prompt. This issue has been fixed in release
  version 0.5.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users that are unable to update from vulnerable
  versions, executing `hyper-bump-it` with the `--interactive` command line argument will ensure
  that all planned changes are displayed and prompt the user for confirmation before editing
  any files, even if the configuration file contains `show_confirm_prompt=true`.
