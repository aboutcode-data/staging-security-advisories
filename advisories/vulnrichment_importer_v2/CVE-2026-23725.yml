summary: WeGIA is a web manager for charitable institutions. Prior to 3.6.2, a Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the html/pet/adotantes/cadastro_adotante.php
  and html/pet/adotantes/informacao_adotantes.php endpoint of the WeGIA application. The application
  does not sanitize user-controlled input before rendering it inside the Adopters Information
