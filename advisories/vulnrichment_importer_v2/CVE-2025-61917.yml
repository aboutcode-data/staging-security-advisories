aliases: []
summary: n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. From version 1.65.0 to before 1.114.3,
  the use of Buffer.allocUnsafe() and Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow() in the task runner allowed untrusted
  code to allocate uninitialized memory. Such uninitialized buffers could contain residual data
  from within the same Node.js process (for example, data from prior requests, tasks, secrets,
  or tokens), resulting in potential information disclosure. This issue has been patched in
  version 1.114.3.
