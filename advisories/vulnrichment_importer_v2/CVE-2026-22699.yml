aliases: []
summary: 'RustCrypto: Elliptic Curves is general purpose Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) support,
  including types and traits for representing various elliptic curve forms, scalars, points,
  and public/secret keys composed thereof. In versions 0.14.0-pre.0 and 0.14.0-rc.0, a denial-of-service
  vulnerability exists in the SM2 PKE decryption path where an invalid elliptic-curve point
  (C1) is decoded and the resulting value is unwrapped without checking. Specifically, AffinePoint::from_encoded_point(&encoded_c1)
  may return a None/CtOption::None when the supplied coordinates are syntactically valid but
  do not lie on the SM2 curve. The calling code previously used .unwrap(), causing a panic when
  presented with such input. This issue has been patched via commit 085b7be.'
