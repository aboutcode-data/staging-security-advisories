aliases: []
summary: 'A deserialization vulnerability exists in the way parso through 0.4.0 handles grammar
  parsing from the cache. Cache loading relies on pickle and, provided that an evil pickle can
  be written to a cache grammar file and that its parsing can be triggered, this flaw leads
  to Arbitrary Code Execution. NOTE: This is disputed because "the cache directory is not under
  control of the attacker in any common configuration.'
