aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in binary-husky/gpt_academic, as of commit 310122f, allows for a Regular
  Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. The function '解析项目源码（手动指定和筛选源码文件类型）' permits
  the execution of user-provided regular expressions. Certain regular expressions can cause
  the Python RE engine to take exponential time to execute, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS)
  condition. An attacker who controls both the regular expression and the search string can
  exploit this vulnerability to hang the server for an arbitrary amount of time.
