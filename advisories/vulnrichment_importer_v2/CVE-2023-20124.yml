summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV016,
  RV042, RV042G, RV082, RV320, and RV325 Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker
  to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper
  validation of user input within incoming HTTP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to gain root-level privileges and access unauthorized data. To exploit
  this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have valid administrative credentials on the
  affected device. Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability.
