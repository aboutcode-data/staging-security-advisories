aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the filesystem management for the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Application
  Centric Infrastructure (ACI) Mode Switch Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker
  with administrator rights to gain elevated privileges as the root user on an affected device.
  The vulnerability is due to overly permissive file permissions of specific system files. An
  attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device, creating
  a crafted command string, and writing this crafted string to a specific file location. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands as root on
  an affected device. The attacker would need to have valid administrator credentials for the
  device.
