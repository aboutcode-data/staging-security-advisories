aliases: []
summary: Skyport Daemon (skyportd) is the daemon for the Skyport Panel. By making thousands
  of folders & files (easy due to skyport's lack of rate limiting on createFolder. createFile),
  skyportd in a lot of cases will cause 100% CPU usage and an OOM, probably crashing the system.
  This is fixed in 0.2.2.
