aliases: []
summary: Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When
  relying on SSO providers in combination with local authentication it can be possible to enumerate
  existing SSO users in the instance. This is possible because if an email address exists in
  Directus and belongs to a known SSO provider then it will throw a "helpful" error that the
  user belongs to another provider. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.13.0.
