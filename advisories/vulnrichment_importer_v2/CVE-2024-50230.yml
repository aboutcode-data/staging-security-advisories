  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  nilfs2: fix kernel bug due to missing clearing of checked flag

  Syzbot reported that in directory operations after nilfs2 detects
  filesystem corruption and degrades to read-only,
  __block_write_begin_int(), which is called to prepare block writes, may
  fail the BUG_ON check for accesses exceeding the folio/page size,
  triggering a kernel bug.

  This was found to be because the "checked" flag of a page/folio was not
  cleared when it was discarded by nilfs2's own routine, which causes the
  sanity check of directory entries to be skipped when the directory
  page/folio is reloaded.  So, fix that.

  This was necessary when the use of nilfs2's own page discard routine was
  applied to more than just metadata files.
