summary: A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) of Cisco IOS XE Wireless
  Controller Software for the Catalyst 9000 Family could allow an authenticated, remote attacker
  to access sensitive information. This vulnerability is due to insufficient restrictions that
  allow a sensitive configuration detail to be disclosed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability

  the attacker to view Service Set Identifier (SSID) preshared keys (PSKs) that are configured
  on the affected device.
