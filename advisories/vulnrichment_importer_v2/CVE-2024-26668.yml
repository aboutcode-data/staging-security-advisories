aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  netfilter: nft_limit: reject configurations that cause integer overflow

  Reject bogus configs where internal token counter wraps around.
  This only occurs with very very large requests, such as 17gbyte/s.

  Its better to reject this rather than having incorrect ratelimit.
