aliases: []
summary: Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. In versions 1.7.23 and below,
  a logic bug allows a malicious agent to read sensitive files that should be protected via
  cursorignore. An attacker who has already achieved prompt injection, or a malicious model,
  could create a new cursorignore file which can invalidate the configuration of pre-existing
  ones. This could allow a malicious agent to read protected files. This issue is fixed in version
  2.0.
