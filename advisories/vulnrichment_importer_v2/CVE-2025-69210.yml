aliases: []
summary: FacturaScripts is open-source enterprise resource planning and accounting software.
  Prior to version 2025.7, a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the product
  file upload functionality. Authenticated users can upload crafted XML files containing executable
  JavaScript. These files are later rendered by the application without sufficient sanitization
  or content-type enforcement, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution when the file is accessed.
  Because product files uploaded by regular users are visible to administrative users, this
  vulnerability can be leveraged to execute malicious JavaScript in an administrator’s browser
  session. Version 2025.7 fixes the issue.
