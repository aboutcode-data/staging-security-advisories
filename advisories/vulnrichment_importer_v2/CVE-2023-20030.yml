aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine
  (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information, conduct
  a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack through an affected device, or negatively impact
  the responsiveness of the web-based management interface itself. This vulnerability is due
  to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted XML file that contains
  references to external entities. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve
  files from the local system, resulting in the disclosure of confidential information. A successful
  exploit could also cause the web application to perform arbitrary HTTP requests on behalf
  of the attacker or consume memory resources to reduce the availability of the web-based management
  interface. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid Super
  Admin or Policy Admin credentials.
