aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability with the handling of MPLS traffic for Cisco NX-OS Software could allow\
  \ an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the netstack process to unexpectedly restart,\
  \ which could cause the device to stop processing network traffic or to reload. \r\n\r This\
  \ vulnerability is due to lack of proper error checking when processing an ingress MPLS frame.\
  \ An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv6 packet that is encapsulated\
  \ within an MPLS frame to an MPLS-enabled interface of the targeted device. A successful exploit\
  \ could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r Note: The IPv6\
  \ packet can be generated multiple hops away from the targeted device and then encapsulated\
  \ within MPLS. The DoS condition may occur when the NX-OS device processes the packet."
