aliases: []
summary: The Wilmer Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via
  shortcodes in versions up to, and including, 2.4.5 due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in
  pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
