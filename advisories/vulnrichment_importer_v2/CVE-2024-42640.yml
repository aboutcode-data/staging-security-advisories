summary: 'angular-base64-upload prior to v0.1.21 is vulnerable to unauthenticated remote code
  execution via demo/server.php. Exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to upload
  arbitrary content to the server, which can subsequently be accessed through demo/uploads.

  code execution on the server. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer
