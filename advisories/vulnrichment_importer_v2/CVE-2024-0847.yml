summary: The 5280 Bootstrap Modal Contact Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to missing or incorrect
  nonce validation in class-sbmm-list-table.php. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to bulk delete messages via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
