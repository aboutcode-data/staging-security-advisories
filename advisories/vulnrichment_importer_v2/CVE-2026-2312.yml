aliases: []
summary: The Media Library Folders plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object
  Reference in all versions up to, and including, 8.3.6 via the delete_maxgalleria_media() and
  maxgalleria_rename_image() functions due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This
  makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to delete
  or rename attachments owned by other users (including administrators). The rename flow also
  deletes all postmeta for the target attachment, causing data loss.
