aliases: []
summary: '@fastly/js-compute is a JavaScript SDK and runtime for building Fastly Compute applications.
  The implementation of several functions were determined to include a use-after-free bug. This
  bug could allow for unintended data loss if the result of the preceding functions were sent

  has been fixed in version 3.16.0 of the `@fastly/js-compute` package.'
