aliases: []
summary: In pig-mesh In Pig version 3.8.2 and below, within the Token Management function under
  the System Management module, the token query interface (/api/admin/sys-token/page) has an
  improper permission verification issue, which leads to information leakage. This interface
  can be called by any user who has completed login authentication, and it returns the plaintext
  authentication Tokens of all users currently logged in to the system. As a result, ordinary
  users can obtain the administrator's authentication Token through this interface, thereby
  forging an administrator account, gaining the system's management permissions, and taking
  over the system.
