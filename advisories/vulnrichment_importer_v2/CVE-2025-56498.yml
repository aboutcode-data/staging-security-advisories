aliases: []
summary: An OS command injection vulnerability exists in PLDT WiFi Router's Prolink PGN6401V
  Firmware 8.1.2 web management interface. The ping6.asp page submits user input to the /boaform/formPing6
  endpoint via the pingAddr parameter, which is not properly sanitized. An authenticated attacker
  can exploit this flaw by injecting arbitrary system commands, which are executed by the underlying
  operating system with root privileges. The router uses the Boa web server (version 0.93.15)
  to handle the request. Successful exploitation can lead to full system compromise and unauthorized
  control of the network device.
