summary: "A vulnerability in the distribution list feature of Cisco&nbsp;Webex Meetings could\
  \ allow an authenticated, remote attacker to modify a distribution list that belongs to another\
  \ user of their organization.\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization enforcement\
  \ for requests to update distribution lists. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by sending a crafted request to the Webex Meetings interface to modify an existing distribution\
  \ list. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify a distribution list that belongs\
  \ to a user other than themselves.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this\
  \ vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
