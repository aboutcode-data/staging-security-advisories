datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2025/0xxx/CVE-2025-0626.json
aliases: []
summary: The "monitor" binary in the firmware of the affected product attempts to mount to a
  hard-coded, routable IP address, bypassing existing device network settings to do so. The
  function also enables the network interface of the device if it is disabled. The function
  is triggered by attempting to update the device from the user menu. This could serve as a
  backdoor to the device, and could lead to a malicious actor being able to upload and overwrite
  files on the device.
