aliases: []
summary: Potential privilege escalation vulnerability in Revenera InstallShield versions 2022
  R2 and 2021 R2 due to adding InstallScript custom action to a Basic MSI or InstallScript MSI
  project extracting few binaries to a predefined writable folder during installation time.
  The standard user account has write access to these files and folders, hence replacing them
  during installation time can lead to a DLL hijacking vulnerability.
