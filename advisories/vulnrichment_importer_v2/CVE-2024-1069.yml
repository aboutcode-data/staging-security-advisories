summary: The Contact Form Entries plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
  due to insufficient file validation on the 'view_page' function in versions up to, and including,

  or above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code
  execution possible.
