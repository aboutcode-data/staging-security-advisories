aliases: []
summary: Nagios XI versions prior to 2026R1.1 are vulnerable to local privilege escalation due
  to an unsafe interaction between sudo permissions and application file permissions. A user‑accessible
  maintenance script may be executed as root via sudo and includes an application file that
  is writable by a lower‑privileged user. A local attacker with access to the application account
  can modify this file to introduce malicious code, which is then executed with elevated privileges
  when the script is run. Successful exploitation results in arbitrary code execution as the
  root user.
