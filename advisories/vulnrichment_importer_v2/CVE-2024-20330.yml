aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the Snort 2 and Snort 3 TCP and UDP detection engine of Cisco Firepower\
  \ Threat Defense (FTD) Software for Cisco Firepower 2100 Series Appliances could allow an\
  \ unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause memory corruption, which could cause the Snort\
  \ detection engine to restart unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper memory\
  \ management when the Snort detection engine processes specific TCP or UDP packets. An attacker\
  \ could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TCP or UDP packets through a device\
  \ that is inspecting traffic using the Snort detection engine. A successful exploit could\
  \ allow the attacker to restart the Snort detection engine repeatedly, which could cause a\
  \ denial of service (DoS) condition. The DoS condition impacts only the traffic through the\
  \ device that is examined by the Snort detection engine. The device can still be managed over\
  \ the network.\r\nNote: Once a memory block is corrupted, it cannot be cleared until the Cisco\
  \ Firepower 2100 Series Appliance is manually reloaded. This means that the Snort detection\
  \ engine could crash repeatedly, causing traffic that is processed by the Snort detection\
  \ engine to be dropped until the device is manually reloaded."
