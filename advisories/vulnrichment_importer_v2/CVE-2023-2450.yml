aliases: []
summary: The FiboSearch - AJAX Search for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in versions up to, and including, 1.23.0  due
  to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts
  in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site
  installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
