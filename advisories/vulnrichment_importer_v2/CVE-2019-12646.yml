aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Network Address Translation (NAT) Session Initiation Protocol
  (SIP) Application Layer Gateway (ALG) of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload. The vulnerability is due to improper
  processing of transient SIP packets on which NAT is performed on an affected device. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by using UDP port 5060 to send crafted SIP packets through
  an affected device that is performing NAT for SIP packets. A successful exploit could allow
  an attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
