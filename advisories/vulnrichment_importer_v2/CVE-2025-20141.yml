summary: "A vulnerability in the handling of specific packets that are punted from a line card\
  \ to a route processor in Cisco IOS XR Software Release 7.9.2 could allow an unauthenticated,\
  \ adjacent attacker to cause control plane traffic to stop working on multiple Cisco IOS XR\
  \ platforms.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of packets that\
  \ are punted to the route processor. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending\
  \ traffic, which must be handled by the Linux stack on the route processor, to an affected\
  \ device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause control plane traffic to\
  \ stop working, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition."
