aliases: []
summary: The Modern Events Calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
  due to missing file type validation in the set_featured_image function in all versions up
  to, and including, 7.11.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber
  access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote
  code execution possible. The plugin allows administrators (via its settings) to extend the
  ability to submit events to unauthenticated users, which would allow unauthenticated attackers
  to exploit this vulnerability.
