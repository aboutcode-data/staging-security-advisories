summary: Frappe Learning is a learning system that helps users structure their content. In versions
  2.33.0 and below, the image upload functionality did not adequately sanitize uploaded SVG
  files. This allowed users to upload SVG files containing embedded JavaScript or other potentially
  malicious content. Malicious SVG files could be used to execute arbitrary scripts in the context
  of other users. A fix for this issue is planned for version 2.34.0.
