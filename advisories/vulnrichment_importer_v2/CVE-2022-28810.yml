aliases: []
summary: Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus before build 6122 allows a remote authenticated
  administrator to execute arbitrary operating OS commands as SYSTEM via the policy custom script
  feature. Due to the use of a default administrator password, attackers may be able to abuse
  this functionality with minimal effort. Additionally, a remote and partially authenticated
  attacker may be able to inject arbitrary commands into the custom script due to an unsanitized
  password field.
