aliases: []
summary: BuildKit is a toolkit for converting source code to build artifacts in an efficient,
  expressive and repeatable manner. A malicious BuildKit client or frontend could craft a request
  that could lead to BuildKit daemon crashing with a panic. The issue has been fixed in v0.12.5.
  As a workaround, avoid using BuildKit frontends from untrusted sources.
