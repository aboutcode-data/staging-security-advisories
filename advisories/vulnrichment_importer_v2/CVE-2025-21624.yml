aliases: []
summary: ClipBucket V5 provides open source video hosting with PHP. Prior to 5.5.1 - 239, a
  file upload vulnerability exists in the Manage Playlist functionality of the application,
  specifically surrounding the uploading of playlist cover images. Without proper checks, an
  attacker can upload a PHP script file instead of an image file, thus allowing a webshell or
  other malicious files to be stored and executed on the server. This attack vector exists in
  both the admin area and low-level user area. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.5.1 - 239.
