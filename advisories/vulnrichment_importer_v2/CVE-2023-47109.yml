summary: PrestaShop blockreassurance adds an information block aimed at offering helpful information
  to reassure customers that the store is trustworthy. When adding a block in blockreassurance
  module, a BO user can modify the http request and give the path of any file in the project
  instead of an image. When deleting the block from the BO, the file will be deleted. It is
  possible to make the website completely unavailable by removing index.php for example. This
  issue has been patched in version 5.1.4.
