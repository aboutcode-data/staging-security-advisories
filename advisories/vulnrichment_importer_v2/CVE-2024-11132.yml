summary: The Eventer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via shortcodes
  in versions up to, and including, 3.9.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
  escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with
  contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
  execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
