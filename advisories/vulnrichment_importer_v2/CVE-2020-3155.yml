aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the SSL implementation of the Cisco Intelligent Proximity solution
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to view or alter information shared on Cisco
  Webex video devices and Cisco collaboration endpoints if the products meet the conditions
  described in the Vulnerable Products section. The vulnerability is due to a lack of validation
  of the SSL server certificate received when establishing a connection to a Cisco Webex video
  device or a Cisco collaboration endpoint. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
  using man in the middle (MITM) techniques to intercept the traffic between the affected client
  and an endpoint, and then using a forged certificate to impersonate the endpoint. Depending
  on the configuration of the endpoint, an exploit could allow the attacker to view presentation
  content shared on it, modify any content being presented by the victim, or have access to
  call controls. This vulnerability does not affect cloud registered collaboration endpoints.
