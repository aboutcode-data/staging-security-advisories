aliases: []
summary: The Generate PDF using Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload in versions up to, and including, 4.0.6. This is
  due to missing nonce validation and missing file type validation in the 'wp_cf7_pdf_dashboard_html_page'
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on
  the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible via a forged request
  granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on
  a link.
