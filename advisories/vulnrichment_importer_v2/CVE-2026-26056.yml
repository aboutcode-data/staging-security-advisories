aliases: []
summary: Yoke is a Helm-inspired infrastructure-as-code (IaC) package deployer. In 0.19.0 and
  earlier, a vulnerability exists in the Air Traffic Controller (ATC) component of Yoke. It
  allows users with CR create/update permissions to execute arbitrary WASM code in the ATC controller
  context by injecting a malicious URL through the overrides.yoke.cd/flight annotation. The
  ATC controller downloads and executes the WASM module without proper URL validation, enabling
  attackers to create arbitrary Kubernetes resources or potentially escalate privileges to cluster-admin
  level.
