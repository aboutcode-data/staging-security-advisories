aliases: []
summary: Flarum is an open source forum software. Flarum is affected by a vulnerability that
  allows an attacker to conduct a Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack or disclose
  any file on the server, even with a basic user account on any Flarum forum. By uploading a
  file containing a URL and spoofing the MIME type, an attacker can manipulate the application
  to execute unintended actions. The vulnerability is due to the behavior of the `intervention/image`
  package, which attempts to interpret the supplied file contents as a URL, which then fetches
  its contents. This allows an attacker to exploit the vulnerability to perform SSRF attacks,
  disclose local file contents, or conduct a blind oracle attack. This has been patched in Flarum
  version 1.8.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable PHP's `allow_url_fopen`
  which will prevent the fetching of external files via URLs as a temporary workaround for the
  SSRF aspect of the vulnerability.
