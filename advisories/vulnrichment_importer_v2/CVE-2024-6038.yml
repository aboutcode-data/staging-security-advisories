aliases: []
summary: A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the latest version
  of gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt. The vulnerability is located in the filter_history function
  within the utils.py module. This function takes a user-provided keyword and attempts to match
  it against chat history filenames using a regular expression search. Due to the lack of sanitization
  or validation of the keyword parameter, an attacker can inject a specially crafted regular
  expression, leading to a denial of service condition. This can cause severe degradation of
  service performance and potential system unavailability.
