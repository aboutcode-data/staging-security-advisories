aliases: []
summary: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Wix web application, where
  the endpoint ' https://manage.wix.com/account/account-settings ', responsible for uploading
  SVG images, does not properly sanitize the content. An authenticated attacker could upload
  an SVG file containing embedded JavaScript code, which is stored and subsequently executed
  when other users view the image. Exploiting this vulnerability allows arbitrary code to be
  executed in the context of the victim's browser, which could lead to the disclosure of sensitive
  information or the abuse of the affected user's session.
