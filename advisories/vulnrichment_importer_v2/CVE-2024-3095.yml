aliases: []
summary: A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the Web Research Retriever
  component of langchain-ai/langchain version 0.1.5. The vulnerability arises because the Web
  Research Retriever does not restrict requests to remote internet addresses, allowing it to
  reach local addresses. This flaw enables attackers to execute port scans, access local services,
  and in some scenarios, read instance metadata from cloud environments. The vulnerability is
  particularly concerning as it can be exploited to abuse the Web Explorer server as a proxy
  for web attacks on third parties and interact with servers in the local network, including
  reading their response data. This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution, depending
  on the nature of the local services. The vulnerability is limited to GET requests, as POST
  requests are not possible, but the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability
  is significant due to the potential for stolen credentials and state-changing interactions
  with internal APIs.
