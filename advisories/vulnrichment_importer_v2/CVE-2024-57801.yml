  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net/mlx5e: Skip restore TC rules for vport rep without loaded flag

  During driver unload, unregister_netdev is called after unloading
  vport rep. So, the mlx5e_rep_priv is already freed while trying to get
  rpriv->netdev, or walk rpriv->tc_ht, which results in use-after-free.
  So add the checking to make sure access the data of vport rep which is
  still loaded.
