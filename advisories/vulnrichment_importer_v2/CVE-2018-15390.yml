aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the FTP inspection engine of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD)
  Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload,
  resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability exists because the affected
  software fails to release spinlocks when a device is running low on system memory, if the
  software is configured to apply FTP inspection and an access control rule to transit traffic,
  and the access control rule is associated with an FTP file policy. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by sending a high rate of transit traffic through an affected device to
  cause a low-memory condition on the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to cause a software panic on the affected device, which could cause the device to reload and
  result in a temporary DoS condition.
