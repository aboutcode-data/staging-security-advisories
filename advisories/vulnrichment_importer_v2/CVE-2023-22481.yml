aliases: []
summary: FreshRSS is a self-hosted RSS feed aggregator. When using the greader API, the provided
  password is logged in clear in `users/_/log_api.txt` in the case where the authentication
  fails. The issues occurs in `authorizationToUser()` in `greader.php`. If there is an issue
  with the request or the credentials, `unauthorized()` or `badRequest()` is called. Both these
  functions are printing the return of `debugInfo()` in the logs.  `debugInfo()` will return
  the content of the request. By default, this will be saved in `users/_/log_api.txt` and if
  the const `COPY_LOG_TO_SYSLOG` is true, in syslogs as well. Exploiting this issue requires
  having access to logs produced by FreshRSS. Using the information from the logs, a malicious
  individual could get users' API keys (would be displayed if the users fills in a bad username)
  or passwords.
