  Brandon
  Rothel from QED Secure Solutions and Sam Hanson of Dragos have found that the VAPIX API tcptest.cgi
  did not have a sufficient input validation allowing for a possible remote code
  execution. This flaw can only be exploited after authenticating with an
  operator- or administrator-privileged service account. The impact of exploiting
  this vulnerability is lower with operator-privileges compared to
  administrator-privileges service accounts. Please refer to the Axis security advisory
  for more information and solution.
