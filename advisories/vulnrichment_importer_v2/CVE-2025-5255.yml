datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2025-5255
datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2025/5xxx/CVE-2025-5255.json
aliases: []
summary: |
  The Phoenix Code's configuration on macOS, specifically the presence of entitlements: "com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables" and "com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation" allows for Dynamic Library (Dylib) injection. A local attacker with unprivileged access can use environment variables like DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES to successfully inject code in application's context and bypass Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC). Acquired resource access is limited to previously granted permissions by the user. Access to other resources beyond granted-permissions requires user interaction with a system prompt asking for permission.

  This issue was fixed in commit 0c75fb57f89d0b7d9b180026bc2624b7dcf807da
