aliases: []
summary: The Analytics Cat – Google Analytics Made Easy plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg without appropriate escaping
  on the URL in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute if they can successfully trick a user
  into performing an action, such as clicking on a specially crafted link.
