aliases: []
summary: NAXSI is an open-source maintenance web application firewall (WAF) for NGINX. An issue
  present starting in version 1.3 and prior to version 1.6 allows someone to bypass the WAF
  when a malicious `X-Forwarded-For` IP matches `IgnoreIP` `IgnoreCIDR` rules. This old code
  was arranged to allow older NGINX versions to also support `IgnoreIP` `IgnoreCIDR` when multiple
  reverse proxies were present. The issue is patched in version 1.6. As a workaround, do not
  set any `IgnoreIP` `IgnoreCIDR` for older versions.
