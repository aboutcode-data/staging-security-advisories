datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2025/4xxx/CVE-2025-4973.json
aliases: []
summary: The Workreap plugin for WordPress, used by the Workreap - Freelance Marketplace WordPress
  Theme, is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.1.
  This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a user's identity prior to logging them in
  when verifying an account with an email address. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to log in as registered users, including administrators, if they know user's email
  address. This is only exploitable fi the user's confirmation_key has not already been set
  by the plugin.
