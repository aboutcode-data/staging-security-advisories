aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) functionality of Cisco AsyncOS
  Software for Cisco Email Security Appliances (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote
  attacker to bypass configured user filters on the device. The vulnerability is due to incomplete
  input and validation checking mechanisms for certain SPF messages that are sent to an affected
  device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a customized SPF packet to
  an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the header filters
  that are configured for the affected device, which could allow malicious content to pass through
  the device.
