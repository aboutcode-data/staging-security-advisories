  iio: adis16475: fix deadlock on frequency set

  With commit 39c024b51b560
  ("iio: adis16475: improve sync scale mode handling"), two deadlocks were
  introduced:
   1) The call to 'adis_write_reg_16()' was not changed to it's unlocked
      version.
   2) The lock was not being released on the success path of the function.

  This change fixes both these issues.
