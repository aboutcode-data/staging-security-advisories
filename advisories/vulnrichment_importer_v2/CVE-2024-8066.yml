aliases: []
summary: The File Manager Pro – Filester plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
  uploads due to missing validation in the 'fsConnector' function in all versions up to, and
  including, 1.8.6. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
  access and above, and granted permissions by an Administrator, to upload a new .htaccess file
  allowing them to subsequently upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may
  make remote code execution possible.
