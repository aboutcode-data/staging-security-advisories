aliases: []
summary: Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications,
  and databases. Prior to version 4.0.0-beta.451, an authenticated command injection vulnerability
  in the Dynamic Proxy Configuration Filename handling allows users with application/service
  management permissions to execute arbitrary commands as root on managed servers. Proxy configuration
  filenames are passed to shell commands without proper escaping, enabling full remote code
  execution. Version 4.0.0-beta.451 fixes the issue.
