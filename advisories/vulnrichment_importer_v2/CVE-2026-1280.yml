aliases: []
summary: The Frontend File Manager Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized file sharing
  due to a missing capability check on the 'wpfm_send_file_in_email' AJAX action in all versions
  up to, and including, 23.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to share
  arbitrary uploaded files via email by supplying a file ID. Since file IDs are sequential integers,
  attackers can enumerate all uploaded files on the site and exfiltrate sensitive data that
  was intended to be restricted to administrators only.
