summary: "An Origin Validation Error vulnerability in an insufficient protected file of Juniper\
  \ Networks Junos OS on EX4600 Series and QFX5000 Series allows an unauthenticated attacker\
  \ with physical access to the device to create a backdoor which allows complete control of\
  \ the system.\n\nWhen a device isn't configured with a root password, an attacker can modify\
  \ a specific file. It's contents will be added to the Junos configuration of the device without\
  \ being visible. This allows for the addition of any configuration unknown \n\nto the actual\
  \ operator, which includes users, IP addresses and other configuration which could allow unauthorized\
  \ access to the device.\nThis exploit is persistent across reboots and even zeroization.\n\
  \nThe indicator of compromise is a modified /etc/config/<platform>-defaults[-flex].conf file.\
  \ Review that file for unexpected configuration statements, or compare it to an unmodified\
  \ version which can be extracted from the original Juniper software image file. For details\
  \ on the extraction procedure please contact Juniper Technical Assistance Center (JTAC).\n\
  \nTo restore the device to a trusted initial configuration the system needs to be reinstalled\
  \ from physical media. \n\nThis issue affects Junos OS on EX4600 Series and QFX5000 Series:\n\
  \n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.4R3,\n  *  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S3."
