aliases: []
summary: Control Panel provides an API for pre-registering  into an enrollment and organization
  prior to a user's first login. The API for creating users checks that the account requesting
  a user creation has `edit` on the enrollment-level user directory, but is missing a separate
  check that the enrollment editor has access (or belongs to) the organization that they are
  adding a user to.
