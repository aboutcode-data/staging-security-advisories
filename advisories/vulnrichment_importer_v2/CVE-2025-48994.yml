aliases: []
summary: SignXML is an implementation of the W3C XML Signature standard in Python. When verifying
  signatures with X509 certificate validation turned off and HMAC shared secret set (`signxml.XMLVerifier.verify(require_x509=False,
  hmac_key=...`), versions of SignXML prior to 4.0.4 are vulnerable to a potential algorithm
  confusion attack. Unless the user explicitly limits the expected signature algorithms using
  the `signxml.XMLVerifier.verify(expect_config=...)` setting, an attacker may supply a signature
  unexpectedly signed with a key other than the provided HMAC key, using a different (asymmetric
  key) signature algorithm. Starting with SignXML 4.0.4, specifying `hmac_key` causes the set
  of accepted signature algorithms to be restricted to HMAC only, if not already restricted
  by the user.
