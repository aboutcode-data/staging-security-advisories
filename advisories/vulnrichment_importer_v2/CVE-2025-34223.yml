aliases: []
summary: 'Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host prior to version 22.0.1049 and
  Application prior to version 20.0.2786 (VA/SaaS deployments) contain a default admin account and
  an installation‑time endpoint at `/admin/query/update_database.php` that can be accessed without
  authentication. An attacker who can reach the installation web interface can POST arbitrary
  `root_user` and `root_password` values, causing the script to replace the default admin credentials
  with attacker‑controlled ones. The script also contains hard‑coded SHA‑512 and SHA‑1 hashes
  of the default password, allowing the attacker to bypass password‑policy validation. As a
  result, an unauthenticated remote attacker can obtain full administrative control of the system
  during the initial setup. This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2024-022
  — Insecure Installation Credentials.'
