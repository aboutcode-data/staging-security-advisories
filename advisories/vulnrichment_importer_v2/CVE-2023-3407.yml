summary: The Subscribe2 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in
  versions up to, and including, 10.40. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation

  emails with custom content to users on sites running a vulnerable version of this plugin via
  a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such
  as clicking on a link.
