  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  bpf: Fail verification for sign-extension of packet data/data_end/data_meta

  syzbot reported a kernel crash due to
    commit 1f1e864b6555 ("bpf: Handle sign-extenstin ctx member accesses").
  The reason is due to sign-extension of 32-bit load for
  packet data/data_end/data_meta uapi field.

  The original code looks like:
          r2 = *(s32 *)(r1 + 76) /* load __sk_buff->data */
          r3 = *(u32 *)(r1 + 80) /* load __sk_buff->data_end */
          r0 = r2
          r0 += 8
          if r3 > r0 goto +1
          ...
  Note that __sk_buff->data load has 32-bit sign extension.

  After verification and convert_ctx_accesses(), the final asm code looks like:
          r2 = *(u64 *)(r1 +208)
          r2 = (s32)r2
          r3 = *(u64 *)(r1 +80)
          r0 = r2
          r0 += 8
          if r3 > r0 goto pc+1
          ...
  Note that 'r2 = (s32)r2' may make the kernel __sk_buff->data address invalid
  which may cause runtime failure.

  Currently, in C code, typically we have
          void *data = (void *)(long)skb->data;
          void *data_end = (void *)(long)skb->data_end;
          ...
  and it will generate
          r2 = *(u64 *)(r1 +208)
          r3 = *(u64 *)(r1 +80)
          r0 = r2
          r0 += 8
          if r3 > r0 goto pc+1

  If we allow sign-extension,
          void *data = (void *)(long)(int)skb->data;
          void *data_end = (void *)(long)skb->data_end;
          ...
  the generated code looks like
          r2 = *(u64 *)(r1 +208)
          r2 <<= 32
          r2 s>>= 32
          r3 = *(u64 *)(r1 +80)
          r0 = r2
          r0 += 8
          if r3 > r0 goto pc+1
  and this will cause verification failure since "r2 <<= 32" is not allowed
  as "r2" is a packet pointer.

  To fix this issue for case
    r2 = *(s32 *)(r1 + 76) /* load __sk_buff->data */
  this patch added additional checking in is_valid_access() callback
  function for packet data/data_end/data_meta access. If those accesses
  are with sign-extenstion, the verification will fail.
