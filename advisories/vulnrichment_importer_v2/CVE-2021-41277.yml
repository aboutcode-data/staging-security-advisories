aliases: []
summary: Metabase is an open source data analytics platform. In affected versions a security
  issue has been discovered with the custom GeoJSON map (`admin->settings->maps->custom maps->add
  a map`) support and potential local file inclusion (including environment variables). URLs
  were not validated prior to being loaded. This issue is fixed in a new maintenance release
  (0.40.5 and 1.40.5), and any subsequent release after that. If you’re unable to upgrade immediately,
  you can mitigate this by including rules in your reverse proxy or load balancer or WAF to
  provide a validation filter before the application.
