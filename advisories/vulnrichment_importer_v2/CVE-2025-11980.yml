aliases: []
summary: The Quick Featured Images plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the
  'delete_orphaned' function in all versions up to, and including, 13.7.3 due to insufficient
  escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing
  SQL query. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Editor-level access and
  above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to
  extract sensitive information from the database, granted they can convince an author-level
  user or higher to add a malicious custom field value.
