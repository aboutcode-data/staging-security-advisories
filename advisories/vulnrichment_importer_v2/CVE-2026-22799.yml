aliases: []
summary: Emlog is an open source website building system. emlog v2.6.1 and earlier exposes a
  REST API endpoint (/index.php?rest-api=upload) for media file uploads. The endpoint fails
  to implement proper validation of file types, extensions, and content, allowing authenticated
  attackers (with a valid API key or admin session cookie) to upload arbitrary files (including
  malicious PHP scripts) to the server. An attacker can obtain the API key either by gaining
  administrator access to enable the REST API setting, or via information disclosure vulnerabilities
  in the application. Once uploaded, the malicious PHP file can be executed to gain remote code
  execution (RCE) on the target server, leading to full server compromise.
