aliases: []
summary: NetSupport Manager < 14.12.0001  relies on a shared Gateway Key for authentication
  between Manager/Control, Client, and Connectivity Server components. The key is stored using
  a reversible encoding scheme. An attacker who obtains access to a deployed client configuration
  file can decode the stored value to recover the plaintext Gateway Key. Possession of the Gateway
  Key allows unauthorized access to NetSupport Manager connectivity services and enables remote
  control of systems managed through the same key.
