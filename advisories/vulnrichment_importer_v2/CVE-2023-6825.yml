datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2023/6xxx/CVE-2023-6825.json
aliases: []
summary: The File Manager and File Manager Pro plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to Directory
  Traversal in versions up to, and including version 7.2.1 (free version) and 8.3.4 (Pro version)
  via the target parameter in the  mk_file_folder_manager_action_callback_shortcode function.
  This makes it possible for attackers to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server,
  which can contain sensitive information and to upload files into directories other than the
  intended directory for file uploads. The free version requires Administrator access for this
  vulnerability to be exploitable. The Pro version allows a file manager to be embedded via
  a shortcode and also allows admins to grant file handling privileges to other user levels,
  which could lead to this vulnerability being exploited by lower-level users.
