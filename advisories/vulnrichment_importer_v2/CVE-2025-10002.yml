aliases: []
summary: The ClickWhale – Link Manager, Link Shortener and Click Tracker for Affiliate Links
  & Link Pages plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the export_csv() function
  in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.0 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied
  parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to append additional
  SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information
  from the database. This may be exploitable by lower level users if access to the plugin is
  granted.
