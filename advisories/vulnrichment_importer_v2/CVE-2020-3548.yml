aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol implementation of Cisco&nbsp;AsyncOS\
  \ software for Cisco&nbsp;Email Security Appliance (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote\
  \ attacker to cause high CPU usage on an affected device, resulting in a denial of service\
  \ (DoS) condition.\r\nThe vulnerability is due to inefficient processing of incoming TLS traffic.\
  \ An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted TLS packets\
  \ to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a prolonged\
  \ state of high CPU utilization. The affected device would still be operative, but response\
  \ time and overall performance may be degraded.There are no workarounds that address this\
  \ vulnerability."
