aliases: []
summary: Angular is a development platform for building mobile and desktop web applications
  using TypeScript/JavaScript and other languages. Prior to versions 19.2.16, 20.3.14, and 21.0.1,
  there is a XSRF token leakage via protocol-relative URLs in angular HTTP clients. The vulnerability
  is a Credential Leak by App Logic that leads to the unauthorized disclosure of the Cross-Site
  Request Forgery (XSRF) token to an attacker-controlled domain. Angular's HttpClient has a
  built-in XSRF protection mechanism that works by checking if a request URL starts with a protocol
  (http:// or https://) to determine if it is cross-origin. If the URL starts with protocol-relative
  URL (//), it is incorrectly treated as a same-origin request, and the XSRF token is automatically
  added to the X-XSRF-TOKEN header. This issue has been patched in versions 19.2.16, 20.3.14,
  and 21.0.1. A workaround for this issue involves avoiding using protocol-relative URLs (URLs
  starting with //) in HttpClient requests. All backend communication URLs should be hardcoded
  as relative paths (starting with a single /) or fully qualified, trusted absolute URLs.
