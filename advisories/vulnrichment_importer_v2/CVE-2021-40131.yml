summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Common Services Platform
  Collector (CSPC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attack against a user of the interface. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation
  of user-supplied input that is processed by the web-based management interface. An attacker

  web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
  code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
