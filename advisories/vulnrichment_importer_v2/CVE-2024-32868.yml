aliases: []
summary: ZITADEL provides users the possibility to use Time-based One-Time-Password (TOTP) and
  One-Time-Password (OTP) through SMS and Email. While ZITADEL already gives administrators
  the option to define a `Lockout Policy` with a maximum amount of failed password check attempts,
  there was no such mechanism for (T)OTP checks. This issue has been patched in version 2.50.0.
