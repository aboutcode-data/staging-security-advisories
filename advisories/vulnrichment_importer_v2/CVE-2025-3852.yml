aliases: []
summary: The WPshop 2 – E-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
  via account takeover in versions 2.0.0 to 2.6.0. This is due to the plugin not properly validating
  a user's identity prior to updating their details like email & password through the update()
  function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access
  and above, to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators, and leverage that
  to gain access to their account.
