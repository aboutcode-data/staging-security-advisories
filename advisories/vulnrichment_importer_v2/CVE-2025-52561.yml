aliases: []
summary: HTMLSanitizer.jl is a Whitelist-based HTML sanitizer. Prior to version 0.2.1, when
  adding the style tag to the whitelist, content inside the tag is incorrectly unescaped, and
  closing tags injected as content are interpreted as real HTML, enabling tag injection and
  JavaScript execution. This could result in possible cross-site scripting (XSS) in any HTML
  that is sanitized with this library. This issue has been patched in version 0.2.1. A workaround
  involves adding the math and svg elements to the whitelist manually.
