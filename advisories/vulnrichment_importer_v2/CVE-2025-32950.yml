aliases: []
summary: Jmix is a set of libraries and tools to speed up Spring Boot data-centric application
  development. In versions 1.0.0 to 1.6.1 and 2.0.0 to 2.3.4, attackers could manipulate the
  FileRef parameter to access files on the system where the Jmix application is deployed, provided
  the application server has the necessary permissions. This can be accomplished either by modifying
  the FileRef directly in the database or by supplying a harmful value in the fileRef parameter
  of the `/files` endpoint of the generic REST API. This issue has been patched in versions
  1.6.2 and 2.4.0. A workaround is provided on the Jmix documentation website.
