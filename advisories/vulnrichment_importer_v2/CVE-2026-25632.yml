aliases: []
summary: EPyT-Flow is a Python package designed for the easy generation of hydraulic and water
  quality scenario data of water distribution networks. Prior to 0.16.1, EPyT-Flow’s REST API
  parses attacker-controlled JSON request bodies using a custom deserializer (my_load_from_json)
  that supports a type field. When type is present, the deserializer dynamically imports an
  attacker-specified module/class and instantiates it with attacker-supplied arguments. This
  allows invoking dangerous classes such as subprocess.Popen, which can lead to OS command execution
  during JSON parsing. This also affects the loading of JSON files. This vulnerability is fixed
  in 0.16.1.
