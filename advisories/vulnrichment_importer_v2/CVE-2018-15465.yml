aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the authorization subsystem of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance
  (ASA) Software could allow an authenticated, but unprivileged (levels 0 and 1), remote attacker
  to perform privileged actions by using the web management interface. The vulnerability is
  due to improper validation of user privileges when using the web management interface. An
  attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific HTTP requests via HTTPS to an
  affected device as an unprivileged user. An exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve files
  (including the running configuration) from the device or to upload and replace software images
  on the device.
