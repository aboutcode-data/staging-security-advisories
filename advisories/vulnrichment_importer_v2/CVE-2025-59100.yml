aliases: []
summary: "The web interface offers a functionality to export the internal SQLite database. After\
  \ executing the database export, an automatic download is started and the device reboots.\
  \ After rebooting, the exported database is deleted and cannot be accessed anymore. However,\
  \ it was noticed that sometimes the device does not reboot and therefore the exported database\
  \ is not deleted, or the device reboots and the export is not deleted for unknown reasons.\
  \ The path where the database export is located can be accessed without prior authentication.\
  \ This leads to the fact that an attacker might be able to get access to the exported database\
  \ without prior authentication. \nThe database includes sensitive data like passwords, card\
  \ pins, encrypted Mifare sitekeys and much more."
