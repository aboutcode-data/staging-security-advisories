summary: An error in BigInt conversion to Number in Hermes prior to commit a6dcafe6ded8e61658b40f5699878cd19a481f80
  could have been used by a malicious attacker to execute arbitrary code due to an out-of-bound
  write. Note that this bug is only exploitable in cases where Hermes is used to execute untrusted
  JavaScript. Hence, most React Native applications are not affected.
