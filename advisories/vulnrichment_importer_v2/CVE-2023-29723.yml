aliases: []
summary: The Glitter Unicorn Wallpaper app for Android 7.0 thru 8.0 allows unauthorized applications
  to actively request permission to insert data into the database that records information about
  a user's personal preferences and will be loaded into memory to be read and used when the
  application is opened. By injecting data, the attacker can force the application to load malicious
  image URLs and display them in the UI. As the amount of data increases, it will eventually
  cause the application to trigger an OOM error and crash, resulting in a persistent denial
  of service attack.
