aliases: []
summary: RustFS is a distributed object storage system built in Rust. From >= 1.0.0-alpha.1
  to 1.0.0-alpha.79, invalid RPC signatures cause the server to log the shared HMAC secret (and
  expected signature), which exposes the secret to log readers and enables forged RPC calls.
  In crates/ecstore/src/rpc/http_auth.rs, the invalid signature branch logs sensitive data.
  This log line includes secret and expected_signature, both derived from the shared HMAC key.
  Any invalidly signed request triggers this path. The function is reachable from RPC and admin
  request handlers. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.0-alpha.80.
