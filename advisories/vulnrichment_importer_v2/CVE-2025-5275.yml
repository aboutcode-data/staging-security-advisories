summary: "The Charitable – Donation Plugin for WordPress – Fundraising with Recurring Donations\
  \ & More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the privacy\
  \ settings fields in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.6.1 due to insufficient input\
  \ sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with\
  \ administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever\
  \ a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations\
  \ where unfiltered_html has been disabled.\r\nThis issue was partially fixed in version 1.8.6.1\
  \ and fully fixed in version 1.8.6.2."
