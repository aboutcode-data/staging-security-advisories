aliases: []
summary: When installing Nessus to a directory outside of the default location on a Windows
  host, Nessus versions prior to 10.7.3 did not enforce secure permissions for sub-directories.
  This could allow for local privilege escalation if users had not secured the directories in
  the non-default installation location.
