aliases: []
summary: The tbm-client from Chunghwa Telecom has an Arbitrary File Delete vulnerability. The
  application sets up a simple local web server and provides APIs for communication with the
  target website. Due to the lack of CSRF protection in the APIs, unauthenticated remote attackers
  could use these APIs through phishing. Additionally, one of the APIs contains an Absolute
  Path Traversal vulnerability, allowing attackers to delete arbitrary files on the user's system.
