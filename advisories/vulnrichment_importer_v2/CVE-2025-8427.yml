summary: The Beaver Builder Plugin (Starter Version) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
  Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘auto_play’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.2.1

  attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
  that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
