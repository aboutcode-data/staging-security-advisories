aliases: []
summary: New API is a large language mode (LLM) gateway and artificial intelligence (AI) asset
  management system. An authenticated Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists
  in versions prior to 0.9.0.5. A feature within the application allows authenticated users
  to submit a URL for the server to process its content. The application fails to properly validate
  this user-supplied URL before making a server-side request. This vulnerability is not limited
  to image URLs and can be triggered with any link provided to the vulnerable endpoint. Since
  user registration is often enabled by default, any registered user can exploit this. By crafting
  a malicious URL, an attacker can coerce the server to send requests to arbitrary internal
  or external services. The vulnerability has been patched in version 0.9.0.5. The patch introduces
  a comprehensive, user-configurable SSRF protection module, which is enabled by default to
  protect server security. This new feature provides administrators with granular control over
  outbound requests made by the server. For users who cannot upgrade immediately, some temporary
  mitigation options are available. Enable new-api image processing worker (new-api-worker)
  and/or configure egress firewall rules.
