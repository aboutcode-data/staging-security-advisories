aliases: []
summary: TinyWeb is a web server (HTTP, HTTPS) written in Delphi for Win32. Versions prior to
  version 2.02 have a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability via memory exhaustion. Unauthenticated
  remote attackers can send an HTTP POST request to the server with an exceptionally large `Content-Length`
  header (e.g., `2147483647`). The server continuously allocates memory for the request body
  (`EntityBody`) while streaming the payload without enforcing any maximum limit, leading to
  all available memory being consumed and causing the server to crash. Anyone hosting services
  using TinyWeb is impacted. Version 2.02 fixes the issue. The patch introduces a `CMaxEntityBodySize`
  limit (set to 10MB) for the maximum size of accepted payloads. As a temporary workaround if
  upgrading is not immediately possible, consider placing the server behind a Web Application
  Firewall (WAF) or reverse proxy (like nginx or Cloudflare) configured to explicitly limit
  the maximum allowed HTTP request body size (e.g., `client_max_body_size` in nginx).
