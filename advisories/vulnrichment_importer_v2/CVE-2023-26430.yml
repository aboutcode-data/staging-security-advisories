aliases: []
summary: Attackers with access to user accounts can inject arbitrary control characters to SIEVE
  mail-filter rules. This could be abused to access SIEVE extension that are not allowed by
  App Suite or to inject rules which would break per-user filter processing, requiring manual
  cleanup of such rules. We have added sanitization to all mail-filter APIs to avoid forwardning
  control characters to subsystems. No publicly available exploits are known.
