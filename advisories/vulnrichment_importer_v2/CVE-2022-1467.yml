aliases: []
summary: Windows OS can be configured to overlay a “language bar” on top of any application.
  When this OS functionality is enabled, the OS language bar UI will be viewable in the browser
  alongside the AVEVA InTouch Access Anywhere and Plant SCADA Access Anywhere applications.
  It is possible to manipulate the Windows OS language bar to launch an OS command prompt, resulting
  in a context-escape from application into OS.
