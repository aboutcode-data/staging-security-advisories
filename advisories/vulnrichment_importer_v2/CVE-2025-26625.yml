aliases: []
summary: Git LFS is a Git extension for versioning large files. In Git LFS versions 0.5.2 through
  3.7.0, when populating a Git repository's working tree with the contents of Git LFS objects,
  certain Git LFS commands may write to files visible outside the current Git working tree if
  symbolic or hard links exist which collide with the paths of files tracked by Git LFS. The
  git lfs checkout and git lfs pull commands do not check for symbolic links before writing
  to files in the working tree, allowing an attacker to craft a repository containing symbolic
  or hard links that cause Git LFS to write to arbitrary file system locations accessible to
  the user running these commands. As well, when the git lfs checkout and git lfs pull commands
  are run in a bare repository, they could write to files visible outside the repository. The
  vulnerability is fixed in version 3.7.1. As a workaround, support for symlinks in Git may
  be disabled by setting the core.symlinks configuration option to false, after which further
  clones and fetches will not create symbolic links. However, any symbolic or hard links in
  existing repositories will still provide the opportunity for Git LFS to write to their targets.
