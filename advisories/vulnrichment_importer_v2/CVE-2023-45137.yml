aliases: []
summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications
  built on top of it. `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web` starting in version 3.1-milestone-2
  and prior to version 13.4-rc-1, as well as `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web-templates`
  prior to versions 14.10.12 and 15.5-rc-1, are vulnerable to cross-site scripting. When trying
  to create a document that already exists, XWiki displays an error message in the form for
  creating it. Due to missing escaping, this error message is vulnerable to raw HTML injection
  and thus XSS. The injected code is the document reference of the existing document so this
  requires that the attacker first creates a non-empty document whose name contains the attack
  code. This has been patched in `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web` version 13.4-rc-1 and
  `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web-templates` versions 14.10.12 and 15.5-rc-1 by adding
  the appropriate escaping. The vulnerable template file `createinline.vm` is part of XWiki's
  WAR and can be patched by manually applying the changes from the fix.
