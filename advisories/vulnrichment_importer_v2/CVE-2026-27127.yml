aliases: []
summary: Craft is a content management system (CMS). In versions 4.5.0-RC1 through 4.16.18 and
  5.0.0-RC1 through 5.8.22, the SSRF validation in Craft CMS’s GraphQL Asset mutation performs
  DNS resolution separately from the HTTP request. This Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability
  enables DNS rebinding attacks, where an attacker’s DNS server returns different IP addresses
  for validation compared to the actual request. This is a bypass of the security fix for CVE-2025-68437
  that allows access to all blocked IPs, not just IPv6 endpoints. Exploitation requires GraphQL
  schema permissions for editing assets in the `<VolumeName>` volume and creating assets in
  the `<VolumeName>` volume. These permissions may be granted to authenticated users with appropriate
  GraphQL schema access and/or Public Schema (if misconfigured with write permissions). Versions
  4.16.19 and 5.8.23 patch the issue.
