summary: 'Gladinet CentreStack through 16.1.10296.56315 (fixed in 16.4.10315.56368) has a deserialization
  vulnerability due to the CentreStack portal''s hardcoded machineKey use, as exploited in the
  wild in March 2025. This enables threat actors (who know the machineKey) to serialize a payload
  for server-side deserialization to achieve remote code execution. NOTE: a CentreStack admin
  can manually delete the machineKey defined in portal\web.config.'
