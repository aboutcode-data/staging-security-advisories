aliases: []
summary: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions starting with 2.2
  and prior to 2.3.19, 2.4.7, and 2.5.0-beta.2 are vulnerable to regular expression denial of
  service (ReDoS) attacks. By using specific a RegularExpression, an attacker can cause denial
  of service for the bbb-html5 service. The useragent library performs checking of device by
  parsing the input of User-Agent header and lets it go through lookupUserAgent() (alias of
  useragent.lookup() ). This function handles input by regexing and attackers can abuse that
  by providing some ReDos payload using `SmartWatch`. The maintainers removed `htmlclient/useragent`
  from versions 2.3.19, 2.4.7, and 2.5.0-beta.2. As a workaround, disable NginX forwarding the
  requests to the handler according to the directions in the GitHub Security Advisory.
