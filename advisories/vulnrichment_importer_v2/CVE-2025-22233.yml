summary: "CVE-2024-38820 ensured Locale-independent, lowercase conversion for both the configured\
  \ disallowedFields patterns and for request parameter names. However, there are still cases\
  \ where it is possible to bypass the disallowedFields checks.\n\nAffected Spring Products\
  \ and Versions\n\nSpring Framework:\n  *  6.2.0 - 6.2.6\n\n  *  6.1.0 - 6.1.19\n\n  *  6.0.0\
  \ - 6.0.27\n\n  *  5.3.0 - 5.3.42\n  *  Older, unsupported versions are also affected\n\n\n\
  \nMitigation\n\nUsers of affected versions should upgrade to the corresponding fixed version.\n\
  \nAffected version(s)Fix Version Availability 6.2.x\n 6.2.7\nOSS6.1.x\n 6.1.20\nOSS6.0.x\n\
  \ 6.0.28\n Commercial https://enterprise.spring.io/ 5.3.x\n 5.3.43\n Commercial https://enterprise.spring.io/\
  \ \nNo further mitigation steps are necessary.\n\n\nGenerally, we recommend using a dedicated\
  \ model object with properties only for data binding, or using constructor binding since constructor\
  \ arguments explicitly declare what to bind together with turning off setter binding through\
  \ the declarativeBinding flag. See the Model Design section in the reference documentation.\n\
  \nFor setting binding, prefer the use of allowedFields (an explicit list) over disallowedFields.\n\
  \nCredit\n\nThis issue was responsibly reported by the TERASOLUNA Framework Development Team\
  \ from NTT DATA Group Corporation."
