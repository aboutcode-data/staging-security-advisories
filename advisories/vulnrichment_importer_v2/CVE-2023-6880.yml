summary: The Visual Composer Website Builder, Landing Page Builder, Custom Theme Builder, Maintenance
  Mode & Coming Soon Pages plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the plugin's custom fields in all versions up to, and including, 45.6.0 due to insufficient

  for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary
  web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
