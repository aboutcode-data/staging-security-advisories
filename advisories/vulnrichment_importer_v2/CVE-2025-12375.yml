aliases: []
summary: The Printful Integration for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side
  Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.11 via the advanced size chart REST
  API endpoint. This is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied URLs before passing
  them to the download_url() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
  Contributor-level access and above, to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating
  from the web application which can be used to query and modify information from internal services.
