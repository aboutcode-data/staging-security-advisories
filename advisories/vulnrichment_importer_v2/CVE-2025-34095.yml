aliases: []
summary: An OS command injection vulnerability exists in Mako Server versions 2.5 and 2.6, specifically
  within the tutorial interface provided by the examples/save.lsp endpoint. An unauthenticated
  attacker can send a crafted PUT request containing arbitrary Lua os.execute() code, which
  is then persisted on disk and triggered via a subsequent GET request to examples/manage.lsp.
  This allows remote command execution on the underlying operating system, impacting both Windows
  and Unix-based deployments.
