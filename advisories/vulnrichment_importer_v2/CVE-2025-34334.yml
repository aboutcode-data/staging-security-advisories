aliases: []
summary: AudioCodes Fax Server and Auto-Attendant IVR appliances versions up to and including
  2.6.23 are vulnerable to an authenticated command injection in the fax test functionality
  implemented by AudioCodes_files/TestFax.php. When a fax "send" test is requested, the application
  builds a faxsender command line using attacker-supplied parameters and passes it to GlobalUtils::RunBatchFile
  without proper validation or shell-argument sanitization. The resulting batch file is written
  into a temporary run directory and then executed via a backend service that runs as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.
  An authenticated attacker with access to the fax test interface can craft parameter values
  that inject additional shell commands into the generated batch file, leading to arbitrary
  command execution with SYSTEM privileges. In addition, because the generated batch files reside
  in a location with overly permissive file system permissions, a local low-privilege user on
  the server can modify pending batch files to achieve the same elevation.
