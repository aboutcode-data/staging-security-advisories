aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated,\
  \ local attacker with privilege level 15 to elevate privileges to root on the underlying operating\
  \ system of an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation\
  \ when processing specific configuration commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by including crafted input in specific configuration commands. A successful exploit could\
  \ allow the attacker to elevate privileges to root on the underlying operating system of an\
  \ affected device. The security impact rating (SIR) of this advisory has been raised to High\
  \ because an attacker could gain access to the underlying operating system of the affected\
  \ device and perform potentially undetected actions.\r\n\r Note: The attacker must have privileges\
  \ to enter configuration mode on the affected device. This is usually referred to as privilege\
  \ level 15."
