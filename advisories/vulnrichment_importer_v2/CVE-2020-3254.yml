aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) inspection feature
  of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition
  on an affected device. The vulnerabilities are due to inefficient memory management. An attacker
  could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted MGCP packets through an affected device.
  An exploit could allow the attacker to cause memory exhaustion resulting in a restart of an
  affected device, causing a DoS condition for traffic traversing the device.
