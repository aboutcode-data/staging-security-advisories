summary: |
  Issue summary: The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM
  platform contains a bug that could cause it to read past the input buffer,
  leading to a crash.

  Impact summary: Applications that use the AES-XTS algorithm on the 64 bit ARM
  platform can crash in rare circumstances. The AES-XTS algorithm is usually
  used for disk encryption.

  The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM platform will read
  past the end of the ciphertext buffer if the ciphertext size is 4 mod 5 in 16
  byte blocks, e.g. 144 bytes or 1024 bytes. If the memory after the ciphertext
  buffer is unmapped, this will trigger a crash which results in a denial of
  service.

  If an attacker can control the size and location of the ciphertext buffer
  being decrypted by an application using AES-XTS on 64 bit ARM, the
  application is affected. This is fairly unlikely making this issue
  a Low severity one.
