aliases: []
summary: Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane.
  This issue only impacts users who have a HTTP policy that applies to multiple `toEndpoints`
  AND have an allow-all rule in place that affects only one of those endpoints. In such cases,
  a wildcard rule will be appended to the set of HTTP rules, which could cause bypass of HTTP
  policies. This issue has been patched in Cilium 1.11.16, 1.12.9, and 1.13.2.
