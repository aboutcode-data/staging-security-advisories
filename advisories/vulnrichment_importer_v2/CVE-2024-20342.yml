aliases: []
summary: "Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the rate filtering feature\
  \ of the Snort detection engine that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass\
  \ a configured rate limiting filter.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to an incorrect\
  \ connection count comparison. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic\
  \ through an affected device at a rate that exceeds a configured rate filter. A successful\
  \ exploit could allow the attacker to successfully bypass the rate filter. This could allow\
  \ unintended traffic to enter the network protected by the affected device."
