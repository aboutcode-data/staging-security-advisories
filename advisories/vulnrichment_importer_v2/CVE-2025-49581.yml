aliases: []
summary: XWiki is a generic wiki platform. Any user with edit right on a page (could be the
  user's profile) can execute code (Groovy, Python, Velocity) with programming right by defining
  a wiki macro. This allows full access to the whole XWiki installation. The main problem is
  that if a wiki macro parameter allows wiki syntax, its default value is executed with the
  rights of the author of the document where it is used. This can be exploited by overriding
  a macro like the children macro that is used in a page that has programming right like the
  page XWiki.ChildrenMacro and thus allows arbitrary script macros. This vulnerability has been
  patched in XWiki 16.4.7, 16.10.3 and 17.0.0 by executing wiki parameters with the rights of
  the wiki macro's author when the parameter's value is the default value.
