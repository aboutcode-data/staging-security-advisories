  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  nilfs2: fix potential out-of-bounds memory access in nilfs_find_entry()

  Syzbot reported that when searching for records in a directory where the
  inode's i_size is corrupted and has a large value, memory access outside
  the folio/page range may occur, or a use-after-free bug may be detected if
  KASAN is enabled.

  This is because nilfs_last_byte(), which is called by nilfs_find_entry()
  and others to calculate the number of valid bytes of directory data in a
  page from i_size and the page index, loses the upper 32 bits of the 64-bit
  size information due to an inappropriate type of local variable to which
  the i_size value is assigned.

  This caused a large byte offset value due to underflow in the end address
  calculation in the calling nilfs_find_entry(), resulting in memory access
  that exceeds the folio/page size.

  Fix this issue by changing the type of the local variable causing the bit
  loss from "unsigned int" to "u64".  The return value of nilfs_last_byte()
  is also of type "unsigned int", but it is truncated so as not to exceed
  PAGE_SIZE and no bit loss occurs, so no change is required.
