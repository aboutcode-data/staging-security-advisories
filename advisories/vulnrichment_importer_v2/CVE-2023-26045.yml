aliases: []
summary: NodeBB is Node.js based forum software. Starting in version 2.5.0 and prior to version
  2.8.7, due to the use of the object destructuring assignment syntax in the user export code
  path, combined with a path traversal vulnerability, a specially crafted payload could invoke
  the user export logic to arbitrarily execute javascript files on the local disk. This issue
  is patched in version 2.8.7. As a workaround, site maintainers can cherry pick the fix into
  their codebase to patch the exploit.
