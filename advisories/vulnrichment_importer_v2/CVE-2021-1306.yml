summary: A vulnerability in the restricted shell of Cisco Evolved Programmable Network (EPN)
  Manager, Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE), and Cisco Prime Infrastructure could allow
  an authenticated, local attacker to identify directories and write arbitrary files to the
  file system. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of parameters that are sent
  to a CLI command within the restricted shell. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by logging in to the device and issuing certain CLI commands. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to identify file directories on the affected device and write arbitrary files
  to the file system on the affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must
  be an authenticated shell user.
