aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated
  but unprivileged (level 1), remote attacker to run privileged Cisco IOS commands by using
  the web UI. The vulnerability is due to a failure to validate and sanitize input in Web Services
  Management Agent (WSMA) functions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting
  a malicious payload to the affected device's web UI. A successful exploit could allow the
  lower-privileged attacker to execute arbitrary commands with higher privileges on the affected
  device.
