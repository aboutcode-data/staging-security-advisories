aliases: []
summary: Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library. Versions 6.5.2
  and below use an inefficient algorithm when parsing parameters for HTTP header values, potentially
  causing a DoS. The _parseparam function in httputil.py is used to parse specific HTTP header
  values, such as those in multipart/form-data and repeatedly calls string.count() within a
  nested loop while processing quoted semicolons. If an attacker sends a request with a large
  number of maliciously crafted parameters in a Content-Disposition header, the server's CPU
  usage increases quadratically (O(n²)) during parsing. Due to Tornado's single event loop architecture,
  a single malicious request can cause the entire server to become unresponsive for an extended
  period. This issue is fixed in version 6.5.3.
