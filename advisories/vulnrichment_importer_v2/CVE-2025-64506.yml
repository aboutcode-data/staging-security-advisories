aliases: []
summary: LIBPNG is a reference library for use in applications that read, create, and manipulate
  PNG (Portable Network Graphics) raster image files. From version 1.6.0 to before 1.6.51, a
  heap buffer over-read vulnerability exists in libpng's png_write_image_8bit function when
  processing 8-bit images through the simplified write API with convert_to_8bit enabled. The
  vulnerability affects 8-bit grayscale+alpha, RGB/RGBA, and images with incomplete row data.
  A conditional guard incorrectly allows 8-bit input to enter code expecting 16-bit input, causing
  reads up to 2 bytes beyond allocated buffer boundaries. This issue has been patched in version
  1.6.51.
