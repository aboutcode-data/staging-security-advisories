  wifi: rtw89: Fix array index mistake in rtw89_sta_info_get_iter()

  In rtw89_sta_info_get_iter() 'status->he_gi' is compared to array size.
  But then 'rate->he_gi' is used as array index instead of 'status->he_gi'.
  This can lead to go beyond array boundaries in case of 'rate->he_gi' is
  not equal to 'status->he_gi' and is bigger than array size. Looks like
  "copy-paste" mistake.

  Fix this mistake by replacing 'rate->he_gi' with 'status->he_gi'.

  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.
