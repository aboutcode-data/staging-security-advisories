aliases: []
summary: Camaleon CMS is a dynamic and advanced content management system based on Ruby on Rails.
  An arbitrary file write vulnerability accessible via the upload method of the MediaController
  allows authenticated users to write arbitrary files to any location on the web server Camaleon
  CMS is running on (depending on the permissions of the underlying filesystem). E.g. This can
  lead to a delayed remote code execution in case an attacker is able to write a Ruby file into
  the config/initializers/ subfolder of the Ruby on Rails application. This issue has been addressed
  in release version 2.8.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for
  this vulnerability.
