aliases: []
summary: The Recent Posts Widget Extended plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the plugin's 'rpwe' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.2 due
  to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject
  arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
