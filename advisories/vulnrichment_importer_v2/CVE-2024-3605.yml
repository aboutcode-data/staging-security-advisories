aliases: []
summary: The WP Hotel Booking plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'room_type'
  parameter of the /wphb/v1/rooms/search-rooms REST API endpoint in all versions up to, and
  including, 2.1.0 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient
  preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract
  sensitive information from the database.
