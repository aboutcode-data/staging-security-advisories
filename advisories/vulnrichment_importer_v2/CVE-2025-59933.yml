aliases: []
summary: libvips is a demand-driven, horizontally threaded image processing library. For versions
  8.17.1 and below, when libvips is compiled with support for PDF input via poppler, the pdfload
  operation is affected by a buffer read overflow when parsing the header of a crafted PDF with
  a page that defines a width but not a height. Those using libvips compiled without support
  for PDF input are unaffected as well as thosewith support for PDF input via PDFium. This issue
  is fixed in version 8.17.2. A workaround for those affected is to block the VipsForeignLoadPdf
  operation via vips_operation_block_set, which is available in most language bindings, or to
  set VIPS_BLOCK_UNTRUSTED environment variable at runtime, which will block all untrusted loaders
  including PDF input via poppler.
