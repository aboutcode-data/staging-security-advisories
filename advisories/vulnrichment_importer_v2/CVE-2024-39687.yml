aliases: []
summary: Fedify is a TypeScript library for building federated server apps powered by ActivityPub
  and other standards. At present, when Fedify needs to retrieve an object or activity from
  a remote activitypub server, it makes a HTTP request to the `@id` or other resources present
  within the activity it has received from the web. This activity could reference an `@id` that
  points to an internal IP address, allowing an attacker to send request to resources internal
  to the fedify server's network. This applies to not just resolution of documents containing
  activities or objects, but also to media URLs as well. Specifically this is a Server Side
  Request Forgery attack. Users should upgrade to Fedify version 0.9.2, 0.10.1, or 0.11.1 to
  receive a patch for this issue.
