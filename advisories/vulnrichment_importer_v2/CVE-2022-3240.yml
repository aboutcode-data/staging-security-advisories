aliases: []
summary: The "Follow Me Plugin" plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in versions up to, and including, 3.1.1. This is due to missing nonce validation on the FollowMeIgniteSocialMedia_options_page()
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings
  and inject malicious JavaScript via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
