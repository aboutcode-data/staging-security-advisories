  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  cifs: fix underflow in parse_server_interfaces()

  In this loop, we step through the buffer and after each item we check
  if the size_left is greater than the minimum size we need.  However,
  the problem is that "bytes_left" is type ssize_t while sizeof() is type
  size_t.  That means that because of type promotion, the comparison is
  done as an unsigned and if we have negative bytes left the loop
  continues instead of ending.
