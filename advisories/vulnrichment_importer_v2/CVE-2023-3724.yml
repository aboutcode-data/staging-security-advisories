aliases: []
summary: If a TLS 1.3 client gets neither a PSK (pre shared key) extension nor a KSE (key share
  extension) when connecting to a malicious server, a default predictable buffer gets used for
  the IKM (Input Keying Material) value when generating the session master secret. Using a potentially
  known IKM value when generating the session master secret key compromises the key generated,
  allowing an eavesdropper to reconstruct it and potentially allowing access to or meddling
  with message contents in the session. This issue does not affect client validation of connected
  servers, nor expose private key information, but could result in an insecure TLS 1.3 session
  when not controlling both sides of the connection. wolfSSL recommends that TLS 1.3 client
  side users update the version of wolfSSL used.
