aliases: []
summary: The source-controller is a Kubernetes operator, specialised in artifacts acquisition
  from external sources such as Git, OCI, Helm repositories and S3-compatible buckets. The source-controller
  implements the source.toolkit.fluxcd.io API and is a core component of the GitOps toolkit.
  Prior to version 1.2.5, when source-controller was configured to use an Azure SAS token when
  connecting to Azure Blob Storage, the token was logged along with the Azure URL when the controller
  encountered a connection error. An attacker with access to the source-controller logs could
  use the token to gain access to the Azure Blob Storage until the token expires. This vulnerability
  was fixed in source-controller v1.2.5. There is no workaround for this vulnerability except
  for using a different auth mechanism such as Azure Workload Identity.
