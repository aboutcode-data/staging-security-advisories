summary: |
  A Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in the Network Services Daemon (NSD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows authenticated, low privileged, local attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

  On an SRX 5000 Series device, when executing a specific command repeatedly, memory is corrupted, which leads to a Flow Processing Daemon (flowd) crash.

  The NSD process has to be restarted to restore services.

  If this issue occurs, it can be checked with the following command:

  user@host> request security policies check
  The following log message can also be observed:

  Error: policies are out of sync for PFE node<number>.fpc<number>.pic<number>.
