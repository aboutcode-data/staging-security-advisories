aliases: []
summary: Kata Containers is an open source project focusing on a standard implementation of
  lightweight Virtual Machines (VMs) that perform like containers. In versions prior to 3.26.0,
  when a container image is malformed or contains no layers, containerd falls back to bind-mounting
  an empty snapshotter directory for the container rootfs. When the Kata runtime attempts to
  mount the container rootfs, the bind mount causes the rootfs to be detected as a block device,
  leading to the underlying device being hotplugged to the guest. This can cause filesystem-level
  errors on the host due to double inode allocation, and may lead to the host's block device
  being mounted as read-only. Version 3.26.0 contains a patch for the issue.
