summary: The WP Event Manager – Events Calendar, Registrations, Sell Tickets with WooCommerce
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin parameter
  in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.41 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
  escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
  in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such
  as clicking on a link.
