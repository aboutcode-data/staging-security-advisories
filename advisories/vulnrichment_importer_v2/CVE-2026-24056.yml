aliases: []
summary: pnpm is a package manager. Prior to version 10.28.2, when pnpm installs a `file:` (directory)
  or `git:` dependency, it follows symlinks and reads their target contents without constraining
  them to the package root. A malicious package containing a symlink to an absolute path (e.g.,
  `/etc/passwd`, `~/.ssh/id_rsa`) causes pnpm to copy that file's contents into `node_modules`,
  leaking local data. The vulnerability only affects `file:` and `git:` dependencies. Registry
  packages (npm) have symlinks stripped during publish and are NOT affected. The issue impacts
  developers installing local/file dependencies andCI/CD pipelines installing git dependencies.
  It can lead to credential theft via symlinks to `~/.aws/credentials`, `~/.npmrc`, `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.
  Version 10.28.2 contains a patch.
