aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco DNA Center
  software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attack against a user of the interface of an affected device. The vulnerabilities exist
  because the web-based management interface on an affected device does not properly validate
  user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user
  of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
  execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive,
  browser-based information.
