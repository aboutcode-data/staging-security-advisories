aliases: []
summary: Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) is an automated, all-in-one mobile application (Android/iOS/Windows)
  pen-testing, malware analysis and security assessment framework. According to Apple's documentation
  for bundle ID's, it must contain only alphanumeric characters (A–Z, a–z, and 0–9), hyphens
  (-), and periods (.). However, an attacker can manually modify this value in the `Info.plist`
  file and add special characters to the `<key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>` value. When the application
  parses the wrong characters in the bundle ID, it encounters an error. As a result, it will
  not display content and will throw a 500 error instead. The only way to make the pages work
  again is to manually remove the malicious application from the system. This issue has been
  addressed in version 4.3.1 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
  for this vulnerability.
