aliases: []
summary: 'A privilege escalation attack was found in apport-cli 2.26.0 and earlier which is
  similar to CVE-2023-26604. If a system is specially configured to allow unprivileged users
  to run sudo apport-cli, less is configured as the pager, and the terminal size can be set:
  a local attacker can escalate privilege. It is extremely unlikely that a system administrator
  would configure sudo to allow unprivileged users to perform this class of exploit.'
