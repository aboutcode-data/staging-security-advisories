aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Cisco Aironet Access Points (APs) could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) on an affected device. The vulnerability
  is due to improper resource management while processing specific packets. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted UDP packets to a specific port on
  an affected device. A successful exploit could either allow the attacker to tear down the
  connection between the AP and the wireless LAN controller, resulting in the affected device
  not being able to process client traffic, or cause the vulnerable device to reload, triggering
  a DoS condition. After the attack, the affected device should automatically recover its normal
  functions without manual intervention.
