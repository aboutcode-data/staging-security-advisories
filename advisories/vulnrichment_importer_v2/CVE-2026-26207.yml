aliases: []
summary: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Prior to versions 2025.12.2, 2026.1.1,
  and 2026.2.0, `discourse-policy` plugin allows any authenticated user to interact with policies
  on posts they do not have permission to view. The `PolicyController` loads posts by ID without
  verifying the current user's access, enabling policy group members to accept/unaccept policies
  on posts in private categories or PMs they cannot see and any authenticated user to enumerate
  which post IDs have policies attached via differentiated error responses (information disclosure).
  The issue is patched in versions 2025.12.2, 2026.1.1, and 2026.2.0 by adding a `guardian.can_see?(@post)`
  check in the `set_post` before_action, ensuring post visibility is verified before any policy
  action is processed. As a workaround, disabling the discourse-policy plugin (`policy_enabled
  = false`) eliminates the vulnerability. There is no other workaround without upgrading.
