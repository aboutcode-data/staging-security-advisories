aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the TCP ingress handler for the data interfaces that are configured
  with management access to Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to cause an increase in CPU and memory usage, resulting in a denial of service
  (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to insufficient ingress TCP rate limiting for TCP
  ports 22 (SSH) and 443 (HTTPS). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a
  crafted, steady stream of TCP traffic to port 22 or 443 on the data interfaces that are configured
  with management access to the affected device.
