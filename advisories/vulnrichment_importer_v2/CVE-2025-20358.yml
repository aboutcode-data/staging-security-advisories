aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the Contact Center Express (CCX) Editor application of Cisco Unified\
  \ CCX could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and obtain\
  \ administrative permissions pertaining to script creation and execution.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability\
  \ is due to improper authentication mechanisms in the communication between the CCX Editor\
  \ and an affected Unified CCX server. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by redirecting\
  \ the authentication flow to a malicious server and tricking the CCX Editor into believing\
  \ the authentication was successful. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to create\
  \ and execute arbitrary scripts on the underlying operating system of an affected Unified\
  \ CCX server, as an internal non-root user account."
