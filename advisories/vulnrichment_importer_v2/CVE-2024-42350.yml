aliases: []
summary: 'Biscuit is an authorization token with decentralized verification, offline attenuation
  and strong security policy enforcement based on a logic language. Third-party blocks can be
  generated without transferring the whole token to the third-party authority. Instead, a `ThirdPartyBlock`
  request can be sent, providing only the necessary info to generate a third-party block and
  to sign it: 1. the public key of the previous block (used in the signature), 2. the public
  keys part of the token symbol table (for public key interning in datalog expressions). A third-part
  block request forged by a malicious user can trick the third-party authority into generating
  datalog trusting the wrong keypair. Tokens with third-party blocks containing `trusted` annotations
  generated through a third party block request. This has been addressed in version 4 of the
  specification. Users are advised to update their implementations to conform. There are no
  known workarounds for this vulnerability.'
