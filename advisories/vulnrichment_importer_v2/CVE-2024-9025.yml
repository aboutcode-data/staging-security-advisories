aliases: []
summary: The Sight – Professional Image Gallery and Portfolio plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the 'handler_post_title'
  function in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to expose private, pending, trashed, and draft post titles. Successful exploitation
  requires the Elementor plugin to be installed and activated.
