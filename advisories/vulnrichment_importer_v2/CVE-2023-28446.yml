aliases: []
summary: Deno is a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses
  V8 and is built in Rust. Arbitrary program names without any ANSI filtering allows any malicious
  program to clear the first 2 lines of a `op_spawn_child` or `op_kill` prompt and replace it
  with any desired text. This works with any command on the respective platform, giving the
  program the full ability to choose what program they wanted to run. This problem can not be
  exploited on systems that do not attach an interactive prompt (for example headless servers).
  This issue has been patched in version 1.31.2.
