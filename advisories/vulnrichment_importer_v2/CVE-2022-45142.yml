aliases: []
summary: The fix for CVE-2022-3437 included changing memcmp to be constant time and a workaround
  for a compiler bug by adding "!= 0" comparisons to the result of memcmp. When these patches
  were backported to the heimdal-7.7.1 and heimdal-7.8.0 branches (and possibly other branches)
  a logic inversion sneaked in causing the validation of message integrity codes in gssapi/arcfour
  to be inverted.
