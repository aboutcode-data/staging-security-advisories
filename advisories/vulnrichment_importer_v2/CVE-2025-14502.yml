aliases: []
summary: The News and Blog Designer Bundle plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File
  Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.1 via the template parameter. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary .php files on the
  server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass
  access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where .php file
  types can be uploaded and included.
