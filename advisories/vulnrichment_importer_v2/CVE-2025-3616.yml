aliases: []
summary: The Greenshift – animation and page builder blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the gspb_make_proxy_api_request()
  function in versions 11.4 to 11.4.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
  Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server
  which may make remote code execution possible. The arbitrary file upload was sufficiently
  patched in 11.4.5, but a capability check was added in 11.4.6 to properly prevent unauthorized
  limited file uploads.
