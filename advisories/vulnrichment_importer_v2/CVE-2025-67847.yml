summary: A flaw was found in Moodle. An attacker with access to the restore interface could
  trigger server-side execution of arbitrary code. This is due to insufficient validation of
  restore input, which leads to unintended interpretation by core restore routines. Successful
  exploitation could result in a full compromise of the Moodle application.
