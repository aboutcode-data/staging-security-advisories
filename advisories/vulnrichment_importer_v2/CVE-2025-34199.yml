aliases: []
summary: 'Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host versions prior to 22.0.1049
  and Application versions prior to 20.0.2786 (VA and SaaS deployments) contain insecure defaults
  and code patterns that disable TLS/SSL certificate verification for communications to printers
  and internal microservices. In multiple places, the application sets libcurl/PHP transport
  options such that CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST and CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER are effectively disabled,
  and environment variables (for example API_*_VERIFYSSL=false) are used to turn off verification
  for gateway and microservice endpoints. As a result, the client accepts TLS connections without
  validating server certificates (and, in some cases, uses clear-text HTTP), permitting on-path
  attackers to perform man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. An attacker able to intercept network
  traffic between the product and printers or microservices can eavesdrop on and modify sensitive
  data (including print jobs, configuration, and authentication tokens), inject malicious payloads,
  or disrupt service. This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2024-024 —
  Insecure Communication to Printers & Microservices.'
