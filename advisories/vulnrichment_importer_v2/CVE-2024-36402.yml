aliases: []
summary: Matrix Media Repo (MMR) is a highly configurable multi-homeserver media repository
  for Matrix. MMR before version 1.3.5 allows, by design, unauthenticated remote participants
  to trigger a download and caching of remote media from a remote homeserver to the local media
  repository. Such content then also becomes available for download from the local homeserver
  in an unauthenticated way. The implication is that unauthenticated remote adversaries can
  use this functionality to plant problematic content into the media repository. MMR 1.3.5 introduces
  a partial mitigation in the form of new endpoints which require authentication for media downloads.
  The unauthenticated endpoints will be frozen in a future release, closing the attack vector.
  Though extremely limited, server operators can use more strict rate limits based on IP address
  as a partial workaround.
