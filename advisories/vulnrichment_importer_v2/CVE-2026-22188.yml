aliases: []
summary: Panda3D versions up to and including 1.10.16 deploy-stub contains a denial of service
  vulnerability due to unbounded stack allocation. The deploy-stub executable allocates argv_copy
  and argv_copy2 using alloca() based directly on the attacker-controlled argc value without
  validation. Supplying a large number of command-line arguments can exhaust stack space and
  propagate uninitialized stack memory into Python interpreter initialization, resulting in
  a reliable crash and undefined behavior.
