aliases: []
summary: 'PyMdown Extensions is a set of extensions for the `Python-Markdown` markdown project.
  In affected versions an arbitrary file read is possible when using include file syntax. By
  using the syntax `--8<--"/etc/passwd"` or `--8<--"/proc/self/environ"` the content of these
  files will be rendered in the generated documentation. Additionally, a path relative to a
  specified, allowed base path can also be used to render the content of a file outside the
  specified base paths: `--8<-- "../../../../etc/passwd"`. Within the Snippets extension, there
  exists a `base_path` option but the implementation is vulnerable to Directory Traversal. The
  vulnerable section exists in `get_snippet_path(self, path)` lines 155 to 174 in snippets.py.
  Any readable file on the host where the plugin is executing may have its content exposed.
  This can impact any use of Snippets that exposes the use of Snippets to external users. It
  is never recommended to use Snippets to process user-facing, dynamic content. It is designed
  to process known content on the backend under the control of the host, but if someone were
  to accidentally enable it for user-facing content, undesired information could be exposed.
  This issue has been addressed in version 10.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable
  to upgrade may restrict relative paths by filtering input.'
