aliases: []
summary: "When running the AWS Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (SAM CLI)\
  \ build process with Docker and symlinks are included in the build files, the container environment\
  \ allows a user to access privileged files on the host by leveraging the elevated permissions\
  \ granted to the tool. A user could leverage the elevated permissions to access restricted\
  \ files via symlinks and copy them to a more permissive location on the container. \n\nUsers\
  \ should upgrade to v1.133.0 or newer and ensure any forked or derivative code is patched\
  \ to incorporate the new fixes."
