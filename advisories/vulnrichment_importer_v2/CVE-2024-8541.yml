aliases: []
summary: The Discount Rules for WooCommerce – Create Smart WooCommerce Coupons & Discounts,
  Bulk Discount, BOGO Coupons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  due to the use of add_query_arg without appropriate escaping on the URL in all versions up
  to, and including, 2.6.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary
  web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a site administrator into
  performing an action such as clicking on a link. Please note that this is only exploitable
  when the 'Leave a Review' notice is present, which occurs after 100 orders are made and disappears
  after a user dismisses the notice.
