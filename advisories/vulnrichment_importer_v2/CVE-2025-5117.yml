aliases: []
summary: The Property plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to a missing
  capability check on the use of the property_package_user_role metadata in versions 1.0.5 to
  1.0.6. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author‐level access and above,
  to elevate their privileges to that of an administrator by creating a package post whose property_package_user_role
  is set to administrator and then submitting the PayPal registration form.
