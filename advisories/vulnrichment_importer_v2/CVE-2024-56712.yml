  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  udmabuf: fix memory leak on last export_udmabuf() error path

  In export_udmabuf(), if dma_buf_fd() fails because the FD table is full, a
  dma_buf owning the udmabuf has already been created; but the error handling
  in udmabuf_create() will tear down the udmabuf without doing anything about
  the containing dma_buf.

  This leaves a dma_buf in memory that contains a dangling pointer; though
  that doesn't seem to lead to anything bad except a memory leak.

  Fix it by moving the dma_buf_fd() call out of export_udmabuf() so that we
  can give it different error handling.

  Note that the shape of this code changed a lot in commit 5e72b2b41a21
  ("udmabuf: convert udmabuf driver to use folios"); but the memory leak
  seems to have existed since the introduction of udmabuf.
