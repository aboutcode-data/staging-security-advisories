aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in the skupper console,  a read-only interface that renders cluster
  network, traffic details, and metrics for a network application that a user sets up across
  a hybrid multi-cloud environment. When the default authentication method is used, a random
  password is generated for the "admin" user and is persisted in either a Kubernetes secret
  or a podman volume in a plaintext file. This authentication method can be manipulated by an
  attacker, leading to the reading of any user-readable file in the container filesystem, directly
  impacting data confidentiality. Additionally, the attacker may induce skupper to read extremely
  large files into memory, resulting in resource exhaustion and a denial of service attack.
