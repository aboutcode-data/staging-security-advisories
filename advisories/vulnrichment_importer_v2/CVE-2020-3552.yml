summary: A vulnerability in the Ethernet packet handling of Cisco Aironet Access Points (APs)
  Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS)
  condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting as a wired client to the Ethernet
  interface of an affected device and sending a series of specific packets within a short time
  frame. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a NULL pointer access that results
  in a reload of the affected device.
