summary: 'A vulnerability in the NX-API feature of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system.
  This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the NX-API on an affected device.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the NX-API to follow
  a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions
  with the privilege level of the affected user. The attacker could view and modify the device
  configuration. Note: The NX-API feature is disabled by default.'
