aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the client application for iOS of Cisco Webex Teams could allow
  an authenticated, remote attacker to upload arbitrary files within the scope of the iOS application.
  The vulnerability is due to improper input validation in the client application. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious file to a targeted user and persuading
  the user to manually open it. An exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite sensitive application
  files and eventually cause a denial of service (DoS) condition by foreclosing future access
  to the system to the targeted user. This vulnerability is fixed in version 3.13.26920.
