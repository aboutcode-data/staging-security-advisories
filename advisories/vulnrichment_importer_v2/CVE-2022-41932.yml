aliases: []
summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications
  built on top of it. It's possible to make XWiki create many new schemas and fill them with
  tables just by using a crafted user identifier in the login form. This may lead to degraded
  database performance. The problem has been patched in XWiki 13.10.8, 14.6RC1 and 14.4.2. Users
  are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
