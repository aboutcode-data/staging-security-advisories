  Business 200, 300, and 500 Series Managed Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote
  attacker to cause a memory corruption on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper
  validation of HTTPS packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed
  HTTPS packet to the management web interface of the affected device. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected reload of the device, resulting in a denial
