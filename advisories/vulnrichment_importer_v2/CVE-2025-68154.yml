aliases: []
summary: systeminformation is a System and OS information library for node.js. In versions prior
  to 5.27.14, the `fsSize()` function in systeminformation is vulnerable to OS command injection
  on Windows systems. The optional `drive` parameter is directly concatenated into a PowerShell
  command without sanitization, allowing arbitrary command execution when user-controlled input
  reaches this function. The actual exploitability depends on how applications use this function.
  If an application does not pass user-controlled input to `fsSize()`, it is not vulnerable.
  Version 5.27.14 contains a patch.
