aliases: []
summary: LiveBOS, an object-oriented business architecture middleware suite developed by Apex
  Software Co., Ltd., contains an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in its UploadFile.do;.js.jsp
  endpoint. This flaw affects the LiveBOS Server component and allows unauthenticated remote
  attackers to upload crafted files outside the intended directory structure via path traversal
  in the filename parameter. Successful exploitation may lead to remote code execution on the
  server, enabling full system compromise. The vulnerability is presumed to affect builds released
  prior to August 2024 and is said to be remediated in newer versions of the product, though
  the exact affected range remains undefined. Exploitation evidence was first observed by the
  Shadowserver Foundation on 2024-08-23 UTC.
