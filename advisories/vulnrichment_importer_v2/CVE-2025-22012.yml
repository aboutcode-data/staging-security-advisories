summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  Revert "arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845: Affirm IDR0.CCTW on apps_smmu"

  There are reports that the pagetable walker cache coherency is not a
  given across the spectrum of SDM845/850 devices, leading to lock-ups
  and resets. It works fine on some devices (like the Dragonboard 845c,
  but not so much on the Lenovo Yoga C630).

  This unfortunately looks like a fluke in firmware development, where
  likely somewhere in the vast hypervisor stack, a change to accommodate
  for this was only introduced after the initial software release (which
  often serves as a baseline for products).

  Revert the change to avoid additional guesswork around crashes.

  This reverts commit 6b31a9744b8726c69bb0af290f8475a368a4b805.
