aliases: []
summary: "Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. \n\nStarting\
  \ with the 8.1 branch, Grafana had a stored XSS vulnerability affecting the core plugin GeoMap.\
  \ \n\nThe stored XSS vulnerability was possible due to map attributions weren't properly sanitized\
  \ and allowed arbitrary JavaScript to be executed in the context of the currently authorized\
  \ user of the Grafana instance. \n\nAn attacker needs to have the Editor role in order to\
  \ change a panel to include a map attribution containing JavaScript. \n\nThis means that vertical\
  \ privilege escalation is possible, where a user with Editor role can change to a known password\
  \ for a user having Admin role if the user with Admin role executes malicious JavaScript viewing\
  \ a dashboard. \n\nUsers may upgrade to version 8.5.21, 9.2.13 and 9.3.8 to receive a fix."
