summary: 'The Blockspare: Gutenberg Blocks & Patterns for Blogs, Magazines, Business Sites –
  Post Grids, Sliders, Carousels, Counters, Page Builder & Starter Site Imports, No Coding Needed
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters in
  the ‘blockspare_render_social_sharing_block’ function in all versions up to, and including,

  authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web
  scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.'
