summary: StreamVault is a multi-platform video parsing and downloading tool. Prior to version

  construct malicious commands, execute command injection attacks against the system, and ultimately

  modified their background passwords or use weak passwords are at risk of having their systems
  taken over via remote command execution. This issue has been patched in version 250822.
