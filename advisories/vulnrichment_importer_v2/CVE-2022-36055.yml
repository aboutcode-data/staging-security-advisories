aliases: []
summary: Helm is a tool for managing Charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes
  resources. Fuzz testing, provided by the CNCF, identified input to functions in the _strvals_
  package that can cause an out of memory panic. The _strvals_ package contains a parser that
  turns strings in to Go structures. The _strvals_ package converts these strings into structures
  Go can work with. Some string inputs can cause array data structures to be created causing
  an out of memory panic. Applications that use the _strvals_ package in the Helm SDK to parse
  user supplied input can suffer a Denial of Service when that input causes a panic that cannot
  be recovered from. The Helm Client will panic with input to `--set`, `--set-string`, and other
  value setting flags that causes an out of memory panic. Helm is not a long running service
  so the panic will not affect future uses of the Helm client. This issue has been resolved
  in 3.9.4. SDK users can validate strings supplied by users won't create large arrays causing
  significant memory usage before passing them to the _strvals_ functions.
