aliases: []
summary: 'The Flex Store Users plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.1.0. This is due to the ''fsUserHandle::signup'' and
  the ''fsSellerRole::add_role_seller'' functions not restricting what user roles a user can
  register with. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to supply the ''administrator''
  role during registration and gain administrator access to the site. Note: The vulnerability
  can be exploited with the ''fs_type'' parameter if the Flex Store Seller plugin is also activated.'
