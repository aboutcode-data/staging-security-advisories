aliases: []
summary: authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Prior to versions 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2,
  when the default admin user has been deleted, it is potentially possible for an attacker to
  set the password of the default admin user without any authentication. authentik uses a blueprint
  to create the default admin user, which can also optionally set the default admin users' password
  from an environment variable. When the user is deleted, the `initial-setup` flow used to configure
  authentik after the first installation becomes available again. authentik 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2
  fix this issue. As a workaround, ensure the default admin user (Username `akadmin`) exists
  and has a password set. It is recommended to use a very strong password for this user, and
  store it in a secure location like a password manager. It is also possible to deactivate the
  user to prevent any logins as akadmin.
