summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Collaboration\
  \ Deployment could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting\
  \ attack against a user of the interface.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the web-based\
  \ management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit\
  \ this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful\
  \ exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the\
  \ affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.\r\nCisco plans to release\
  \ software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address\
  \ this vulnerability."
