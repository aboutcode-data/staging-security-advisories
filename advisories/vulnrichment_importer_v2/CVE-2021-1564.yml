aliases: []
summary: 'Multiple vulnerabilities in the implementation of the Cisco Discovery Protocol and
  Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) for Cisco Video Surveillance 7000 Series IP Cameras could
  allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a memory leak, which could lead to a
  denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. These vulnerabilities are due to
  incorrect processing of certain Cisco Discovery Protocol and LLDP packets at ingress time.
  An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol
  or LLDP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause
  the affected device to continuously consume memory, which could cause the device to crash
  and reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: Cisco Discovery Protocol and LLDP are Layer
  2 protocols. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain
  as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).'
