aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the implementation of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Message Digest
  5 (MD5) authentication in Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to bypass MD5 authentication and establish a BGP connection with the device. The vulnerability
  occurs because the BGP MD5 authentication is bypassed if the peer does not have MD5 authentication
  configured, the NX-OS device does have BGP MD5 authentication configured, and the NX-OS BGP
  virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) name is configured to be greater than 19 characters.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to establish a BGP session with
  the NX-OS peer. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to establish a BGP session with
  the NX-OS device without MD5 authentication. The Cisco implementation of the BGP protocol
  accepts incoming BGP traffic only from explicitly configured peers. To exploit this vulnerability,
  an attacker must send the malicious packets over a TCP connection that appears to come from
  a trusted BGP peer. To do so, the attacker must obtain information about the BGP peers in
  the affected system&rsquo;s trusted network.
