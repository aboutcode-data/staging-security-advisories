summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco&nbsp;PI and Cisco&nbsp;EPNM\
  \ could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct an XSS attack against a user\
  \ of the interface of an affected device.\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the web-based\
  \ management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit\
  \ this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to click a crafted link.\
  \ A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context\
  \ of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.Cisco&nbsp;has\
  \ released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that\
  \ address these vulnerabilities."
