aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Secure Configuration Validation functionality of Cisco FXOS
  Software and Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to run arbitrary
  commands at system boot time with the privileges of root. The vulnerability is due to a lack
  of proper validation of system files when the persistent configuration information is read
  from the file system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the
  device and overwriting the persistent configuration storage with malicious executable files.
  An exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands at system startup and those
  commands will run as the root user. The attacker must have valid administrative credentials
  for the device.
