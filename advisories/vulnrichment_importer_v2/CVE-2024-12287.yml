aliases: []
summary: The Biagiotti Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying
  a user's identity prior to authenticating them. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to log in as other users, such as administrators, granted they have access to an
  email.
