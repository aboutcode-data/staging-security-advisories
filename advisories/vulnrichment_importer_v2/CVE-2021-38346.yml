aliases: []
summary: The Brizy Page Builder plugin <= 2.3.11 for WordPress allowed authenticated users to
  upload executable files to a location of their choice using the brizy_create_block_screenshot
  AJAX action. The file would be named using the id parameter, which could be prepended with
  "../" to perform directory traversal, and the file contents were populated via the ibsf parameter,
  which would be base64-decoded and written to the file. While the plugin added a .jpg extension
  to all uploaded filenames, a double extension attack was still possible, e.g. a file named
  shell.php would be saved as shell.php.jpg, and would be executable on a number of common configurations.
