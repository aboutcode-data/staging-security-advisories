aliases: []
summary: CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security
  Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running
  the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. Prior to version 1.4.3, the cryptography_encrypt()
  function allocates multiple buffers for HTTP requests and JSON parsing that are never freed
  on any code path. Each call leaks approximately 400 bytes of memory. Sustained traffic can
  gradually exhaust available memory. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.3.
