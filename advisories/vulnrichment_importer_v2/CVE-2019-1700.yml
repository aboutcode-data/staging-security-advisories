aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in field-programmable gate array (FPGA) ingress buffer management
  for the Cisco Firepower 9000 Series with the Cisco Firepower 2-port 100G double-width network
  module (PID: FPR9K-DNM-2X100G) could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause
  a denial of service (DoS) condition. Manual intervention may be required before a device will
  resume normal operations. The vulnerability is due to a logic error in the FPGA related to
  the processing of different types of input packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by being on the adjacent subnet and sending a crafted sequence of input packets to a specific
  interface on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a
  queue wedge condition on the interface. When a wedge occurs, the affected device will stop
  processing any additional packets that are received on the wedged interface. Version 2.2 is
  affected.'
