aliases: []
summary: Sylius is an open source eCommerce platform. Prior to versions 1.10.11 and 1.11.2,
  the reset password token was not set to null after the password was changed. The same token
  could be used several times, which could result in leak of the existing token and unauthorized
  password change. The issue is fixed in versions 1.10.11 and 1.11.2. As a workaround, overwrite
  the `Sylius\Bundle\ApiBundle\CommandHandler\ResetPasswordHandler` class with code provided
  by the maintainers and register it in a container. More information about this workaround
  is available in the GitHub Security Advisory.
