  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/amd/display: Fix potential memory leak in DMUB hw_init

  [Why]
  On resume we perform DMUB hw_init which allocates memory:
  dm_resume->dm_dmub_hw_init->dc_dmub_srv_create->kzalloc
  That results in memory leak in suspend/resume scenarios.

  [How]
  Allocate memory for the DC wrapper to DMUB only if it was not
  allocated before.
  No need to reallocate it on suspend/resume.
