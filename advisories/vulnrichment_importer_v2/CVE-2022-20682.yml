aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP)
  protocol processing of Cisco IOS XE Wireless Controller Software for the Catalyst 9000 Family
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition
  on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to inadequate input validation of incoming
  CAPWAP packets encapsulating multicast DNS (mDNS) queries. An attacker could exploit this
  vulnerability by connecting to a wireless network and sending a crafted mDNS query, which
  would flow through and be processed by the wireless controller. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to cause the affected device to crash and reload, resulting in a DoS condition.
