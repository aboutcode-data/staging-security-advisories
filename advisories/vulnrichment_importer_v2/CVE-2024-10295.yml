aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in Gateway. Sending a non-base64 'basic' auth with special characters
  can cause APICast to incorrectly authenticate a request. A malformed basic authentication
  header containing special characters bypasses authentication and allows unauthorized access
  to the backend. This issue can occur due to a failure in the base64 decoding process, which
  causes APICast to skip the rest of the authentication checks and proceed with routing the
  request upstream.
