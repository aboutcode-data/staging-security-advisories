aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Kerberos authentication feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance
  (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to impersonate the Kerberos
  key distribution center (KDC) and bypass authentication on an affected device that is configured
  to perform Kerberos authentication for VPN or local device access. The vulnerability is due
  to insufficient identity verification of the KDC when a successful authentication response
  is received. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by spoofing the KDC server response
  to the ASA device. This malicious response would not have been authenticated by the KDC. A
  successful attack could allow an attacker to bypass Kerberos authentication.
