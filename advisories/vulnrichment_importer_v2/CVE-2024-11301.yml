datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2024-11301
datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2024/11xxx/CVE-2024-11301.json
aliases: []
summary: In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, the application allows the creation of evaluators
  without enforcing a unique constraint on the combination of projectId and slug. This allows
  an attacker to overwrite existing data by submitting a POST request with the same slug as
  an existing evaluator. The lack of database constraints or application-layer validation to
  prevent duplicates exposes the application to data integrity issues. This vulnerability can
  result in corrupted data and potentially malicious actions, impairing the system's functionality.
