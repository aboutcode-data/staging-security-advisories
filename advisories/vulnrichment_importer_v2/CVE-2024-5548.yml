aliases: []
summary: A directory traversal vulnerability exists in the stitionai/devika repository, specifically
  within the /api/download-project endpoint. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating
  the 'project_name' parameter in a GET request to download arbitrary files from the system.
  This issue affects the latest version of the repository. The vulnerability arises due to insufficient
  input validation in the 'download_project' function, allowing attackers to traverse the directory
  structure and access files outside the intended directory. This could lead to unauthorized
  access to sensitive files on the server.
