aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a command injection attack and elevate privileges
  to root. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation for specific API endpoints.
  An attacker in a man-in-the-middle position could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting
  and modifying specific internode communications from one ISE persona to another ISE persona.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands with root privileges
  on the underlying operating system. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need
  to decrypt HTTPS traffic between two ISE personas that are located on separate nodes.
