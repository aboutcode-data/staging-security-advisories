summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ipv6: fix possible UAF in ip6_finish_output2()

  If skb_expand_head() returns NULL, skb has been freed
  and associated dst/idev could also have been freed.

  We need to hold rcu_read_lock() to make sure the dst and
  associated idev are alive.
