summary: Group-Office is an enterprise customer relationship management and groupware tool.
  Prior to versions 6.8.150, 25.0.82, and 26.0.5, there is a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability
  in Group-Office. The endpoint email/message/tnefAttachmentFromTempFile directly concatenates
  the user-controlled parameter tmp_file into an exec() call. By injecting shell metacharacters
  into tmp_file, an authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server.
  This issue has been patched in versions 6.8.150, 25.0.82, and 26.0.5.
