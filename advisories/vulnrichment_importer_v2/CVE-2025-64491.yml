aliases: []
summary: SuiteCRM is an open-source, enterprise-ready Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
  software application. Versions 7.14.7 and below allow unauthenticated reflected Cross-Site
  Scripting (XSS). Successful exploitation could lead to full account takeover, for example
  by altering the login form to send credentials to an attacker-controlled server. As a reflected
  XSS issue, exploitation requires the victim to open a crafted malicious link, which can be
  delivered via phishing, social media, or other communication channels. This issue is fixed
  in version 7.14.8.
