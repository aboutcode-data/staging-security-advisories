aliases: []
summary: Flask-AppBuilder is an application development framework, built on top of Flask. When
  Flask-AppBuilder is set to AUTH_TYPE AUTH_OID, it allows an attacker to forge an HTTP request,
  that could deceive the backend into using any requested OpenID service. This vulnerability
  could grant an attacker unauthorised privilege access if a custom OpenID service is deployed
  by the attacker and accessible by the backend. This vulnerability is only exploitable when
  the application is using the OpenID 2.0 authorization protocol. Upgrade to Flask-AppBuilder
  4.3.11 to fix the vulnerability.
