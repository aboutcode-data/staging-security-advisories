aliases: []
summary: OpenSearch Dashboards Reports allows ‘Report Owner’ export and share reports from OpenSearch
  Dashboards. An issue in the OpenSearch reporting plugin allows unintended access to private
  tenant resources like notebooks. The system did not properly check if the user was the resource
  author when accessing resources in a private tenant, leading to potential data being revealed.
  The patches are included in OpenSearch 2.14.
