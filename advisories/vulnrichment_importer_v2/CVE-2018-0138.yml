summary: 'A vulnerability in the detection engine of Cisco Firepower System Software could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass file policies that are configured to block files
  transmitted to an affected device via the BitTorrent protocol. The vulnerability exists because
  the affected software does not detect BitTorrent handshake messages correctly. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted BitTorrent connection request to an
  affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass file policies that
  are configured to block files transmitted to the affected device via the BitTorrent protocol.
