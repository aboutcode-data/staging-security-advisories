aliases: []
summary: A session fixation issue was discovered in the NGINX OpenID Connect reference implementation,
  where a nonce was not checked at login time. This flaw allows an attacker to fix a victim's
  session to an attacker-controlled account. As a result, although the attacker cannot log in
  as the victim, they can force the session to associate it with the attacker-controlled account,
  leading to potential misuse of the victim's session.
