aliases: []
summary: yt-grabber-tui is a terminal user interface application for downloading videos. In
  versions before 1.0-rc, the application allows users to configure the path to the yt-dlp executable
  via the path_to_yt_dlp configuration setting. An attacker with write access to the configuration
  file or the filesystem location of the configured executable can replace the executable with
  malicious code or create a symlink to an arbitrary executable. When the application invokes
  yt-dlp, the malicious code is executed with the privileges of the user running yt-grabber-tui.
  This vulnerability has been patched in version 1.0-rc.
