aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) server component of
  Cisco Expressway software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass security
  controls and send network traffic to restricted destinations. The vulnerability is due to
  improper validation of specific connection information by the TURN server within the affected
  software. An attacker could exploit this issue by sending specially crafted network traffic
  to the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send traffic through
  the affected software to destinations beyond the application, possibly allowing the attacker
  to gain unauthorized network access.
