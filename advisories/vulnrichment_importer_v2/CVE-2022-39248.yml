aliases: []
summary: matrix-android-sdk2 is the Matrix SDK for Android. Prior to version 1.5.1, an attacker
  cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages that legitimately appear to
  have come from another person, without any indication such as a grey shield. Additionally,
  a sophisticated attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver could employ this vulnerability
  to perform a targeted attack in order to send fake to-device messages appearing to originate
  from another user. This can allow, for example, to inject the key backup secret during a self-verification,
  to make a targeted device start using a malicious key backup spoofed by the homeserver. matrix-android-sdk2
  would then additionally sign such a key backup with its device key, spilling trust over to
  other devices trusting the matrix-android-sdk2 device. These attacks are possible due to a
  protocol confusion vulnerability that accepts to-device messages encrypted with Megolm instead
  of Olm. matrix-android-sdk2 version 1.5.1 has been modified to only accept Olm-encrypted to-device
  messages and to stop signing backups on a successful decryption. Out of caution, several other
  checks have been audited or added. This attack requires coordination between a malicious home
  server and an attacker, so those who trust their home servers do not need a workaround.
