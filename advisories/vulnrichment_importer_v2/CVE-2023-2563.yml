summary: The WordPress Contact Forms by Cimatti plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.5.7. This is due to missing or incorrect

  unauthenticated attackers to delete forms created with this plugin via a forged request granted
  they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
