aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the implementation of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) functionality
  in Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial
  of service (DoS) condition on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing
  of certain BGP update messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending BGP
  update messages that include a specific set of attributes to be processed by an affected system.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the BGP process to restart unexpectedly,
  resulting in a DoS condition. The Cisco implementation of BGP accepts incoming BGP traffic
  from explicitly defined peers only. To exploit this vulnerability, the malicious BGP update
  message would need to come from a configured, valid BGP peer or would need to be injected
  by the attacker into the victim's BGP network on an existing, valid TCP connection to a BGP
  peer.
