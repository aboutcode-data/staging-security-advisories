aliases: []
summary: 'Orchid is a @laravel package that allows for rapid application development of back-office
  applications, admin/user panels, and dashboards. This vulnerability is a method exposure issue
  (CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function) in the Orchid Platform’s asynchronous modal
  functionality, affecting users of Orchid Platform version 8 through 14.42.x. Attackers could
  exploit this vulnerability to call arbitrary methods within the `Screen` class, leading to
  potential brute force of database tables, validation checks against user credentials, and
  disclosure of the server’s real IP address. The issue has been patched in the latest release,
  version 14.43.0, released on November 6, 2024. Users should upgrade to version 14.43.0 or
  later to address this vulnerability. If upgrading to version 14.43.0 is not immediately possible,
  users can mitigate the vulnerability by implementing middleware to intercept and validate
  requests to asynchronous modal endpoints, allowing only approved methods and parameters.'
