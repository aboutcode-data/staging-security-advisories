  cfg80211: fix race in netlink owner interface destruction

  My previous fix here to fix the deadlock left a race where
  the exact same deadlock (see the original commit referenced
  below) can still happen if cfg80211_destroy_ifaces() already
  runs while nl80211_netlink_notify() is still marking some
  interfaces as nl_owner_dead.

  The race happens because we have two loops here - first we
  dev_close() all the netdevs, and then we destroy them. If we
  also have two netdevs (first one need only be a wdev though)
  then we can find one during the first iteration, close it,
  and go to the second iteration -- but then find two, and try
  to destroy also the one we didn't close yet.

  Fix this by only iterating once.
