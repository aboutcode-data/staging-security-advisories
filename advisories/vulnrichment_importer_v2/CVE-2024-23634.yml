aliases: []
summary: GeoServer is an open source software server written in Java that allows users to share
  and edit geospatial data. An arbitrary file renaming vulnerability exists in versions prior
  to 2.23.5 and 2.24.2 that enables an authenticated administrator with permissions to modify
  stores through the REST Coverage Store or Data Store API to rename arbitrary files and directories
  with a name that does not end in `.zip`. Store file uploads rename zip files to have a `.zip`
  extension if it doesn't already have one before unzipping the file.  This is fine for file
  and url upload methods where the files will be in a specific subdirectory of the data directory
  but, when using the external upload method, this allows arbitrary files and directories to
  be renamed. Renaming GeoServer files will most likely result in a denial of service, either
  completely preventing GeoServer from running or effectively deleting specific resources (such
  as a workspace, layer or style).  In some cases, renaming GeoServer files could revert to
  the default settings for that file which could be relatively harmless like removing contact
  information or have more serious consequences like allowing users to make OGC requests that
  the customized settings would have prevented them from making. The impact of renaming non-GeoServer
  files depends on the specific environment although some sort of denial of service is a likely
  outcome. Versions 2.23.5 and 2.24.2 contain a fix for this issue.
