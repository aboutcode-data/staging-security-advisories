aliases: []
summary: The Conditional Fields for Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.4.13. This is due to missing or incorrect
  nonce validation on the wpcf7cf_admin_init function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to reset the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site
  administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
