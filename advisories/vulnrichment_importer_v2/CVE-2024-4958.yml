aliases: []
summary: The User Registration – Custom Registration Form, Login Form, and User Profile WordPress
  Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing
  capability check on the 'import_form_action' function in versions up to, and including, 3.2.0.1.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and
  above, to import a registration form with a default user role of administrator. If an administrator
  approves or publishes a post or page with the shortcode to the imported form, any user can
  register as an administrator.
