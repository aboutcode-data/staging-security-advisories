aliases: []
summary: Airflow versions before 2.10.3 have a vulnerability that allows authenticated users
  with audit log access to see sensitive values in audit logs which they should not see. When
  sensitive variables were set via airflow CLI, values of those variables appeared in the audit
  log and were stored unencrypted in the Airflow database. While this risk is limited to users
  with audit log access, it is recommended to upgrade to Airflow 2.10.3 or a later version,
  which addresses this issue. Users who previously used the CLI to set secret variables should
  manually delete entries with those variables from the log table.
