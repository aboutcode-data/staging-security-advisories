summary: 'Docker Machine through 0.16.2 allows an attacker, who has control of a worker node,
  to provide crafted version data, which might potentially trick an administrator into performing
  an unsafe action (via escape sequence injection), or might have a data size that causes a
  denial of service to a bastion node. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are
  no longer supported by the maintainer.'
