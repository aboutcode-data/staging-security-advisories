aliases: []
summary: XWiki is a generic wiki platform. When a user without script right creates a document
  with an `XWiki.Notifications.Code.NotificationEmailRendererClass` object, and later an admin
  edits and saves that document, the email templates in this object will be used for notifications.
  No malicious code can be executed, though, as while these templates allow Velocity code, the
  existing generic analyzer already warns admins before editing Velocity code. The main impact
  would thus be to send spam, e.g., with phishing links to other users or to hide notifications
  about other attacks. Note that warnings before editing documents with dangerous properties
  have only been introduced in XWiki 15.9, before that version, this was a known issue and the
  advice was simply to be careful. This has been patched in XWiki 16.10.2, 16.4.7 and 15.10.16
  by adding an analysis for the respective XClass properties.
