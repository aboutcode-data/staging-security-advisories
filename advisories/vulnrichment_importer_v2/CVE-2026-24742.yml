aliases: []
summary: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. In versions prior to 3.5.4, 2025.11.2,
  2025.12.1, and 2026.1.0, non-admin moderators can view sensitive information in staff action
  logs that should be restricted to administrators only. The exposed information includes webhook
  payload URLs and secrets, API key details, site setting changes, private message content,
  restricted category names and structures, and private chat channel titles. This allows moderators
  to bypass intended access controls and extract confidential data by monitoring the staff action
  logs. With leaked webhook secrets, an attacker could potentially spoof webhook events to integrated
  services. This issue is patched in versions 3.5.4, 2025.11.2, 2025.12.1, and 2026.1.0. As
  a workaround, site administrators should review and limit moderator appointments to fully
  trusted users. There is no configuration-based workaround to prevent this access.
