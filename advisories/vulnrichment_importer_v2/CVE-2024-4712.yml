summary: "An arbitrary file creation vulnerability exists in PaperCut NG/MF that only affects\
  \ Windows servers with Web Print enabled. This specific flaw exists within the image-handler\
  \ process, which can incorrectly create files that don’t exist when a maliciously formed payload\
  \ is provided. This can lead to local privilege escalation.\n\nNote: \n\nThis CVE has been\
  \ split into two (CVE-2024-4712 and CVE-2024-8405) and it’s been rescored with a \"Privileges\
  \ Required (PR)\" rating of low, and “Attack Complexity (AC)” rating of low, reflecting the\
  \ worst-case scenario where an Administrator has granted local login access to standard network\
  \ users on the host server."
