aliases: []
summary: sysend.js is a library that allows a user to send messages between pages that are open
  in the same browser. Users that use cross-origin communication may have their communications
  intercepted. Impact is limited by the communication occurring in the same browser. This issue
  has been patched in sysend.js version 1.10.0. The only currently known workaround is to avoid
  sending communications that a user does not want to have intercepted via sysend messages.
