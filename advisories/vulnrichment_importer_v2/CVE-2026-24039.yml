aliases: []
summary: Horilla is a free and open source Human Resource Management System (HRMS). Version
  1.4.0 has Improper Access Control, allowing low-privileged employees to self-approve documents
  they have uploaded. The document-approval UI is intended to be restricted to administrator
  or high-privilege roles only; however, an insufficient server-side authorization check on
  the approval endpoint lets a standard employee modify the approval status of their own uploaded
  document. A successful exploitation allows users with only employee-level permissions to alter
  application state reserved for administrators. This undermines the integrity of HR processes
  (for example, acceptance of credentials, certifications, or supporting materials), and may
  enable submission of unvetted documents. This issue is fixed in version 1.5.0.
