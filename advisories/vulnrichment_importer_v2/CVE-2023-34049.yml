aliases: []
summary: The Salt-SSH pre-flight option copies the script to the target at a predictable path,
  which allows an attacker to force Salt-SSH to run their script. If an attacker has access
  to the target VM and knows the path to the pre-flight script before it runs they can ensure
  Salt-SSH runs their script with the privileges of the user running Salt-SSH. Do not make the
  copy path on the target predictable and ensure we check return codes of the scp command if
  the copy fails.
