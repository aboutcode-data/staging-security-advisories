aliases: []
summary: The Photo Gallery by 10Web – Mobile-Friendly Image Gallery plugin for WordPress is
  vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG file uploads in all versions up to, and
  including, 1.8.21 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
  possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary
  web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only
  affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
