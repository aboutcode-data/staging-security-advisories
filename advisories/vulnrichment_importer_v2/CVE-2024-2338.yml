aliases: []
summary: PostgreSQL Anonymizer v1.2 contains a SQL injection vulnerability that allows a user
  who owns a table to elevate to superuser when dynamic masking is enabled. PostgreSQL Anonymizer
  enables users to set security labels on tables to mask specified columns. There is a flaw
  that allows complex expressions to be provided as a value. This expression is then later used
  as it to create the masked views leading to SQL Injection. If dynamic masking is enabled,
  this will lead to privilege escalation to superuser after the label is created. Users that
  don't own a table, especially masked users cannot exploit this vulnerability. The problem
  is resolved in v1.3.
