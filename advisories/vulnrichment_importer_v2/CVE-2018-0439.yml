summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Meeting Server could
  allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack
  and perform arbitrary actions on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker

  link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on an affected
  device by using a web browser and with the privileges of the user.
