summary: 'ydb-go-sdk is a pure Go native and database/sql driver for the YDB platform. Since
  ydb-go-sdk v3.48.6 if you use a custom credentials object (implementation of interface Credentials
  it may leak into logs. This happens because this object could be serialized into an error
  message using `fmt.Errorf("something went wrong (credentials: %q)", credentials)` during connection
  to the YDB server. If such logging occurred, a  malicious user with access to logs could read
  sensitive information (i.e. credentials) information and use it to get access to the database.
  ydb-go-sdk contains this problem in versions from v3.48.6 to v3.53.2. The fix for this problem
  has been released in version v3.53.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade
  should implement the `fmt.Stringer` interface in your custom credentials type with explicit
  stringify of object state.'
