aliases: []
summary: (conda) Constructor is a tool that enables users to create installers for conda package
  collections. In versions 3.12.2 and below, the  installation directory inherits permissions
  from its parent directory. Outside of restricted directories, the permissions are very permissive
  and often allow write access by authenticated users. Any logged in user can make modifications
  during the installation for both single-user and all-user installations. This constitutes
  a local attack vector if the installation is in a directory local users have access to. For
  single-user installations in a shared directory, these permissions persist after the installation.
  This issue is fixed in version 3.13.0.
