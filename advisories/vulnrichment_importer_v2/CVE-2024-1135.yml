aliases: []
summary: Gunicorn fails to properly validate Transfer-Encoding headers, leading to HTTP Request
  Smuggling (HRS) vulnerabilities. By crafting requests with conflicting Transfer-Encoding headers,
  attackers can bypass security restrictions and access restricted endpoints. This issue is
  due to Gunicorn's handling of Transfer-Encoding headers, where it incorrectly processes requests
  with multiple, conflicting Transfer-Encoding headers, treating them as chunked regardless
  of the final encoding specified. This vulnerability allows for a range of attacks including
  cache poisoning, session manipulation, and data exposure.
