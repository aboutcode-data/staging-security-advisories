summary: The Frontend File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Arbitrary
  Post Deletion in versions up to, and including, 18.2. This is due to lacking authentication
  protections and lacking a security nonce on the wpfm_delete_file AJAX action. This makes it
  possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete any posts and pages on the site.
