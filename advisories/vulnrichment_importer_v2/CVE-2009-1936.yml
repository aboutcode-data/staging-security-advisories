aliases: []
summary: _functions.php in cpCommerce 1.2.x, possibly including 1.2.9, sends a redirect but
  does not exit when it is called directly, which allows remote attackers to bypass a protection
  mechanism to conduct remote file inclusion and directory traversal attacks, execute arbitrary
  PHP code, or read arbitrary files via the GLOBALS[prefix] parameter, a different vector than
  CVE-2003-1500.
