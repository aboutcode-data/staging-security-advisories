aliases: []
summary: Silverpeas 6.4.2 contains a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the
  event management module. An authenticated user can upload a malicious SVG file as an event
  attachment, which, when viewed by an administrator, executes embedded JavaScript in the admin's
  session. This allows attackers to escalate privileges by creating a new administrator account.
  The vulnerability arises from insufficient sanitization of SVG files and weak CSRF protections.
