aliases: []
summary: Tophat is a mobile applications testing harness. An Improper Access Control vulnerability
  can expose the `TOPHAT_APP_TOKEN` token stored in `~/.tophatrc` through use of a malicious
  Tophat URL controlled by the attacker. The vulnerability allows Tophat to send this token
  to the attacker's server without any checks to ensure that the server is trusted. This token
  can then be used to access internal build artifacts, for mobile applications, not intended
  to be public. The issue has been patched as of version 1.10.0.  The ability to request artifacts
  using a Tophat API has been deprecated as this flow was inherently insecure.  Systems that
  have implemented this kind of endpoint should cease use and invalidate the token immediately.
  There are no workarounds and all users should update as soon as possible.
