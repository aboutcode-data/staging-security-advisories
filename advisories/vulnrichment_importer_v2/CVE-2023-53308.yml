summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: fec: Better handle pm_runtime_get() failing in .remove()

  In the (unlikely) event that pm_runtime_get() (disguised as
  pm_runtime_resume_and_get()) fails, the remove callback returned an
  error early. The problem with this is that the driver core ignores the
  error value and continues removing the device. This results in a
  resource leak. Worse the devm allocated resources are freed and so if a
  callback of the driver is called later the register mapping is already
  gone which probably results in a crash.
