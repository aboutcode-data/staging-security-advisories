summary: The Slider Responsive Slideshow – Image slider, Gallery slideshow plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.8 via deserialization
  of untrusted input to the awl_slider_responsive_shortcode function. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object.

  plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary
  files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
