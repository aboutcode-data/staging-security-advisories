aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the IP Service Level Agreement (SLA) responder feature of Cisco
  IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the IP SLA responder
  to reuse an existing port, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability
  exists because the IP SLA responder could consume a port that could be used by another feature.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific IP SLA control packets to
  the IP SLA responder on an affected device. The control packets must include the port number
  that could be used by another configured feature. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to cause an in-use port to be consumed by the IP SLA responder, impacting the feature that
  was using the port and resulting in a DoS condition.
