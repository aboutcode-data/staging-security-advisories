  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mm/damon/dbgfs: fix 'struct pid' leaks in 'dbgfs_target_ids_write()'

  DAMON debugfs interface increases the reference counts of 'struct pid's
  for targets from the 'target_ids' file write callback
  ('dbgfs_target_ids_write()'), but decreases the counts only in DAMON
  monitoring termination callback ('dbgfs_before_terminate()').

  Therefore, when 'target_ids' file is repeatedly written without DAMON
  monitoring start/termination, the reference count is not decreased and
  therefore memory for the 'struct pid' cannot be freed.  This commit
  fixes this issue by decreasing the reference counts when 'target_ids' is
  written.
