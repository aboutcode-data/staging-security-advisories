aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Secure Firewall Management\
  \ Center (FMC) Software, formerly Firepower Management Center Software, could allow an authenticated,\
  \ remote attacker to inject arbitrary HTML content into a device-generated document.\r\n\r\
  \nThis vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied data. An attacker could\
  \ exploit this vulnerability by submitting malicious content to an affected device and using\
  \ the device to generate a document that contains sensitive information. A successful exploit\
  \ could allow the attacker to alter the standard layout of the device-generated documents,\
  \ access arbitrary files from the underlying operating system, and conduct server-side request\
  \ forgery (SSRF) attacks. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need\
  \ valid credentials for a user account with policy-editing permissions, such as Network Admin,\
  \ Intrusion Admin, or any custom user role with the same capabilities."
