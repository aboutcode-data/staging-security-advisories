aliases: []
summary: The WP Simple Shopping Cart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information
  Exposure in versions up to, and including, 4.6.3 due to the plugin saving shopping cart data
  exports in a publicly accessible location (/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-simple-paypal-shopping-cart/includes/admin/).
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view information that should be limited
  to administrators only and can include data like first name, last name, email, address, IP
  Address, and more.
