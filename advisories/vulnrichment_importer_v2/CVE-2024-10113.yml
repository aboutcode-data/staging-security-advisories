summary: The WP AdCenter – Ad Manager & Adsense Ads plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
  Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's wpadcenter_ad shortcode in all versions up to, and including,
  2.5.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.

  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page.
