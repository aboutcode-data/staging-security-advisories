aliases: []
summary: Agate is central authentication server software for OBiBa epidemiology applications.
  Prior to version 3.3.0, when registering for an Agate account, arbitrary HTML code can be
  injected into a user's first and last name. This HTML is then rendered in the email sent to
  administrative users. The Agate service account sends this email and appears trustworthy,
  making this a significant risk for phishing attacks. Administrative users are impacted, as
  they can be targeted by unauthenticated users. Version 3.3.0 fixes the issue.
