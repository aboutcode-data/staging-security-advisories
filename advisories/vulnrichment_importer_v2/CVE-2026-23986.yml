aliases: []
summary: 'Copier is a library and CLI app for rendering project templates. Prior to version
  9.11.2, Copier suggests that it''s safe to generate a project from a safe template, i.e. one
  that doesn''t use unsafe features like custom Jinja extensions which would require passing
  the `--UNSAFE,--trust` flag. As it turns out, a safe template can currently write to arbitrary
  directories outside the destination path by using directory a symlink along with `_preserve_symlinks:
  true` and a generated directory structure whose rendered path is inside the symlinked directory.
  This way, a malicious template author can create a template that overwrites arbitrary files
  (according to the user''s write permissions), e.g., to cause havoc. Version 9.11.2 patches
  the issue.'
