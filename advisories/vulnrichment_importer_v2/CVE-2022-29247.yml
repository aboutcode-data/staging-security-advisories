aliases: []
summary: Electron is a framework for writing cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript
  (JS), HTML, and CSS. A vulnerability in versions prior to 18.0.0-beta.6, 17.2.0, 16.2.6, and
  15.5.5 allows a renderer with JS execution to obtain access to a new renderer process with
  `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames` enabled which in turn allows effective access to `ipcRenderer`.
  The `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames` option does not implicitly grant Node.js access. Rather,
  it depends on the existing sandbox setting. If an application is sandboxed, then `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames`
  just gives access to the sandboxed renderer APIs, which include `ipcRenderer`. If the application
  then additionally exposes IPC messages without IPC `senderFrame` validation that perform privileged
  actions or return confidential data this access to `ipcRenderer` can in turn compromise your
  application / user even with the sandbox enabled. Electron versions 18.0.0-beta.6, 17.2.0,
  16.2.6, and 15.5.5 contain a fix for this issue. As a workaround, ensure that all IPC message
  handlers appropriately validate `senderFrame`.
