aliases: []
summary: The WP Private Content Plus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to information disclosure
  in all versions up to, and including, 3.6. This is due to the plugin not properly restricting
  access to posts via the REST API when a page has been made private. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to view protected posts.
