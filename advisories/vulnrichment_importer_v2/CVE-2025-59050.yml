aliases: []
summary: Greenshot is an open source Windows screenshot utility. Greenshot 1.3.300 and earlier
  deserializes attacker-controlled data received in a WM_COPYDATA message using BinaryFormatter.Deserialize
  without prior validation or authentication, allowing a local process at the same integrity
  level to trigger arbitrary code execution inside the Greenshot process. The vulnerable logic
  resides in a WinForms WndProc handler for WM_COPYDATA (message 74) that copies the supplied
  bytes into a MemoryStream and invokes BinaryFormatter.Deserialize, and only afterward checks
  whether the specified channel is authorized. Because the authorization check occurs after
  deserialization, any gadget chain embedded in the serialized payload executes regardless of
  channel membership. A local attacker who can send WM_COPYDATA to the Greenshot main window
  can achieve in-process code execution, which may aid evasion of application control policies
  by running payloads within the trusted, signed Greenshot.exe process. This issue is fixed
  in version 1.3.301. No known workarounds exist.
