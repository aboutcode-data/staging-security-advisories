summary: |
  KNIME Business Hub is affected by several cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in its web pages. If a user clicks on a malicious link or opens a malicious web page, arbitrary Java Script may be executed with this user's permissions. This can lead to information loss and/or modification of existing data.
  The issues are caused by a  bug https://github.com/Baroshem/nuxt-security/issues/610  in the widely used nuxt-security module.





  There are no viable workarounds therefore we strongly recommend to update to one of the following versions of KNIME Business Hub:





    *  1.13.3 or later






    *  1.12.4 or later
