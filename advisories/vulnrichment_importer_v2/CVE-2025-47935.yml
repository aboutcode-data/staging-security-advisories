aliases: []
summary: Multer is a node.js middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`. Versions prior to
  2.0.0 are vulnerable to a resource exhaustion and memory leak issue due to improper stream
  handling. When the HTTP request stream emits an error, the internal `busboy` stream is not
  closed, violating Node.js stream safety guidance. This leads to unclosed streams accumulating
  over time, consuming memory and file descriptors. Under sustained or repeated failure conditions,
  this can result in denial of service, requiring manual server restarts to recover. All users
  of Multer handling file uploads are potentially impacted. Users should upgrade to 2.0.0 to
  receive a patch. No known workarounds are available.
