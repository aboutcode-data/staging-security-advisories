aliases: []
summary: The DWT - Directory & Listing WordPress Theme is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
  Scripting in versions up to, and including, 3.3.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and
  output escaping on the 'sort_by' and 'token' parameters. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick
  a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
