aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the discussion image upload function of the Lollms application,
  version v9.9, allows for the uploading of SVG files. Due to incomplete filtering in the sanitize_svg
  function, this can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, which in turn pose
  a risk of remote code execution. The sanitize_svg function only removes script elements and
  'on*' event attributes, but does not account for other potential vectors for XSS within SVG
  files. This vulnerability can be exploited when authorized users access a malicious URL containing
  the crafted SVG file.
