aliases: []
summary: 'Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django. In affected versions
  if a model has been made available for editing through the `wagtail.contrib.settings` module
  or `ModelViewSet`, and the `permission` argument on `FieldPanel` has been used to further
  restrict access to one or more fields of the model, a user with edit permission over the model
  but not the specific field can craft an HTTP POST request that bypasses the permission check
  on the individual field, allowing them to update its value. This vulnerability is not exploitable
  by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin, or by a user who has not
  been granted edit access to the model in question. The editing interfaces for pages and snippets
  are also unaffected. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 6.0.3 and 6.1. Wagtail
  releases prior to 6.0 are unaffected. Users are advised to upgrade. Site owners who are unable
  to upgrade to a patched version can avoid the vulnerability as follows: 1.For models registered
  through `ModelViewSet`, register the model as a snippet instead; 2. For settings models, place
  the restricted fields in a separate settings model, and configure permission at the model
  level.'
