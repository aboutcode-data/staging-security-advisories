aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  thermal/drivers/qcom/lmh: Check for SCM availability at probe

  Up until now, the necessary scm availability check has not been
  performed, leading to possible null pointer dereferences (which did
  happen for me on RB1).

  Fix that.
