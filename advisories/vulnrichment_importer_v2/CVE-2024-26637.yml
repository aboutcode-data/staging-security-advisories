  wifi: ath11k: rely on mac80211 debugfs handling for vif

  mac80211 started to delete debugfs entries in certain cases, causing a
  ath11k to crash when it tried to delete the entries later. Fix this by
  relying on mac80211 to delete the entries when appropriate and adding
  them from the vif_add_debugfs handler.
