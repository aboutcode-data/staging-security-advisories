aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the authentication functionality of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller
  (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication controls
  and log in to the device through the management interface This vulnerability is due to the
  improper implementation of the password validation algorithm. An attacker could exploit this
  vulnerability by logging in to an affected device with crafted credentials. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to bypass authentication and log in to the device as an administrator.
  The attacker could obtain privileges that are the same level as an administrative user but
  it depends on the crafted credentials. Note: This vulnerability exists because of a non-default
  device configuration that must be present for it to be exploitable. For details about the
  vulnerable configuration, see the Vulnerable Products section of this advisory.'
