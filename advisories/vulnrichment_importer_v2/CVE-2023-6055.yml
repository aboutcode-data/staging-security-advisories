aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability has been identified in Bitdefender Total Security HTTPS scanning functionality
  where the software fails to properly validate website certificates. Specifically, if a site
  certificate lacks the "Server Authentication" specification in the Extended Key Usage extension,
  the product does not verify the certificate's compliance with the site, deeming such certificates
  as valid. This flaw could allow an attacker to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack,
  intercepting and potentially altering communications between the user and the website.
