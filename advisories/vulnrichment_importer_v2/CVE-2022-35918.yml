summary: 'Streamlit is a data oriented application development framework for python. Users hosting
  Streamlit app(s) that use custom components are vulnerable to a directory traversal attack
  that could leak data from their web server file-system such as: server logs, world readable
  files, and potentially other sensitive information. An attacker can craft a malicious URL
  with file paths and the streamlit server would process that URL and return the contents of
  that file. This issue has been resolved in version 1.11.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There
  are no known workarounds for this issue.'
