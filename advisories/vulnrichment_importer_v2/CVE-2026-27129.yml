aliases: []
summary: Craft is a content management system (CMS). In versions 4.5.0-RC1 through 4.16.18 and
  5.0.0-RC1 through 5.8.22, the SSRF validation in Craft CMS’s GraphQL Asset mutation uses `gethostbyname()`,
  which only resolves IPv4 addresses. When a hostname has only AAAA (IPv6) records, the function
  returns the hostname string itself, causing the blocklist comparison to always fail and completely
  bypassing SSRF protection. This is a bypass of the security fix for CVE-2025-68437. Exploitation
  requires GraphQL schema permissions for editing assets in the `<VolumeName>` volume and creating
  assets in the `<VolumeName>` volume. These permissions may be granted to authenticated users
  with appropriate GraphQL schema access and/or Public Schema (if misconfigured with write permissions).
  Versions 4.16.19 and 5.8.23 patch the issue.
