aliases: []
summary: In case Cacheservice was configured to use a sproxyd object-storage backend, it would
  follow HTTP redirects issued by that backend. An attacker with access to a local or restricted
  network with the capability to intercept and replay HTTP requests to sproxyd (or who is in
  control of the sproxyd service) could perform a server-side request-forgery attack and make
  Cacheservice connect to unexpected resources. We have disabled the ability to follow HTTP
  redirects when connecting to sproxyd resources. No publicly available exploits are known.
