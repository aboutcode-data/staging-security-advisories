aliases: []
summary: 'Improper input validation on the `contains` LoopBack filter may allow for arbitrary
  SQL injection. When the extended filter property `contains` is permitted to be interpreted
  by the Postgres connector, it is possible to inject arbitrary SQL which may affect the confidentiality
  and integrity of data stored on the connected database. A patch was released in version 5.5.1.
  This affects users who does any of the following: - Connect to the database via the DataSource
  with `allowExtendedProperties: true` setting OR - Uses the connector''s CRUD methods directly
  OR - Uses the connector''s other methods to interpret the LoopBack filter. Users who are unable
  to upgrade should do the following if applicable: - Remove `allowExtendedProperties: true`
  DataSource setting - Add `allowExtendedProperties: false` DataSource setting - When passing
  directly to the connector functions, manually sanitize the user input for the `contains` LoopBack
  filter beforehand.'
