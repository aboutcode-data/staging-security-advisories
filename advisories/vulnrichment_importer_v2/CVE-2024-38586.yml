  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  r8169: Fix possible ring buffer corruption on fragmented Tx packets.

  An issue was found on the RTL8125b when transmitting small fragmented
  packets, whereby invalid entries were inserted into the transmit ring
  buffer, subsequently leading to calls to dma_unmap_single() with a null
  address.

  This was caused by rtl8169_start_xmit() not noticing changes to nr_frags
  which may occur when small packets are padded (to work around hardware
  quirks) in rtl8169_tso_csum_v2().

  To fix this, postpone inspecting nr_frags until after any padding has been
  applied.
