aliases: []
summary: LIBPNG is a reference library for use in applications that read, create, and manipulate
  PNG (Portable Network Graphics) raster image files. From version 1.6.0 to before 1.6.51, there
  is a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in the libpng simplified API function png_image_finish_read
  when processing 16-bit interlaced PNGs with 8-bit output format. Attacker-crafted interlaced
  PNG files cause heap writes beyond allocated buffer bounds. This issue has been patched in
  version 1.6.51.
