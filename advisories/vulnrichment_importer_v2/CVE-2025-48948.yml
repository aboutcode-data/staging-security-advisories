aliases: []
summary: Navidrome is an open source web-based music collection server and streamer. A permission
  verification flaw in versions prior to 0.56.0 allows any authenticated regular user to bypass
  authorization checks and perform administrator-only transcoding configuration operations,
  including creating, modifying, and deleting transcoding settings. In the threat model where
  administrators are trusted but regular users are not, this vulnerability represents a significant
  security risk when transcoding is enabled. Version 0.56.0 patches the issue.
