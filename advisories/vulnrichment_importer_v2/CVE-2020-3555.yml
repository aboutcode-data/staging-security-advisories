aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the SIP inspection process of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance
  (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to cause a crash and reload of an affected device, resulting in a denial of
  service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a watchdog timeout and crash during the
  cleanup of threads that are associated with a SIP connection that is being deleted from the
  connection list. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of crafted
  SIP traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause
  a watchdog timeout and crash, resulting in a crash and reload of the affected device.
