aliases: []
summary: AudioCodes Fax Server and Auto-Attendant IVR appliances versions up to and including
  2.6.23 expose an authenticated command injection vulnerability in the license activation workflow
  handled by AudioCodes_files/ActivateLicense.php. When a license file is uploaded, the application
  derives a new filename by combining a generated base name with the attacker-controlled extension
  portion of the original upload name, then constructs a command line for fax_server_lic_cmdline.exe
  that includes this path. The extension value is incorporated into the command string without
  input validation, escaping, or proper argument quotation before being passed to exec(). An
  authenticated user with access to the license upload interface can supply a specially crafted
  filename whose extension injects additional shell metacharacters, causing arbitrary commands
  to be executed as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.
