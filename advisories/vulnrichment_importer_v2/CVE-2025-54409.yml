aliases: []
summary: AIDE is an advanced intrusion detection environment. From versions 0.13 to 0.19.1,
  there is a null pointer dereference vulnerability in AIDE. An attacker can crash the program
  during report printing or database listing after setting extended file attributes with an
  empty attribute value or with a key containing a comma. A local user might exploit this to
  cause a local denial of service. This issue has been patched in version 0.19.2. A workaround
  involves removing xattrs group from rules matching files on affected file systems.
