aliases: []
summary: ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital
  images. Prior to version 7.1.2-1, when preparing to transform from Log to sRGB colorspaces,
  the logmap construction fails to handle cases where the reference-black or reference-white
  value is larger than 1024. This leads to corrupting memory beyond the end of the allocated
  logmap buffer. This issue has been patched in version 7.1.2-1.
