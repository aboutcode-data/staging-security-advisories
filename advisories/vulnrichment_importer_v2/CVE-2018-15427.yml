summary: A vulnerability in Cisco Video Surveillance Manager (VSM) Software running on certain
  Cisco Connected Safety and Security Unified Computing System (UCS) platforms could allow an
  unauthenticated, remote attacker to log in to an affected system by using the root account,
  which has default, static user credentials. The vulnerability is due to the presence of undocumented,
  default, static user credentials for the root account of the affected software on certain
