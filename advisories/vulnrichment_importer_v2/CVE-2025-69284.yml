aliases: []
summary: Plane is an an open-source project management tool. In plane.io, a guest user doesn't
  have a permission to access https[:]//app[.]plane[.]so/[:]slug/settings. Prior to Plane version
  1.2.0, a problem occurs when the `/api/workspaces/:slug/members/` is accessible by guest and
  able to list of users on a specific workspace that they joined. Since the `display_name` in
  the response is actually the handler of the email, a malicious guest can still identify admin
  users' email addresses. Version 1.2.0 fixes this issue.
