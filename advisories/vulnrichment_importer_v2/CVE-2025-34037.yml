aliases: []
summary: An OS command injection vulnerability exists in various models of E-Series Linksys routers
  via the /tmUnblock.cgi and /hndUnblock.cgi endpoints over HTTP on port 8080. The CGI scripts
  improperly process user-supplied input passed to the ttcp_ip parameter without sanitization,
  allowing unauthenticated attackers to inject shell commands. This vulnerability is exploited
  in the wild by the "TheMoon" worm to deploy a MIPS ELF payload, enabling arbitrary code execution
  on the router. This vulnerability may affect other Linksys products to include, but not limited
  to, WAG/WAP/WES/WET/WRT-series router models and Wireless-N access points and routers. Exploitation
  evidence was observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2025-02-06 UTC.
