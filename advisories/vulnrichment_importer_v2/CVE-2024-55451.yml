aliases: []
summary: A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in authenticated SVG file
  upload and viewing functionality in UJCMS 9.6.3. The vulnerability arises from insufficient
  sanitization of embedded attributes in uploaded SVG files. When a maliciously crafted SVG
  file is viewed by other backend users, it allows authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary
  JavaScript in the context of other backend users' browsers, potentially leading to the theft
  of sensitive tokens.
