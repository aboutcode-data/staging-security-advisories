aliases: []
summary: HCL DRYiCE MyXalytics is impacted by path traversal arbitrary file read vulnerability
  because it uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file
  or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory.  The product does not
  properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve
  to a location that is outside of the restricted directory. Potential exploits can completely
  disrupt or take over the application.
