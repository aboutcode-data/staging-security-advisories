aliases: []
summary: Laf is a cloud development platform. In the Laf version design, the log uses communication
  with k8s to quickly retrieve logs from the container without the need for additional storage.
  However, in version 1.0.0-beta.13 and prior, this interface does not verify the permissions
  of the pod, which allows authenticated users to obtain any pod logs under the same namespace
  through this method, thereby obtaining sensitive information printed in the logs. As of time
  of publication, no known patched versions exist.
