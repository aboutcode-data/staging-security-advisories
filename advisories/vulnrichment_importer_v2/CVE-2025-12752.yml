aliases: []
summary: The Subscriptions & Memberships for PayPal plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to fake
  payment creation in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.7. This is due to the plugin not
  properly verifying the authenticity of an IPN request. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to create fake payment entries that have not actually occurred.
