summary: Jenkins OpenId Connect Authentication Plugin 4.452.v2849b_d3945fa_ and earlier, except
  4.438.440.v3f5f201de5dc, treats usernames as case-insensitive, allowing attackers on Jenkins
  instances configured with a case-sensitive OpenID Connect provider to log in as any user by
  providing a username that differs only in letter case, potentially gaining administrator access
  to Jenkins.
