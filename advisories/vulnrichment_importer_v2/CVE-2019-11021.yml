aliases: []
summary: 'admin/app/mediamanager in Schlix CMS 2.1.8-7 allows Authenticated Unrestricted File
  Upload, leading to remote code execution. NOTE: "While inadvertently allowing a PHP file to
  be uploaded via Media Manager was an oversight, it still requires an admin permission. We
  think it''s pretty rare for an administrator to exploit a bug on his/her own site to own his/her
  own site.'
