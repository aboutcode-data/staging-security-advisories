summary: The Uncode theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the
  ‘mle-description’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.1.6 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
  execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
