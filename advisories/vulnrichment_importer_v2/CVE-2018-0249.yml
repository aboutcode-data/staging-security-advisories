summary: 'A vulnerability when handling incoming 802.11 Association Requests for Cisco Aironet
  1800 Series Access Point (APs) on Qualcomm Atheros (QCA) based hardware platforms could allow
  an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected
  system. A successful exploit could prevent new clients from joining the AP. The vulnerability
  is due to incorrect handling of malformed or invalid 802.11 Association Requests. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed stream of 802.11 Association Requests
  to the local interface of the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to cause a DoS situation on an affected system, causing new client 802.11 Association Requests
  to fail. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products: Aironet 1560 Series Access
  Points, Aironet 1810 Series OfficeExtend Access Points, Aironet 1810w Series Access Points,
  Aironet 1815 Series Access Points, Aironet 1830 Series Access Points, Aironet 1850 Series
  Access Points, Aironet 2800 Series Access Points, Aironet 3800 Series Access Points. Cisco
