aliases: []
summary: Parse Dashboard is a standalone dashboard for managing Parse Server apps. In versions
  7.3.0-alpha.42 through 9.0.0-alpha.7, the AI Agent API endpoint (POST `/apps/:appId/agent`)
  has multiple security vulnerabilities that, when chained, allow unauthenticated remote attackers
  to perform arbitrary read and write operations against any connected Parse Server database
  using the master key. The agent feature is opt-in; dashboards without an agent config are
  not affected. The fix in version 9.0.0-alpha.8 adds authentication, CSRF validation, and per-app
  authorization middleware to the agent endpoint. Read-only users are restricted to the `readOnlyMasterKey`
  with write permissions stripped server-side. A cache key collision between master key and
  read-only master key was also corrected. As a workaround, remove or comment out the agent
  configuration block from your Parse Dashboard configuration.
