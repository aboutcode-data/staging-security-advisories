aliases: []
summary: 'Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in local file management for
  certain system log files of Cisco collaboration products that could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to cause high disk utilization, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
  The vulnerability occurs because a certain system log file does not have a maximum size restriction.
  Therefore, the file is allowed to consume the majority of available disk space on the appliance.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted remote connection requests
  to the appliance. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to increase the size of
  a system log file so that it consumes most of the disk space. The lack of available disk space
  could lead to a DoS condition in which the application functions could operate abnormally,
  making the appliance unstable. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco Voice Operating
  System (VOS)-based products: Emergency Responder, Finesse, Hosted Collaboration Mediation
  Fulfillment, MediaSense, Prime License Manager, SocialMiner, Unified Communications Manager
  (UCM), Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service (IM&P - earlier releases were
  known as Cisco Unified Presence), Unified Communication Manager Session Management Edition
  (SME), Unified Contact Center Express (UCCx), Unified Intelligence Center (UIC), Unity Connection,
  Virtualized Voice Browser. This vulnerability also affects Prime Collaboration Assurance and
  Prime Collaboration Provisioning. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd10872, CSCvf64322, CSCvf64332, CSCvi29538,
  CSCvi29543, CSCvi29544, CSCvi29546, CSCvi29556, CSCvi29571, CSCvi31738, CSCvi31741, CSCvi31762,
  CSCvi31807, CSCvi31818, CSCvi31823.'
