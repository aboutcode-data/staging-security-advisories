  KVM: arm64: Fix host stage-2 PGD refcount

  The KVM page-table library refcounts the pages of concatenated stage-2
  PGDs individually. However, when running KVM in protected mode, the
  host's stage-2 PGD is currently managed by EL2 as a single high-order
  compound page, which can cause the refcount of the tail pages to reach 0
  when they shouldn't, hence corrupting the page-table.

  Fix this by introducing a new hyp_split_page() helper in the EL2 page
  allocator (matching the kernel's split_page() function), and make use of
  it from host_s2_zalloc_pages_exact().
