aliases: []
summary: NocoDB is software for building databases as spreadsheets. Prior to version 0.301.0,
  a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in NocoDB’s attachment handling mechanism.
  Authenticated users can upload malicious SVG files containing embedded JavaScript, which are
  later rendered inline and executed in the browsers of other users who view the attachment.
  Because the malicious payload is stored server-side and executed under the application’s origin,
  successful exploitation can lead to account compromise, data exfiltration and unauthorized
  actions performed on behalf of affected users. Version 0.301.0 patches the issue.
