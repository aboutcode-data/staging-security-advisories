aliases: []
summary: "Critical XXE in Apache Tika tika-core (1.13-3.2.1), tika-pdf-module (2.0.0-3.2.1)\
  \ and tika-parsers (1.13-1.28.5) modules on all platforms allows an attacker to carry out\
  \ XML External Entity injection via a crafted XFA file inside of a PDF. \n\nThis CVE covers\
  \ the same vulnerability as in CVE-2025-54988. However, this CVE expands the scope of affected\
  \ packages in two ways. \n\nFirst, while the entrypoint for the vulnerability was the tika-parser-pdf-module\
  \ as reported in CVE-2025-54988, the vulnerability and its fix were in tika-core. Users who\
  \ upgraded the tika-parser-pdf-module but did not upgrade tika-core to >= 3.2.2 would still\
  \ be vulnerable. \n\nSecond, the original report failed to mention that in the 1.x Tika releases,\
  \ the PDFParser was in the \"org.apache.tika:tika-parsers\" module."
