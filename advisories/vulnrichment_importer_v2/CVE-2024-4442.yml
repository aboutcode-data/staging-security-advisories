aliases: []
summary: The Salon booking system plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion
  in all versions up to, and including, 9.8. This is due to the plugin not properly validating
  the path of an uploaded file prior to deleting it. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to delete arbitrary files, including the wp-config.php file, which can make site
  takeover and remote code execution possible.
