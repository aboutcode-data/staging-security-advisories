aliases: []
summary: The WCFM Marketplace plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification
  and access of data in versions up to, and including, 3.4.11 due to missing capability checks
  on various AJAX actions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal
  permissions such as subscribers, to perform a wide variety of actions such as modifying shipping
  method details, modifying products, deleting arbitrary posts, and privilege escalation (via
  the wp_ajax_wcfm_vendor_store_online AJAX action).
