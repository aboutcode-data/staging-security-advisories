aliases: []
summary: tarteaucitron.js is a compliant and accessible cookie banner. A vulnerability was identified
  in tarteaucitron.js, allowing a user with high privileges (access to the site's source code
  or a CMS plugin) to enter a URL containing an insecure scheme such as javascript:alert().
  Before the fix, URL validation was insufficient, which could allow arbitrary JavaScript execution
  if a user clicked on a malicious link. An attacker with high privileges could insert a link
  exploiting an insecure URL scheme, leading to execution of arbitrary JavaScript code, theft
  of sensitive data through phishing attacks, or modification of the user interface behavior.
  This vulnerability is fixed in 1.20.1.
