  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: mctp: take ownership of skb in mctp_local_output

  Currently, mctp_local_output only takes ownership of skb on success, and
  we may leak an skb if mctp_local_output fails in specific states; the
  skb ownership isn't transferred until the actual output routing occurs.

  Instead, make mctp_local_output free the skb on all error paths up to
  the route action, so it always consumes the passed skb.
