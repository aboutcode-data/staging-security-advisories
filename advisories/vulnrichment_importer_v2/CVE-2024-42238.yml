summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  firmware: cs_dsp: Return error if block header overflows file

  Return an error from cs_dsp_power_up() if a block header is longer
  than the amount of data left in the file.

  The previous code in cs_dsp_load() and cs_dsp_load_coeff() would loop
  while there was enough data left in the file for a valid region. This
  protected against overrunning the end of the file data, but it didn't
  abort the file processing with an error.
