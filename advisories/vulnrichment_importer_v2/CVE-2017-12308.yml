summary: 'A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Small Business Managed Switches software
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct an HTTP response splitting attack
  against a user of the web interface of an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  input validation of some parameters that are passed to the web server of the affected system.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to follow a malicious link
  or by intercepting a user request and injecting malicious code into the request. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected
  web interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information. This vulnerability
