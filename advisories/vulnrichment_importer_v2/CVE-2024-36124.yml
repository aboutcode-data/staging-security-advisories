aliases: []
summary: iq80 Snappy is a compression/decompression library. When uncompressing certain data,
  Snappy tries to read outside the bounds of the given byte arrays. Because Snappy uses the
  JDK class `sun.misc.Unsafe` to speed up memory access, no additional bounds checks are performed
  and this has similar security consequences as out-of-bounds access in C or C++, namely it
  can lead to non-deterministic behavior or crash the JVM. iq80 Snappy is not actively maintained
  anymore. As quick fix users can upgrade to version 0.5.
