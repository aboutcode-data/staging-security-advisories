aliases: []
summary: '@vitejs/plugin-rs provides React Server Components (RSC) support for Vite. Versions
  0.5.5 and below are vulnerable to arbitrary remote code execution on the development server
  through unsafe dynamic imports in server function APIs (loadServerAction, decodeReply, decodeAction)
  when integrated into RSC applications that expose server function endpoints. Attackers with
  network access to the development server can read/modify files, exfiltrate sensitive data
  (source code, environment variables, credentials), or pivot to other internal services. While
  this affects development servers only, the risk increases when using vite --host to expose
  the server on all network interfaces. This issue is fixed in version 0.5.6.'
