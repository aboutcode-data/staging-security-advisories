  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  phy: qcom: qmp-usb-legacy: fix NULL-deref on runtime suspend

  Commit 413db06c05e7 ("phy: qcom-qmp-usb: clean up probe initialisation")
  removed most users of the platform device driver data from the
  qcom-qmp-usb driver, but mistakenly also removed the initialisation
  despite the data still being used in the runtime PM callbacks. This bug
  was later reproduced when the driver was copied to create the
  qmp-usb-legacy driver.

  Restore the driver data initialisation at probe to avoid a NULL-pointer
  dereference on runtime suspend.

  Apparently no one uses runtime PM, which currently needs to be enabled
  manually through sysfs, with these drivers.
