aliases: []
summary: Harden-Runner is a CI/CD security agent that works like an EDR for GitHub Actions runners.
  Versions from 0.12.0 to before 2.12.0 are vulnerable to `disable-sudo` bypass. Harden-Runner
  includes a policy option `disable-sudo` to prevent the GitHub Actions runner user from using
  sudo. This is implemented by removing the runner user from the sudoers file. However, this
  control can be bypassed as the runner user, being part of the docker group, can interact with
  the Docker daemon to launch privileged containers or access the host filesystem. This allows
  the attacker to regain root access or restore the sudoers file, effectively bypassing the
  restriction. This issue has been patched in version 2.12.0.
