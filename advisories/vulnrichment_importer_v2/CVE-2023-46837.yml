aliases: []
summary: |
  Arm provides multiple helpers to clean & invalidate the cache
  for a given region.  This is, for instance, used when allocating
  guest memory to ensure any writes (such as the ones during scrubbing)
  have reached memory before handing over the page to a guest.

  Unfortunately, the arithmetics in the helpers can overflow and would
  then result to skip the cache cleaning/invalidation.  Therefore there
  is no guarantee when all the writes will reach the memory.

  This undefined behavior was meant to be addressed by XSA-437, but the
  approach was not sufficient.
