summary: The DethemeKit For Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure
  in all versions up to, and including, 2.36 via the duplicate_post() function due to insufficient
  restrictions on which posts can be duplicated. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Contributor-level access and above, to extract data from password protected, private,
  draft, or scheduled posts that they should not have access to by duplicating the post.
