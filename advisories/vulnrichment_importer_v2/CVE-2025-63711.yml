summary: A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the SourceCodester Client Database
  Management System 1.0 allows an attacker to cause an authenticated administrative user to
  perform user deletion actions without their consent. The application's user deletion endpoint
  (e.g., superadmin_user_delete.php) accepts POST requests containing a user_id parameter and
  does not enforce request origin or anti-CSRF tokens. Because the endpoint lacks proper authentication/authorization
  checks and CSRF protections, a remote attacker can craft a malicious page that triggers deletion
  when visited by an authenticated admin, resulting in arbitrary removal of user accounts.
