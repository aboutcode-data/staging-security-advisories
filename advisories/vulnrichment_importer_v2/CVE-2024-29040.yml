aliases: []
summary: "This repository hosts source code implementing the Trusted Computing Group's (TCG)\
  \ TPM2 Software Stack (TSS). The JSON Quote Info returned by Fapi_Quote has to be deserialized\
  \ by Fapi_VerifyQuote to the TPM Structure `TPMS_ATTEST`. For the field `TPM2_GENERATED magic`\
  \ of this structure any number can be used in the JSON structure. The verifier can receive\
  \ a state which does not represent the actual, possibly malicious state of the device under\
  \ test. The malicious device might get access to data it shouldn't, or can use services it\
  \ shouldn't be able to. This \nissue has been patched in version 4.1.0."
