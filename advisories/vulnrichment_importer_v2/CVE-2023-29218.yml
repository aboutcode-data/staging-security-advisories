aliases: []
summary: 'The Twitter Recommendation Algorithm through ec83d01 allows attackers to cause a denial
  of service (reduction of reputation score) by arranging for multiple Twitter accounts to coordinate
  negative signals regarding a target account, such as unfollowing, muting, blocking, and reporting,
  as exploited in the wild in March and April 2023. NOTE: Vendor states that allowing users
  to unfollow, mute, block, and report tweets and accounts and the impact of these negative
  engagements on Twitter’s ranking algorithm is a conscious design decision, rather than a security
  vulnerability.'
