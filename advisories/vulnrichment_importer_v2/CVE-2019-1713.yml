summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance
  (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request
  forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF
  protections for the web-based management interface on an affected device. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious link.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege
  level of the affected user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could
  alter the configuration of, extract information from, or reload an affected device.
