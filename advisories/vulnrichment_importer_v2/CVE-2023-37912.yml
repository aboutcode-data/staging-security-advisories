aliases: []
summary: XWiki Rendering is a generic Rendering system that converts textual input in a given
  syntax into another syntax. Prior to version 14.10.6 of `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-core-rendering-macro-footnotes`
  and `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-rendering-macro-footnotes` and prior to version 15.1-rc-1 of
  `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-rendering-macro-footnotes`, the footnote macro executed its content
  in a potentially different context than the one in which it was defined. In particular in
  combination with the include macro, this allows privilege escalation from a simple user account
  in XWiki to programming rights and thus remote code execution, impacting the confidentiality,
  integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. This vulnerability has been patched
  in XWiki 14.10.6 and 15.1-rc-1. There is no workaround apart from upgrading to a fixed version
  of the footnote macro.
