aliases: []
summary: The WP User Control plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized password resets
  in versions up to, and including 1.5.3. This is due to the plugin using native password reset
  functionality, with insufficient validation on the password reset function (in the WP User
  Control Widget). The function changes the user's password after providing the email. The new
  password is only sent to the user's email, so the attacker does not have access to the new
  password.
