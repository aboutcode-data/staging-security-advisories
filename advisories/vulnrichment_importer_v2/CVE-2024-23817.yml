aliases: []
summary: Dolibarr is an enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management
  (CRM) software package. Version 18.0.4 has a HTML Injection vulnerability in the Home page
  of the Dolibarr Application. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML
  tags and manipulate the rendered content in the application's response. Specifically, I was
  able to successfully inject a new HTML tag into the returned document and, as a result, was
  able to comment out some part of the Dolibarr App Home page HTML code. This behavior can be
  exploited to perform various attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). To remediate the issue,
  validate and sanitize all user-supplied input, especially within HTML attributes, to prevent
  HTML injection attacks; and implement proper output encoding when rendering user-provided
  data to ensure it is treated as plain text rather than executable HTML.
