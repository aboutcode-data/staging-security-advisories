aliases: []
summary: Sage DPW before 2024_12_001 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control. The implemented
  role-based access controls are not always enforced on the server side. Low-privileged Sage
  users with employee role privileges can create external courses for other employees, even
  though they do not have the option to do so in the user interface. To do this, a valid request
  to create a course simply needs to be modified, so that the current user ID in the "id" parameter
  is replaced with the ID of another user.
