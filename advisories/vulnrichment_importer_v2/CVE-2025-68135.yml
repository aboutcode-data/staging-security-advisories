summary: EVerest is an EV charging software stack. Prior to version 2025.10.0, C++ exceptions
  are not properly handled for and by the `TbdController` loop, leading to its caller and itself
  to silently terminates. Thus, this leads to a denial of service as it is responsible of SDP
  and ISO15118-20 servers. Version 2025.10.0 fixes the issue.
