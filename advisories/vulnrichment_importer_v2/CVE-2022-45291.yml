aliases: []
summary: PWS Personal Weather Station Dashboard (PWS_Dashboard) LTS December 2020 (2012_lts)
  allows remote code execution by injecting PHP code into settings.php. Attacks can use the
  PWS_printfile.php, PWS_frame_text.php, PWS_listfile.php, PWS_winter.php, and PWS_easyweathersetup.php
  endpoints. A contributing factor is a hardcoded login password of support, which is not documented.
  (This is not the same as the documented setup password, which is 12345.) The issue was fixed
  in late 2022.
