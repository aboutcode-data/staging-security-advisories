summary: "An Unchecked Return Value vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) on Juniper\
  \ Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows a logically adjacent, unauthenticated\
  \ attacker sending a specific PIM packet to cause rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a\
  \ Denial of Service (DoS), when PIM is configured with Multicast-only Fast Reroute (MoFRR).\
  \ Continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service\
  \ (DoS) condition.\n\nThis issue is observed on Junos and Junos Evolved platforms where PIM\
  \ is configured along with MoFRR. MoFRR tries to select the active path, but due to an internal\
  \ timing issue, rpd is unable to select the forwarding next-hop towards the source, resulting\
  \ in an rpd crash.\n\nThis issue affects:\n\nJunos OS: \n\n\n  *  All versions before 20.4R3-S10,\
  \ \n  *  from 21.2 before 21.2R3-S7, \n  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S6, \n  *  from 22.1 before\
  \ 22.1R3-S5, \n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S3, \n  *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3, \n  *  from\
  \ 22.4 before 22.4R2; \n\n\n\n\nJunos OS Evolved: \n\n\n  *  All versions before 20.4R3-S10\
  \ -EVO,\n  *  All versions of 21.2-EVO,\n  *  from 21.4-EVO before 21.4R3-S9-EVO,\n  *  from\
  \ 22.1-EVO before 22.1R3-S5-EVO,\n  *  from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S3-EVO,\n  *  from 22.3-EVO\
  \ before 22.3R3-EVO,\n  *  from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R2-EVO."
