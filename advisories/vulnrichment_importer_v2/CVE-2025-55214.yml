aliases: []
summary: Copier library and CLI app for rendering project templates. From 7.1.0 to before 9.9.1,
  Copier suggests that it's safe to generate a project from a safe template, i.e. one that doesn't
  use unsafe features like custom Jinja extensions which would require passing the --UNSAFE,--trust
  flag. As it turns out, a safe template can currently write files outside the destination path
  where a project shall be generated or updated. This is possible when rendering a generated
  directory structure whose rendered path is either a relative parent path or an absolute path.
  Constructing such paths is possible using Copier's builtin pathjoin Jinja filter and its builtin
  _copier_conf.sep variable, which is the platform-native path separator. This way, a malicious
  template author can create a template that overwrites arbitrary files (according to the user's
  write permissions), e.g., to cause havoc. This vulnerability is fixed in 9.9.1.
