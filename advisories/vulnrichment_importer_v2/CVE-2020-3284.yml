aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the enhanced Preboot eXecution Environment (PXE) boot loader for
  Cisco IOS XR 64-bit Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute unsigned
  code during the PXE boot process on an affected device. The PXE boot loader is part of the
  BIOS and runs over the management interface of hardware platforms that are running Cisco IOS
  XR Software only. The vulnerability exists because internal commands that are issued when
  the PXE network boot process is loading a software image are not properly verified. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by compromising the PXE boot server and replacing a valid
  software image with a malicious one. Alternatively, the attacker could impersonate the PXE
  boot server and send a PXE boot reply with a malicious file. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to execute unsigned code on the affected device. Note: To fix this vulnerability,
  both the Cisco IOS XR Software and the BIOS must be upgraded. The BIOS code is included in
  Cisco IOS XR Software but might require additional installation steps. For further information,
  see the Fixed Software section of this advisory.'
