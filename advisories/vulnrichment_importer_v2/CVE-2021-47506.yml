  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  nfsd: fix use-after-free due to delegation race

  A delegation break could arrive as soon as we've called vfs_setlease.  A
  delegation break runs a callback which immediately (in
  nfsd4_cb_recall_prepare) adds the delegation to del_recall_lru.  If we
  then exit nfs4_set_delegation without hashing the delegation, it will be
  freed as soon as the callback is done with it, without ever being
  removed from del_recall_lru.

  Symptoms show up later as use-after-free or list corruption warnings,
  usually in the laundromat thread.

  I suspect aba2072f4523 "nfsd: grant read delegations to clients holding
  writes" made this bug easier to hit, but I looked as far back as v3.0
  and it looks to me it already had the same problem.  So I'm not sure
  where the bug was introduced; it may have been there from the beginning.
