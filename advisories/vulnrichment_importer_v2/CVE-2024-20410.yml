  Center (FMC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface of an affected device. This vulnerability
  is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface.

  arbitrary script code in the context of the interface, or access sensitive, browser-based
  information.
