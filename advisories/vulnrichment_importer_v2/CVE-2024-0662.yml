aliases: []
summary: The FancyBox for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via admin settings in versions 3.0.2 to 3.3.3 due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level
  permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
  a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations
  where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
