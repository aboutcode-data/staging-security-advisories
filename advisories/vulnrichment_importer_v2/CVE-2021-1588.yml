aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the MPLS Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) feature
  of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial
  of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper input
  validation when an affected device is processing an MPLS echo-request or echo-reply packet.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious MPLS echo-request or echo-reply
  packets to an interface that is enabled for MPLS forwarding on the affected device. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to cause the MPLS OAM process to crash and restart multiple
  times, causing the affected device to reload and resulting in a DoS condition.
