summary: A vulnerability in danny-avila/librechat version 0.7.9 allows for HTML injection via
  the Accept-Language header. When a logged-in user sends an HTTP GET request with a crafted
  Accept-Language header, arbitrary HTML can be injected into the <html lang=""> tag of the
  response. This can lead to potential security risks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
