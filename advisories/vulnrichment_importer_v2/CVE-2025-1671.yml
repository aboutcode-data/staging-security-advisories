summary: The Academist Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.6. This is due to the academist_membership_check_facebook_user()
  function not properly verifying a user's identity prior to authenticating them. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any user, including site administrators.
