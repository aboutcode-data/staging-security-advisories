aliases: []
summary: Anthropic Sandbox Runtime is a lightweight sandboxing tool for enforcing filesystem
  and network restrictions on arbitrary processes at the OS level, without requiring a container.
  Prior to 0.0.16, due to a bug in sandboxing logic, sandbox-runtime did not properly enforce
  a network sandbox if the sandbox policy did not configure any allowed domains. This could
  allow sandboxed code to make network requests outside of the sandbox. A patch for this was
  released in v0.0.16.
