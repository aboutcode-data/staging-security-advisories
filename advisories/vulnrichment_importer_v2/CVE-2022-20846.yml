aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the Cisco&nbsp;Discovery Protocol implementation for Cisco&nbsp;IOS\
  \ XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause the Cisco&nbsp;Discovery\
  \ Protocol process to reload on an affected device.\r\nThis vulnerability is due to a heap\
  \ buffer overflow in certain Cisco&nbsp;Discovery Protocol messages. An attacker could exploit\
  \ this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco&nbsp;Discovery Protocol packet to an affected\
  \ device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a heap overflow, which could\
  \ cause the Cisco&nbsp;Discovery Protocol process to reload on the device. The bytes that\
  \ can be written in the buffer overflow are restricted, which limits remote code execution.Note:\
  \ Cisco&nbsp;Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker\
  \ must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent). &nbsp;Cisco&nbsp;has\
  \ released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that\
  \ address this vulnerability.This advisory is part of the September 2022 release of the Cisco&nbsp;IOS\
  \ XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories\
  \ and links to them, see ."
