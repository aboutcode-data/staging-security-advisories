aliases: []
summary: The WordPress Infinite Scroll – Ajax Load More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  deserialization of untrusted input via the 'alm_repeaters_export' parameter in versions up
  to, and including 5.5.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated users to call files using
  a PHAR wrapper, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such
  as clicking on a link, that will deserialize and call arbitrary PHP Objects that can be used
  to perform a variety of malicious actions granted a POP chain is also present. It also requires
  that the attacker is successful in uploading a file with the serialized payload.
