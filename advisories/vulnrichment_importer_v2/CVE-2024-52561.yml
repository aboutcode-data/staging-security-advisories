aliases: []
summary: A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the Snapshot functionality of Parallels
  Desktop for Mac version 20.1.1 (build 55740). When a snapshot of a virtual machine is deleted,
  a root service verifies and modifies the ownership of the snapshot files. By using a symlink,
  an attacker can change the ownership of files owned by root to a lower-privilege user, potentially
  leading to privilege escalation.
