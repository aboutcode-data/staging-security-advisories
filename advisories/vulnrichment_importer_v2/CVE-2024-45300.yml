aliases: []
summary: alf.io is an open source ticket reservation system for conferences, trade shows, workshops,
  and meetups. Prior to version 2.0-M5, a race condition allows the user to bypass the limit
  on the number of promo codes and use the discount coupon multiple times. In "alf.io", an event
  organizer can apply price discounts by using promo codes to your events. The organizer can
  limit the number of promo codes that will be used for this, but the time-gap between checking
  the number of codes and restricting the use of the codes allows a threat actor to bypass the
  promo code limit. Version 2.0-M5 fixes this issue.
