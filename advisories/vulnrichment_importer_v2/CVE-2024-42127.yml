  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/lima: fix shared irq handling on driver remove

  lima uses a shared interrupt, so the interrupt handlers must be prepared
  to be called at any time. At driver removal time, the clocks are
  disabled early and the interrupts stay registered until the very end of
  the remove process due to the devm usage.
  This is potentially a bug as the interrupts access device registers
  which assumes clocks are enabled. A crash can be triggered by removing
  the driver in a kernel with CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ enabled.
  This patch frees the interrupts at each lima device finishing callback
  so that the handlers are already unregistered by the time we fully
  disable clocks.
