  i2c: cadence: fix reference leak when pm_runtime_get_sync fails

  The PM reference count is not expected to be incremented on
  return in functions cdns_i2c_master_xfer and cdns_reg_slave.

  However, pm_runtime_get_sync will increment pm usage counter
  even failed. Forgetting to putting operation will result in a
  reference leak here.

  Replace it with pm_runtime_resume_and_get to keep usage
  counter balanced.
