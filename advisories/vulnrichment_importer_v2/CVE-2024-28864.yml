aliases: []
summary: SecureProps is a PHP library designed to simplify the encryption and decryption of
  property data in objects. A vulnerability in SecureProps version 1.2.0 and 1.2.1 involves
  a regex failing to detect tags during decryption of encrypted data. This occurs when the encrypted
  data has been encoded with `NullEncoder` and passed to `TagAwareCipher`, and contains special
  characters such as `\n`. As a result, the decryption process is skipped since the tags are
  not detected. This causes the encrypted data to be returned in plain format.  The vulnerability
  affects users who implement `TagAwareCipher` with any base cipher that has `NullEncoder` (not
  default). The patch for the issue has been released. Users are advised to update to version
  1.2.2. As a workaround, one may use the default `Base64Encoder` with the base cipher decorated
  with `TagAwareCipher` to prevent special characters in the encrypted string from interfering
  with regex tag detection logic.  This workaround is safe but may involve double encoding since
  `TagAwareCipher` uses `NullEncoder` by default.
