aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Enable Secret feature of Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches and
  Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode could allow an authenticated, local
  attacker to issue the enable command and get full administrative privileges. To exploit this
  vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials for the affected device.
  The vulnerability is due to a logic error in the implementation of the enable command. An
  attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the device and issuing the enable
  command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain full administrative privileges
  without using the enable password. Note: The Enable Secret feature is disabled by default.'
