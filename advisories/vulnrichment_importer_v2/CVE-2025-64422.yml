aliases: []
summary: Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications,
  and databases. In Coolify vstarting with version 4.0.0-beta.434, the /login endpoint advertises
  a rate limit of 5 requests but can be trivially bypassed by rotating the X-Forwarded-For header.
  This enables unlimited credential stuffing and brute-force attempts against user and admin
  accounts. As of time of publication, it is unclear if a patch is available.
