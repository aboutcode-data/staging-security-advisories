aliases: []
summary: A parsing issue similar to CVE-2022-3171, but with textformat in protobuf-java core
  and lite versions prior to 3.21.7, 3.20.3, 3.19.6 and 3.16.3 can lead to a denial of service
  attack. Inputs containing multiple instances of non-repeated embedded messages with repeated
  or unknown fields causes objects to be converted back-n-forth between mutable and immutable
  forms, resulting in potentially long garbage collection pauses. We recommend updating to the
  versions mentioned above.
