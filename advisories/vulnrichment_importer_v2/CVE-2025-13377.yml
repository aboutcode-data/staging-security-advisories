aliases: []
summary: The 10Web Booster – Website speed optimization, Cache & Page Speed optimizer plugin
  for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary folder deletion due to insufficient file path validation
  in the get_cache_dir_for_page_from_url() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.32.7.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above,
  to delete arbitrary folders on the server, which can easily lead to a loss of data or a denial
  of service condition.
