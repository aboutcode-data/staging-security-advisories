aliases: []
summary: Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. In versions below 0.2.111, a path validation
  flaw using prefix matching instead of canonical path comparison, makes it possible to bypass
  directory restrictions and access files outside the CWD. Successful exploitation depends on
  the presence of (or ability to create) a directory with the same prefix as the CWD and the
  ability to add untrusted content into a Claude Code context window. This is fixed in version
  0.2.111.
