aliases: []
summary: Matrix JavaScript SDK is the Matrix Client-Server software development kit (SDK) for
  JavaScript. Prior to version 19.7.0, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver could
  interfere with the verification flow between two users, injecting its own cross-signing user
  identity in place of one of the users’ identities. This would lead to the other device trusting/verifying
  the user identity under the control of the homeserver instead of the intended one. The vulnerability
  is a bug in the matrix-js-sdk, caused by checking and signing user identities and devices
  in two separate steps, and inadequately fixing the keys to be signed between those steps.
  Even though the attack is partly made possible due to the design decision of treating cross-signing
  user identities as Matrix devices on the server side (with their device ID set to the public
  part of the user identity key), no other examined implementations were vulnerable. Starting
  with version 19.7.0, the matrix-js-sdk has been modified to double check that the key signed
  is the one that was verified instead of just referencing the key by ID. An additional check
  has been made to report an error when one of the device ID matches a cross-signing key. As
  this attack requires coordination between a malicious homeserver and an attacker, those who
  trust their homeservers do not need a particular workaround.
