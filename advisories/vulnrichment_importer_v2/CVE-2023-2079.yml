summary: The "Buy Me a Coffee – Button and Widget Plugin" plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Cross-Site Request Forgery due to missing nonce validation on the recieve_post, bmc_disconnect,
  name_post, and widget_post functions in versions up to, and including, 3.7. This makes it

  granted the attacker can trick a site's administrator into performing an action such as clicking
