aliases: []
summary: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. Under certain scenarios, Grappler
  component of TensorFlow is vulnerable to an integer overflow during cost estimation for crop
  and resize. Since the cropping parameters are user controlled, a malicious person can trigger
  undefined behavior. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also
  affected and still in supported range.
