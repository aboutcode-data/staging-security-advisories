aliases: []
summary: Guzzle, an extensible PHP HTTP client. `Authorization` headers on requests are sensitive
  information. In affected versions when using our Curl handler, it is possible to use the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH`
  option to specify an `Authorization` header. On making a request which responds with a redirect
  to a URI with a different origin (change in host, scheme or port), if we choose to follow
  it, we should remove the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` option before continuing, stopping curl from appending
  the `Authorization` header to the new request. Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle
  7.4.5 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade
  to Guzzle 6.5.8 or 7.4.5. Note that a partial fix was implemented in Guzzle 7.4.2, where a
  change in host would trigger removal of the curl-added Authorization header, however this
  earlier fix did not cover change in scheme or change in port. If you do not require or expect
  redirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects all together. Alternatively,
  one can specify to use the Guzzle steam handler backend, rather than curl.
