  s390/zcrypt: fix zcard and zqueue hot-unplug memleak

  Tests with kvm and a kmemdebug kernel showed, that on hot unplug the
  zcard and zqueue structs for the unplugged card or queue are not
  properly freed because of a mismatch with get/put for the embedded
  kref counter.

  This fix now adjusts the handling of the kref counters. With init the
  kref counter starts with 1. This initial value needs to drop to zero
  with the unregister of the card or queue to trigger the release and
  free the object.
