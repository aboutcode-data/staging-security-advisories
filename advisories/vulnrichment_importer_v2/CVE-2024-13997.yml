summary: Nagios XI versions prior to 2024R1.1.3 contain a privilege escalation vulnerability
  in which an authenticated administrator could leverage the Migrate Server feature to obtain

  attacker could execute actions outside the intended security scope of the application, resulting
  in full control of the operating system.
