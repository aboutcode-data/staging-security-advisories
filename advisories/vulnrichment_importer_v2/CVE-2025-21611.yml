aliases: []
summary: tgstation-server is a production scale tool for BYOND server management. Prior to 6.12.3,
  roles used to authorize API methods were incorrectly OR'd instead of AND'ed with the role
  used to determine if a user was enabled. This allows enabled users access to most, but not
  all, authorized actions regardless of their permissions. Notably, the WriteUsers right is
  unaffected so users may not use this bug to permanently elevate their account permissions.
  The fix is release in tgstation-server-v6.12.3.
