aliases: []
summary: Therefore Corporation GmbH has recently become aware that Therefore™ Online and Therefore™
  On-Premises contain an account impersonation vulnerability. A malicious user may potentially
  be able to impersonate the web service account or the account of a service using the API when
  connecting to the Therefore™ Server. If the malicious user gains this impersonation user access,
  then it is possible for them to access the documents stored in Therefore™. This impersonation
  is at application level (Therefore access level), not the operating system level.
