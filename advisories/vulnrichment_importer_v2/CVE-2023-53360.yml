  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  NFSv4.2: Rework scratch handling for READ_PLUS (again)

  I found that the read code might send multiple requests using the same
  nfs_pgio_header, but nfs4_proc_read_setup() is only called once. This is
  how we ended up occasionally double-freeing the scratch buffer, but also
  means we set a NULL pointer but non-zero length to the xdr scratch
  buffer. This results in an oops the first time decoding needs to copy
  something to scratch, which frequently happens when decoding READ_PLUS
  hole segments.

  I fix this by moving scratch handling into the pageio read code. I
  provide a function to allocate scratch space for decoding read replies,
  and free the scratch buffer when the nfs_pgio_header is freed.
