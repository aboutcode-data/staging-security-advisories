aliases: []
summary: |
  An optional feature of PCI MSI called "Multiple Message" allows a
  device to use multiple consecutive interrupt vectors.  Unlike for MSI-X,
  the setting up of these consecutive vectors needs to happen all in one
  go.  In this handling an error path could be taken in different
  situations, with or without a particular lock held.  This error path
  wrongly releases the lock even when it is not currently held.
