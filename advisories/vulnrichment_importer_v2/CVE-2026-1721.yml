summary: "Summary\n\nA Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in\
  \ the AI Playground's OAuth callback handler. The `error_description` query parameter was\
  \ directly interpolated into an HTML script tag without proper escaping, allowing attackers\
  \ to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's session.\n\n\n\n\nRoot cause\n\
  \nThe OAuth callback handler in `site/ai-playground/src/server.ts` directly interpolated the\
  \ `authError` value, sourced from the `error_description` query parameter,  into an inline\
  \ `<script>` tag.\n\n\nImpact\n\nAn attacker could craft a malicious link that, when clicked\
  \ by a victim, would:\n\n  *  Steal user chat message history - Access all LLM interactions\
  \ stored in the user's session.\n\n\n  *  Access connected MCP Servers - Interact with any\
  \ MCP servers connected to the victim's session (public or authenticated/private), potentially\
  \ allowing the attacker to perform actions on the victim's behalf\n\n\n\n\n\nMitigation:\n\
  \n  *  PR:  https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/841 https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/841\
  \ \n\n\n\n\n  *  Agents-sdk users should upgrade to agents@0.3.10\n\n\n\n\n  *  Developers\
  \ using configureOAuthCallback with custom error handling in their own applications should\
  \ ensure all user-controlled input is escaped before interpolation."
