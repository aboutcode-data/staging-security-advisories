aliases: []
summary: XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions starting from 15.9-rc-1 to before 15.10.12,
  from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.4.3, and from 16.5.0-rc-1 to before 16.8.0-rc-1, when a user
  with programming rights edits a document in XWiki that was last edited by a user without programming
  rights and contains an XWiki.ComponentClass, there is no warning that this will grant programming
  rights to this object. An attacker who created such a malicious object could use this to gain
  programming rights on the wiki. For this, the attacker needs to have edit rights on at least
  one page to place this object and then get an admin user to edit that document. This issue
  has been patched in versions 15.10.12, 16.4.3, and 16.8.0-rc-1.
