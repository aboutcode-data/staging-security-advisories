aliases: []
summary: n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. Versions starting with 1.65.0 and
  below 1.121.0 enable an attacker to access files on the underlying server through execution
  of certain form-based workflows. A vulnerable workflow could grant access to an unauthenticated
  remote attacker, resulting in exposure of sensitive information stored on the system and may
  enable further compromise depending on deployment configuration and workflow usage. This issue
  is fixed in version 1.121.0.
