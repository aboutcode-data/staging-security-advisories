aliases: []
summary: In Zammad 6.4.x before 6.4.2, SSRF can occur. Authenticated admin users can enable
  webhooks in Zammad, which are triggered as POST requests when certain conditions are met.
  If a webhook endpoint returned a redirect response, Zammad would follow it automatically with
  another GET request. This could be abused by an attacker to cause GET requests for example
  in the local network.
