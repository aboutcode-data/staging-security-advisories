aliases: []
summary: The database backup function in Delta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master Versions
  00.00.01a and prior lacks proper authentication. An attacker could provide malicious serialized
  objects which, when deserialized, could activate an opcode for a backup scheduling function
  without authentication. This function allows the user to designate all function arguments
  and the file to be executed. This could allow the attacker to start any new process and achieve
  remote code execution.
