aliases: []
summary: The EAN for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the plugin's 'alg_wc_ean_product_meta' shortcode in all versions up to, and including,
  4.8.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions
  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page.
