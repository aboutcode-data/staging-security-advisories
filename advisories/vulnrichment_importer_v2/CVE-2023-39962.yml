summary: Nextcloud Server provides data storage for Nextcloud, an open source cloud platform.
  Starting in version 19.0.0 and prior to versions 19.0.13.10, 20.0.14.15, 21.0.9.13, 22.2.10.14,
  23.0.12.8, 24.0.12.5, 25.0.9, 26.0.4, and 27.0.1, a malicious user could delete any personal
  or global external storage, making them inaccessible for everyone else as well. Nextcloud
  server versions 25.0.9, 26.0.4, and 27.0.1 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions 19.0.13.10,
  20.0.14.15, 21.0.9.13, 22.2.10.14, 23.0.12.9, 24.0.12.5, 25.0.9, 26.0.4, and 27.0.1 contain
  a patch for this issue. As a workaround, disable app files_external. This also makes the external
  storage inaccessible but retains the configurations until a patched version has been deployed.
