aliases: []
summary: Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open Information
  Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. Prior to versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2, a stack
  overflow can occur on large HTTP file transfers if the user has increased the HTTP response
  body limit and enabled the logging of printable http bodies. This issue has been patched in
  versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2. A workaround for this issue involves using default HTTP response
  body limits and/or disabling http-body-printable logging; body logging is disabled by default.
