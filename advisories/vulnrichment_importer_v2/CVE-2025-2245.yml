aliases: []
summary: A server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the Bitdefender GravityZone
  Update Server when operating in Relay Mode. The HTTP proxy component on port 7074 uses a domain
  allowlist to restrict outbound requests, but fails to properly sanitize hostnames containing
  null-byte (%00) sequences. By crafting a request to a domain such as evil.com%00.bitdefender.com,
  an attacker can bypass the allowlist check, causing the proxy to forward requests to arbitrary
  external or internal systems.
