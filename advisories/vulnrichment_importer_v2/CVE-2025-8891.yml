summary: The OceanWP theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions
  4.0.9 to 4.1.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the oceanwp_notice_button_click()
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to install the Ocean Extra
  plugin via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
  action such as clicking on a link.
