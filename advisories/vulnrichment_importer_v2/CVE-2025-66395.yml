aliases: []
summary: ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. Prior to version 6.5.3, a SQL
  injection vulnerability exists in the `src/ListEvents.php` file. When filtering events by
  type, the `WhichType` POST parameter is not properly sanitized or type-casted before being
  used in multiple SQL queries. This allows any authenticated user to execute arbitrary SQL
  commands, including time-based blind SQL injection attacks. Any authenticated user, regardless
  of their privilege level, can execute arbitrary queries on the database. This could allow
  them to exfiltrate, modify, or delete any data in the database, including user credentials,
  financial data, and personal information, leading to a full compromise of the application's
  data. Version 6.5.3 fixes the issue.
