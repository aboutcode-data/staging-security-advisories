summary: "A vulnerability in the lobby ambassador web interface of Cisco IOS XE Wireless Controller\
  \ Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to remove arbitrary users that are\
  \ defined on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to insufficient access control\
  \ of actions executed by lobby ambassador users. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by logging in to an affected device with a lobby ambassador user account and sending crafted\
  \ HTTP requests to the API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary\
  \ user accounts on the device, including users with administrative privileges.\r\n\r Note:\
  \ This vulnerability is exploitable only if the attacker obtains the credentials for a lobby\
  \ ambassador account. This account is not configured by default."
