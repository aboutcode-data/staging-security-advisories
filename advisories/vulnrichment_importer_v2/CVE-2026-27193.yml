aliases: []
summary: Feathersjs is a framework for creating web APIs and real-time applications with TypeScript
  or JavaScript. In versions 5.0.39 and below, all HTTP request headers are stored in the session
  cookie, which is signed but not encrypted, exposing internal proxy/gateway headers to clients.
  The OAuth service stores the complete headers object in the session, then the session is persisted
  using cookie-session, which base64-encodes the data. While the cookie is signed to prevent
  tampering, the contents are readable by anyone by simply decoding the base64 value. Under
  specific deployment configurations (e.g., behind reverse proxies or API gateways), this can
  lead to exposure of sensitive internal infrastructure details such as API keys, service tokens,
  and internal IP addresses. This issue has been fixed in version 5.0.40.
