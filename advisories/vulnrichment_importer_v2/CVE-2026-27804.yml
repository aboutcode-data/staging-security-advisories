aliases: []
summary: 'Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure
  that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 8.6.3 and 9.1.1-alpha.4, an unauthenticated attacker
  can forge a Google authentication token with `alg: "none"` to log in as any user linked to
  a Google account, without knowing their credentials. All deployments with Google authentication
  enabled are affected. The fix in versions 8.6.3 and 9.1.1-alpha.4 hardcodes the expected `RS256`
  algorithm instead of trusting the JWT header, and replaces the Google adapter''s custom key
  fetcher with `jwks-rsa` which rejects unknown key IDs. As a workaround, dsable Google authentication
  until upgrading is possible.'
