aliases: []
summary: The Essential Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized use of functionality
  due to a missing capability check on the get function in versions up to, and including, 4.0.6.
  This makes it possible for subscriber-level attackers to obtain plugin settings. While a nonce
  check is present, it is only executed when a nonce is provided. Not providing a nonce results
  in the nonce verification to be skipped. There is no capability check.
