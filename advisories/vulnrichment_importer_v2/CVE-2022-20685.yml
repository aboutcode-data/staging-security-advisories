summary: "A vulnerability in the Modbus preprocessor of the Snort detection engine could allow\
  \ an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected\
  \ device.\r\nThis vulnerability is due to an integer overflow while processing Modbus traffic.\
  \ An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Modbus traffic through an\
  \ affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Snort process\
  \ to hang, causing traffic inspection to stop.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that\
  \ address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
