aliases: []
summary: Solady is software that provides Solidity snippets with APIs. Starting in version 0.0.125
  and prior to version 0.1.24, when an account is deployed via a proxy, using regular Solidity
  to call its initialization function may result in a silent failure, if the initialization
  function does not return a `bool` or some other return data.  This is because regular Solidity
  uses `extcodesize(proxy)` to decide if call succeeds. This is insufficient in the case when
  the proxy points to an empty implementation. Users should upgrade to Solady v0.1.24 or later
  to receive a patch. Deploy any affected implementations and their factories on new EVM chains
  as soon as possible.
