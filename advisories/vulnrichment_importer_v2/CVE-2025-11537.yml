aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in Keycloak. When the logging format is configured to a verbose, user-supplied
  pattern (such as the pre-defined 'long' pattern), sensitive headers including Authorization
  and Cookie are disclosed to the logs in cleartext. An attacker with read access to the log
  files can extract these credentials (e.g., bearer tokens, session cookies) and use them to
  impersonate users, leading to a full account compromise.
