aliases: []
summary: 'knative.dev/func is is a client library and CLI enabling the development and deployment
  of Kubernetes functions. Developers using a malicious or compromised third-party buildpack
  could expose their registry credentials or local docker socket to a malicious `lifecycle`
  container. This issues has been patched in PR #1442, and is part of release 1.8.1. This issue
  only affects users who are using function buildpacks from third-parties; pinning the builder
  image to a specific content-hash with a valid `lifecycle` image will also mitigate the attack.'
