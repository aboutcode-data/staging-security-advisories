aliases: []
summary: Sending an HTTP request/response body with greater than 2^31 bytes triggers an infinite
  loop in proxygen::coro::HTTPQuicCoroSession which blocks the backing event loop and unconditionally
  appends data to a std::vector per-loop iteration. This issue leads to unbounded memory growth
  and eventually causes the process to run out of memory.
