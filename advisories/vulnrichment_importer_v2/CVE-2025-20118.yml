summary: "A vulnerability in the implementation of the internal system processes of Cisco APIC\
  \ could allow an authenticated, local attacker to access sensitive information on an affected\
  \ device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials.\r\
  \n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient masking of sensitive information that is displayed\

  \ information on an affected device that could be used for additional attacks."
