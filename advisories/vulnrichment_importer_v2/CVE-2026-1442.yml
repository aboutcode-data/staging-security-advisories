datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2026-1442
datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2026/1xxx/CVE-2026-1442.json
aliases: []
summary: Since the encryption algorithm used to protect firmware updates is itself encrypted
  using key material available to an attacker (or anyone paying attention), the firmware updates
  may be altered by an unauthorized user, and then trusted by a Unitree product, such as the
  Unitree Go2 and other models. This issue appears to affect all of Unitree’s current offerings
  as of February 26, 2026, and so should be considered a vulnerability in both the firmware
  generation and extraction processes. At the time of this release, there is no publicly-documented
  mechanism to subvert the update process and insert poisoned firmware packages without the
  equipment owner’s knowledge.
