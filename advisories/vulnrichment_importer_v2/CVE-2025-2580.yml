summary: The Contact Form by Bit Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 2.18.3 due to insufficient

  with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute
  whenever a user accesses the SVG file.
