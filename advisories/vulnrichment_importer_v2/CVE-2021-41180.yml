aliases: []
summary: Nextcloud talk is a self hosting messaging service. In versions prior 12.1.2 an attacker
  is able to control the link of a geolocation preview in the Nextcloud Talk application due
  to a lack of validation on the link. This could result in an open-redirect, but required user
  interaction. This only affected users of the Android Talk client. It is recommended that the
  Nextcloud Talk App is upgraded to 12.1.2. There are no known workarounds.
