aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the IPsec Manager of Cisco StarOS for Cisco Aggregation Services
  Router (ASR) 5000 Series Routers and Virtualized Packet Core (VPC) System Software could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to terminate all active IPsec VPN tunnels and prevent
  new tunnels from being established, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The
  vulnerability is due to improper processing of corrupted Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2)
  messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IKEv2 messages toward
  an affected router. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ipsecmgr service
  to reload. A reload of this service could cause all IPsec VPN tunnels to be terminated and
  prevent new tunnels from being established until the service has restarted, resulting in a
  DoS condition. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products when they are running
  Cisco StarOS: Cisco Aggregation Services Router (ASR) 5000 Series Routers, Virtualized Packet
  Core (VPC) System Software. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve29605.'
