summary: An issue was discovered in KaiOS 3.0. The pre-installed Communications application
  exposes a Web Activity that returns the user's call log without origin or permission checks.

  or consent. This allows an attacker to send the user's call logs to a remote server via XMLHttpRequest
  or Fetch.
