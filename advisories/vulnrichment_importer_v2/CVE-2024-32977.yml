aliases: []
summary: OctoPrint provides a web interface for controlling consumer 3D printers. OctoPrint
  versions up until and including 1.10.0 contain a vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated
  attacker to completely bypass the authentication if the `autologinLocal` option is enabled
  within `config.yaml`, even if they come from networks that are not configured as `localNetworks`,
  spoofing their IP via the `X-Forwarded-For` header. If autologin is not enabled, this vulnerability
  does not have any impact. The vulnerability has been patched in version 1.10.1. Until the
  patch has been applied, OctoPrint administrators who have autologin enabled on their instances
  should disable it and/or to make the instance inaccessible from potentially hostile networks
  like the internet.
