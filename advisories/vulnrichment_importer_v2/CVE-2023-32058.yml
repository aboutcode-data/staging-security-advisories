aliases: []
summary: Vyper is a Pythonic smart contract language for the Ethereum virtual machine. Prior
  to version 0.3.8, due to missing overflow check for loop variables, by assigning the iterator
  of a loop to a variable, it is possible to overflow the type of the latter. The issue seems
  to happen only in loops of type `for i in range(a, a + N)` as in loops of type `for i in range(start,
  stop)` and `for i in range(stop)`, the compiler is able to raise a `TypeMismatch` when trying
  to overflow the variable. The problem has been patched in version 0.3.8.
