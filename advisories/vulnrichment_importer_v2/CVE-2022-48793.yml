  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  KVM: x86: nSVM: fix potential NULL derefernce on nested migration

  Turns out that due to review feedback and/or rebases
  I accidentally moved the call to nested_svm_load_cr3 to be too early,
  before the NPT is enabled, which is very wrong to do.

  KVM can't even access guest memory at that point as nested NPT
  is needed for that, and of course it won't initialize the walk_mmu,
  which is main issue the patch was addressing.

  Fix this for real.
