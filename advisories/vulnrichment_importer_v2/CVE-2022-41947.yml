aliases: []
summary: 'DHIS 2 is an open source information system for data capture, management, validation,
  analytics and visualization. Through various features of DHIS2, an authenticated user may
  be able to upload a file which includes embedded javascript. The user could then potentially
  trick another authenticated user to open the malicious file in a browser which would trigger
  the javascript code, resulting in a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. DHIS2 administrators
  should upgrade to the following hotfix releases: 2.36.12.1, 2.37.8.1, 2.38.2.1, 2.39.0.1.
  Users unable to upgrade may add the following simple CSP rule in your web proxy to the vulnerable
  endpoints: `script-src ''none''`. This workaround will prevent all javascript from running
  on those endpoints.'
