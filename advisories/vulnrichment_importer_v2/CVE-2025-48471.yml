summary: FreeScout is a free self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. Prior to version 1.8.179,
  the application does not check or performs insufficient checking of files uploaded to the
  application. This allows files to be uploaded with the phtml and phar extensions, which can
  lead to remote code execution if the Apache web server is used. This issue has been patched
  in version 1.8.179.
