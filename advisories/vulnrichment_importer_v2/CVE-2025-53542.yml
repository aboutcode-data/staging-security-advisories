aliases: []
summary: Headlamp is an extensible Kubernetes web UI. A command injection vulnerability was
  discovered in the codeSign.js script used in the macOS packaging workflow of the Kubernetes
  Headlamp project. This issue arises due to the improper use of Node.js's execSync() function
  with unsanitized input derived from environment variables, which can be influenced by an attacker.
  The variables ${teamID}, ${entitlementsPath}, and ${config.app} are dynamically derived from
  the environment or application config and passed directly to the shell command without proper
  escaping or argument separation. This exposes the system to command injection if any of the
  values contain malicious input. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.31.1.
