aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subsystem of Cisco
  IOS Software running on certain models of Cisco Catalyst Switches could allow an authenticated,
  remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition, aka a GET MIB Object ID Denial
  of Service Vulnerability. The vulnerability is due to a condition that could occur when the
  affected software processes an SNMP read request that contains a request for the ciscoFlashMIB
  object ID (OID). An attacker could trigger this vulnerability by issuing an SNMP GET request
  for the ciscoFlashMIB OID on an affected device. A successful exploit could cause the affected
  device to restart due to a SYS-3-CPUHOG. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco devices
  if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS Software and are configured to use SNMP
  Version 2 (SNMPv2) or SNMP Version 3 (SNMPv3): Cisco Catalyst 2960-L Series Switches, Cisco
  Catalyst Digital Building Series Switches 8P, Cisco Catalyst Digital Building Series Switches
  8U. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd89541.'
