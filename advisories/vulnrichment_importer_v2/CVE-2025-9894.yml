aliases: []
summary: The Sync Feedly plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the crsf_cron_job_func function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
  trigger content synchronization from Feedly, potentially creating multiple posts via a forged
  request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
  on a link.
