aliases: []
summary: OpenSearch Security is a plugin for OpenSearch that offers encryption, authentication
  and authorization. Versions 2.0.0.0 and 2.1.0.0 of the security plugin are affected by an
  information disclosure vulnerability. Requests to an OpenSearch cluster configured with advanced
  access control features document level security (DLS), field level security (FLS), and/or
  field masking will not be filtered when the query's search pattern matches an aliased index.
  OpenSearch Dashboards creates an alias to `.kibana` by default, so filters with the index
  pattern of `*` to restrict access to documents or fields will not be applied. This issue allows
  requests to access sensitive information when customer have acted to restrict access that
  specific information. OpenSearch 2.2.0, which is compatible with OpenSearch Security 2.2.0.0,
  contains the fix for this issue. There is no recommended work around.
