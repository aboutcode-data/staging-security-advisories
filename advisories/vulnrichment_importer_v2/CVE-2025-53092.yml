aliases: []
summary: Strapi is an open source headless content management system. Strapi versions prior
  to 5.20.0 contain a CORS misconfiguration vulnerability in default installations. By default,
  Strapi reflects the value of the Origin header back in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin response
  header without proper validation or whitelisting. This allows an attacker-controlled site
  to send credentialed requests to the Strapi backend. An attacker can exploit this by hosting
  a malicious site on a different origin (e.g., different port) and sending requests with credentials
  to the Strapi API. The vulnerability is fixed in version 5.20.0. No known workarounds exist.
