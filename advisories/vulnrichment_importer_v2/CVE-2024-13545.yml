aliases: []
summary: The Bootstrap Ultimate theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.4.9 via the path parameter. This makes it possible for
  unauthenticated attackers to include PHP files on the server, allowing the execution of any
  PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data,
  or achieve code execution in cases where PHP files can be uploaded and included. If php://filter
  is enabled on the server, this issue may directly lead to Remote Code Execution.
