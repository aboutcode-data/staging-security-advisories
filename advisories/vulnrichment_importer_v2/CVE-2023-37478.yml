aliases: []
summary: pnpm is a package manager. It is possible to construct a tarball that, when installed
  via npm or parsed by the registry is safe, but when installed via pnpm is malicious, due to
  how pnpm parses tar archives. This can result in a package that appears safe on the npm registry
  or when installed via npm being replaced with a compromised or malicious version when installed
  via pnpm. This issue has been patched in version(s) 7.33.4 and 8.6.8.
