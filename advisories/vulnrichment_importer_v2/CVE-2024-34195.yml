aliases: []
summary: TOTOLINK AC1200 Wireless Router A3002R Firmware V1.1.1-B20200824 is vulnerable to Buffer
  Overflow. In the boa server program's CGI handling function formWlEncrypt, there is a lack
  of length restriction on the wlan_ssid field. This oversight leads to potential buffer overflow
  under specific circumstances. For instance, by invoking the formWlanRedirect function with
  specific parameters to alter wlan_idx's value and subsequently invoking the formWlEncrypt
  function, an attacker can trigger buffer overflow, enabling arbitrary command execution or
  denial of service attacks.
