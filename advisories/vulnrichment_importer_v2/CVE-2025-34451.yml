aliases: []
summary: rofl0r/proxychains-ng versions up to and including 4.17 and prior to commit cc005b7
  contain a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the function proxy_from_string() located
  in src/libproxychains.c. When parsing crafted proxy configuration entries containing overly
  long username or password fields, the application may write beyond the bounds of fixed-size
  stack buffers, leading to memory corruption or crashes. This vulnerability may allow denial
  of service and, under certain conditions, could be leveraged for further exploitation depending
  on the execution environment and applied mitigations.
