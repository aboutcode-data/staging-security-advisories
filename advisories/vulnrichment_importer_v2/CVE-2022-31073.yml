aliases: []
summary: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration
  capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, the ServiceBus
  server on the edge side may be susceptible to a DoS attack if an HTTP request containing a
  very large Body is sent to it. It is possible for the node to be exhausted of memory. The
  consequence of the exhaustion is that other services on the node, e.g. other containers, will
  be unable to allocate memory and thus causing a denial of service. Malicious apps accidentally
  pulled by users on the host and have the access to send HTTP requests to localhost may make
  an attack. It will be affected only when users enable the `ServiceBus` module in the config
  file `edgecore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a
  workaround, disable the `ServiceBus` module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`.
