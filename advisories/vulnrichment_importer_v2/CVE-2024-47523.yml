summary: LibreNMS is an open-source, PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network monitoring system. A Stored
  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Alert Transports" feature allows authenticated
  users to inject arbitrary JavaScript through the "Details" section (which contains multiple
  fields depending on which transport is selected at that moment). This vulnerability can lead
  to the execution of malicious code in the context of other users' sessions, potentially compromising
  their accounts and allowing unauthorized actions. This vulnerability is fixed in 24.9.0.
