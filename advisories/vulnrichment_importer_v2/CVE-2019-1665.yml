aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco HyperFlex software could
  allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against
  a user of the web-based management interface of an affected system. The vulnerability is due
  to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of
  an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the
  interface to click a maliciously crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive,
  browser-based information. Versions prior to 3.5(1a) are affected.
