aliases: []
summary: APOC (Awesome Procedures on Cypher) is an add-on library for Neo4j that provides hundreds
  of procedures and functions. A path traversal vulnerability found in the apoc.export.* procedures
  of apoc plugins in Neo4j Graph database. The issue allows a malicious actor to potentially
  break out of the expected directory. The vulnerability is such that files could only be created
  but not overwritten. For the vulnerability to be exploited, an attacker would need access
  to execute an arbitrary query, either by having access to an authenticated Neo4j client, or
  a Cypher injection vulnerability in an application. The minimum versions containing patch
  for this vulnerability are 4.4.0.12 and 4.3.0.12 and 5.3.1. As a workaround, you can control
  the allowlist of the procedures that can be used in your system, and/or turn off local file
  access by setting apoc.export.file.enabled=false.
