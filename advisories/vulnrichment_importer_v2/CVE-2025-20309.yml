  \ Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME) could allow an unauthenticated,\
  \ remote attacker to log in to an affected device using the root account, which has default,\
  \ static credentials that cannot be changed or deleted.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to\
  \ the presence of static user credentials for the root account that are reserved for use during\

  \ to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to log in to the affected\
  \ system and execute arbitrary commands as the root user."
