aliases: []
summary: If the attacker has access to a valid Poweruser session, remote code execution is possible
  because specially crafted valid PNG files with injected PHP content can be uploaded as desktop
  backgrounds or lock screens. After the upload, the PHP script is available in the web root.
  The PHP code executes once the uploaded file is accessed. This allows the execution of arbitrary
  PHP code and OS commands on the device as "www-data".
