  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ceph: blocklist the kclient when receiving corrupted snap trace

  When received corrupted snap trace we don't know what exactly has
  happened in MDS side. And we shouldn't continue IOs and metadatas
  access to MDS, which may corrupt or get incorrect contents.

  This patch will just block all the further IO/MDS requests
  immediately and then evict the kclient itself.

  The reason why we still need to evict the kclient just after
  blocking all the further IOs is that the MDS could revoke the caps
  faster.
