aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the interprocess communication (IPC) channel of Cisco Secure Client\
  \ for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a DLL hijacking attack\
  \ on an affected device if the Secure Firewall Posture Engine, formerly HostScan, is installed\
  \ on Cisco Secure Client.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of resources\
  \ that are loaded by the application at run time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by sending a crafted IPC message to a specific Cisco Secure Client process. A successful\
  \ exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected machine with\
  \ SYSTEM privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid user credentials\
  \ on the Windows system."
