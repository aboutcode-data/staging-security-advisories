aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the internal packet-processing functionality of Cisco Firepower
  Threat Defense (FTD) Software for Cisco Firepower 2100 Series Security Appliances could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to stop processing traffic,
  resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to the affected
  software improperly validating IP Version 4 (IPv4) and IP Version 6 (IPv6) packets after the
  software reassembles the packets (following IP Fragmentation). An attacker could exploit this
  vulnerability by sending a series of malicious, fragmented IPv4 or IPv6 packets to an affected
  device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause Snort processes on the affected
  device to hang at 100% CPU utilization, which could cause the device to stop processing traffic
  and result in a DoS condition until the device is reloaded manually. This vulnerability affects
  Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software Releases 6.2.1 and 6.2.2, if the software is
  running on a Cisco Firepower 2100 Series Security Appliance. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf91098.'
