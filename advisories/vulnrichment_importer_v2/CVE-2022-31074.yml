aliases: []
summary: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration
  capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, several endpoints
  in the Cloud AdmissionController may be susceptible to a DoS attack if an HTTP request containing
  a very large Body is sent to it. The consequence of the exhaustion is that the Cloud AdmissionController
  will be in denial of service. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4.
  There is currently no known workaround.
