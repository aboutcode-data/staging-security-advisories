aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the access control list (ACL) programming for port channel subinterfaces\
  \ of Cisco Nexus 3000 and 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode could allow an unauthenticated,\
  \ remote attacker to send traffic that should be blocked through an affected device.\r\n\r\
  \ This vulnerability is due to incorrect hardware programming that occurs when configuration\
  \ changes are made to port channel member ports. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by attempting to send traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow\
  \ the attacker to access network resources that should be protected by an ACL that was applied\
  \ on port channel subinterfaces."
