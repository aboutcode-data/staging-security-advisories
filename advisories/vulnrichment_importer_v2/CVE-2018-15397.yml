aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the implementation of Traffic Flow Confidentiality (TFC) over IPsec
  functionality in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat
  Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected
  device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability
  is due to an error that may occur if the affected software renegotiates the encryption key
  for an IPsec tunnel when certain TFC traffic is in flight. An attacker could exploit this
  vulnerability by sending a malicious stream of TFC traffic through an established IPsec tunnel
  on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a daemon process
  on the affected device to crash, which could cause the device to crash and result in a DoS
  condition.
