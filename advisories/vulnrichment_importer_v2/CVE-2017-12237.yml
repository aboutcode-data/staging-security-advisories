aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) module of Cisco IOS
  15.0 through 15.6 and Cisco IOS XE 3.5 through 16.5 could allow an unauthenticated, remote
  attacker to cause high CPU utilization, traceback messages, or a reload of an affected device
  that leads to a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to how an affected
  device processes certain IKEv2 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
  specific IKEv2 packets to an affected device to be processed. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to cause high CPU utilization, traceback messages, or a reload of the affected
  device that leads to a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that have the
  Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) enabled. Although only
  IKEv2 packets can be used to trigger this vulnerability, devices that are running Cisco IOS
  Software or Cisco IOS XE Software are vulnerable when ISAKMP is enabled. A device does not
  need to be configured with any IKEv2-specific features to be vulnerable. Many features use
  IKEv2, including different types of VPNs such as the following: LAN-to-LAN VPN; Remote-access
  VPN, excluding SSL VPN; Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN); and FlexVPN. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc41277.'
