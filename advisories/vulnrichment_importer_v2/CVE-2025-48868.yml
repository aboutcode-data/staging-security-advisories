aliases: []
summary: Horilla is a free and open source Human Resource Management System (HRMS). An authenticated
  Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in Horilla 1.3.0 due to the unsafe use of
  Python’s eval() function on a user-controlled query parameter in the project_bulk_archive
  view. This allows privileged users (e.g., administrators) to execute arbitrary system commands
  on the server. While having Django’s DEBUG=True makes exploitation visibly easier by returning
  command output in the HTTP response, this is not required. The vulnerability can still be
  exploited in DEBUG=False mode by using blind payloads such as a reverse shell, leading to
  full remote code execution. This issue has been patched in version 1.3.1.
