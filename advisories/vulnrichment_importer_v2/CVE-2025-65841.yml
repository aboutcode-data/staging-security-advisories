aliases: []
summary: Aquarius Desktop 3.0.069 for macOS stores user authentication credentials in the local
  file ~/Library/Application Support/Aquarius/aquarius.settings using a weak obfuscation scheme.
  The password is "encrypted" through predictable byte-substitution that can be trivially reversed,
  allowing immediate recovery of the plaintext value. Any attacker who can read this settings
  file can fully compromise the victim's Aquarius account by importing the stolen configuration
  into their own client or login through the vendor website. This results in complete account
  takeover, unauthorized access to cloud-synchronized data, and the ability to perform authenticated
  actions as the user.
