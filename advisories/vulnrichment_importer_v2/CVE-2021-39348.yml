summary: The LearnPress WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to
  insufficient escaping on the $custom_profile parameter found in the ~/inc/admin/views/backend-user-profile.php
  file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts,
  in versions up to and including 4.1.3.1. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html
  is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled. Please note that
  this is seperate from CVE-2021-24702.
