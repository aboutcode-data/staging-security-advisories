summary: ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. Prior to version 6.5.3, the allowRegistration,
  acceptKiosk, reloadKiosk, and identifyKiosk functions in the Kiosk Manager feature suffers
  from broken access control, allowing any authenticated user to allow and accept kiosk registrations,
  and perform other Kiosk Manager actions such as reload and identify. Version 6.5.3 fixes the
  issue.
