aliases: []
summary: LangGraph SQLite Checkpoint is an implementation of LangGraph CheckpointSaver that
  uses SQLite DB (both sync and async, via aiosqlite). In versions 2.1.2 and below, the JsonPlusSerializer
  (used as the default serialization protocol for all checkpointing) contains a Remote Code
  Execution (RCE) vulnerability when deserializing payloads saved in the "json" serialization
  mode. By default, the serializer attempts to use "msgpack" for serialization. However, prior
  to version 3.0 of the checkpointer library, if illegal Unicode surrogate values caused serialization
  to fail, it would fall back to using the "json" mode. This issue is fixed in version 3.0.0.
