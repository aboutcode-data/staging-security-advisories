summary: 'An Improper Link Resolution Before File Access vulnerability in console port access
  of Juniper Networks Junos OS on NFX Series allows an attacker to bypass console access controls.
  When "set system ports console insecure" is enabled, root login is disallowed for Junos OS
  as expected. However, the root password can be changed using "set system root-authentication
  plain-text-password" on NFX Series systems, leading to a possible administrative bypass with
  physical access to the console. Password recovery, changing the root password from a console,
  should not have been allowed from an insecure console. This is similar to the vulnerability
  described in CVE-2019-0035 but affects different platforms and in turn requires a different
  fix. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on NFX Series: 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R3-S7;
  19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S8; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S12; 20.2 versions prior to
  20.2R3-S8; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S7; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S5; 21.2 versions
  prior to 21.2R3-S4; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S3; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S2; 22.1
  versions prior to 22.1R3-S1; 22.2 versions prior to 22.2R2-S1, 22.2R3; 22.3 versions prior
  to 22.3R1-S2, 22.3R2.'
