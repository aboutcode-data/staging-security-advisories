  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  can: dev: fix skb drop check

  In commit a6d190f8c767 ("can: skb: drop tx skb if in listen only
  mode") the priv->ctrlmode element is read even on virtual CAN
  interfaces that do not create the struct can_priv at startup. This
  out-of-bounds read may lead to CAN frame drops for virtual CAN
  interfaces like vcan and vxcan.

  This patch mainly reverts the original commit and adds a new helper
  for CAN interface drivers that provide the required information in
  struct can_priv.

  [mkl: patch pch_can, too]
