  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  gpiolib: cdev: fix uninitialised kfifo

  If a line is requested with debounce, and that results in debouncing
  in software, and the line is subsequently reconfigured to enable edge
  detection then the allocation of the kfifo to contain edge events is
  overlooked.  This results in events being written to and read from an
  uninitialised kfifo.  Read events are returned to userspace.

  Initialise the kfifo in the case where the software debounce is
  already active.
