aliases: []
summary: RemoteClinic 2.0 contains a critical vulnerability chain that can be exploited by a
  remote attacker with low-privileged user credentials to create admin users, escalate privileges,
  and execute arbitrary code on the target system via a PHP shell. The vulnerabilities are caused
  by a lack of input validation and access control in the staff/register.php endpoint and the
  edit-my-profile.php page. By sending a series of specially crafted requests to the RemoteClinic
  application, an attacker can create admin users with more privileges than their own, upload
  a PHP file containing arbitrary code, and execute arbitrary commands via the PHP shell.
