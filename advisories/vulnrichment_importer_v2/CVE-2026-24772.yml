aliases: []
summary: OpenProject is an open-source, web-based project management software. To enable the
  real time collaboration on documents, OpenProject 17.0 introduced a synchronization server.
  The OpenPrioject backend generates an authentication token that is currently valid for 24
  hours, encrypts it with a shared secret only known to the synchronization server. The frontend
  hands this encrypted token and the backend URL over to the synchronization server to check
  user's ability to work on the document and perform intermittent saves while editing. The synchronization
  server does not properly validate the backend URL and sends a request with the decrypted authentication
  token to the endpoint that was given to the server. An attacker could use this vulnerability
  to decrypt a token that he intercepted by other means to gain an access token to interact
  with OpenProject on the victim's behalf. This vulnerability was introduced with OpenProject
  17.0.0 and was fixed in 17.0.2. As a workaround, disable the collaboration feature via Settings
  -> Documents -> Real time collaboration -> Disable. Additionally the `hocuspocus` container
  should also be disabled.
