aliases: []
summary: iMonitor EAM 9.6394 installs a system service (eamusbsrv64.exe) that runs with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
  privileges. This service includes an insecure update mechanism that automatically loads files
  placed in the C:\sysupdate\ directory during startup. Because any local user can create and
  write to this directory, an attacker can place malicious DLLs or executables in it. Upon service
  restart, the files are moved to the application’s installation path and executed with SYSTEM
  privileges, leading to privilege escalation.
