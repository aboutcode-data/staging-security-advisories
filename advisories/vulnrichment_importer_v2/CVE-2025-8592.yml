aliases: []
summary: The Inspiro theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all
  versions up to, and including, 2.1.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the inspiro_install_plugin() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to install plugins from the repository via a forged request granted they can trick a site
  administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
