aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the `LockManager.release_locks` function in aimhubio/aim (commit
  bb76afe) allows for arbitrary file deletion through relative path traversal. The `run_hash`
  parameter, which is user-controllable, is concatenated without normalization as part of a
  path used to specify file deletion. This vulnerability is exposed through the `Repo._close_run()`
  method, which is accessible via the tracking server instruction API. As a result, an attacker
  can exploit this to delete any arbitrary file on the machine running the tracking server.
