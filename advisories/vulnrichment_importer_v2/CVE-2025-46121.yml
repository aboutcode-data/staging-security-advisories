aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in CommScope Ruckus Unleashed prior to 200.15.6.212.14 and
  200.17.7.0.139, where the functions `stamgr_cfg_adpt_addStaFavourite` and `stamgr_cfg_adpt_addStaIot`
  pass a client hostname directly to snprintf as the format string. A remote attacker can exploit
  this flaw either by sending a crafted request to the authenticated endpoint `/admin/_conf.jsp`,
  or without authentication and without direct network access to the controller by spoofing
  the MAC address of a favourite station and embedding malicious format specifiers in the DHCP
  hostname field, resulting in unauthenticated format-string processing and arbitrary code execution
  on the controller.
