aliases: []
summary: Shescape is a shell escape package for JavaScript. An Inefficient Regular Expression
  Complexity vulnerability impacts users that use Shescape to escape arguments for the Unix
  shells `Bash` and `Dash`, or any not-officially-supported Unix shell; and/or using the `escape`
  or `escapeAll` functions with the `interpolation` option set to `true`. An attacker can cause
  polynomial backtracking or quadratic runtime in terms of the input string length due to two
  Regular Expressions in Shescape that are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service
  (ReDoS). This bug has been patched in v1.5.10. For `Dash` only, this bug has been patched
  since v1.5.9. As a workaround, a maximum length can be enforced on input strings to Shescape
  to reduce the impact of the vulnerability. It is not recommended to try and detect vulnerable
  input strings, as the logic for this may end up being vulnerable to ReDoS itself.
