aliases: []
summary: 'On affected platforms running Arista EOS, an authorized attacker with permissions
  to perform gNMI requests could craft a request allowing it to update arbitrary configurations
  in the switch. This situation occurs only when the Streaming Telemetry Agent (referred to
  as the TerminAttr agent) is enabled and gNMI access is configured on the agent. Note: This
  gNMI over the Streaming Telemetry Agent scenario is mostly commonly used when streaming to
  a 3rd party system and is not used by default when streaming to CloudVision'
