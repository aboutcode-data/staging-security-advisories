aliases: []
summary: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Sesame web application, due to the
  fact that uploaded SVG images are not properly sanitized. This allows attackers to embed malicious
  scripts in SVG files by sending a POST request using the 'logo' parameter in '/api/v3/companies/<ID>/logo',
  which are then stored on the server and executed in the context of any user who accesses the
  compromised resource.
