summary: "A flaw was found in the Quay registry. While the image labels created through Quay\
  \ undergo validation both in the UI and backend by applying a regex (validation.py), the same\
  \ validation is\r\nnot performed when the label comes from an image. This flaw allows an attacker\
  \ to publish a malicious image to a public registry containing a script that can be executed\
  \ via Cross-site scripting (XSS)."
