  USB: core: Fix access violation during port device removal

  Testing with KASAN and syzkaller revealed a bug in port.c:disable_store():
  usb_hub_to_struct_hub() can return NULL if the hub that the port belongs to
  is concurrently removed, but the function does not check for this
  possibility before dereferencing the returned value.

  It turns out that the first dereference is unnecessary, since hub->intfdev
  is the parent of the port device, so it can be changed easily.  Adding a
  check for hub == NULL prevents further problems.

  The same bug exists in the disable_show() routine, and it can be fixed the
  same way.
