aliases: []
summary: OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. A function
  in the implementation contract may be inaccessible if its selector clashes with one of the
  proxy's own selectors. Specifically, if the clashing function has a different signature with
  incompatible ABI encoding, the proxy could revert while attempting to decode the arguments
  from calldata. The probability of an accidental clash is negligible, but one could be caused
  deliberately and could cause a reduction in availability. The issue has been fixed in version
  4.8.3. As a workaround if a function appears to be inaccessible for this reason, it may be
  possible to craft the calldata such that ABI decoding does not fail at the proxy and the function
  is properly proxied through.
