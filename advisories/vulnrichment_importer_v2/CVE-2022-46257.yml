summary: An information disclosure vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server
  that allowed private repositories to be added to a GitHub Actions runner group via the API
  by a user who did not have access to those repositories, resulting in the repository names
  being shown in the UI. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need access to the
  GHES instance, permissions to modify GitHub Actions runner groups, and successfully guess
  the obfuscated ID of private repositories. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub
  Enterprise Server prior to 3.7 and was fixed in versions 3.3.17, 3.4.12, 3.5.9, 3.6.5. This
  vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.
