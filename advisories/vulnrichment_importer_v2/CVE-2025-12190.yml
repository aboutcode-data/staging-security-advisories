aliases: []
summary: The Image Optimizer by wps.sk plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce
  validation on the imagopby_ajax_optimize_gallery() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to trigger bulk optimization via a forged request granted they can trick a site
  administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
