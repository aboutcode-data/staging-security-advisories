aliases: []
summary: '@dependencytrack/frontend is a Single Page Application (SPA) used in Dependency-Track,
  an open source Component Analysis platform that allows organizations to identify and reduce
  risk in the software supply chain. Since version 4.12.0, Dependency-Track users with the SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION
  permission can configure a "welcome message", which is HTML that is to be rendered on the
  login page for branding purposes. When rendering the welcome message, Dependency-Track versions
  before 4.13.6 did not properly sanitize the HTML, allowing arbitrary JavaScript to be executed.
  Users with the SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION permission (i.e., administrators), can exploit this weakness
  to execute arbitrary JavaScript for users browsing to the login page. The issue has been fixed
  in version 4.13.6.'
