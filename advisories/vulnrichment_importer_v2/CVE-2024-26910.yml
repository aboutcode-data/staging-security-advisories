  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  netfilter: ipset: fix performance regression in swap operation

  The patch "netfilter: ipset: fix race condition between swap/destroy
  and kernel side add/del/test", commit 28628fa9 fixes a race condition.
  But the synchronize_rcu() added to the swap function unnecessarily slows
  it down: it can safely be moved to destroy and use call_rcu() instead.

  Eric Dumazet pointed out that simply calling the destroy functions as
  rcu callback does not work: sets with timeout use garbage collectors
  which need cancelling at destroy which can wait. Therefore the destroy
  functions are split into two: cancelling garbage collectors safely at
  executing the command received by netlink and moving the remaining
  part only into the rcu callback.
