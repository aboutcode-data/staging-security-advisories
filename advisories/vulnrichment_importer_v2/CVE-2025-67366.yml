aliases: []
summary: '@sylphxltd/filesystem-mcp v0.5.8 is an MCP server that provides file content reading
  functionality. Version 0.5.8 of filesystem-mcp contains a critical path traversal vulnerability
  in its "read_content" tool. This vulnerability arises from improper symlink handling in the
  path validation mechanism: the resolvePath function checks path validity before resolving
  symlinks, while fs.readFile resolves symlinks automatically during file access. This allows
  attackers to bypass directory restrictions by leveraging symlinks within the allowed directory
  that point to external files, enabling unauthorized access to files outside the intended operational
  scope.'
