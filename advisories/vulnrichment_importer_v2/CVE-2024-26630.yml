  mm: cachestat: fix folio read-after-free in cache walk

  In cachestat, we access the folio from the page cache's xarray to compute
  its page offset, and check for its dirty and writeback flags.  However, we
  do not hold a reference to the folio before performing these actions,
  which means the folio can concurrently be released and reused as another
  folio/page/slab.

  Get around this altogether by just using xarray's existing machinery for
  the folio page offsets and dirty/writeback states.

  This changes behavior for tmpfs files to now always report zeroes in their
  dirty and writeback counters.  This is okay as tmpfs doesn't follow
  conventional writeback cache behavior: its pages get "cleaned" during
  swapout, after which they're no longer resident etc.
