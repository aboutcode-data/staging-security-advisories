aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ALSA: rawmidi - fix the uninitalized user_pversion

  The user_pversion was uninitialized for the user space file structure
  in the open function, because the file private structure use
  kmalloc for the allocation.

  The kernel ALSA sequencer code clears the file structure, so no additional
  fixes are required.
