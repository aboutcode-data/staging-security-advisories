aliases: []
summary: This vulnerability affects Snowplow Collector 3.x before 3.3.0 (unless it’s set up
  behind a reverse proxy that establishes payload limits). It involves sending very large payloads
  to the Collector and can render it unresponsive to the rest of the requests. As a result,
  data would not enter the pipeline and would be potentially lost.
