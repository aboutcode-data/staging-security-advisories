aliases: []
summary: 'An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was discovered in SOGo Webmail
  thru 5.6.0, allowing an authenticated user to send emails on behalf of other users by manipulating
  a user-controlled identifier in the email-sending request. The server fails to verify whether
  the authenticated user is authorized to use the specified sender identity, resulting in unauthorized
  message delivery as another user. This can lead to impersonation, phishing, or unauthorized
  communication within the system. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because the only effective
  way to prevent this sender spoofing is on the SMTP server, not within a client such as SOGo.'
