aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered on certain Nuki Home Solutions devices. Some BLE commands,
  which should have been designed to be only called from privileged accounts, could also be
  called from unprivileged accounts. This demonstrates that no access controls were implemented
  for the different BLE commands across the different accounts. This affects Nuki Smart Lock
  3.0 before 3.3.5 and Nuki Smart Lock 2.0 before 2.12.4.
