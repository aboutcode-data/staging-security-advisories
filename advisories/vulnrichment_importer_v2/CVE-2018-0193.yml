aliases: []
summary: 'Multiple vulnerabilities in the CLI parser of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an
  authenticated, local attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the CLI of the affected software,
  which could allow the attacker to gain access to the underlying Linux shell of an affected
  device and execute commands with root privileges on the device. The vulnerabilities exist
  because the affected software does not sufficiently sanitize command arguments before passing
  commands to the Linux shell for execution. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities
  by submitting a malicious CLI command to the affected software. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to break from the CLI of the affected software, which could allow the attacker
  to gain access to the underlying Linux shell on an affected device and execute arbitrary commands
  with root privileges on the device. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCuz03145, CSCuz56419, CSCva31971, CSCvb09542.'
