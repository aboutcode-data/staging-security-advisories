  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  usb: dwc3: core: remove lock of otg mode during gadget suspend/resume to avoid deadlock

  When config CONFIG_USB_DWC3_DUAL_ROLE is selected, and trigger system
  to enter suspend status with below command:
  echo mem > /sys/power/state
  There will be a deadlock issue occurring. Detailed invoking path as
  below:
  dwc3_suspend_common()
      spin_lock_irqsave(&dwc->lock, flags);              <-- 1st
      dwc3_gadget_suspend(dwc);
          dwc3_gadget_soft_disconnect(dwc);
              spin_lock_irqsave(&dwc->lock, flags);      <-- 2nd
  This issue is exposed by commit c7ebd8149ee5 ("usb: dwc3: gadget: Fix
  NULL pointer dereference in dwc3_gadget_suspend") that removes the code
  of checking whether dwc->gadget_driver is NULL or not. It causes the
  following code is executed and deadlock occurs when trying to get the
  spinlock. In fact, the root cause is the commit 5265397f9442("usb: dwc3:
  Remove DWC3 locking during gadget suspend/resume") that forgot to remove
  the lock of otg mode. So, remove the redundant lock of otg mode during
  gadget suspend/resume.
