aliases: []
summary: The UiPress lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure
  in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.08. This is due to missing capability checks in
  the 'uip_process_block_query' AJAX function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with subscriber-level access and above, to extract sensitive user data including password
  hashes, emails, and other user information that could be used for account takeover attacks.
