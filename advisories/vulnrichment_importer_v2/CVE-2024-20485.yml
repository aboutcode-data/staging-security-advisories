aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the VPN web server of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software\
  \ and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker\
  \ to execute arbitrary code with root-level privileges. Administrator-level privileges are\
  \ required to exploit this vulnerability.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper validation\
  \ of a specific file when it is read from system flash memory. An attacker could exploit this\
  \ vulnerability by restoring a crafted backup file to an affected device. A successful exploit\
  \ could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device after the next\
  \ reload of the device, which could alter system behavior. Because the injected code could\
  \ persist across device reboots, Cisco has raised the Security Impact Rating (SIR) of this\
  \ advisory from Medium to High."
