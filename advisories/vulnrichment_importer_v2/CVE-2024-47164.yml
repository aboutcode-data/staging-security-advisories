aliases: []
summary: Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability
  relates to the **bypass of directory traversal checks** within the `is_in_or_equal` function.
  This function, intended to check if a file resides within a given directory, can be bypassed
  with certain payloads that manipulate file paths using `..` (parent directory) sequences.
  Attackers could potentially access restricted files if they are able to exploit this flaw,
  although the difficulty is high. This primarily impacts users relying on Gradio’s blocklist
  or directory access validation, particularly when handling file uploads. Users are advised
  to upgrade to `gradio>=5.0` to address this issue. As a workaround, users can manually sanitize
  and normalize file paths in their Gradio deployment before passing them to the `is_in_or_equal`
  function. Ensuring that all file paths are properly resolved and absolute can help mitigate
  the bypass vulnerabilities caused by the improper handling of `..` sequences or malformed
  paths.
