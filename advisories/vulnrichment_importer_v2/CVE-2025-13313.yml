aliases: []
summary: The CRM Memberships plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via
  password reset in all versions up to, and including, 2.5. This is due to missing authorization
  and authentication checks on the `ntzcrm_changepassword` AJAX action. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to reset arbitrary user passwords and gain unauthorized access
  to user accounts via the `ntzcrm_changepassword` endpoint, granted they can obtain or enumerate
  a target user's email address. The plugin also exposes the `ntzcrm_get_users` endpoint without
  authentication, allowing attackers to enumerate subscriber email addresses, facilitating the
  exploitation of the password reset vulnerability.
