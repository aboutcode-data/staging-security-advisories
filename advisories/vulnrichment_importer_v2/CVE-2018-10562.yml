aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered on Dasan GPON home routers. Command Injection can occur via
  the dest_host parameter in a diag_action=ping request to a GponForm/diag_Form URI. Because
  the router saves ping results in /tmp and transmits them to the user when the user revisits
  /diag.html, it's quite simple to execute commands and retrieve their output.
