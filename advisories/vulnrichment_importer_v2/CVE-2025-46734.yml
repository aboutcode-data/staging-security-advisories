aliases: []
summary: 'league/commonmark is a PHP Markdown parser. A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
  in the Attributes extension of the league/commonmark library (versions 1.5.0 through 2.6.x)
  allows remote attackers to insert malicious JavaScript calls into HTML. The league/commonmark
  library provides configuration options such as `html_input: ''strip''` and `allow_unsafe_links:
  false` to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by stripping raw HTML and disallowing
  unsafe links. However, when the Attributes Extension is enabled, it introduces a way for users
  to inject arbitrary HTML attributes into elements via Markdown syntax using curly braces.
  Version 2.7.0 contains three changes to prevent this XSS attack vector: All attributes starting
  with `on` are considered unsafe and blocked by default; support for an explicit allowlist
  of allowed HTML attributes; and manually-added `href` and `src` attributes now respect the
  existing `allow_unsafe_links` configuration option. If upgrading is not feasible, please consider
  disabling the `AttributesExtension` for untrusted users and/or filtering the rendered HTML
  through a library like HTMLPurifier.'
