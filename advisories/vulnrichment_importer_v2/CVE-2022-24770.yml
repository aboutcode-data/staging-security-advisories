aliases: []
summary: '`gradio` is an open source framework for building interactive machine learning models
  and demos. Prior to version 2.8.11, `gradio` suffers from Improper Neutralization of Formula
  Elements in a CSV File. The `gradio` library has a flagging functionality which saves input/output
  data into a CSV file on the developer''s computer. This can allow a user to save arbitrary
  text into the CSV file, such as commands. If a program like MS Excel opens such a file, then
  it automatically runs these commands, which could lead to arbitrary commands running on the
  user''s computer. The problem has been patched as of `2.8.11`, which escapes the saved csv
  with single quotes. As a workaround, avoid opening csv files generated by `gradio` with Excel
  or similar spreadsheet programs.'
