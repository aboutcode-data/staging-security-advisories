aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Cisco Unified IP Phones could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to impersonate another user's phone if the Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM) is
  in secure mode. This vulnerability is due to improper key generation during the manufacturing
  process that could result in duplicated manufactured keys installed on multiple devices. An
  attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing a machine-in-the-middle attack on
  the secure communication between the phone and the CUCM. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to impersonate another user's phone. This vulnerability cannot be addressed with
  software updates. There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability.
