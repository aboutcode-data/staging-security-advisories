aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) handler
  of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD)
  Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to exhaust memory resources on the
  affected device, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due
  to improper resource management for inbound SSL/TLS connections. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by establishing multiple SSL/TLS connections with specific conditions to
  the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust the memory on
  the affected device, causing the device to stop accepting new SSL/TLS connections and resulting
  in a DoS condition for services on the device that process SSL/TLS traffic. Manual intervention
  is required to recover an affected device.
