aliases: []
summary: Stalwart Mail Server is an open-source mail server. Prior to version 0.8.0, attackers
  who achieved Arbitrary Code Execution as the stalwart-mail user (including web interface admins)
  can gain complete root access to the system. Usually, system services are run as a separate
  user (not as root) to isolate an attacker with Arbitrary Code Execution to the current service.
  Therefore, other system services and the system itself remains protected in case of a successful
  attack. stalwart-mail runs as a separate user, but it can give itself full privileges again
  in a simple way, so this protection is practically ineffective. Server admins who handed out
  the admin credentials to the mail server, but didn't want to hand out complete root access
  to the system, as well as any attacked user when the attackers gained Arbitrary Code Execution
  using another vulnerability, may be vulnerable. Version 0.8.0 contains a patch for the issue.
