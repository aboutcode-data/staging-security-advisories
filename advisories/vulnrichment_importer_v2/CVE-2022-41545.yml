aliases: []
summary: The administrative web interface of a Netgear C7800 Router running firmware version
  6.01.07 (and possibly others) authenticates users via basic authentication, with an HTTP header
  containing a base64 value of the plaintext username and password. Because the web server also
  does not utilize transport security by default, this renders the administrative credentials
  vulnerable to eavesdropping by an adversary during every authenticated request made by a client
  to the router over a WLAN, or a LAN, should the adversary be able to perform a man-in-the-middle
  attack.
