aliases: []
summary: 'An issue was discovered in the endpoint protection agent in Zoho ManageEngine Device
  Control Plus 10.1.2228.15. Despite configuring complete restrictions on USB pendrives, USB
  HDD devices, memory cards, USB connections to mobile devices, etc., it is still possible to
  bypass the USB restrictions by making use of a virtual machine (VM). This allows a file to
  be exchanged outside the laptop/system. VMs can be created by any user (even without admin
  rights). The data exfiltration can occur without any record in the audit trail of Windows
  events on the host machine. NOTE: the vendor''s position is "it''s not a vulnerability in
  our product."'
