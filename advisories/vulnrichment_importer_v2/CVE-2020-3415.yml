aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Data Management Engine (DME) of Cisco NX-OS Software could
  allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code with administrative
  privileges or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability
  is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
  a crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to a Layer 2-adjacent affected device. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges
  or cause the Cisco Discovery Protocol process to crash and restart multiple times, causing
  the affected device to reload and resulting in a DoS condition. Note: Cisco Discovery Protocol
  is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be in the same broadcast
  domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent). Exploitation of this vulnerability also
  requires jumbo frames to be enabled on the interface that receives the crafted Cisco Discovery
  Protocol packets on the affected device.'
