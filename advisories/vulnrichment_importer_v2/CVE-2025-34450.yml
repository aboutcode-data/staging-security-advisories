aliases: []
summary: merbanan/rtl_433 versions up to and including 25.02 and prior to commit 25e47f8 contain
  a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the function parse_rfraw() located in src/rfraw.c.
  When processing crafted or excessively large raw RF input data, the application may write

  can be exploited to cause a denial of service and, under certain conditions, may be leveraged
  for further exploitation depending on the execution environment and available mitigations.
