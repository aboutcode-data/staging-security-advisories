aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in zenml-io/zenml version 0.56.3 allows attackers to reuse old session
  credentials or session IDs due to insufficient session expiration. Specifically, the session
  does not expire after a password change, enabling an attacker to maintain access to a compromised
  account without the victim's ability to revoke this access. This issue was observed in a self-hosted
  ZenML deployment via Docker, where after changing the password from one browser, the session
  remained active and usable in another browser without requiring re-authentication.
