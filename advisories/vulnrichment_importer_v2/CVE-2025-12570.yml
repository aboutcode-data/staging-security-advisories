aliases: []
summary: The Fancy Product Designer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.8 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping in the data-to-image.php and pdf-to-image.php files.
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
  that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.
