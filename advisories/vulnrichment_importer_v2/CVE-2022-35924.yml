aliases: []
summary: 'NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications.
  `next-auth` users who are using the `EmailProvider` either in versions before `4.10.3` or
  `3.29.10` are affected. If an attacker could forge a request that sent a comma-separated list
  of emails (eg.: `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`) to the sign-in endpoint, NextAuth.js
  would send emails to both the attacker and the victim''s e-mail addresses. The attacker could
  then login as a newly created user with the email being `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`.
  This means that basic authorization like `email.endsWith("@victim.com")` in the `signIn` callback
  would fail to communicate a threat to the developer and would let the attacker bypass authorization,
  even with an `@attacker.com` address. This vulnerability has been patched in `v4.10.3` and
  `v3.29.10` by normalizing the email value that is sent to the sign-in endpoint before accessing
  it anywhere else. We also added a `normalizeIdentifier` callback on the `EmailProvider` configuration,
  where you can further tweak your requirements for what your system considers a valid e-mail
  address. (E.g.: strict RFC2821 compliance). Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
  workarounds for this vulnerability. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, you can normalize
  the incoming request using Advanced Initialization.'
