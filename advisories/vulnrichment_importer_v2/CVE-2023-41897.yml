datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2023-41897
datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2023/41xxx/CVE-2023-41897.json
aliases: []
summary: Home assistant is an open source home automation. Home Assistant server does not set
  any HTTP security headers, including the X-Frame-Options header, which specifies whether the
  web page is allowed to be framed. The omission of this and correlating headers facilitates
  covert clickjacking attacks and alternative exploit opportunities, such as the vector described
  in this security advisory. This fault incurs major risk, considering the ability to trick
  users into installing an external and malicious add-on with minimal user interaction, which
  would enable Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the Home Assistant application. This issue
  has been addressed in version 2023.9.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no
  known workarounds for this vulnerability.
