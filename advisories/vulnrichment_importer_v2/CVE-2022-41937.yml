summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications
  built on top of it. The application allows anyone with view access to modify any page of the
  wiki by importing a crafted XAR package. The problem has been patched in XWiki 14.6RC1, 14.6
  and 13.10.8. As a workaround, setting the right of the page Filter.WebHome and making sure
  only the main wiki administrators can view the application installed on main wiki or edit
  the page and apply the changed described in commit fb49b4f.
