aliases: []
summary: Version 00.07.03.4 and prior of Teltonika’s RUT router firmware contain a packet dump
  utility that contains proper validation for filter parameters. However, variables for validation
  checks are stored in an external configuration file. An authenticated attacker could use an
  exposed UCI configuration utility to change these variables and enable malicious parameters
  in the dump utility, which could result in arbitrary code execution.
