aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Live Data server of Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition
  on an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the affected software improperly manages
  resources when processing inbound Live Data traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending multiple crafted Live Data packets to an affected device. A successful exploit
  could cause the affected device to run out of buffer resources, which could result in a stack
  overflow and cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: The
  Live Data port in Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise devices allows only a single TCP
  connection. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to send crafted packets
  to an affected device before a legitimate Live Data client establishes a connection.'
