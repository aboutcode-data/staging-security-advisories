summary: Concrete CMS before 8.5.13 and 9.x before 9.2.2 allows unauthorized access because
  directories can be created with insecure permissions. File creation functions (such as the
  Mkdir() function) gives universal access (0777) to created folders by default. Excessive permissions
  can be granted when creating a directory with permissions greater than 0755 or when the permissions
  argument is not specified.
