aliases: []
summary: The MasterStudy LMS Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
  due to insufficient file type validation in the 'install_and_activate_plugin' function in
  all versions up to, and including, 4.7.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server
  which may make remote code execution possible. The vulnerability is difficult to exploit due
  to timing requirements and environmental factors.
