aliases: []
summary: jackson-core contains core low-level incremental ("streaming") parser and generator
  abstractions used by Jackson Data Processor. In versions prior to 2.15.0, if a user parses
  an input file and it has deeply nested data, Jackson could end up throwing a StackoverflowError
  if the depth is particularly large. jackson-core 2.15.0 contains a configurable limit for
  how deep Jackson will traverse in an input document, defaulting to an allowable depth of 1000.
  jackson-core will throw a StreamConstraintsException if the limit is reached. jackson-databind
  also benefits from this change because it uses jackson-core to parse JSON inputs. As a workaround,
  users should avoid parsing input files from untrusted sources.
