aliases: []
summary: XStream is a simple library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In affected
  versions this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker has sufficient rights to execute commands
  of the host only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected, who followed
  the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal
  required types. XStream 1.4.18 uses no longer a blacklist by default, since it cannot be secured
  for general purpose.
