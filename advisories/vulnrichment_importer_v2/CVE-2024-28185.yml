datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2024-28185
datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2024/28xxx/CVE-2024-28185.json
aliases: []
summary: Judge0 is an open-source online code execution system. The application does not account
  for symlinks placed inside the sandbox directory, which can be leveraged by an attacker to
  write to arbitrary files and gain code execution outside of the sandbox. When executing a
  submission, Judge0 writes a `run_script` to the sandbox directory. The security issue is that
  an attacker can create a symbolic link (symlink) at the path `run_script` before this code
  is executed, resulting in the `f.write` writing to an arbitrary file on the unsandboxed system.
  An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to overwrite scripts on the system and gain code
  execution outside of the sandbox.
