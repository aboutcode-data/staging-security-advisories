aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the integrated wireless access point (AP) packet processing of the
  Cisco 1000 Series Connected Grid Router (CGR1K) could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker
  to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to
  insufficient input validation of received traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending crafted traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to cause the integrated AP to stop processing traffic, resulting in a DoS condition. It may
  be necessary to manually reload the CGR1K to restore AP operation.
