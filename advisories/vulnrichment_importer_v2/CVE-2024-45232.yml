aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in powermail extension through 12.3.5 for TYPO3. It fails to
  validate the mail parameter of the confirmationAction, resulting in Insecure Direct Object
  Reference (IDOR). An unauthenticated attacker can use this to display the user-submitted data
  of all forms persisted by the extension. This can only be exploited when the extension is
  configured to save submitted form data to the database (plugin.tx_powermail.settings.db.enable=1),
  which however is the default setting of the extension. The fixed versions are 7.5.0, 8.5.0,
  10.9.0, and 12.4.0
