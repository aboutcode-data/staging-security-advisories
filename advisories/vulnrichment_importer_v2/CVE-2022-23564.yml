summary: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. When decoding a resource handle
  tensor from protobuf, a TensorFlow process can encounter cases where a `CHECK` assertion is
  invalidated based on user controlled arguments. This allows attackers to cause denial of services
  in TensorFlow processes. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also
  affected and still in supported range.
