aliases: []
summary: OpenEMR is a free and open source electronic health records and medical practice management
  application. Versions 5.0.0.5 through 7.0.3.4 have a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability
  in the ub04 helper of the billing interface. The variable `$data` is passed in a click event
  handler enclosed in single quotes without proper sanitization. Thus, despite `json_encode`
  a malicious user can still inject a payload such as ` ac' ><img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)>
  ` to trigger the bug. This vulnerability allows low privileged users to embed malicious JS
  payloads on the server and perform stored XSS attack. This, in turn makes it possible for
  malicious users to steal the session cookies and perform unauthorized actions impersonating
  administrators. Version 7.0.4 patches the issue.
