aliases: []
summary: webtransport-go is an implementation of the WebTransport protocol. From 0.3.0 to 0.9.0,
  an attacker can cause excessive memory consumption in webtransport-go's session implementation
  by sending a WT_CLOSE_SESSION capsule containing an excessively large Application Error Message.
  The implementation does not enforce the draft-mandated limit of 1024 bytes on this field,
  allowing a peer to send an arbitrarily large message payload that is fully read and stored
  in memory. This allows an attacker to consume an arbitrary amount of memory. The attacker
  must transmit the full payload to achieve the memory consumption, but the lack of any upper
  bound makes large-scale attacks feasible given sufficient bandwidth. This vulnerability is
  fixed in 0.10.0.
