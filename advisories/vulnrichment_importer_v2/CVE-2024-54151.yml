aliases: []
summary: Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting
  in version 11.0.0 and prior to version 11.3.0, when setting `WEBSOCKETS_GRAPHQL_AUTH` or `WEBSOCKETS_REST_AUTH`
  to "public", an unauthenticated user is able to do any of the supported operations (CRUD,
  subscriptions) with full admin privileges. This impacts any Directus instance that has either
  `WEBSOCKETS_GRAPHQL_AUTH` or `WEBSOCKETS_REST_AUTH` set to `public` allowing unauthenticated
  users to subscribe for changes on any collection or do REST CRUD operations on user defined
  collections ignoring permissions. Version 11.3.0 fixes the issue.
