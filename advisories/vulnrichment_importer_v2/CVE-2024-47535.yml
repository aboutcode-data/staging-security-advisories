summary: Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development
  of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. An unsafe reading of environment
  file could potentially cause a denial of service in Netty. When loaded on an Windows application,
  Netty attempts to load a file that does not exist. If an attacker creates such a large file,
  the Netty application crashes. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.1.115.
