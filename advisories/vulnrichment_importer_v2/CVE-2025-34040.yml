aliases: []
summary: An arbitrary file upload vulnerability exists in the Zhiyuan OA platform via the wpsAssistServlet
  interface. The realFileType and fileId parameters are improperly validated during multipart
  file uploads, allowing unauthenticated attackers to upload crafted JSP files outside of intended
  directories using path traversal. Successful exploitation enables remote code execution as
  the uploaded file can be accessed and executed through the web server. Exploitation evidence
  was observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2025-02-01 UTC.
