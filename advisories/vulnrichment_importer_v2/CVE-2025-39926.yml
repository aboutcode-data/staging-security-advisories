  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  genetlink: fix genl_bind() invoking bind() after -EPERM

  Per family bind/unbind callbacks were introduced to allow families
  to track multicast group consumer presence, e.g. to start or stop
  producing events depending on listeners.

  However, in genl_bind() the bind() callback was invoked even if
  capability checks failed and ret was set to -EPERM. This means that
  callbacks could run on behalf of unauthorized callers while the
  syscall still returned failure to user space.

  Fix this by only invoking bind() after "if (ret) break;" check
  i.e. after permission checks have succeeded.
