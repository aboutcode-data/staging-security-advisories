aliases: []
summary: apko allows users to build and publish OCI container images built from apk packages.
  From version 0.14.8 to before 1.1.1, an attacker who controls or compromises an APK repository
  used by apko could cause resource exhaustion on the build host. The ExpandApk function in
  pkg/apk/expandapk/expandapk.go expands .apk streams without enforcing decompression limits,
  allowing a malicious repository to serve a small, highly-compressed .apk that inflates into
  a large tar stream, consuming excessive disk space and CPU time, causing build failures or
  denial of service. This issue has been patched in version 1.1.1.
