aliases: []
summary: Greenshot is an open source Windows screenshot utility. Versions 1.3.310 and below
  arvulnerable to OS Command Injection through unsanitized filename processing. The FormatArguments
  method in ExternalCommandDestination.cs:269 uses string.Format() to insert user-controlled
  filenames directly into shell commands without sanitization, allowing attackers to execute
  arbitrary commands by crafting malicious filenames containing shell metacharacters. This issue
  is fixed in version 1.3.311.
