aliases: []
summary: The Formula theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via
  the ‘id’ parameter in the 'quality_customizer_notify_dismiss_action' AJAX action in all versions
  up to, and including, 0.5.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This
  makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that
  execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on
  a link.
