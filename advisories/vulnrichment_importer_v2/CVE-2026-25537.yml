aliases: []
summary: 'jsonwebtoken is a JWT lib in rust. Prior to version 10.3.0, there is a Type Confusion
  vulnerability in jsonwebtoken, specifically, in its claim validation logic. When a standard
  claim (such as nbf or exp) is provided with an incorrect JSON type (Like a String instead
  of a Number), the library’s internal parsing mechanism marks the claim as “FailedToParse”.
  Crucially, the validation logic treats this “FailedToParse” state identically to “NotPresent”.
  This means that if a check is enabled (like: validate_nbf = true), but the claim is not explicitly
  marked as required in required_spec_claims, the library will skip the validation check entirely
  for the malformed claim, treating it as if it were not there. This allows attackers to bypass
  critical time-based security restrictions (like “Not Before” checks) and commit potential
  authentication and authorization bypasses. This issue has been patched in version 10.3.0.'
