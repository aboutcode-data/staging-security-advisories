  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ice: Fix improper extts handling

  Extts events are disabled and enabled by the application ts2phc.
  However, in case where the driver is removed when the application is
  running, a specific extts event remains enabled and can cause a kernel
  crash.
  As a side effect, when the driver is reloaded and application is started
  again, remaining extts event for the channel from a previous run will
  keep firing and the message "extts on unexpected channel" might be
  printed to the user.

  To avoid that, extts events shall be disabled when PTP is released.
