aliases: []
summary: Updatecli is a tool used to apply file update strategies. Prior to version 0.93.0,
  private maven repository credentials may be leaked in application logs in case of unsuccessful
  retrieval operation. During the execution of an updatecli pipeline which contains a `maven`
  source configured with basic auth credentials, the credentials are being leaked in the application
  execution logs in case of failure. Credentials are properly sanitized when the operation is
  successful but not when for whatever reason there is a failure in the maven repository, e.g.
  wrong coordinates provided, not existing artifact or version. Version 0.93.0 contains a patch
  for the issue.
