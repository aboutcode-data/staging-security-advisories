aliases: []
summary: Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. An authenticated
  user may use a specially crafted Lua script to manipulate the garbage collector and potentially
  lead to remote code execution. The problem is fixed in 7.4.2, 7.2.7, and 6.2.17. An additional
  workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent
  users from executing Lua scripts. This can be done using ACL to restrict EVAL and EVALSHA
  commands.
