summary: The Open eClass platform (formerly known as GUnet eClass) is a complete Course Management
  System. An arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the "save" functionality of the H5P module
  enables unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary files on the server's filesystem. This may
  lead in unrestricted RCE on the backend server, since the upload location is accessible from
  the internet. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.16.
