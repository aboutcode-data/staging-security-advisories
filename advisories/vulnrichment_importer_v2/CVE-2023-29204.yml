summary: XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top level XWiki projects.
  It is possible to bypass the existing security measures put in place to avoid open redirect
  by using a redirect such as `//mydomain.com` (i.e. omitting the `http:`). It was also possible
  to bypass it when using URL such as `http:/mydomain.com`. The problem has been patched on
  XWiki 13.10.10, 14.4.4 and 14.8RC1.
