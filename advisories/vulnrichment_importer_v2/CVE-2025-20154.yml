summary: "A vulnerability in the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) server feature\
  \ of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker\
  \ to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\
  \ For Cisco IOS XR Software, this vulnerability could cause the ipsla_ippm_server&nbsp;process\
  \ to reload unexpectedly if debugs are enabled.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to out-of-bounds\
  \ array access when processing specially crafted TWAMP control packets. An attacker could\
  \ exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TWAMP control packets to an affected device.\
  \ A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting\
  \ in a DoS condition.\r\nNote: For Cisco IOS XR Software, only the ipsla_ippm_server process\
  \ reloads unexpectedly and only when debugs are enabled. The vulnerability details for Cisco\
  \ IOS XR Software are as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security Impact Rating (SIR): Low&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CVSS\
  \ Base Score: 3.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"
