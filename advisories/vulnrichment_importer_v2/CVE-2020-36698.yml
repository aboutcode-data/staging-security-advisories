aliases: []
summary: The Security & Malware scan by CleanTalk plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
  user interaction in versions up to, and including, 2.50. This is due to missing capability
  checks on several AJAX actions and nonce disclosure in the source page of the administrative
  dashboard. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions
  and above, to call functions and delete and/or upload files.
