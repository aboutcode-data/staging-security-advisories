aliases: []
summary: 'An issue was discovered in YSoft SAFEQ 6 Server before 6.0.82. When modifying the
  URL of the LDAP server configuration from LDAPS to LDAP, the system does not require the password
  to be (re)entered. This results in exposing cleartext credentials when connecting to a rogue
  LDAP server. NOTE: the vendor originally reported this as a security issue but then reconsidered
  because of the requirement for Admin access in order to change the configuration.'
