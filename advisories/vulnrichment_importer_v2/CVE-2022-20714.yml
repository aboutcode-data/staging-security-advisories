aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the data plane microcode of Lightspeed-Plus line cards for Cisco
  ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to cause the line card to reset. This vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of malformed
  packets that are received on the Lightspeed-Plus line cards. An attacker could exploit this
  vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv4 or IPv6 packet through an affected device. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Lightspeed-Plus line card to reset, resulting
  in a denial of service (DoS) condition for any traffic that traverses that line card.
