aliases: []
summary: When a URL is added to the map element, it is recorded in the database with sequential
  IDs. Upon adding a new URL, the system retrieves the last sysmapelementurlid value and increments
  it by one. However, an issue arises when a user manually changes the sysmapelementurlid value
  by adding sysmapelementurlid + 1. This action prevents others from adding URLs to the map
  element.
