aliases: []
summary: Model Context Protocol Servers is a collection of reference implementations for the
  model context protocol (MCP). In mcp-server-git versions prior to 2026.1.14, the git_add tool
  did not validate that file paths provided in the files argument were within the repository
  boundaries. Because the tool used GitPython's repo.index.add() rather than the Git CLI, relative
  paths containing `../` sequences that resolve outside the repository were accepted and staged
  into the Git index. Users are advised to upgrade to 2026.1.14 or newer to remediate this issue.
