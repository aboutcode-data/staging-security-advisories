aliases: []
summary: 'An issue was discovered in Ollama before 0.1.46. An attacker can use two HTTP requests
  to upload a malformed GGUF file containing just 4 bytes starting with the GGUF custom magic
  header. By leveraging a custom Modelfile that includes a FROM statement pointing to the attacker-controlled
  blob file, the attacker can crash the application through the CreateModel route, leading to
  a segmentation fault (signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation).'
