aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol implementation for Cisco Video Surveillance
  8000 Series IP Cameras could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause an affected
  IP camera to reload. This vulnerability is due to missing checks when processing Cisco Discovery
  Protocol messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco
  Discovery Protocol packet to an affected IP camera. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to cause the affected IP camera to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS)
  condition. Note: Cisco Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit this vulnerability,
  an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).'
