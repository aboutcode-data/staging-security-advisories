  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  media: nxp: imx8-isi: Check whether crossbar pad is non-NULL before access

  When translating source to sink streams in the crossbar subdev, the
  driver tries to locate the remote subdev connected to the sink pad. The
  remote pad may be NULL, if userspace tries to enable a stream that ends
  at an unconnected crossbar sink. When that occurs, the driver
  dereferences the NULL pad, leading to a crash.

  Prevent the crash by checking if the pad is NULL before using it, and
  return an error if it is.
