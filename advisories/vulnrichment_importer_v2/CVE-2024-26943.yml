  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  nouveau/dmem: handle kcalloc() allocation failure

  The kcalloc() in nouveau_dmem_evict_chunk() will return null if
  the physical memory has run out. As a result, if we dereference
  src_pfns, dst_pfns or dma_addrs, the null pointer dereference bugs
  will happen.

  Moreover, the GPU is going away. If the kcalloc() fails, we could not
  evict all pages mapping a chunk. So this patch adds a __GFP_NOFAIL
  flag in kcalloc().

  Finally, as there is no need to have physically contiguous memory,
  this patch switches kcalloc() to kvcalloc() in order to avoid
  failing allocations.
