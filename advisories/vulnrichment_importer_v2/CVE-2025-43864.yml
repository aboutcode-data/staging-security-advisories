aliases: []
summary: React Router is a router for React. Starting in version 7.2.0 and prior to version
  7.5.2, it is possible to force an application to switch to SPA mode by adding a header to
  the request. If the application uses SSR and is forced to switch to SPA, this causes an error
  that completely corrupts the page. If a cache system is in place, this allows the response
  containing the error to be cached, resulting in a cache poisoning that strongly impacts the
  availability of the application. This issue has been patched in version 7.5.2.
