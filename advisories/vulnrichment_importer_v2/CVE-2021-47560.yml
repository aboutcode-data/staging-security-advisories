  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mlxsw: spectrum: Protect driver from buggy firmware

  When processing port up/down events generated by the device's firmware,
  the driver protects itself from events reported for non-existent local
  ports, but not the CPU port (local port 0), which exists, but lacks a
  netdev.

  This can result in a NULL pointer dereference when calling
  netif_carrier_{on,off}().

  Fix this by bailing early when processing an event reported for the CPU
  port. Problem was only observed when running on top of a buggy emulator.
