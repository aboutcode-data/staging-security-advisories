aliases: []
summary: kanidim-provision is a helper utility that uses kanidm's API to provision users, groups
  and oauth2 systems. Prior to version 1.2.0, a faulty function intrumentation in the (optional)
  kanidm patches provided by kandim-provision will cause the provisioned admin credentials to
  be leaked to the system log. This only impacts users which both use the provided patches and
  provision their `admin` or `idm_admin` account credentials this way. No other credentials
  are affected. Users should recompile kanidm with the newest patchset from tag `v1.2.0` or
  higher. As a workaround, the user can set the log level `KANIDM_LOG_LEVEL` to any level higher
  than `info`, for example `warn`.
