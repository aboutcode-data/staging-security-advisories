aliases: []
summary: Sealos is a Cloud Operating System designed for managing cloud-native applications.
  In version 4.2.0 and prior, there is a permission flaw in the Sealos billing system, which
  allows users to control the recharge resource account `sealos[.] io/v1/Payment`, resulting
  in the ability to recharge any amount of 1 renminbi (RMB). The charging interface may expose
  resource information. The namespace of this custom resource would be user's control and may
  have permission to correct it. It is not clear whether a fix exists.
