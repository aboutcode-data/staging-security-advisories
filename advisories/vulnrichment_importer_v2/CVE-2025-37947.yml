summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ksmbd: prevent out-of-bounds stream writes by validating *pos

  ksmbd_vfs_stream_write() did not validate whether the write offset
  (*pos) was within the bounds of the existing stream data length (v_len).
  If *pos was greater than or equal to v_len, this could lead to an
  out-of-bounds memory write.

  This patch adds a check to ensure *pos is less than v_len before
  proceeding. If the condition fails, -EINVAL is returned.
