aliases: []
summary: Helm is a tool that streamlines installing and managing Kubernetes applications.`getHostByName`
  is a Helm template function introduced in Helm v3. The function is able to accept a hostname
  and return an IP address for that hostname. To get the IP address the function performs a
  DNS lookup. The DNS lookup happens when used with `helm install|upgrade|template` or when
  the Helm SDK is used to render a chart. Information passed into the chart can be disclosed
  to the DNS servers used to lookup the IP address. For example, a malicious chart could inject
  `getHostByName` into a chart in order to disclose values to a malicious DNS server. The issue
  has been fixed in Helm 3.11.1. Prior to using a chart with Helm verify the `getHostByName`
  function is not being used in a template to disclose any information you do not want passed
  to DNS servers.
