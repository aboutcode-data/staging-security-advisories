aliases: []
summary: 'Ghost 5.35.0 allows authorization bypass: contributors can view draft posts of other
  users, which is arguably inconsistent with a security policy in which a contributor''s draft
  can only be read by editors until published by an editor. NOTE: the vendor''s position is
  that this behavior has no security impact.'
