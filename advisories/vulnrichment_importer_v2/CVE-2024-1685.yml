aliases: []
summary: The Social Media Share Buttons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection
  in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.0 via deserialization of untrusted input through
  the attachmentUrl parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level
  access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable
  plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target
  system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or
  execute code.
