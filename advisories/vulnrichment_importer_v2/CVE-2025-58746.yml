aliases: []
summary: The Volkov Labs Business Links panel for Grafana provides an interface to navigate
  using external links, internal dashboards, time pickers, and dropdown menus. Prior to version
  2.4.0, a malicious actor with Editor privileges can escalate their privileges to Administrator
  and perform arbitrary administrative actions. This is possible because the plugin allows arbitrary
  JavaScript code injection in the [Layout] → [Link] → [URL] field. Version 2.4.0 contains a
  fix for the issue.
