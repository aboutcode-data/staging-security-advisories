aliases: []
summary: decidim is a Free Open-Source participatory democracy, citizen participation and open
  government for cities and organizations. The admin panel is subject to potential Cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attach in case an admin assigns a valuator to a proposal, or does any other
  action that generates an admin activity log where one of the resources has an XSS crafted.
  This issue has been addressed in release version 0.27.7, 0.28.2, and newer. Users are advised
  to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may redirect the pages /admin and /admin/logs to other
  admin pages to prevent this access (i.e. `/admin/organization/edit`).
