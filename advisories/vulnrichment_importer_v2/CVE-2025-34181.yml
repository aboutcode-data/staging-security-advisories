summary: NetSupport Manager < 14.12.0001 contains an arbitrary file write vulnerability in its
  Connectivity Server/Gateway PUTFILE request handler. An attacker with a valid Gateway Key

  locations on the server. This can be leveraged to place attacker-controlled DLLs or executables
  in privileged paths and achieve remote code execution in the context of the NetSupport Manager
  connectivity service.
