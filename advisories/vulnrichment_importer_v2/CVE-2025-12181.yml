aliases: []
summary: The ContentStudio plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due
  to missing file type validation in the cstu_update_post() function in all versions up to,
  and including, 1.3.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level
  access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote
  code execution possible.
