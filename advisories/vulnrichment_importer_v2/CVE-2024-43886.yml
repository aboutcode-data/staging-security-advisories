  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/amd/display: Add null check in resource_log_pipe_topology_update

  [WHY]
  When switching from "Extend" to "Second Display Only" we sometimes
  call resource_get_otg_master_for_stream on a stream for the eDP,
  which is disconnected. This leads to a null pointer dereference.

  [HOW]
  Added a null check in dc_resource.c/resource_log_pipe_topology_update.
