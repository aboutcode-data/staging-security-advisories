aliases: []
summary: Illustrator versions 29.2.1, 28.7.4 and earlier are affected by an Untrusted Search
  Path vulnerability that might allow attackers to execute their own programs, access unauthorized
  data files, or modify configuration in unexpected ways. If the application uses a search path
  to locate critical resources such as programs, then an attacker could modify that search path
  to point to a malicious program, which the targeted application would then execute. The problem
  extends to any type of critical resource that the application trusts.
