  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ipv6: fix another slab-out-of-bounds in fib6_nh_flush_exceptions

  While running the self-tests on a KASAN enabled kernel, I observed a
  slab-out-of-bounds splat very similar to the one reported in
  commit 821bbf79fe46 ("ipv6: Fix KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds Read in
   fib6_nh_flush_exceptions").

  We additionally need to take care of fib6_metrics initialization
  failure when the caller provides an nh.

  The fix is similar, explicitly free the route instead of calling
  fib6_info_release on a half-initialized object.
