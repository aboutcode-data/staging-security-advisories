aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Siime Eye 14.1.00000001.3.330.0.0.3.14. It uses a default
  SSID value, which makes it easier for remote attackers to discover the physical locations
  of many Siime Eye devices, violating the privacy of users who do not wish to disclose their
  ownership of this type of device. (Various resources such as wigle.net can be use for mapping
  of SSIDs to physical locations.)
