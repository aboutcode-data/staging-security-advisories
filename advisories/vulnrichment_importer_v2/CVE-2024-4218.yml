aliases: []
summary: The AffiEasy plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all
  versions up to, and including, 1.1.7. This is due to plugin improperly releasing the tagged
  and patched version of the plugin - the vulnerable version is used as the core files, while
  the patched version was included in a 'trunk' folder. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to perform a variety of actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site
  administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
