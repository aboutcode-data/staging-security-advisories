aliases: []
summary: The MStore API – Create Native Android & iOS Apps On The Cloud plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 4.14.7. This
  is due to insufficient verification on the 'phone' parameter of the 'firebase_sms_login' and
  'firebase_sms_login_v2' functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
  log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to
  the email address or phone number.  Additionally, if a new email address is supplied, a new
  user account is created with the default role, even if registration is disabled.
