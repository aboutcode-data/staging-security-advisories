aliases: []
summary: CGGMP24 is a state-of-art ECDSA TSS protocol that supports 1-round signing (requires
  3 preprocessing rounds), identifiable abort, and a key refresh protocol. Prior to version
  0.6.3, there is a missing check in the ZK proof that enables an attack in which single malicious
  signer can reconstruct full private key. This issue has been patched in version 0.6.3, for
  full mitigation it is recommended to upgrade to cggmp24 version 0.7.0-alpha.2 as it contains
  more security checks.
