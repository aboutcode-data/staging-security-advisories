aliases: []
summary: Icinga 2 is an open source monitoring system. Starting in version 2.3.0 and prior to
  versions 2.13.14, 2.14.8, and 2.15.2, the Icinga 2 MSI did not set appropriate permissions
  for the `%ProgramData%\icinga2\var` folder on Windows. This resulted in the its contents -
  including the private key of the user and synced configuration - being readable by all local
  users. All installations on Windows are affected. Versions 2.13.14, 2.14.8, and 2.15.2 contains
  a fix. There are two possibilities to work around the issue without upgrading Icinga 2. Upgrade
  Icinga for Windows to at least version v1.13.4, v1.12.4, or v1.11.2. These version will automatically
  fix the ACLs for the Icinga 2 agent as well. Alternatively, manually update the ACL for the
  given folder `C:\ProgramData\icinga2\var` (and `C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\modules\icinga-powershell-framework\certificate`
  to fix the issue for the Icinga for Windows as well) including every sub-folder and item to
  restrict access for general users, only allowing the Icinga service user and administrators
  access.
