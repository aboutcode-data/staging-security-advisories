aliases: []
summary: In Django 3.2 before 3.2.19, 4.x before 4.1.9, and 4.2 before 4.2.1, it was possible
  to bypass validation when using one form field to upload multiple files. This multiple upload
  has never been supported by forms.FileField or forms.ImageField (only the last uploaded file
  was validated). However, Django's "Uploading multiple files" documentation suggested otherwise.
