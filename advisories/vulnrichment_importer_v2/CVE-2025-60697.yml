aliases: []
summary: A command injection vulnerability exists in the D-Link DIR-882 Router firmware DIR882A1_FW102B02
  within the `prog.cgi` and `rc` binaries. The `sub_4438A4` function in `prog.cgi` stores user-supplied
  DDNS parameters (`ServerAddress` and `Hostname`) in NVRAM via `nvram_safe_set`. These values
  are later retrieved in the `start_DDNS_ipv4` function of `rc` using `nvram_safe_get` and concatenated
  into DDNS shell commands executed via `twsystem()` without proper sanitization. Partial string
  comparison is performed but is insufficient to prevent command injection. An unauthenticated
  remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands on the device
  through specially crafted HTTP requests to the router's web interface.
