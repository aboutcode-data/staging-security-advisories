  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  fbdev: efifb: Register sysfs groups through driver core

  The driver core can register and cleanup sysfs groups already.
  Make use of that functionality to simplify the error handling and
  cleanup.

  Also avoid a UAF race during unregistering where the sysctl attributes
  were usable after the info struct was freed.
