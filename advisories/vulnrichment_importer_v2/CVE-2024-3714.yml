aliases: []
summary: The GiveWP – Donation Plugin and Fundraising Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'give_form' shortcode when used with a legacy
  form in all versions up to, and including, 3.10.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and
  output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
  execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
