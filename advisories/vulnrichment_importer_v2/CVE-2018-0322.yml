summary: 'A vulnerability in the web management interface of Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning
  (PCP) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to modify sensitive data that is associated
  with arbitrary accounts on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a failure to enforce
  access restrictions on the Help Desk and User Provisioning roles that are assigned to authenticated
  users. This failure could allow an authenticated attacker to modify critical attributes of
  higher-privileged accounts on the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
  gain elevated privileges on the device. This vulnerability affects Cisco Prime Collaboration
  Provisioning (PCP) Releases 12.1 and prior. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd61779.'
