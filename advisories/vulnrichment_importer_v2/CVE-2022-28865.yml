summary: An issue was discovered in Nokia NetAct 22 through the Site Configuration Tool website
  section. A malicious user can change a filename of an uploaded file to include JavaScript
  code, which is then stored and executed by a victim's web browser. The most common mechanism
  for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly
  or e-mailed directly to victims. Here, the /netact/sct filename parameter is used.
