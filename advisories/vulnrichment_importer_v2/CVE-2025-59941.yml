aliases: []
summary: go-f3 is a Golang implementation of Fast Finality for Filecoin (F3). In versions 0.8.8
  and below, go-f3's justification verification caching mechanism has a vulnerability where
  verification results are cached without properly considering the context of the message. An
  attacker can bypass justification verification by submitting a valid message with a correct
  justification and then reusing the same cached justification in contexts where it would normally
  be invalid. This occurs because the cached verification does not properly validate the relationship
  between the justification and the specific message context it's being used with. This issue
  is fixed in version 0.8.9.
