summary: The Shortcode Menu plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via 'shortmenu' shortcode in versions up to, and including, 3.2 due to insufficient input

  attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in
  pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
