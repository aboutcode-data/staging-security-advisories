aliases: []
summary: Craft is a platform for creating digital experiences. In Craft versions 4.0.0-RC1 through
  4.16.17 and 5.0.0-RC1 through 5.8.21, the saveAsset GraphQL mutation validates the initial
  URL hostname and resolved IP against a blocklist, but Guzzle follows HTTP redirects by default.
  An attacker can bypass all SSRF protections by hosting a redirect that points to cloud metadata
  endpoints or any internal IP addresses. This issue is patched in versions 4.16.18 and 5.8.22.
