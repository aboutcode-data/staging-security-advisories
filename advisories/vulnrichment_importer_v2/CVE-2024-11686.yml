summary: The WhatsApp 🚀 click to chat plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
  Scripting via the 'manycontacts_code' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.4

  attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick
  a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
