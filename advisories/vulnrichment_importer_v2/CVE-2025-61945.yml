aliases: []
summary: Radiometrics VizAir is vulnerable to any remote attacker via access to the admin panel
  of the VizAir system without authentication. Once inside, the attacker can modify critical
  weather parameters such as wind shear alerts, inversion depth, and CAPE values, which are
  essential for accurate weather forecasting and flight safety. This unauthorized access could
  result in the disabling of vital alerts, causing hazardous conditions for aircraft, and manipulating
  runway assignments, which could result in mid-air conflicts or runway incursions.
