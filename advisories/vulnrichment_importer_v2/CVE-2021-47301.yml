  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  igb: Fix use-after-free error during reset

  Cleans the next descriptor to watch (next_to_watch) when cleaning the
  TX ring.

  Failure to do so can cause invalid memory accesses. If igb_poll() runs
  while the controller is reset this can lead to the driver try to free
  a skb that was already freed.

  (The crash is harder to reproduce with the igb driver, but the same
  potential problem exists as the code is identical to igc)
