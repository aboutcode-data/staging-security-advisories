aliases: []
summary: Flask-AppBuilder is an application development framework built on top of Flask. Versions
  prior to 4.6.2 would allow for a malicious unauthenticated actor to perform an open redirect
  by manipulating the Host header in HTTP requests. Flask-AppBuilder 4.6.2 introduced the `FAB_SAFE_REDIRECT_HOSTS`
  configuration variable, which allows administrators to explicitly define which domains are
  considered safe for redirection. As a workaround, use a reverse proxy to enforce trusted host
  headers.
