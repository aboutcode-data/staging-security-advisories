aliases: []
summary: An SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the berriai/litellm repository, specifically
  within the `/global/spend/logs` endpoint. The vulnerability arises due to improper neutralization
  of special elements used in an SQL command. The affected code constructs an SQL query by concatenating
  an unvalidated `api_key` parameter directly into the query, making it susceptible to SQL Injection
  if the `api_key` contains malicious data. This issue affects the latest version of the repository.
  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation,
  exposure of confidential information, and denial of service (DoS).
