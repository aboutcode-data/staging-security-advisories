aliases: []
summary: goauthentik is an open-source Identity Provider. In affected versions using a recovery
  flow with an identification stage an attacker is able to determine if a username exists. Only
  setups configured with a recovery flow are impacted by this. Anyone with a user account on
  a system with the recovery flow described above is susceptible to having their username/email
  revealed as existing. An attacker can easily enumerate and check users' existence using the
  recovery flow, as a clear message is shown when a user doesn't exist. Depending on configuration
  this can either be done by username, email, or both. This issue has been addressed in versions
  2023.5.6 and 2023.6.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
  issue.
