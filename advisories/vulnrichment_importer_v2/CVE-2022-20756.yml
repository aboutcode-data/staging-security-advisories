aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the RADIUS feature of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could
  allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the affected system to stop processing
  RADIUS packets. This vulnerability is due to improper handling of certain RADIUS requests.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to authenticate to a network or
  a service where the access server is using Cisco ISE as the RADIUS server. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to cause Cisco ISE to stop processing RADIUS requests, causing authentication/authorization
  timeouts, which would then result in legitimate requests being denied access. Note: To recover
  the ability to process RADIUS packets, a manual restart of the affected Policy Service Node
  (PSN) is required. See the Details section for more information.'
