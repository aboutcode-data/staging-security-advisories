aliases: []
summary: Memos is a privacy-first, lightweight note-taking service that uses Access Tokens to
  authenticate application access. When a user changes their password, the existing list of
  Access Tokens stay valid instead of expiring. If a user finds that their account has been
  compromised, they can update their password. In versions up to and including 0.18.1, though,
  the bad actor will still have access to their account because the bad actor's Access Token
  stays on the list as a valid token. The user will have to manually delete the bad actor's
  Access Token to secure their account. The list of Access Tokens has a generic Description
  which makes it hard to pinpoint a bad actor in a list of Access Tokens. A known patched version
  of Memos isn't available. To improve Memos security, all Access Tokens will need to be revoked
  when a user changes their password. This removes the session for all the user's devices and
  prompts the user to log in again. One can treat the old Access Tokens as "invalid" because
  those Access Tokens were created with the older password.
