summary: CVEProject/cve-services is an open source project used to operate the CVE services
  API. A conditional in 'data.js' has potential for production secrets to be written to disk.
  The affected method writes the generated randomKey to disk if the environment is not development.
  If this method were called in production, it is possible that it would write the plaintext
  key to disk. A patch is not available as of time of publication but is anticipated as a "hot
  fix" for version 1.1.1 and for the 2.x branch.
