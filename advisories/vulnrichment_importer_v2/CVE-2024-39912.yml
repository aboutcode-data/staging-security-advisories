aliases: []
summary: web-auth/webauthn-lib is an open source set of PHP libraries and a Symfony bundle to
  allow developers to integrate that authentication mechanism into their web applications. The
  ProfileBasedRequestOptionsBuilder method returns allowedCredentials without any credentials
  if no username was found. When WebAuthn is used as the first or only authentication method,
  an attacker can enumerate usernames based on the absence of the `allowedCredentials` property
  in the assertion options response. This allows enumeration of valid or invalid usernames.
  By knowing which usernames are valid, attackers can focus their efforts on a smaller set of
  potential targets, increasing the efficiency and likelihood of successful attacks. This issue
  has been addressed in version 4.9.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
  workarounds for this vulnerability.
