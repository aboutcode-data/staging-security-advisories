aliases: []
summary: 'gss_mech_free in net/sunrpc/auth_gss/gss_mech_switch.c in the rpcsec_gss_krb5 implementation
  in the Linux kernel through 5.6.10 lacks certain domain_release calls, leading to a memory
  leak. Note: This was disputed with the assertion that the issue does not grant any access
  not already available. It is a problem that on unloading a specific kernel module some memory
  is leaked, but loading kernel modules is a privileged operation. A user could also write a
  kernel module to consume any amount of memory they like and load that replicating the effect
  of this bug'
