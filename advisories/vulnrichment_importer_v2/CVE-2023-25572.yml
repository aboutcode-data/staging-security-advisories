aliases: []
summary: react-admin is a frontend framework for building browser applications on top of REST/GraphQL
  APIs. react-admin prior to versions 3.19.12 and 4.7.6, along with ra-ui-materialui prior to
  3.19.12 and 4.7.6, are vulnerable to cross-site scripting. All React applications built with
  react-admin and using the `<RichTextField>` are affected. `<RichTextField>` outputs the field
  value using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without client-side sanitization. If the data isn't
  sanitized server-side, this opens a possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. Versions 3.19.12
  and 4.7.6 now use `DOMPurify` to escape the HTML before outputting it with React and `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
  Users who already sanitize HTML data server-side do not need to upgrade. As a workaround,
  users may replace the `<RichTextField>` by a custom field doing sanitization by hand.
