aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Veeam Backup & Replication allows a low-privileged user to start
  an agent remotely in server mode and obtain credentials, effectively escalating privileges
  to system-level access. This allows the attacker to upload files to the server with elevated
  privileges. The vulnerability exists because remote calls bypass permission checks, leading
  to full system compromise.
