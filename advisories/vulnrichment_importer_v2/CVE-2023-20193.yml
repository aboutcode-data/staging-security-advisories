aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Embedded Service Router (ESR) of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated,
  local attacker to read, write, or delete arbitrary files on the underlying operating system
  and escalate their privileges to root. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have
  valid Administrator-level privileges on the affected device. This vulnerability is due to
  improper privilege management in the ESR console. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a crafted request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to elevate their privileges to root and read, write, or delete arbitrary files from the underlying
  operating system of the affected device. Note: The ESR is not enabled by default and must
  be licensed. To verify the status of the ESR in the Admin GUI, choose Administration > Settings
  > Protocols > IPSec.'
