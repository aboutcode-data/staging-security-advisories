aliases: []
summary: mintplex-labs/anything-llm is vulnerable to multiple security issues due to improper
  input validation in several endpoints. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to escalate
  privileges from a default user role to an admin role, read and delete arbitrary files on the
  system, and perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The vulnerabilities are present
  in the `/request-token`, `/workspace/:slug/thread/:threadSlug/update`, `/system/remove-logo`,
  `/system/logo`, and collector's `/process` endpoints. These issues are due to the application's
  failure to properly validate user input before passing it to `prisma` functions and other
  critical operations. Affected versions include the latest version prior to 1.0.0.
