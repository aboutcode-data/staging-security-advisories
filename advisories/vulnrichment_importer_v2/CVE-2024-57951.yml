summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhrtimers: Handle\
  \ CPU state correctly on hotplug\n\nConsider a scenario where a CPU transitions from CPUHP_ONLINE\
  \ to halfway\nthrough a CPU hotunplug down to CPUHP_HRTIMERS_PREPARE, and then back to\nCPUHP_ONLINE:\n\
  \nSince hrtimers_prepare_cpu() does not run, cpu_base.hres_active remains set\nto 1 throughout.\
  \ However, during a CPU unplug operation, the tick and the\nclockevents are shut down at CPUHP_AP_TICK_DYING.\
  \ On return to the online\nstate, for instance CFS incorrectly assumes that the hrtick is\
  \ already\nactive, and the chance of the clockevent device to transition to oneshot\nmode\
  \ is also lost forever for the CPU, unless it goes back to a lower state\nthan CPUHP_HRTIMERS_PREPARE\
  \ once.\n\nThis round-trip reveals another issue; cpu_base.online is not set to 1\nafter the\
  \ transition, which appears as a WARN_ON_ONCE in enqueue_hrtimer().\n\nAside of that, the\
  \ bulk of the per CPU state is not reset either, which\nmeans there are dangling pointers\
  \ in the worst case.\n\nAddress this by adding a corresponding startup() callback, which resets\
  \ the\nstale per CPU state and sets the online flag.\n\n[ tglx: Make the new callback unconditionally\
  \ available, remove the online\n  \tmodification in the prepare() callback and clear the remaining\n\
  \  \tstate in the starting callback instead of the prepare callback ]"
