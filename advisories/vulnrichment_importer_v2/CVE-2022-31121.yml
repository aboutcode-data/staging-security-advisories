aliases: []
summary: Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned distributed ledger framework. In affected versions
  if a consensus client sends a malformed consensus request to an orderer it may crash the orderer
  node. A fix has been added in commit 0f1835949 which checks for missing consensus messages
  and returns an error to the consensus client should the message be missing. Users are advised
  to upgrade to versions 2.2.7 or v2.4.5. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
