aliases: []
summary: sudo-rs is a memory safe implementation of sudo and su written in Rust. Starting in
  version 0.2.7 and prior to version 0.2.10, if a user begins entering a password but does not
  press return for an extended period, a password timeout may occur. When this happens, the
  keystrokes that were entered are echoed back to the console. This could reveal partial password
  information, possibly exposing history files when not carefully handled by the user and on
  screen, usable for Social Engineering or Pass-By attacks. Version 0.2.10 fixes the issue.
