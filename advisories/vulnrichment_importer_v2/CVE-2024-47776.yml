aliases: []
summary: GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An OOB-read
  has been discovered in gst_wavparse_cue_chunk within gstwavparse.c. The vulnerability happens
  due to a discrepancy between the size of the data buffer and the size value provided to the
  function. This mismatch causes the comparison  if (size < 4 + ncues * 24) to fail in some
  cases, allowing the subsequent loop to access beyond the bounds of the data buffer. The root
  cause of this discrepancy stems from a miscalculation when clipping the chunk size based on
  upstream data size. This vulnerability allows reading beyond the bounds of the data buffer,
  potentially leading to a crash (denial of service) or the leak of sensitive data. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 1.24.10.
