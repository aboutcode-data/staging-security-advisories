aliases: []
summary: The News Element Elementor Blog Magazine plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing
  Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.8. This is due to a missing capability
  check and nonce verification on the 'ne_clean_data' AJAX action. This makes it possible for
  authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to truncate 8 core WordPress
  database tables (posts, comments, terms, term_relationships, term_taxonomy, postmeta, commentmeta,
  termmeta) and delete the entire WordPress uploads directory, resulting in complete data loss.
