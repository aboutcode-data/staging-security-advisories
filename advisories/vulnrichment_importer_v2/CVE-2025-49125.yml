aliases: []
summary: "Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. \
  \ When using PreResources or PostResources mounted other than at the root of the web application,\
  \ it was possible to access those resources via an unexpected path. That path was likely not\
  \ to be protected by the same security constraints as the expected path, allowing those security\
  \ constraints to be bypassed.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through\
  \ 11.0.7, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.41, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.105.\nThe following versions\
  \ were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are \nknown to be affected: 8.5.0 through 8.5.100.\
  \ Other, older, EOL versions \nmay also be affected.\n\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade\
  \ to version 11.0.8, 10.1.42 or 9.0.106, which fix the issue."
