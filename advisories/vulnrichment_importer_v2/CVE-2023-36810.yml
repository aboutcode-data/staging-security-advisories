summary: pypdf is a pure-python PDF library capable of splitting, merging, cropping, and transforming
  the pages of PDF files. An attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads
  to unexpected long runtime. This quadratic runtime blocks the current process and can utilize
  a single core of the CPU by 100%. It does not affect memory usage. This issue has been addressed
  in PR 808 and versions from 1.27.9 include this fix. Users are advised to upgrade. There are
  no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
