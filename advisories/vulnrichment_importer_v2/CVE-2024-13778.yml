aliases: []
summary: The Hero Mega Menu - Responsive WordPress Menu Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to SQL Injection via several functions in all versions up to, and including, 1.16.5 due to
  insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on
  the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
  access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can
  be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
