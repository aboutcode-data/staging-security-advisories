aliases: []
summary: A command injection vulnerability exists in the gradio-app/gradio repository, specifically
  within the 'test-functional.yml' workflow. The vulnerability arises due to improper neutralization
  of special elements used in a command, allowing for unauthorized modification of the base
  repository or secrets exfiltration. The issue affects versions up to and including '@gradio/video@0.6.12'.
  The flaw is present in the workflow's handling of GitHub context information, where it echoes
  the full name of the head repository, the head branch, and the workflow reference without
  adequate sanitization. This could potentially lead to the exfiltration of sensitive secrets
  such as 'GITHUB_TOKEN', 'COMMENT_TOKEN', and 'CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN'.
