aliases: []
summary: "When passing data to the b64decode(), standard_b64decode(), and urlsafe_b64decode()\
  \ functions in the \"base64\" module the characters \"+/\" will always be accepted, regardless\
  \ of the value of \"altchars\" parameter, typically used to establish an \"alternative base64\
  \ alphabet\" such as the URL safe alphabet. This behavior matches what is recommended in earlier\
  \ base64 RFCs, but newer RFCs now recommend either dropping characters outside the specified\
  \ base64 alphabet or raising an error. The old behavior has the possibility of causing data\
  \ integrity issues.\n\n\n\n\nThis behavior can only be insecure if your application uses an\
  \ alternate base64 alphabet (without \"+/\"). If your application does not use the \"altchars\"\
  \ parameter or the urlsafe_b64decode() function, then your application does not use an alternative\
  \ base64 alphabet.\n\n\n\n\nThe attached patches DOES NOT make the base64-decode behavior\
  \ raise an error, as this would be a change in behavior and break existing programs. Instead,\
  \ the patch deprecates the behavior which will be replaced with the newly recommended behavior\
  \ in a future version of Python. Users are recommended to mitigate by verifying user-controlled\
  \ inputs match the base64 \nalphabet they are expecting or verify that their application would\
  \ not be \naffected if the b64decode() functions accepted \"+\" or \"/\" outside of altchars."
