aliases: []
summary: The Wux Blog Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due
  to insufficient file type validation in the 'wuxbt_insertImageNew' function in versions up
  to, and including, 3.0.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary
  files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
