aliases: []
summary: 'Race condition in PrivateFirewall 7.0.20.37 on Windows XP allows local users to bypass
  kernel-mode hook handlers, and execute dangerous code that would otherwise be blocked by a
  handler but not blocked by signature-based malware detection, via certain user-space memory
  changes during hook-handler execution, aka an argument-switch attack or a KHOBE attack.  NOTE:
  this issue is disputed by some third parties because it is a flaw in a protection mechanism
  for situations where a crafted program has already begun to execute'
