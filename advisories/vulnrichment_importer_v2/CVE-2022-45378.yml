summary: 'In the default configuration of Apache SOAP, an RPCRouterServlet is available without
  authentication. This gives an attacker the possibility to invoke methods on the classpath
  that meet certain criteria. Depending on what classes are available on the classpath this
  might even lead to arbitrary remote code execution. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects
  products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.'
