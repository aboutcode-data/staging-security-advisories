aliases: []
summary: 'OpenPrinting CUPS is an open source printing system for Linux and other Unix-like
  operating systems. In versions 2.4.12 and earlier, when the `AuthType` is set to anything
  but `Basic`, if the request contains an `Authorization: Basic ...` header, the password is
  not checked. This results in authentication bypass. Any configuration that allows an `AuthType`
  that is not `Basic` is affected. Version 2.4.13 fixes the issue.'
