aliases: []
summary: The Absolute Privacy plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in versions up to, and including, 2.1. This is due to missing nonce validation on the 'abpr_profileShortcode'
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change user email and password
  via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
  such as clicking on a link.
