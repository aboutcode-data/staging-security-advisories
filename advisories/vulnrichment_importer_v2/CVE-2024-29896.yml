aliases: []
summary: Astro-Shield is a library to compute the subresource integrity hashes for your JS scripts
  and CSS stylesheets. When automated CSP headers generation for SSR content is enabled and
  the web application serves content that can be partially controlled by external users, then
  it is possible that the CSP headers generation feature might be "allow-listing" malicious
  injected resources like inlined JS, or references to external malicious scripts. The fix is
  available in version 1.3.0.
