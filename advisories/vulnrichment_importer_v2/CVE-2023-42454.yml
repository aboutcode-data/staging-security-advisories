aliases: []
summary: SQLpage is a SQL-only webapp builder. Someone using SQLpage versions prior to 0.11.1,
  whose SQLpage instance is exposed publicly, with a database connection string specified in
  the `sqlpage/sqlpage.json` configuration file (not in an environment variable), with the web_root
  is the current working directory (the default), and with their database exposed publicly,
  is vulnerable to an attacker retrieving database connection information from SQLPage and using
  it to connect to their database directly. Version 0.11.0 fixes this issue. Some workarounds
  are available. Using an environment variable instead of the configuration file to specify
  the database connection string prevents exposing it on vulnerable versions. Using a different
  web root (that is not a parent of the SQLPage configuration directory) fixes the issue. One
  should also avoid exposing one's database publicly.
