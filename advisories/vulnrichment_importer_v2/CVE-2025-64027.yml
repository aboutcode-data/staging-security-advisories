aliases: []
summary: 'Snipe-IT v8.3.4 (build 20218) contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
  in the CSV Import workflow. When an invalid CSV file is uploaded, the application returns
  a progress_message value that is rendered as raw HTML in the admin interface. An attacker
  can intercept and modify the POST /livewire/update request to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript
  into the progress_message. Because the server accepts the modified input without sanitization
  and reflects it back to the user, arbitrary JavaScript executes in the browser of any authenticated
  admin who views the import page. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because the report
  only demonstrates that an authenticated user can choose to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack
  against himself.'
