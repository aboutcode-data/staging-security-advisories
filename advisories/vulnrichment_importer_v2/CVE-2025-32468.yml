aliases: []
summary: A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the BMPv3 Image Decoding functionality
  of the SAIL Image Decoding Library v0.9.8. When loading a specially crafted .bmp file, an
  integer overflow can be made to occur when calculating the stride for decoding. Afterwards,
  this will cause a heap-based buffer to overflow when decoding the image which can lead to
  remote code execution. An attacker will need to convince the library to read a file to trigger
  this vulnerability.
