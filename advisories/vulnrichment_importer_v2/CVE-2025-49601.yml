aliases: []
summary: In MbedTLS 3.3.0 before 3.6.4, mbedtls_lms_import_public_key does not check that the
  input buffer is at least 4 bytes before reading a 32-bit field, allowing a possible out-of-bounds
  read on truncated input. Specifically, an out-of-bounds read in mbedtls_lms_import_public_key
  allows context-dependent attackers to trigger a crash or limited adjacent-memory disclosure
  by supplying a truncated LMS (Leighton-Micali Signature) public-key buffer under four bytes.
  An LMS public key starts with a 4-byte type indicator. The function mbedtls_lms_import_public_key
  reads this type indicator before validating the size of its input.
