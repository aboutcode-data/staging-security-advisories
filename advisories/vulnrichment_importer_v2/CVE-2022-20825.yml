aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV110W,
  RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute
  arbitrary code or cause an affected device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial
  of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation
  of incoming HTTP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted
  request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device using root-level privileges. Cisco has
  not released software updates that address this vulnerability.
