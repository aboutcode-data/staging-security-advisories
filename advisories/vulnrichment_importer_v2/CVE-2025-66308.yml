aliases: []
summary: This admin plugin for Grav is an HTML user interface that provides a convenient way
  to configure Grav and easily create and modify pages. Prior to 1.11.0-beta.1, a Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the /admin/config/site endpoint of the Grav
  application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the data[taxonomies]
  parameter. The injected payload is stored on the server and automatically executed in the
  browser of any user who accesses the affected site configuration, resulting in a persistent
  attack vector. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.11.0-beta.1.
