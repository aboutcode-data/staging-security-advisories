summary: The WP Event Manager – Events Calendar, Registrations, Sell Tickets with WooCommerce
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘organizer_name'

  and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary
  web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
