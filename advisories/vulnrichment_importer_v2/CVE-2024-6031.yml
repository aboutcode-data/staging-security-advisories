summary: "Tesla Model S oFono AT Command Heap-based Buffer Overflow Code Execution Vulnerability.\
  \ This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected Tesla Model\
  \ S vehicles. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute code on the target modem\
  \ in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n \nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing\
  \ of responses from AT commands. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the\
  \ length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can\
  \ leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device. Was ZDI-CAN-23198."
