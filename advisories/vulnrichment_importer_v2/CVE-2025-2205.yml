summary: The GDPR Cookie Compliance – Cookie Banner, Cookie Consent, Cookie Notice – CCPA, DSGVO,
  RGPD plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings
  in all versions up to, and including, 4.15.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
  escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions
  and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
  an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
  has been disabled.
