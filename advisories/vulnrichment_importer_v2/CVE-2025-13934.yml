aliases: []
summary: The Tutor LMS – eLearning and online course solution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to unauthorized course enrollment in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.3. This is due
  to a missing capability check and purchasability validation in the `course_enrollment()` AJAX
  handler. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber level access
  and above, to enroll themselves in any course without going through the proper purchase flow.
