aliases: []
summary: The WP Job Portal – A Complete Recruitment System for Company or Job Board website
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion, Arbitrary Settings Update, and
  User Creation in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.6 via several functions called by
  the 'checkFormRequest' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include
  and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those
  files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code
  execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included.
  Attackers can also update arbitrary settings and create user accounts even when registration
  is disabled, leading to user creation with a default role of Administrator.
