  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  scsi: core: Fix unremoved procfs host directory regression

  Commit fc663711b944 ("scsi: core: Remove the /proc/scsi/${proc_name}
  directory earlier") fixed a bug related to modules loading/unloading, by
  adding a call to scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on scsi_remove_host(). But that led
  to a potential duplicate call to the hostdir_rm() routine, since it's also
  called from scsi_host_dev_release(). That triggered a regression report,
  which was then fixed by commit be03df3d4bfe ("scsi: core: Fix a procfs host
  directory removal regression"). The fix just dropped the hostdir_rm() call
  from dev_release().

  But it happens that this proc directory is created on scsi_host_alloc(),
  and that function "pairs" with scsi_host_dev_release(), while
  scsi_remove_host() pairs with scsi_add_host(). In other words, it seems the
  reason for removing the proc directory on dev_release() was meant to cover
  cases in which a SCSI host structure was allocated, but the call to
  scsi_add_host() didn't happen. And that pattern happens to exist in some
  error paths, for example.

  Syzkaller causes that by using USB raw gadget device, error'ing on
  usb-storage driver, at usb_stor_probe2(). By checking that path, we can see
  that the BadDevice label leads to a scsi_host_put() after a SCSI host
  allocation, but there's no call to scsi_add_host() in such path. That leads
  to messages like this in dmesg (and a leak of the SCSI host proc
  structure):

  usb-storage 4-1:87.51: USB Mass Storage device detected
  proc_dir_entry 'scsi/usb-storage' already registered
  WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 3519 at fs/proc/generic.c:377 proc_register+0x347/0x4e0 fs/proc/generic.c:376

  The proper fix seems to still call scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on dev_release(),
  but guard that with the state check for SHOST_CREATED; there is even a
  comment in scsi_host_dev_release() detailing that: such conditional is
  meant for cases where the SCSI host was allocated but there was no calls to
  {add,remove}_host(), like the usb-storage case.

  This is what we propose here and with that, the error path of usb-storage
  does not trigger the warning anymore.
