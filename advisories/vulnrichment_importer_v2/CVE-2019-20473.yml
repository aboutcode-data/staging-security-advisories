summary: An issue was discovered on TK-Star Q90 Junior GPS horloge 3.1042.9.8656 devices. Any
  SIM card used with the device cannot have a PIN configured. If a PIN is configured, the device
  simply produces a "Remove PIN and restart!" message, and cannot be used. This makes it easier
  for an attacker to use the SIM card by stealing the device.
