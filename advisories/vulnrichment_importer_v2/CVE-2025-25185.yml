aliases: []
summary: GPT Academic provides interactive interfaces for large language models. In 3.91 and
  earlier, GPT Academic does not properly account for soft links. An attacker can create a malicious
  file as a soft link pointing to a target file, then package this soft link file into a tar.gz
  file and upload it. Subsequently, when accessing the decompressed file from the server, the
  soft link will point to the target file on the victim server. The vulnerability allows attackers
  to read all files on the server.
