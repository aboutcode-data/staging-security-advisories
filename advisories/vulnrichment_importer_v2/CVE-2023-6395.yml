aliases: []
summary: The Mock software contains a vulnerability wherein an attacker could potentially exploit
  privilege escalation, enabling the execution of arbitrary code with root user privileges.
  This weakness stems from the absence of proper sandboxing during the expansion and execution
  of Jinja2 templates, which may be included in certain configuration parameters. While the
  Mock documentation advises treating users added to the mock group as privileged, certain build
  systems invoking mock on behalf of users might inadvertently permit less privileged users
  to define configuration tags. These tags could then be passed as parameters to mock during
  execution, potentially leading to the utilization of Jinja2 templates for remote privilege
  escalation and the execution of arbitrary code as the root user on the build server.
