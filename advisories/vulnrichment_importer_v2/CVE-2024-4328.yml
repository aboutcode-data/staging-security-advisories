aliases: []
summary: A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the clear_personality_files_list
  function of the parisneo/lollms-webui v9.6. The vulnerability arises from the use of a GET
  request to clear personality files list, which lacks proper CSRF protection. This flaw allows
  attackers to trick users into performing actions without their consent, such as deleting important
  files on the system. The issue is present in the application's handling of requests, making
  it susceptible to CSRF attacks that could lead to unauthorized actions being performed on
  behalf of the user.
