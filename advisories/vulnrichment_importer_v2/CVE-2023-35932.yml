aliases: []
summary: jcvi is a Python library to facilitate genome assembly, annotation, and comparative
  genomics. A configuration injection happens when user input is considered by the application
  in an unsanitized format and can reach the configuration file. A malicious user may craft
  a special payload that may lead to a command injection. The impact of a configuration injection
  may vary. Under some conditions, it may lead to command injection if there is for instance
  shell code execution from the configuration file values. This vulnerability does not currently
  have a fix.
