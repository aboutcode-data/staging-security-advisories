aliases: []
summary: The Sticky Action Buttons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce
  validation on the sabs_options_page_form_submit() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to update plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
