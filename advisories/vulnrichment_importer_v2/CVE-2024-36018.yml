  nouveau/uvmm: fix addr/range calcs for remap operations

  dEQP-VK.sparse_resources.image_rebind.2d_array.r64i.128_128_8
  was causing a remap operation like the below.

  op_remap: prev: 0000003fffed0000 00000000000f0000 00000000a5abd18a 0000000000000000
  op_remap: next:
  op_remap: unmap: 0000003fffed0000 0000000000100000 0
  op_map: map: 0000003ffffc0000 0000000000010000 000000005b1ba33c 00000000000e0000

  This was resulting in an unmap operation from 0x3fffed0000+0xf0000, 0x100000
  which was corrupting the pagetables and oopsing the kernel.

  Fixes the prev + unmap range calcs to use start/end and map back to addr/range.
