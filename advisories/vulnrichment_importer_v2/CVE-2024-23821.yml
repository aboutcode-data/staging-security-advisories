aliases: []
summary: GeoServer is an open source software server written in Java that allows users to share
  and edit geospatial data. A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in versions
  prior to 2.23.4 and 2.24.1 that enables an authenticated administrator with workspace-level
  privileges to store a JavaScript payload in the GeoServer catalog that will execute in the
  context of another user's browser when viewed in the GWC Demos Page.  Access to the GWC Demos
  Page is available to all users although data security may limit users' ability to trigger
  the XSS. Versions 2.23.4 and 2.24.1 contain a patch for this issue.
