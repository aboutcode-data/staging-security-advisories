aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the bootstrap loading of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated,\
  \ local attacker to write arbitrary files to an affected system.\r\n\r This vulnerability\
  \ is due to insufficient input validation of the bootstrap file that is read by the system\
  \ software when a device is first deployed in SD-WAN mode or when an administrator configures\
  \ SD-Routing on the device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying a bootstrap\
  \ file generated by Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager, loading it into the device flash, and then\
  \ either reloading the device in a green field deployment in SD-WAN mode or configuring the\
  \ device with SD-Routing. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary\
  \ file writes to the underlying operating system."
