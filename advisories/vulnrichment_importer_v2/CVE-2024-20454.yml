summary: "Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business\
  \ SPA300 Series IP Phones and Cisco Small Business SPA500 Series IP Phones could allow an\
  \ unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating\
  \ system with root privileges.\r\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities exist because incoming HTTP packets\
  \ are not properly checked for errors, which could result in a buffer overflow. An attacker\
  \ could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device.\
  \ A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overflow an internal buffer and execute\
  \ arbitrary commands at the root privilege level."
