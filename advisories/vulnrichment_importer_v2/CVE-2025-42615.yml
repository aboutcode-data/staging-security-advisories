aliases: []
summary: "In affected versions, vulnerability-lookup did not track or limit failed\n One-Time\
  \ Password (OTP) attempts during Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)\n verification. An attacker\
  \ who already knew or guessed a valid username \nand password could submit an arbitrary number\
  \ of OTP codes without \ncausing the account to be locked or generating any specific alert\
  \ for \nadministrators.\n\n\nThis lack of rate-limiting and lockout on OTP failures significantly\
  \ \nlowers the cost of online brute-force attacks against 2FA codes and \nincreases the risk\
  \ of successful account takeover, especially if OTP \nentropy is reduced (e.g. short numeric\
  \ codes, user reuse, or predictable\n tokens). Additionally, administrators had no direct\
  \ visibility into \naccounts experiencing repeated 2FA failures, making targeted attacks \n\
  harder to detect and investigate.\n\n\nThe patch introduces a persistent failed_otp_attempts\
  \ counter on user \naccounts, locks the user after 5 invalid OTP submissions, resets the \n\
  counter on successful verification, and surfaces failed 2FA attempts in \nthe admin user list.\
  \ This enforces an account lockout policy for OTP \nbrute-force attempts and improves monitoring\
  \ capabilities for suspicious\n 2FA activity.This issue affects Vulnerability-Lookup: before\
  \ 2.18.0."
