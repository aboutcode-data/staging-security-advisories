summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  kunit/overflow: Fix UB in overflow_allocation_test

  The 'device_name' array doesn't exist out of the
  'overflow_allocation_test' function scope. However, it is being used as
  a driver name when calling 'kunit_driver_create' from
  'kunit_device_register'. It produces the kernel panic with KASAN
  enabled.

  Since this variable is used in one place only, remove it and pass the
  device name into kunit_device_register directly as an ascii string.
