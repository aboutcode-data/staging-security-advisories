aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the web management interface of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco
  Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform an unauthorized
  system reset on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper authorization controls
  for a specific URL in the web management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could have a
  twofold impact: the attacker could either change the administrator password, gaining privileged
  access, or reset the network configuration details, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition.
  In both scenarios, manual intervention is required to restore normal operations.'
