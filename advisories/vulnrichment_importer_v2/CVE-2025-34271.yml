aliases: []
summary: Nagios Log Server versions prior to 2024R2.0.2 contain a vulnerability in the cluster
  manager component when requesting sensitive credentials from peer nodes over an unencrypted
  channel even when SSL/TLS is enabled in the product configuration. As a result, an attacker
  positioned on the network path can intercept credentials in transit. Captured credentials
  could allow the attacker to authenticate as a cluster node or service account, enabling further
  unauthorized access, lateral movement, or system compromise.
