aliases: []
summary: Bagisto is an open source laravel eCommerce platform. In Bagisto v2.3.7, the “Create
  New Customer” feature (in the admin panel) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). An
  attacker with access to the admin create-customer form can inject malicious JavaScript payloads
  into certain input fields. These payloads may later execute in the context of an admin’s browser
  or another user viewing the customer data, enabling session theft or admin-level actions.
  This vulnerability is fixed in 2.3.8.
