aliases: []
summary: Incus is a system container and virtual machine manager. When using an ACL on a device
  connected to a bridge, Incus version 6.12 and 6.13 generates nftables rules for local services
  (DHCP, DNS...) that partially bypass security options `security.mac_filtering`, `security.ipv4_filtering`
  and `security.ipv6_filtering`. This can lead to DHCP pool exhaustion and opens the door for
  other attacks. A patch is available at commit 2516fb19ad8428454cb4edfe70c0a5f0dc1da214.
