aliases: []
summary: 'runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification.
  In versions 1.2.7 and below, 1.3.0-rc.1 through 1.3.1, 1.4.0-rc.1 and 1.4.0-rc.2 files, runc
  would not perform sufficient verification that the source of the bind-mount (i.e., the container''s
  /dev/null) was actually a real /dev/null inode when using the container''s /dev/null to mask.
  This exposes two methods of attack:  an arbitrary mount gadget, leading to host information
  disclosure, host denial of service, container escape, or a bypassing of maskedPaths. This
  issue is fixed in versions 1.2.8, 1.3.3 and 1.4.0-rc.3.'
