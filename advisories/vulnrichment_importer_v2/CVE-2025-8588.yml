summary: The Gutenberg Blocks – PublishPress Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
  Cross-Site Scripting via the 'Marker Title' and 'Marker Description' parameters for the Maps
  block in versions up to, and including, 3.3.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
  escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level access
  and above to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
  an injected page.
