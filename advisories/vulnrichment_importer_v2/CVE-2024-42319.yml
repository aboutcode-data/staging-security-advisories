  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mailbox: mtk-cmdq: Move devm_mbox_controller_register() after devm_pm_runtime_enable()

  When mtk-cmdq unbinds, a WARN_ON message with condition
  pm_runtime_get_sync() < 0 occurs.

  According to the call tracei below:
    cmdq_mbox_shutdown
    mbox_free_channel
    mbox_controller_unregister
    __devm_mbox_controller_unregister
    ...

  The root cause can be deduced to be calling pm_runtime_get_sync() after
  calling pm_runtime_disable() as observed below:
  1. CMDQ driver uses devm_mbox_controller_register() in cmdq_probe()
     to bind the cmdq device to the mbox_controller, so
     devm_mbox_controller_unregister() will automatically unregister
     the device bound to the mailbox controller when the device-managed
     resource is removed. That means devm_mbox_controller_unregister()
     and cmdq_mbox_shoutdown() will be called after cmdq_remove().
  2. CMDQ driver also uses devm_pm_runtime_enable() in cmdq_probe() after
     devm_mbox_controller_register(), so that devm_pm_runtime_disable()
     will be called after cmdq_remove(), but before
     devm_mbox_controller_unregister().

  To fix this problem, cmdq_probe() needs to move
  devm_mbox_controller_register() after devm_pm_runtime_enable() to make
  devm_pm_runtime_disable() be called after
  devm_mbox_controller_unregister().
