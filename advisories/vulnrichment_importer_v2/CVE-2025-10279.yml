aliases: []
summary: In mlflow version 2.20.3, the temporary directory used for creating Python virtual
  environments is assigned insecure world-writable permissions (0o777). This vulnerability allows
  an attacker with write access to the `/tmp` directory to exploit a race condition and overwrite
  `.py` files in the virtual environment, leading to arbitrary code execution. The issue is
  resolved in version 3.4.0.
