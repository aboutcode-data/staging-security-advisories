aliases: []
summary: spbu_se_site is the website of the Department of System Programming of St. Petersburg
  State University. Before 2024.01.29, when uploading an avatar image, an authenticated user
  may intentionally use a large Unicode filename which would lead to a server-side denial of
  service under Windows. This is due to no limitation of the length of the filename and the
  costly use of the Unicode normalization with the form NFKD on Windows OS.  This vulnerability
  was fixed in the 2024.01.29 release.
