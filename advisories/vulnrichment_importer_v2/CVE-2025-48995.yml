aliases: []
summary: SignXML is an implementation of the W3C XML Signature standard in Python. When verifying
  signatures with X509 certificate validation turned off and HMAC shared secret set (`signxml.XMLVerifier.verify(require_x509=False,
  hmac_key=...`), versions of SignXML prior to 4.0.4 are vulnerable to a potential timing attack.
  The verifier may leak information about the correct HMAC when comparing it with the user supplied
  hash, allowing users to reconstruct the correct HMAC for any data.
