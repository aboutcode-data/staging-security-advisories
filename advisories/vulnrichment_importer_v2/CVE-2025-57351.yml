aliases: []
summary: A prototype pollution vulnerability exists in the ts-fns package versions prior to
  13.0.7, where insufficient validation of user-provided keys in the assign function allows
  attackers to manipulate the Object.prototype chain. By leveraging this flaw, adversaries may
  inject arbitrary properties into the global object's prototype, potentially leading to application
  crashes, unexpected code execution behaviors, or bypasses of security-critical validation
  logic dependent on prototype integrity. The vulnerability stems from improper handling of
  deep property assignment operations within the library's public API functions. This issue
  remains unaddressed in the latest available version.
