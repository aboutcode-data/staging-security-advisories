aliases: []
summary: ZimaOS is a fork of CasaOS, an operating system for Zima devices and x86-64 systems
  with UEFI. In version 1.2.4 and all prior versions, the API endpoint `http://<Server-IP>/v1/users/login`
  in ZimaOS returns distinct responses based on whether a username exists or the password is
  incorrect. This behavior can be exploited for username enumeration, allowing attackers to
  determine whether a user exists in the system or not. Attackers can leverage this information
  in further attacks, such as credential stuffing or targeted password brute-forcing. As of
  time of publication, no known patched versions are available.
