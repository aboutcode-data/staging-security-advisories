aliases: []
summary: The physical IoT device of the AliveCor's KardiaMobile, a smartphone-based personal
  electrocardiogram (EKG) has no encryption for its data-over-sound protocols. Exploiting this
  vulnerability could allow an attacker to read patient EKG results or create a denial-of-service
  condition by emitting sounds at similar frequencies as the device, disrupting the smartphone
  microphone’s ability to accurately read the data. To carry out this attack, the attacker must
  be close (less than 5 feet) to pick up and emit sound waves.
