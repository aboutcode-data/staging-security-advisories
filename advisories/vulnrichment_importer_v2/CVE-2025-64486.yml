aliases: []
summary: calibre is an e-book manager. In versions 8.13.0 and prior, calibre does not validate
  filenames when handling binary assets in FB2 files, allowing an attacker to write arbitrary
  files on the filesystem when viewing or converting a malicious FictionBook file. This can
  be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution. This issue is fixed in version 8.14.0.
