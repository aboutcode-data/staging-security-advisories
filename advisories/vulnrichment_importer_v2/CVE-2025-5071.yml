aliases: []
summary: The AI Engine plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data
  and loss of data due to a missing capability check on the 'Meow_MWAI_Labs_MCP::can_access_mcp'
  function in versions 2.8.0 to 2.8.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
  subscriber-level access and above, to have full access to the MCP and run various commands
  like 'wp_create_user', 'wp_update_user' and 'wp_update_option', which can be used for privilege
  escalation, and 'wp_update_post', 'wp_delete_post', 'wp_update_comment' and 'wp_delete_comment',
  which can be used to edit and delete posts and comments.
