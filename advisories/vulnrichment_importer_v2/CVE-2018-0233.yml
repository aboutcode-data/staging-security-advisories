summary: 'A vulnerability in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) packet reassembly functionality
  of the detection engine in Cisco Firepower System Software could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to cause the detection engine to consume excessive system memory on an affected
  device, which could cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to
  the affected software improperly handling changes to SSL connection states. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SSL connections through an affected device.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the detection engine to consume excessive
  system memory on the affected device, which could cause a DoS condition. The device may need
  to be reloaded manually to recover from this condition. This vulnerability affects Cisco Firepower
  System Software Releases 6.0.0 and later, running on any of the following Cisco products:
  Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 5500-X Series Firewalls with FirePOWER Services, Adaptive
