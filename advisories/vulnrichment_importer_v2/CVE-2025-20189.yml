aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the Cisco Express Forwarding functionality of Cisco IOS XE Software\
  \ for Cisco ASR 903 Aggregation Services Routers with Route Switch Processor 3 (RSP3C) could\
  \ allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\
  \n\r This vulnerability is due to improper memory management when Cisco IOS XE Software is\
  \ processing Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by sending crafted ARP messages at a high rate over a period of time to an affected device.\
  \ A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust system resources, which eventually\
  \ triggers a reload of the active route switch processor (RSP). If a redundant RSP is not\
  \ present, the router reloads."
