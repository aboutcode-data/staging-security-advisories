aliases: []
summary: Hydra is a continuous integration service for Nix based projects. Prior to commit dea1e16,
  a malicious package can introduce arbitrary JavaScript code into the Hydra database that is
  automatically evaluated in a client's browser when anyone visits the build page. This could
  be done by a third-party project as part of its build process. This also happens in other
  places like with hydra-release-name. This issue has been patched by commit dea1e16. A workaround
  involves either not building untrusted packages or not visiting the builds page.
