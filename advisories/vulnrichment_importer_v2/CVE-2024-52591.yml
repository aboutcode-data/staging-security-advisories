aliases: []
summary: Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. In affected versions missing
  validation in `ApRequestService.signedGet` and `HttpRequestService.getActivityJson` allows
  an attacker to create fake user profiles and forged notes. The spoofed users will appear to
  be from a different instance than the one where they actually exist, and the forged notes
  will appear to be posted by a different user. Vulnerable Misskey instances will accept the
  spoofed objects as valid, allowing an attacker to impersonate other users and instances. The
  attacker retains full control of the spoofed user / note and can interact like a real account.
  This issue has been addressed in version 2024.11.0-alpha.3. Users are advised to upgrade.
  There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
