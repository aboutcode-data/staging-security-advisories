aliases: []
summary: FreeScout is a free help desk and shared inbox built with PHP's Laravel framework.
  Prior to version 1.8.206, FreeScout's `TokenAuth` middleware uses a predictable authentication
  token computed as `MD5(user_id + created_at + APP_KEY)`. This token is static (never expires/rotates),
  and if an attacker obtains the `APP_KEY` — a well-documented and common exposure vector in
  Laravel applications — they can compute a valid token for any user, including the administrator,
  achieving full account takeover without any password. This vulnerability can be exploited
  on its own or in combination with CVE-2026-27636. Version 1.8.206 fixes both vulnerabilities.
