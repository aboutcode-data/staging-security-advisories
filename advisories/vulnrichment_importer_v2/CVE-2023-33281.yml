aliases: []
summary: 'The remote keyfob system on Nissan Sylphy Classic 2021 sends the same RF signal for
  each door-open request, which allows for a replay attack. NOTE: the vendor''s position is
  that this cannot be reproduced with genuine Nissan parts: for example, the combination of
  keyfob and door handle shown in the exploit demonstration does not match any technology that
  Nissan provides to customers.'
