aliases: []
summary: Lobe Chat is an open-source artificial intelligence chat framework. Prior to version
  1.130.1, the project's OIDC redirect handling logic constructs the host and protocol of the
  final redirect URL based on the X-Forwarded-Host or Host headers and the X-Forwarded-Proto
  value. In deployments where a reverse proxy forwards client-supplied X-Forwarded-* headers
  to the origin as-is, or where the origin trusts them without validation, an attacker can inject
  an arbitrary host and trigger an open redirect that sends users to a malicious domain. This
  issue has been patched in version 1.130.1.
