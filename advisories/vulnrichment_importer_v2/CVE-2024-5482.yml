aliases: []
summary: A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the 'add_webpage' endpoint
  of the parisneo/lollms-webui application, affecting the latest version. The vulnerability
  arises because the application does not adequately validate URLs entered by users, allowing
  them to input arbitrary URLs, including those that target internal resources such as 'localhost'
  or '127.0.0.1'. This flaw enables attackers to make unauthorized requests to internal or external
  systems, potentially leading to access to sensitive data, service disruption, network integrity
  compromise, business logic manipulation, and abuse of third-party resources. The issue is
  critical and requires immediate attention to maintain the application's security and integrity.
