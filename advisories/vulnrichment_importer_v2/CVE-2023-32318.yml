aliases: []
summary: Nextcloud server provides a home for data. A regression in the session handling between
  Nextcloud Server and the Nextcloud Text app prevented a correct destruction of the session
  on logout if cookies were not cleared manually. After successfully authenticating with any
  other account the previous session would be continued and the attacker would be authenticated
  as the previously logged in user. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded
  to 25.0.6 or 26.0.1.
