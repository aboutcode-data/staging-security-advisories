aliases: []
summary: malcontent discovers supply-chain compromises through. context, differential analysis,
  and YARA. Starting in version 0.10.0 and prior to version 1.20.3, malcontent could be made
  to expose Docker registry credentials if it scanned a specially crafted OCI image reference.
  malcontent uses google/go-containerregistry for OCI image pulls, which by default uses the
  Docker credential keychain. A malicious registry could return a `WWW-Authenticate` header
  redirecting token authentication to an attacker-controlled endpoint, causing credentials to
  be sent to that endpoint. Version 1.20.3 fixes the issue by defaulting to anonymous auth for
  OCI pulls.
