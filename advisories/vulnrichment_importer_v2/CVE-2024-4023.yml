aliases: []
summary: A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in flatpressblog/flatpress
  version 1.3. When a user uploads a file with a `.xsig` extension and directly accesses this
  file, the server responds with a Content-type of application/octet-stream, leading to the
  file being processed as an HTML file. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript
  code, which can be used to steal user cookies, perform HTTP requests, and access content of
  the same origin.
