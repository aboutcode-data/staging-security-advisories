summary: The Thumbnail carousel slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery in version 1.0. This is due to missing nonce validation on the deleteselected function.
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete sliders in bulk via a forged
  request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
  on a link.
