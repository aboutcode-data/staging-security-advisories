aliases: []
summary: Panda3D versions up to and including 1.10.16 egg-mkfont contains a stack-based buffer
  overflow vulnerability due to use of an unbounded sprintf() call with attacker-controlled
  input. When constructing glyph filenames, egg-mkfont formats a user-supplied glyph pattern
  (-gp) into a fixed-size stack buffer without length validation. Supplying an excessively long
  glyph pattern string can overflow the stack buffer, resulting in memory corruption and a deterministic
  crash. Depending on build configuration and execution environment, the overflow may also be
  exploitable for arbitrary code execution.
