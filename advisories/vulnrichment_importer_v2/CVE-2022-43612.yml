summary: This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected
  installations of Corel CorelDRAW Graphics Suite 23.5.0.506. User interaction is required to
  exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious
  file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of JP2 images. The issue results from the
  lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of
  an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities
  to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-16355.
