aliases: []
summary: vodozemac is an open source implementation of Olm and Megolm in pure Rust.  Versions
  before 0.7.0 of vodozemac use a non-constant time base64 implementation for importing key
  material for Megolm group sessions and `PkDecryption` Ed25519 secret keys. This flaw might
  allow an attacker to infer some information about the secret key material through a side-channel
  attack. The use of a non-constant time base64 implementation might allow an attacker to observe
  timing variations in the encoding and decoding operations of the secret key material. This
  could potentially provide insights into the underlying secret key material. The impact of
  this vulnerability is considered low because exploiting the attacker is required to have access
  to high precision timing measurements, as well as repeated access to the base64 encoding or
  decoding processes.  Additionally, the estimated leakage amount is bounded and low according
  to the referenced paper. This has been patched in commit 734b6c6948d4b2bdee3dd8b4efa591d93a61d272
  which has been included in release version 0.7.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are
  no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
