aliases: []
summary: Navidrome is an open source web-based music collection server and streamer. Navidrome
  automatically adds parameters in the URL to SQL queries. This can be exploited to access information
  by adding parameters like `password=...` in the URL (ORM Leak). Furthermore, the names of
  the parameters are not properly escaped, leading to SQL Injections. Finally, the username
  is used in a `LIKE` statement, allowing people to log in with `%` instead of their username.
  When adding parameters to the URL, they are automatically included in an SQL `LIKE` statement
  (depending on the parameter's name). This allows attackers to potentially retrieve arbitrary
  information. For example, attackers can use the following request to test whether some encrypted
  passwords start with `AAA`. This results in an SQL query like `password LIKE 'AAA%'`, allowing
  attackers to slowly brute-force passwords. When adding parameters to the URL, they are automatically
  added to an SQL query. The names of the parameters are not properly escaped. This behavior
  can be used to inject arbitrary SQL code (SQL Injection). These vulnerabilities can be used
  to leak information and dump the contents of the database and have been addressed in release
  version 0.53.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
