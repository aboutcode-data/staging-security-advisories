aliases: []
summary: The MW WP Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion in all
  versions up to, and including, 5.0.3. This is due to the plugin not properly validating the
  path of an uploaded file prior to deleting it. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to delete arbitrary files, including the wp-config.php file, which can make site
  takeover and remote code execution possible.
