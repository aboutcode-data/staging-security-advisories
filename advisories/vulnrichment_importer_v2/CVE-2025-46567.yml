aliases: []
summary: LLama Factory enables fine-tuning of large language models. Prior to version 1.0.0,
  a critical vulnerability exists in the `llamafy_baichuan2.py` script of the LLaMA-Factory
  project. The script performs insecure deserialization using `torch.load()` on user-supplied
  `.bin` files from an input directory. An attacker can exploit this behavior by crafting a
  malicious `.bin` file that executes arbitrary commands during deserialization. This issue
  has been patched in version 1.0.0.
