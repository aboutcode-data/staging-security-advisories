  net: mscc: ocelot: fix use-after-free in ocelot_vlan_del()

  ocelot_vlan_member_del() will free the struct ocelot_bridge_vlan, so if
  this is the same as the port's pvid_vlan which we access afterwards,
  what we're accessing is freed memory.

  Fix the bug by determining whether to clear ocelot_port->pvid_vlan prior
  to calling ocelot_vlan_member_del().
