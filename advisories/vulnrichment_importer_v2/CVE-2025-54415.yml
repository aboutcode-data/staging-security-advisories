aliases: []
summary: dag-factory is a library for Apache Airflow® to construct DAGs declaratively via configuration
  files. In versions 0.23.0a8 and below, a high-severity vulnerability has been identified in
  the cicd.yml workflow within the astronomer/dag-factory GitHub repository. The workflow, specifically
  when triggered by pull_request_target, is susceptible to exploitation, allowing an attacker
  to execute arbitrary code within the GitHub Actions runner environment. This misconfiguration
  enables an attacker to establish a reverse shell, exfiltrate sensitive secrets, including
  the highly-privileged GITHUB_TOKEN, and ultimately gain full control over the repository.
  This is fixed in version 0.23.0a9.
