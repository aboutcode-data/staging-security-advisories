aliases: []
summary: Opal is OBiBa’s core database application for biobanks or epidemiological studies.
  Prior to version 5.1.1, the protections against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) were insufficient
  application-wide. The referrer header is checked, and if it is invalid, the server returns
  403. However, the referrer header can be dropped from CSRF requests using `<meta name="referrer"
  content="never">`, effectively bypassing this protection. Version 5.1.1 contains a patch for
  the issue.
