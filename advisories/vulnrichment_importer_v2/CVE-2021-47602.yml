  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mac80211: track only QoS data frames for admission control

  For admission control, obviously all of that only works for
  QoS data frames, otherwise we cannot even access the QoS
  field in the header.

  Syzbot reported (see below) an uninitialized value here due
  to a status of a non-QoS nullfunc packet, which isn't even
  long enough to contain the QoS header.

  Fix this to only do anything for QoS data packets.
