  An Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (pfe) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX5000 Series, EX2300, EX3400, EX4100, EX4400 and EX4600 allows a adjacent attacker to send specific traffic, which leads to packet flooding, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).

  When a specific IGMP packet is received in an isolated VLAN, it is duplicated to all other ports under the primary VLAN, which causes a flood.
