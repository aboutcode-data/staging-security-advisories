aliases: []
summary: Apache Commons Text versions prior to 1.10.0 included interpolation features that could
  be abused when applications passed untrusted input into the text-substitution API. Because
  some interpolators could trigger actions like executing commands or accessing external resources,
  an attacker could potentially achieve remote code execution. This vulnerability has been fully
  addressed in FileMaker Server 22.0.4.
