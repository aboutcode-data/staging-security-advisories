  with the escalated user privilege. To exploit this vulnerability, the following prerequisites
  must be met: (1)An attacker has obtained user credentials where the affected product is installed,
  (2)CENTUM Authentication Mode is used for user authentication when CENTUM VP is used. The
  affected products and versions are as follows: CENTUM CS 1000, CENTUM CS 3000 (Including CENTUM
