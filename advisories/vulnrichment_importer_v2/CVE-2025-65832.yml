aliases: []
summary: The mobile application insecurely handles information stored within memory. By performing
  a memory dump on the application after a user has logged out and terminated it, Wi-Fi credentials
  sent during the pairing process, JWTs used for authentication, and other sensitive details
  can be retrieved. As a result, an attacker with physical access to the device of a victim
  can retrieve this information and gain unauthorized access to their home Wi-Fi network and
  Meatmeet account.
