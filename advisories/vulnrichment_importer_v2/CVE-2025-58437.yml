aliases: []
summary: Coder allows organizations to provision remote development environments via Terraform.
  In versions 2.22.0 through 2.24.3, 2.25.0  and 2.25.1, Coder can be compromised through insecure
  session handling in prebuilt workspaces. Coder automatically generates a session token for
  a user when a workspace is started. It is automatically exposed via coder_workspace_owner.session_token.
  Prebuilt workspaces are initially owned by a built-in prebuilds system user. When a prebuilt
  workspace is claimed, a new session token is generated for the user that claimed the workspace,
  but the previous session token for the prebuilds user was not expired. Any Coder workspace
  templates that persist this automatically generated session token are potentially impacted.
  This is fixed in versions 2.24.4 and 2.25.2.
