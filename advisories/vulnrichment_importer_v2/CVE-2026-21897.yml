aliases: []
summary: CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security
  Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running
  the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. Prior to version 1.4.3, the Crypto_Config_Add_Gvcid_Managed_Parameters
  function only checks whether gvcid_counter > GVCID_MAN_PARAM_SIZE. As a result, it allows
  up to the 251st entry, which causes a write past the end of the array, overwriting gvcid_counter
  located immediately after gvcid_managed_parameters_array[250]. This leads to an out-of-bounds
  write, and the overwritten gvcid_counter may become an arbitrary value, potentially affecting
  the parameter lookup/registration logic that relies on it. This issue has been patched in
  version 1.4.3.
