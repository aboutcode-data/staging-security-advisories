aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) feature of Cisco\
  \ Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software\
  \ could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause an unexpected reload of the device.\r\
  \n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of SNMP packets. An attacker\
  \ could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP request to an affected device\
  \ using IPv4 or IPv6. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected\
  \ device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability affects\
  \ all versions of SNMP (versions 1, 2c, and 3) and requires a valid SNMP community string\
  \ or valid SNMPv3 user credentials."
