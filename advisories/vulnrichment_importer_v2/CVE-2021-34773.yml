datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2021/34xxx/CVE-2021-34773.json
aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications
  Manager (Unified CM), Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified
  CM SME), and Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM &amp; Presence Service (Unified CM IM&amp;P)
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
  attack on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for
  the web-based management interface on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the targeted user.
  These actions could include modifying the device configuration and deleting (but not creating)
  user accounts.
