summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Secure Firewall Management\
  \ Center (FMC) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary\
  \ HTML content into a device-generated document.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper\
  \ validation of user-supplied data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting\
  \ malicious content to an affected device and using the device to generate a document that\
  \ contains sensitive information. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter the\
  \ standard layout of the device-generated documents, read arbitrary files from the underlying\
  \ operating system, and conduct server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks. To exploit this\
  \ vulnerability, the attacker must have valid credentials for a user account with at least\
  \ the role of Security Analyst (Read Only)."
