aliases: []
summary: The Sydney Toolbox plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the plugin's Filterable Gallery widget in all versions up to, and including, 1.28 due
  to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject
  arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
