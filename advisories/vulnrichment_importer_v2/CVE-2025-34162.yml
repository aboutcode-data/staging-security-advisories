aliases: []
summary: An unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability exists in the GetLyfsByParams endpoint
  of Bian Que Feijiu Intelligent Emergency and Quality Control System, accessible via the /AppService/BQMedical/WebServiceForFirstaidApp.asmx
  interface. The backend fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the strOpid parameter,
  allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL statements. This can lead to data exfiltration,
  authentication bypass, and potentially remote code execution, depending on backend configuration. The
  vulnerability is presumed to affect builds released prior to June 2025 and is said to be remediated
  in newer versions of the product, though the exact affected range remains undefined. Exploitation
  evidence was first observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2025-07-23 UTC.
