aliases: []
summary: vLLM is an inference and serving engine for large language models (LLMs). In versions
  starting from 0.7.0 to before 0.9.0, in the file vllm/multimodal/hasher.py, the MultiModalHasher
  class has a security and data integrity issue in its image hashing method. Currently, it serializes
  PIL.Image.Image objects using only obj.tobytes(), which returns only the raw pixel data, without
  including metadata such as the image’s shape (width, height, mode). As a result, two images
  of different sizes (e.g., 30x100 and 100x30) with the same pixel byte sequence could generate
  the same hash value. This may lead to hash collisions, incorrect cache hits, and even data
  leakage or security risks. This issue has been patched in version 0.9.0.
