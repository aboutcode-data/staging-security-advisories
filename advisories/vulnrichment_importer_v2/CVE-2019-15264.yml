aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP)
  protocol implementation of Cisco Aironet and Catalyst 9100 Access Points (APs) could allow
  an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause an affected device to restart unexpectedly,
  resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper resource
  management during CAPWAP message processing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a high volume of legitimate wireless management frames within a short time to an
  affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a device to restart
  unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition for clients associated with the AP.
