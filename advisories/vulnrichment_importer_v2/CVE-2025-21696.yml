  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mm: clear uffd-wp PTE/PMD state on mremap()

  When mremap()ing a memory region previously registered with userfaultfd as
  write-protected but without UFFD_FEATURE_EVENT_REMAP, an inconsistency in
  flag clearing leads to a mismatch between the vma flags (which have
  uffd-wp cleared) and the pte/pmd flags (which do not have uffd-wp
  cleared).  This mismatch causes a subsequent mprotect(PROT_WRITE) to
  trigger a warning in page_table_check_pte_flags() due to setting the pte
  to writable while uffd-wp is still set.

  Fix this by always explicitly clearing the uffd-wp pte/pmd flags on any
  such mremap() so that the values are consistent with the existing clearing
  of VM_UFFD_WP.  Be careful to clear the logical flag regardless of its
  physical form; a PTE bit, a swap PTE bit, or a PTE marker.  Cover PTE,
  huge PMD and hugetlb paths.
