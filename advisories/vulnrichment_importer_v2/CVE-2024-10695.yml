aliases: []
summary: The Futurio Extra plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all
  versions up to, and including, 2.0.13 via the 'elementor-template' shortcode due to insufficient
  restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Contributor-level access and above, to extract data from private or draft posts that
  they should not have access to.
