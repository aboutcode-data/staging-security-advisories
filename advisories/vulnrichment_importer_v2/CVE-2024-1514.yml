aliases: []
summary: The WP eCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based blind SQL Injection
  via the 'cart_contents' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.15.1 due to insufficient
  escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing
  SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL
  queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from
  the database.
