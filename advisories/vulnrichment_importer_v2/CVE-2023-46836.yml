summary: |
  The fixes for XSA-422 (Branch Type Confusion) and XSA-434 (Speculative
  Return Stack Overflow) are not IRQ-safe.  It was believed that the
  mitigations always operated in contexts with IRQs disabled.

  However, the original XSA-254 fix for Meltdown (XPTI) deliberately left
  interrupts enabled on two entry paths; one unconditionally, and one
  conditionally on whether XPTI was active.

  As BTC/SRSO and Meltdown affect different CPU vendors, the mitigations
  are not active together by default.  Therefore, there is a race
  condition whereby a malicious PV guest can bypass BTC/SRSO protections
  and launch a BTC/SRSO attack against Xen.
