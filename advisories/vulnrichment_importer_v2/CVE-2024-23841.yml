aliases: []
summary: apollo-client-nextjs is the Apollo Client support for the Next.js App Router. The @apollo/experimental-apollo-client-nextjs
  NPM package is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. To exploit this vulnerability,
  an attacker would need to either inject malicious input (e.g. by redirecting a user to a specifically-crafted
  link) or arrange to have malicious input be returned by a GraphQL server (e.g. by persisting
  it in a database). To fix this issue, please update to version 0.7.0 or later.
