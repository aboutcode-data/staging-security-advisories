aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the bridge protocol data unit (BPDU) forwarding functionality of
  Cisco Aironet Access Points (APs) could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause
  an AP port to go into an error disabled state. The vulnerability occurs because BPDUs received
  from specific wireless clients are forwarded incorrectly. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  on the wireless network by sending a steady stream of crafted BPDU frames. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to cause a limited denial of service (DoS) attack because an AP port
  could go offline.
