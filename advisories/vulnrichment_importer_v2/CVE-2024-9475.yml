aliases: []
summary: The Poll Maker – Versus Polls, Anonymous Polls, Image Polls plugin for WordPress is
  vulnerable to generic SQL Injection via the order_by parameter in all versions up to, and
  including, 5.4.6  due to insufficient escaping on the user-supplied parameter and lack of
  sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to append additional SQL queries
  into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
