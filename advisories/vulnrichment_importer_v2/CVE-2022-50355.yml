  staging: vt6655: fix some erroneous memory clean-up loops

  In some initialization functions of this driver, memory is allocated with
  'i' acting as an index variable and increasing from 0. The commit in
  "Fixes" introduces some clean-up codes in case of allocation failure,
  which free memory in reverse order with 'i' decreasing to 0. However,
  there are some problems:
    - The case i=0 is left out. Thus memory is leaked.
    - In case memory allocation fails right from the start, the memory
      freeing loops will start with i=-1 and invalid memory locations will
      be accessed.

  One of these loops has been fixed in commit c8ff91535880 ("staging:
  vt6655: fix potential memory leak"). Fix the remaining erroneous loops.
