  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  iio: light: veml6030: fix IIO device retrieval from embedded device

  The dev pointer that is received as an argument in the
  in_illuminance_period_available_show function references the device
  embedded in the IIO device, not in the i2c client.

  dev_to_iio_dev() must be used to accessthe right data. The current
  implementation leads to a segmentation fault on every attempt to read
  the attribute because indio_dev gets a NULL assignment.

  This bug has been present since the first appearance of the driver,
  apparently since the last version (V6) before getting applied. A
  constant attribute was used until then, and the last modifications might
  have not been tested again.
