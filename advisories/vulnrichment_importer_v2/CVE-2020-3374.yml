summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software
  could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization, enabling them to access
  sensitive information, modify the system configuration, or impact the availability of the
  affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checking on the affected
  system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the
  web-based management interface of an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the
  attacker to gain privileges beyond what would normally be authorized for their configured
  user authorization level. The attacker may be able to access sensitive information, modify
  the system configuration, or impact the availability of the affected system.
