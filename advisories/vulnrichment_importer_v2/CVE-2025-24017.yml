aliases: []
summary: YesWiki is a wiki system written in PHP. Versions up to and including 4.4.5 are vulnerable
  to any end-user crafting a DOM based XSS on all of YesWiki's pages which is triggered when
  a user clicks on a malicious link. The vulnerability makes use of the search by tag feature.
  When a tag doesn't exist, the tag is reflected on the page and isn't properly sanitized on
  the server side which allows a malicious user to generate a link that will trigger an XSS
  on the client's side when clicked. This vulnerability allows any user to generate a malicious
  link that will trigger an account takeover when clicked, therefore allowing a user to steal
  other accounts, modify pages, comments, permissions, extract user data (emails), thus impacting
  the integrity, availability and confidentiality of a YesWiki instance. Version 4.5.0 contains
  a patch for the issue.
