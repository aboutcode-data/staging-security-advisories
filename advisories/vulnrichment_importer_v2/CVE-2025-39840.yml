  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  audit: fix out-of-bounds read in audit_compare_dname_path()

  When a watch on dir=/ is combined with an fsnotify event for a
  single-character name directly under / (e.g., creating /a), an
  out-of-bounds read can occur in audit_compare_dname_path().

  The helper parent_len() returns 1 for "/". In audit_compare_dname_path(),
  when parentlen equals the full path length (1), the code sets p = path + 1
  and pathlen = 1 - 1 = 0. The subsequent loop then dereferences
  p[pathlen - 1] (i.e., p[-1]), causing an out-of-bounds read.

  Fix this by adding a pathlen > 0 check to the while loop condition
  to prevent the out-of-bounds access.
