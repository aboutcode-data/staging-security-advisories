aliases: []
summary: Dataease is an open source data analytics and visualization platform. In Dataease versions
  up to 2.10.12, the patch introduced to mitigate DB2 JDBC deserialization remote code execution
  attacks only blacklisted the rmi parameter. The ldap parameter in the DB2 JDBC connection
  string was not filtered, allowing attackers to exploit the DB2 JDBC connection string to trigger
  server-side request forgery (SSRF). In higher versions of Java, ldap deserialization (autoDeserialize)
  is disabled by default, preventing remote code execution, but SSRF remains exploitable. Versions
  up to 2.10.12 are affected. The issue is fixed in version 2.10.13. Updating to 2.10.13 or
  later is recommended. No known workarounds are documented aside from upgrading.
