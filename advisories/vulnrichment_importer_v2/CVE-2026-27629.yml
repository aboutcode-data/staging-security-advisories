aliases: []
summary: InvenTree is an Open Source Inventory Management System. Prior to version 1.2.3, insecure
  server-side templates can be hijacked to expose secure information to the client. When generating
  custom batch codes, the InvenTree server makes use of a customizable jinja2 template, which
  can be modified by a staff user to exfiltrate sensitive information or perform code execution
  on the server. This issue requires access by a user with granted staff permissions, followed
  by a request to generate a custom batch code via the API. Once the template has been modified
  in a malicious manner, the API call to generate a new batch code could be made by other users,
  and the template code will be executed with their user context. The code has been patched
  to ensure that all template generation is performed within a secure sandboxed context. This
  issue has been addressed in version 1.2.3, and any versions from 1.3.0 onwards. Some workarounds
  are available. The batch code template is a configurable global setting which can be adjusted
  via any user with staff access. To prevent this setting from being edited, it can be overridden
  at a system level to a default value, preventing it from being edited. This requires system
  administrator access, and cannot be changed from the client side once the server is running.
  It is recommended that for InvenTree installations prior to 1.2.3 the `STOCK_BATCH_CODE_TEMPLATE`
  and `PART_NAME_FORMAT` global settings are overridden at the system level to prevent editing.
