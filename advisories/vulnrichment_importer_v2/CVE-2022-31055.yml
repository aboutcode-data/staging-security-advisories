aliases: []
summary: 'kCTF is a Kubernetes-based infrastructure for capture the flag (CTF) competitions.
  Prior to version 1.6.0, the kctf cluster set-src-ip-ranges was broken and allowed traffic
  from any IP. The problem has been patched in v1.6.0. As a workaround, those who want to test
  challenges privately can mark them as `public: false` and use `kctf chal debug port-forward`
  to connect.'
