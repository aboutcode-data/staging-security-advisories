aliases: []
summary: OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to version 2026.2.14, authenticated attackers
  can read arbitrary files from the Gateway host by supplying absolute paths or path traversal
  sequences to the browser tool's `upload` action. The server passed these paths to Playwright's
  `setInputFiles()` APIs without restricting them to a safe root. An attacker must reach the
  Gateway HTTP surface (or otherwise invoke the same browser control hook endpoints); present
  valid Gateway auth (bearer token / password), as required by the Gateway configuration (In
  common default setups, the Gateway binds to loopback and the onboarding wizard generates a
  gateway token even for loopback); and have the `browser` tool permitted by tool policy for
  the target session/context (and have browser support enabled). If an operator exposes the
  Gateway beyond loopback (LAN/tailnet/custom bind, reverse proxy, tunnels, etc.), the impact
  increases accordingly. Starting in version 2026.2.14, the upload paths are now confined to
  OpenClaw's temp uploads root (`DEFAULT_UPLOAD_DIR`) and traversal/escape paths are rejected.
