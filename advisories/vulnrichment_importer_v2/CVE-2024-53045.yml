  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ASoC: dapm: fix bounds checker error in dapm_widget_list_create

  The widgets array in the snd_soc_dapm_widget_list has a __counted_by
  attribute attached to it, which points to the num_widgets variable. This
  attribute is used in bounds checking, and if it is not set before the
  array is filled, then the bounds sanitizer will issue a warning or a
  kernel panic if CONFIG_UBSAN_TRAP is set.

  This patch sets the size of the widgets list calculated with
  list_for_each as the initial value for num_widgets as it is used for
  allocating memory for the array. It is updated with the actual number of
  added elements after the array is filled.
