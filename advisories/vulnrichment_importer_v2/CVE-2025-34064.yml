aliases: []
summary: A cloud infrastructure misconfiguration in OneLogin AD Connector results in log data
  being sent to a hardcoded S3 bucket (onelogin-adc-logs-production) without validating bucket
  ownership. An attacker who registers this unclaimed bucket can begin receiving log files from
  other OneLogin tenants. These logs may contain sensitive data such as directory tokens, user
  metadata, and environment configuration. This enables cross-tenant leakage of secrets, potentially
  allowing JWT signing key recovery and user impersonation.
