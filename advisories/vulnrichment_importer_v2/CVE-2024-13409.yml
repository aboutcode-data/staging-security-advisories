aliases: []
summary: The Post Grid, Slider & Carousel Ultimate – with Shortcode, Gutenberg Block & Elementor
  Widget plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and
  including, 1.6.10 via the 'theme' parameter of the post_type_ajax_handler() function. This
  makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to
  include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code
  in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve
  code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included.
