aliases: []
summary: Sinatra is a domain-specific language for creating web applications in Ruby. In versions
  prior to 4.2.0, there is a denial of service vulnerability in the `If-Match` and `If-None-Match`
  header parsing component of Sinatra, if the `etag` method is used when constructing the response.
  Carefully crafted input can cause `If-Match` and `If-None-Match` header parsing in Sinatra
  to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a denial of service attack vector.
  This header is typically involved in generating the `ETag` header value. Any applications
  that use the `etag` method when generating a response are impacted. Version 4.2.0 fixes the
  issue.
