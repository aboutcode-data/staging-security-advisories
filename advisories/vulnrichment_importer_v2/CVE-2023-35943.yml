aliases: []
summary: Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications.
  Prior to versions 1.27.0, 1.26.4, 1.25.9, 1.24.10, and 1.23.12, the CORS filter will segfault
  and crash Envoy when the `origin` header is removed and deleted between `decodeHeaders`and
  `encodeHeaders`. Versions 1.27.0, 1.26.4, 1.25.9, 1.24.10, and 1.23.12 have a fix for this
  issue. As a workaround, do not remove the `origin` header in the Envoy configuration.
