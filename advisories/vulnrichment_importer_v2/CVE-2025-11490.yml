aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability has been found in wonderwhy-er DesktopCommanderMCP up to 0.2.13. The
  affected element is the function extractBaseCommand of the file src/command-manager.ts of
  the component Absolute Path Handler. Such manipulation leads to os command injection. The
  attack may be performed from remote. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may
  be used. The vendor explains: "The usual use case is that AI is asked to do something, picks
  commands itself, and typically uses simple command names without absolute paths. It''s curious
  why a user would ask the model to bypass restrictions this way. (...) This could potentially
  be a problem, but we are yet to hear reports of this being an issue in actual workflows. We''ll
  leave this issue open for situations where people may report this as a problem for the long
  term."'
