summary: The ElementsKit Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to DOM-Based Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the ‘url’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.7.8 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
  execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
