aliases: []
summary: Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime with secure defaults. Starting
  in version 1.32.1 and prior to version 1.41.0 of the deno library, maliciously crafted permission
  request can show the spoofed permission prompt by inserting a broken ANSI escape sequence
  into the request contents. Deno is stripping any ANSI escape sequences from the permission
  prompt, but permissions given to the program are based on the contents that contain the ANSI
  escape sequences. Any Deno program can spoof the content of the interactive permission prompt
  by inserting a broken ANSI code, which allows a malicious Deno program to display the wrong
  file path or program name to the user. Version 1.41.0 of the deno library contains a patch
  for the issue.
