aliases: []
summary: Dataease is an open source data analytics and visualization platform. In Dataease versions
  up to 2.10.12 the H2 data source implementation (H2.java) does not verify that a provided
  JDBC URL starts with jdbc:h2. This lack of validation allows a crafted JDBC configuration
  that substitutes the Amazon Redshift driver and leverages the socketFactory and socketFactoryArg
  parameters to invoke org.springframework.context.support.FileSystemXmlApplicationContext or
  ClassPathXmlApplicationContext with an attacker‑controlled remote XML resource, resulting
  in remote code execution. Versions up to and including 2.10.12 are affected. The issue is
  fixed in version 2.10.13. Updating to version 2.10.13 or later is the recommended remediation.
  No known workarounds exist.
