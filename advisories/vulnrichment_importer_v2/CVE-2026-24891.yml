aliases: []
summary: openITCOCKPIT is an open source monitoring tool built for different monitoring engines
  like Nagios, Naemon and Prometheus. Versions 5.3.1 and below contain an unsafe deserialization
  sink in the Gearman worker implementation. The worker function registered as oitc_gearman
  calls PHP's unserialize() on job payloads without enforcing class restrictions or validating
  data origin. While the intended deployment assumes only trusted internal components enqueue
  Gearman jobs, this trust boundary is not enforced in application code. In environments where
  the Gearman service or worker is exposed to untrusted systems, an attacker may submit crafted
  serialized payloads to trigger PHP Object Injection in the worker process. This vulnerability
  is exploitable when Gearman listens on non-local interfaces, network access to TCP/4730 is
  unrestricted, or untrusted systems can enqueue jobs. Default, correctly hardened deployments
  may not be immediately exploitable, but the unsafe sink remains present in code regardless
  of deployment configuration. Enforcing this trust boundary in code would significantly reduce
  risk and prevent exploitation in misconfigured environments. This issue has been fixed in
  version 5.4.0.
