aliases: []
summary: The WHMPress - WHMCS Client Area plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
  modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check
  on the update_settings case in the /admin/ajax.php file in all versions up to, and including,
  4.3-revision-3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
  access and above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged
  to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration
  for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site.
