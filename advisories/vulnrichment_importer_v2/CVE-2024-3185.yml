aliases: []
summary: A key used in logging.json does not follow the least privilege principle by default
  and is exposed to local users in the Rapid7 Platform.  This allows an attacker with local
  access to a machine with the logging.json file to use that key to authenticate to the platform
  with high privileges.  This was fixed in the Rapid7 platform starting 3 April 2024 via the
  introduction of a restricted role and the removal of automatic API key generation on installation
  of an agent.
