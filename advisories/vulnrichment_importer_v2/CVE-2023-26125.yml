aliases: []
summary: "Versions of the package github.com/gin-gonic/gin before 1.9.0 are vulnerable to Improper\
  \ Input Validation by allowing an attacker to use a specially crafted request via the X-Forwarded-Prefix\
  \ header, potentially leading to cache poisoning.\r\r**Note:** Although this issue does not\
  \ pose a significant threat on its own it can serve as an input vector for other more impactful\
  \ vulnerabilities. However, successful exploitation may depend on the server configuration\
  \ and whether the header is used in the application logic."
