  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ALSA: seq: Fix race of snd_seq_timer_open()

  The timer instance per queue is exclusive, and snd_seq_timer_open()
  should have managed the concurrent accesses.  It looks as if it's
  checking the already existing timer instance at the beginning, but
  it's not right, because there is no protection, hence any later
  concurrent call of snd_seq_timer_open() may override the timer
  instance easily.  This may result in UAF, as the leftover timer
  instance can keep running while the queue itself gets closed, as
  spotted by syzkaller recently.

  For avoiding the race, add a proper check at the assignment of
  tmr->timeri again, and return -EBUSY if it's been already registered.
