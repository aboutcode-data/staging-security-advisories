aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) implementation of Cisco
  Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software
  could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition
  on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper control of a resource. An attacker
  with the ability to spoof a trusted IKEv2 site-to-site VPN peer and in possession of valid
  IKEv2 credentials for that peer could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed, authenticated
  IKEv2 messages to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger
  a reload of the device.
