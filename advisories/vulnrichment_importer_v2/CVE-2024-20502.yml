summary: "A vulnerability in the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server of Cisco Meraki MX and Cisco Meraki\
  \ Z Series Teleworker Gateway devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause\
  \ a DoS condition on an affected device.\r\n\n This vulnerability is due to insufficient resource\
  \ management while establishing SSL VPN sessions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by sending a series of crafted HTTPS requests to the VPN server of an affected device. A\
  \ successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server to\
  \ stop accepting new connections, preventing new SSL VPN connections from being established.\
  \ Existing SSL VPN sessions are not impacted.\r\n\n Note: When the attack traffic stops, the\
  \ Cisco AnyConnect VPN server recovers gracefully without requiring manual intervention."
