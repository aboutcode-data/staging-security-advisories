aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the IP Version 4 (IPv4) processing code of Cisco IOS XE Software
  running on Cisco Catalyst 3850 and Cisco Catalyst 3650 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to cause high CPU utilization, traceback messages, or a reload of an affected
  device that leads to a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incorrect
  processing of certain IPv4 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
  specific IPv4 packets to an IPv4 address on an affected device. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to cause high CPU utilization, traceback messages, or a reload of the affected
  device that leads to a DoS condition. If the switch does not reboot when under attack, it
  would require manual intervention to reload the device. This vulnerability affects Cisco Catalyst
  3850 and Cisco Catalyst 3650 Series Switches that are running Cisco IOS XE Software Release
  16.1.1 or later, until the first fixed release, and are configured with an IPv4 address. Cisco
  Bug IDs: CSCvd80714.'
