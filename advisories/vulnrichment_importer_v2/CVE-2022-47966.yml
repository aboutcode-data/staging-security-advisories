aliases: []
summary: Multiple Zoho ManageEngine on-premise products, such as ServiceDesk Plus through 14003,
  allow remote code execution due to use of Apache Santuario xmlsec (aka XML Security for Java)
  1.4.1, because the xmlsec XSLT features, by design in that version, make the application responsible
  for certain security protections, and the ManageEngine applications did not provide those
  protections. This affects Access Manager Plus before 4308, Active Directory 360 before 4310,
  ADAudit Plus before 7081, ADManager Plus before 7162, ADSelfService Plus before 6211, Analytics
  Plus before 5150, Application Control Plus before 10.1.2220.18, Asset Explorer before 6983,
  Browser Security Plus before 11.1.2238.6, Device Control Plus before 10.1.2220.18, Endpoint
  Central before 10.1.2228.11, Endpoint Central MSP before 10.1.2228.11, Endpoint DLP before
  10.1.2137.6, Key Manager Plus before 6401, OS Deployer before 1.1.2243.1, PAM 360 before 5713,
  Password Manager Pro before 12124, Patch Manager Plus before 10.1.2220.18, Remote Access Plus
  before 10.1.2228.11, Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) before 10.1.41. ServiceDesk Plus
  before 14004, ServiceDesk Plus MSP before 13001, SupportCenter Plus before 11026, and Vulnerability
  Manager Plus before 10.1.2220.18. Exploitation is only possible if SAML SSO has ever been
  configured for a product (for some products, exploitation requires that SAML SSO is currently
  active).
