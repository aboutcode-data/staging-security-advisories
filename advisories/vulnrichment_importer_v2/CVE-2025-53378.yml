summary: "A missing authentication vulnerability in Trend Micro Worry-Free Business Security\
  \ Services (WFBSS) agent could have allowed an unauthenticated attacker to remotely take control\
  \ of the agent on affected installations.\r\n\r\nAlso note: this vulnerability only affected\
  \ the SaaS client version of WFBSS only, meaning the on-premise version of Worry-Free Business\
  \ Security was not affected, and this issue was addressed in a WFBSS monthly maintenance update.\
  \ Therefore no other customer action is required to mitigate if the WFBSS agents are on the\
  \ regular SaaS maintenance deployment schedule and this disclosure is for informational purposes\
  \ only."
