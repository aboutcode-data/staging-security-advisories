aliases: []
summary: An attacker can pre-create the `/Applications/Google\ Drive.app/Contents/MacOS` directory
  which is expected to be owned by root to be owned by a non-root user. When the Drive for Desktop
  installer is run for the first time, it will place a binary in that directory with execute
  permissions and set its setuid bit. Since the attacker owns the directory, the attacker can
  replace the binary with a symlink, causing the installer to set the setuid bit on the symlink.
  When the symlink is executed, it will run with root permissions. We recommend upgrading past
  version 64.0
