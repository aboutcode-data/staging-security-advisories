  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  KVM: LAPIC: Also cancel preemption timer during SET_LAPIC

  The below warning is splatting during guest reboot.

  This can be triggered by not exposing tsc-deadline mode and doing a reboot in
  the guest. The lapic_shutdown() function which is called in sys_reboot path
  will not disarm the flying timer, it just masks LVTT. lapic_shutdown() clears
  APIC state w/ LVT_MASKED and timer-mode bit is 0, this can trigger timer-mode
  switch between tsc-deadline and oneshot/periodic, which can result in preemption
  timer be cancelled in apic_update_lvtt(). However, We can't depend on this when
  not exposing tsc-deadline mode and oneshot/periodic modes emulated by preemption
  timer. Qemu will synchronise states around reset, let's cancel preemption timer
  under KVM_SET_LAPIC.
