aliases: []
summary: Apache Pulsar Brokers and Proxies create an internal Pulsar Admin Client that does
  not verify peer TLS certificates, even when tlsAllowInsecureConnection is disabled via configuration.
  The Pulsar Admin Client's intra-cluster and geo-replication HTTPS connections are vulnerable
  to man in the middle attacks, which could leak authentication data, configuration data, and
  any other data sent by these clients. An attacker can only take advantage of this vulnerability
  by taking control of a machine 'between' the client and the server. The attacker must then
  actively manipulate traffic to perform the attack. This issue affects Apache Pulsar Broker
  and Proxy versions 2.7.0 to 2.7.4; 2.8.0 to 2.8.3; 2.9.0 to 2.9.2; 2.10.0; 2.6.4 and earlier.
