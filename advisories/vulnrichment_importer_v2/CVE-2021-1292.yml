aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business
  RV160, RV160W, RV260, RV260P, and RV260W VPN Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote
  attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on an affected device. These vulnerabilities
  exist because HTTP requests are not properly validated. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities
  by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web-based management interface of an affected device.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code on the device.
