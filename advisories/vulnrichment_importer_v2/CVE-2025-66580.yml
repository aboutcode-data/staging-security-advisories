aliases: []
summary: Dive is an open-source MCP Host Desktop Application that enables integration with function-calling
  LLMs. A critical Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in versions prior
  to 0.11.1 in the Mermaid diagram rendering component. The application allows the execution
  of arbitrary JavaScript via `javascript:`. An attacker can exploit this to inject a malicious
  Model Context Protocol (MCP) server configuration, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  on the victim's machine when the node is clicked. Version 0.11.1 fixes the issue.
