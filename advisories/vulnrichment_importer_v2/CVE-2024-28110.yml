aliases: []
summary: Go SDK for CloudEvents is the official CloudEvents SDK to integrate applications with
  CloudEvents. Prior to version 2.15.2, using cloudevents.WithRoundTripper to create a cloudevents.Client
  with an authenticated http.RoundTripper causes the go-sdk to leak credentials to arbitrary
  endpoints. When the transport is populated with an authenticated transport, then http.DefaultClient
  is modified with the authenticated transport and will start to send Authorization tokens to
  any endpoint it is used to contact. Version 2.15.2 patches this issue.
