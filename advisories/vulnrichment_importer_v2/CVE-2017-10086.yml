summary: 'Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: JavaFX). Supported
  versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u141 and 8u131. Easily exploitable vulnerability
  allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java
  SE. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and
  while the vulnerability is in Java SE, attacks may significantly impact additional products.
  Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Java SE. Note: This vulnerability
  applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications
  or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the
  internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to
  Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed
  by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 9.6 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability
  impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).'
