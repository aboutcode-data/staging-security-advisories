aliases: []
summary: Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. Prior to versions
  14.2.32 and 15.4.7, when next() was used without explicitly passing the request object, it
  could lead to SSRF in self-hosted applications that incorrectly forwarded user-supplied headers.
  This vulnerability has been fixed in Next.js versions 14.2.32 and 15.4.7. All users implementing
  custom middleware logic in self-hosted environments are strongly encouraged to upgrade and
  verify correct usage of the next() function.
