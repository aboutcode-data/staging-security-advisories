aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) implementation of Cisco
  IoT Field Network Director could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a denial
  of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  input validation of incoming CoAP traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
  sending a malformed CoAP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the
  attacker to force the CoAP server to stop, interrupting communication to the IoT endpoints.
