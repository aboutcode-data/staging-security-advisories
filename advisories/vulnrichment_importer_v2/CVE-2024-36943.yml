  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  fs/proc/task_mmu: fix loss of young/dirty bits during pagemap scan

  make_uffd_wp_pte() was previously doing:

    pte = ptep_get(ptep);
    ptep_modify_prot_start(ptep);
    pte = pte_mkuffd_wp(pte);
    ptep_modify_prot_commit(ptep, pte);

  But if another thread accessed or dirtied the pte between the first 2
  calls, this could lead to loss of that information.  Since
  ptep_modify_prot_start() gets and clears atomically, the following is the
  correct pattern and prevents any possible race.  Any access after the
  first call would see an invalid pte and cause a fault:

    pte = ptep_modify_prot_start(ptep);
    pte = pte_mkuffd_wp(pte);
    ptep_modify_prot_commit(ptep, pte);
