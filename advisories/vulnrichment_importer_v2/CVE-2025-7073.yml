aliases: []
summary: A local privilege escalation vulnerability in Bitdefender Total Security 27.0.46.231
  allows low-privileged attackers to elevate privileges. The issue arises from bdservicehost.exe deleting
  files from a user-writable directory (C:\ProgramData\Atc\Feedback) without proper symbolic
  link validation, enabling arbitrary file deletion. This issue is chained with a file copy
  operation during network events and a filter driver bypass via DLL injection to achieve arbitrary
  file copy and code execution as elevated user.
