  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ALSA: pcm: Fix races among concurrent hw_params and hw_free calls

  Currently we have neither proper check nor protection against the
  concurrent calls of PCM hw_params and hw_free ioctls, which may result
  in a UAF.  Since the existing PCM stream lock can't be used for
  protecting the whole ioctl operations, we need a new mutex to protect
  those racy calls.

  This patch introduced a new mutex, runtime->buffer_mutex, and applies
  it to both hw_params and hw_free ioctl code paths.  Along with it, the
  both functions are slightly modified (the mmap_count check is moved
  into the state-check block) for code simplicity.
