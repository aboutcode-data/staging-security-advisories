summary: The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes certain characters before
  the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers. The inclusion of invalidated data in an HTTP
  header allows an attacker to specify the full HTTP response represented by the browser. An

  poisoning attacks.
