aliases: []
summary: File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it
  can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit files. Versions prior to 2.45.1 have
  an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in the FileBrowser application's
  share deletion functionality. This vulnerability allows any authenticated user with share
  permissions to delete other users' shared links without authorization checks. The impact is
  significant as malicious actors can disrupt business operations by systematically removing
  shared files and links. This leads to denial of service for legitimate users, potential data
  loss in collaborative environments, and breach of data confidentiality agreements. In organizational
  settings, this could affect critical file sharing for projects, presentations, or document
  collaboration. Version 2.45.1 contains a fix for the issue.
