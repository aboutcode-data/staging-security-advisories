summary: OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. The target
  contract of an EIP-165 `supportsInterface` query can cause unbounded gas consumption by returning
  a lot of data, while it is generally assumed that this operation has a bounded cost. The issue
  has been fixed in v4.7.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for
  this issue.
