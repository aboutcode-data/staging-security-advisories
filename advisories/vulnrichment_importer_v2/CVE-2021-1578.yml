summary: A vulnerability in an API endpoint of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller
  (APIC) and Cisco Cloud Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (Cloud APIC) could allow
  an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate privileges to Administrator on an affected device.

  exploit could allow the attacker to obtain Administrator credentials on the affected device.
