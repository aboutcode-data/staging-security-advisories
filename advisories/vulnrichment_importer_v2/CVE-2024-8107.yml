aliases: []
summary: The Slider Revolution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 6.7.18 due to insufficient input
  sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
  Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute
  whenever a user accesses the SVG file. By default, this can only be exploited by administrators,
  but the ability to use and configure Slider Revolution can be extended to authors.
