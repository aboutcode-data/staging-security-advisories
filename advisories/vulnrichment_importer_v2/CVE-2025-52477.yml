aliases: []
summary: Octo-STS is a GitHub App that acts like a Security Token Service (STS) for the GitHub
  API. Octo-STS versions before v0.5.3 are vulnerable to unauthenticated SSRF by abusing fields
  in OpenID Connect tokens. Malicious tokens were shown to trigger internal network requests
  which could reflect error logs with sensitive information. Upgrade to v0.5.3 to resolve this
  issue. This version includes patch sets to sanitize input and redact logging.
