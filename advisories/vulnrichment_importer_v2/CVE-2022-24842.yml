aliases: []
summary: 'MinIO is a High Performance Object Storage released under GNU Affero General Public
  License v3.0. A security issue was found where an non-admin user is able to create service
  accounts for root or other admin users and then is able to assume their access policies via
  the generated credentials. This in turn allows the user to escalate privilege to that of the
  root user. This vulnerability has been resolved in pull request #14729 and is included in
  `RELEASE.2022-04-12T06-55-35Z`. Users unable to upgrade may workaround this issue by explicitly
  adding a `admin:CreateServiceAccount` deny policy, however, this, in turn, denies the user
  the ability to create their own service accounts as well.'
