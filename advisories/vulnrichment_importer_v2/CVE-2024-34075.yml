aliases: []
summary: kurwov is a fast, dependency-free library for creating Markov Chains. An unsafe sanitization
  of dataset contents on the `MarkovData#getNext` method used in `Markov#generate` and `Markov#choose`
  allows a maliciously crafted string on the dataset to throw and stop the function from running
  properly. If a string contains a forbidden substring (i.e. `__proto__`) followed by a space
  character, the code will access a special property in `MarkovData#finalData` by removing the
  last character of the string, bypassing the dataset sanitization (as it is supposed to be
  already sanitized before this function is called). Any dataset can be contaminated with the
  substring making it unable to properly generate anything in some cases. This issue has been
  addressed in version 3.2.5 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
  for this vulnerability.
