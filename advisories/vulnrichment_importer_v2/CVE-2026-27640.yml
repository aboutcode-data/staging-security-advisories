aliases: []
summary: 'tfplan2md is software for converting Terraform plan JSON files into human-readable
  Markdown reports. Prior to version 1.26.1, a bug in tfplan2md affected several distinct rendering
  paths: AzApi resource body properties, AzureDevOps variable groups, Scriban template context
  variables, and hierarchical sensitivity detection. This caused reports to render values that
  should have been masked as "(sensitive)" instead. This issue is fixed in v1.26.1. No known
  workarounds are available.'
