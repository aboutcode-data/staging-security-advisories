summary: Controls limiting uploads to certain file extensions may be bypassed. This could allow
  an attacker to intercept the initial file upload page response and modify the associated code.
  This modified code can be forwarded and used by a script loaded later in the sequence, allowing
  for arbitrary file upload into a location where PHP scripts may be executed.
