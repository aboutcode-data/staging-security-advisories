  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  dpll: fix dpll_xa_ref_*_del() for multiple registrations

  Currently, if there are multiple registrations of the same pin on the
  same dpll device, following warnings are observed:
  WARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 2212 at drivers/dpll/dpll_core.c:143 dpll_xa_ref_pin_del.isra.0+0x21e/0x230
  WARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 2212 at drivers/dpll/dpll_core.c:223 __dpll_pin_unregister+0x2b3/0x2c0

  The problem is, that in both dpll_xa_ref_dpll_del() and
  dpll_xa_ref_pin_del() registration is only removed from list in case the
  reference count drops to zero. That is wrong, the registration has to
  be removed always.

  To fix this, remove the registration from the list and free
  it unconditionally, instead of doing it only when the ref reference
  counter reaches zero.
