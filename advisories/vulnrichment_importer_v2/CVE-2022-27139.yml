aliases: []
summary: 'An arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the file upload module of Ghost v4.39.0
  allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted SVG file. NOTE: Vendor states that
  as outlined in Ghost''s security documentation, upload of SVGs is only possible by trusted
  authenticated users. The uploading of SVG files to Ghost does not represent a remote code
  execution vulnerability. SVGs are not executable on the server, and may only execute javascript
  in a client''s browser - this is expected and intentional functionality'
