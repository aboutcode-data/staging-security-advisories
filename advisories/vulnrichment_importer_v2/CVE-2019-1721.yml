aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the phone book feature of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence
  Video Communication Server (VCS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause the
  CPU to increase to 100% utilization, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected
  system. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of the XML input. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by sending a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) message with a crafted
  XML payload to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust
  CPU resources, resulting in a DoS condition. Manual intervention may be required to recover
  the device. This vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence
  Video Communication Server Releases X12.5.1 and later.
