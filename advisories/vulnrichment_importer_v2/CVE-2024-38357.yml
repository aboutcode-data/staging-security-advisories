aliases: []
summary: TinyMCE is an open source rich text editor. A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
  was discovered in TinyMCE’s content parsing code. This allowed specially crafted noscript
  elements containing malicious code to be executed when that content was loaded into the editor.
  This vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 7.2.0, TinyMCE 6.8.4 and TinyMCE 5.11.0 LTS
  by ensuring that content within noscript elements are properly parsed. Users are advised to
  upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
