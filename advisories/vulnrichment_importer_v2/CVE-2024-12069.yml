aliases: []
summary: The Lexicata plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due
  to the use of add_query_arg without appropriate escaping on the URL in all versions up to,
  and including, 1.0.16. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary
  web scripts that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action,
  such as clicking on a specially crafted link.
