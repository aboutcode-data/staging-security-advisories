  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  crypto: hisilicon/qm - inject error before stopping queue

  The master ooo cannot be completely closed when the
  accelerator core reports memory error. Therefore, the driver
  needs to inject the qm error to close the master ooo. Currently,
  the qm error is injected after stopping queue, memory may be
  released immediately after stopping queue, causing the device to
  access the released memory. Therefore, error is injected to close master
  ooo before stopping queue to ensure that the device does not access
  the released memory.
