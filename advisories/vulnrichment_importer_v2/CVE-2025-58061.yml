aliases: []
summary: OpenEBS Local PV RawFile allows dynamic deployment of Stateful Persistent Node-Local
  Volumes & Filesystems for Kubernetes. Prior to version 0.10.0, persistent volume data is world
  readable and that would allow non-privileged users to access sensitive data such as databases
  of k8s workload. The rawfile-localpv storage class creates persistent volume data under /var/csi/rawfile/
  on Kubernetes hosts by default. However, the directory and data in it are world-readable.
  It allows non-privileged users to access the whole persistent volume data, and those can include
  sensitive information such as a whole database if the Kubernetes tenants are running MySQL
  or PostgreSQL in a container so it could lead to a database breach. This issue has been patched
  in version 0.10.0.
