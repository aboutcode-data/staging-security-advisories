aliases: []
summary: Toyota RAV4 2021 vehicles automatically trust messages from other ECUs on a CAN bus,
  which allows physically proximate attackers to drive a vehicle by accessing the control CAN
  bus after pulling the bumper away and reaching the headlight connector, and then sending forged
  "Key is validated" messages via CAN Injection, as exploited in the wild in (for example) July
  2022.
