summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine
  (ISE) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a stored cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attack on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input
  validation by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by providing malicious data to a specific field within the interface. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface
  or access sensitive, browser-based information. Cisco ISE Software releases 2.7.0 and later
  contains the fix for this vulnerability.
