summary: "A vulnerability in the installation process of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an\
  \ authenticated, local attacker to bypass Cisco IOS XR Software image signature verification\
  \ and load unsigned software on an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker\
  \ must have root-system privileges on the affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due\
  \ to incomplete validation of files during the installation of an .iso file. An attacker could\
  \ exploit this vulnerability by modifying contents of the .iso image and then installing and\
  \ activating it on the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to load an unsigned\
  \ file as part of the image activation process."
