aliases: []
summary: Adminer is open-source database management software. Adminer v5.4.1 and earlier has
  a version check mechanism where adminer.org sends signed version info via JavaScript postMessage,
  which the browser then POSTs to ?script=version. This endpoint lacks origin validation and
  accepts POST data from any source. An attacker can POST version[] parameter which PHP converts
  to an array. On next page load, openssl_verify() receives this array instead of string and
  throws TypeError, returning HTTP 500 to all users. Upgrade to Adminer 5.4.2.
