  iommu/iova: Fix alloc iova overflows issue

  In __alloc_and_insert_iova_range, there is an issue that retry_pfn
  overflows. The value of iovad->anchor.pfn_hi is ~0UL, then when
  iovad->cached_node is iovad->anchor, curr_iova->pfn_hi + 1 will
  overflow. As a result, if the retry logic is executed, low_pfn is
  updated to 0, and then new_pfn < low_pfn returns false to make the
  allocation successful.

  This issue occurs in the following two situations:
  1. The first iova size exceeds the domain size. When initializing
  iova domain, iovad->cached_node is assigned as iovad->anchor. For
  example, the iova domain size is 10M, start_pfn is 0x1_F000_0000,
  and the iova size allocated for the first time is 11M. The
  following is the log information, new->pfn_lo is smaller than
  iovad->cached_node.

  Example log as follows:
  [  223.798112][T1705487] sh: [name:iova&]__alloc_and_insert_iova_range
  start_pfn:0x1f0000,retry_pfn:0x0,size:0xb00,limit_pfn:0x1f0a00
  [  223.799590][T1705487] sh: [name:iova&]__alloc_and_insert_iova_range
  success start_pfn:0x1f0000,new->pfn_lo:0x1efe00,new->pfn_hi:0x1f08ff

  2. The node with the largest iova->pfn_lo value in the iova domain
  is deleted, iovad->cached_node will be updated to iovad->anchor,
  and then the alloc iova size exceeds the maximum iova size that can
  be allocated in the domain.

  After judging that retry_pfn is less than limit_pfn, call retry_pfn+1
  to fix the overflow issue.
