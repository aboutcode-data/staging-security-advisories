aliases: []
summary: There is a difficult‑to‑exploit improper authentication issue in the Home application
  for Esri Portal for ArcGIS versions 11.2 and below on Windows and Linux, and ArcGIS Enterprise
  versions 11.1 and below on Kubernetes, which under unique circumstances could allow a remote,
  authenticated attacker with low‑privileged access to compromise the confidentiality, integrity,
  and availability of the software. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to cross an
  authentication and authorization boundary beyond their originally assigned access, resulting
  in a scope change.
