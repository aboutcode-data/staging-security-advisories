aliases: []
summary: Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. A specially crafted Lua script
  executing in Redis can trigger a heap overflow in the cjson library, and result with heap
  corruption and potentially remote code execution. The problem exists in all versions of Redis
  with Lua scripting support, starting from 2.6, and affects only authenticated and authorized
  users. The problem is fixed in versions 7.0.12, 6.2.13, and 6.0.20.
