aliases: []
summary: Products.CMFCore are the key framework services for the Zope Content Management Framework
  (CMF). The use of Python's marshal module to handle unchecked input in a public method on
  `PortalFolder` objects can lead to an unauthenticated denial of service and crash situation.
  The code in question is exposed by all portal software built on top of `Products.CMFCore`,
  such as Plone. All deployments are vulnerable. The code has been fixed in `Products.CMFCore`
  version 3.2.
