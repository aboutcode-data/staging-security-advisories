aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS) portal. When rendering
  a table view in the portal, for example, on any of the /main/configmanagement/* endpoints,
  the front-end generates a DOM table-element (id="pdf-table"). This information is then populated
  with unsanitized data using innerHTML. An attacker with some control over the data rendered
  can trigger a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
