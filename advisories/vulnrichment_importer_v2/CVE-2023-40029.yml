summary: 'Argo CD is a declarative continuous deployment for Kubernetes. Argo CD Cluster secrets
  might be managed declaratively using Argo CD / kubectl apply. As a result, the full secret
  body is stored in`kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration` annotation. pull request
  #7139 introduced the ability to manage cluster labels and annotations. Since clusters are
  stored as secrets it also exposes the `kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration` annotation
  which includes full secret body. In order to view the cluster annotations via the Argo CD
  API, the user must have `clusters, get` RBAC access. **Note:** In many cases, cluster secrets
  do not contain any actually-secret information. But sometimes, as in bearer-token auth, the
  contents might be very sensitive. The bug has been patched in versions 2.8.3, 2.7.14, and
  2.6.15. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should update/deploy cluster
  secret with `server-side-apply` flag which does not use or rely on `kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration`
  annotation. Note: annotation for existing secrets will require manual removal.'
