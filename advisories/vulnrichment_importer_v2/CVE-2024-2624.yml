aliases: []
summary: A path traversal and arbitrary file upload vulnerability exists in the parisneo/lollms-webui
  application, specifically within the `@router.get("/switch_personal_path")` endpoint in `./lollms-webui/lollms_core/lollms/server/endpoints/lollms_user.py`.
  The vulnerability arises due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input for the `path`
  parameter, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary file system paths. This flaw enables
  direct arbitrary file uploads, leakage of `personal_data`, and overwriting of configurations
  in `lollms-webui`->`configs` by exploiting the same named directory in `personal_data`. The
  issue affects the latest version of the application and is fixed in version 9.4. Successful
  exploitation could lead to sensitive information disclosure, unauthorized file uploads, and
  potentially remote code execution by overwriting critical configuration files.
