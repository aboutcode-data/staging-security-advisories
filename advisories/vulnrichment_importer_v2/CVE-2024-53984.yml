  option PB_ENABLE_MALLOC is enabled, the message contains at least one field with FT_POINTER
  field type, custom stream callback is used with unknown stream length. and the pb_decode_ex()
  function is used with flag PB_DECODE_DELIMITED, then the pb_decode_ex() function does not
  automatically call pb_release(), like is done for other failure cases. This could lead to
