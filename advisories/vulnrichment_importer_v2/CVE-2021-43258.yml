aliases: []
summary: CartView.php in ChurchInfo 1.3.0 allows attackers to achieve remote code execution
  through insecure uploads. This requires authenticated access tot he ChurchInfo application.
  Once authenticated, a user can add names to their cart, and compose an email. Uploading an
  attachment for the email stores the attachment on the site in the /tmp_attach/ folder where
  it can be accessed with a GET request. There are no limitations on files that can be attached,
  allowing for malicious PHP code to be uploaded and interpreted by the server.
