aliases: []
summary: Taguette is an open source qualitative research tool. In versions 1.5.1 and below,  attackers
  can craft malicious URLs that redirect users to arbitrary external websites after authentication.
  The application accepts a user-controlled next parameter and uses it directly in HTTP redirects
  without any validation. This can be exploited for phishing attacks where victims believe they
  are interacting with a trusted Taguette instance but are redirected to a malicious site designed
  to steal credentials or deliver malware. This issue is fixed in version 1.5.2.
