  drm/amd/display: fix incorrect mpc_combine array size

  [why]
  MAX_SURFACES is per stream, while MAX_PLANES is per asic. The
  mpc_combine is an array that records all the planes per asic. Therefore
  MAX_PLANES should be used as the array size. Using MAX_SURFACES causes
  array overflow when there are more than 3 planes.

  [how]
  Use the MAX_PLANES for the mpc_combine array size.
