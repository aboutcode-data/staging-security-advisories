summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  nvmet: always initialize cqe.result

  The spec doesn't mandate that the first two double words (aka results)
  for the command queue entry need to be set to 0 when they are not
  used (not specified). Though, the target implemention returns 0 for TCP
  and FC but not for RDMA.

  Let's make RDMA behave the same and thus explicitly initializing the
  result field. This prevents leaking any data from the stack.
