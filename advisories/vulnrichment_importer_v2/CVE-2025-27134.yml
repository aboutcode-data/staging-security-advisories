aliases: []
summary: Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application, which can handle a
  large number of notes organised into notebooks. Prior to version 3.3.3, a privilege escalation
  vulnerability exists in the Joplin server, allowing non-admin users to exploit the API endpoint
  `PATCH /api/users/:id` to set the `is_admin` field to 1. The vulnerability allows malicious
  low-privileged users to perform administrative actions without proper authorization. This
  issue has been patched in version 3.3.3.
