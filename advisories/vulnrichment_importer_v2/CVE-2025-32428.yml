summary: Jupyter Remote Desktop Proxy allows you to run a Linux Desktop on a JupyterHub. jupyter-remote-desktop-proxy
  was meant to rely on UNIX sockets readable only by the current user since version 3.0.0, but
  when used with TigerVNC, the VNC server started by jupyter-remote-desktop-proxy were still
  accessible via the network. This vulnerability does not affect users having TurboVNC as the
  vncserver executable. This issue is fixed in 3.0.1.
