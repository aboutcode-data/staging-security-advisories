summary: "A vulnerability in the directory permissions of Cisco Desk Phone 9800 Series, Cisco\
  \ IP Phone 7800 and 8800 Series, and Cisco Video Phone 8875 could allow an unauthenticated,\
  \ remote attacker to access sensitive information on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability\
  \ exists because the product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly\
  \ authorized to have access to that information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by sending a crafted packet to the IP address of a device that has Web Access enabled. A\
  \ successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive information from the device.\r\
  \nNote: To exploit this vulnerability, Web Access must be enabled on the phone. Web Access\
  \ is disabled by default."
