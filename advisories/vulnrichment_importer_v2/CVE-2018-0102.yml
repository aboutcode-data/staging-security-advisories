aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Pong tool of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated,
  adjacent attacker to cause a reload of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service
  (DoS) condition. The vulnerability exists because the affected software attempts to free the
  same area of memory twice. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a pong
  request to an affected device from a location on the network that causes the pong reply packet
  to egress both a FabricPath port and a non-FabricPath port. An exploit could allow the attacker
  to cause a dual or quad supervisor virtual port-channel (vPC) to reload. This vulnerability
  affects the following products when running Cisco NX-OS Software Release 7.2(1)D(1), 7.2(2)D1(1),
  or 7.2(2)D1(2) with both the Pong and FabricPath features enabled and the FabricPath port
  is actively monitored via a SPAN session: Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches and Cisco Nexus
  7700 Series Switches. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCuv98660.'
