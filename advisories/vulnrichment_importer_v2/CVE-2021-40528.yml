aliases: []
summary: The ElGamal implementation in Libgcrypt before 1.9.4 allows plaintext recovery because,
  during interaction between two cryptographic libraries, a certain dangerous combination of
  the prime defined by the receiver's public key, the generator defined by the receiver's public
  key, and the sender's ephemeral exponents can lead to a cross-configuration attack against
  OpenPGP.
