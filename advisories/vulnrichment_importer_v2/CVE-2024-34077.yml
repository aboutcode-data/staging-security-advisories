aliases: []
summary: MantisBT (Mantis Bug Tracker) is an open source issue tracker. Insufficient access
  control in the registration and password reset process allows an attacker to reset another
  user's password and takeover their account, if the victim has an incomplete request pending.
  The exploit is only possible while the verification token is valid, i.e for 5 minutes after
  the confirmation URL sent by e-mail has been opened, and the user did not complete the process
  by updating their password. A brute-force attack calling account_update.php with increasing
  user IDs is possible. A successful takeover would grant the attacker full access to the compromised
  account, including sensitive information and functionalities associated with the account,
  the extent of which depends on its privileges and the data it has access to. Version 2.26.2
  contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may mitigate the risk by reducing the
  verification token's validity (change the value of the `TOKEN_EXPIRY_AUTHENTICATED` constant
  in `constants_inc.php`).
