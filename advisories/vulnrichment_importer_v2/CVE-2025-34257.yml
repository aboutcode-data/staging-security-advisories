aliases: []
summary: Advantech WISE-DeviceOn Server versions prior to 5.4 contain a stored cross-site scripting
  (XSS) vulnerability in the /rmm/v1/action/defined endpoint. When an authenticated user creates
  a task, the defined_name value is stored and later rendered in the Overview page without HTML
  sanitization. An attacker can inject malicious script into defined_name, which is then executed
  in the browser context of users who view the affected task, potentially enabling session compromise
  and unauthorized actions as the victim.
