aliases: []
summary: Wire-ios is a messaging application using the wire protocol on apple's ios platform.
  In versions prior to 3.95 malformed resource identifiers may render the iOS Wire Client completely
  unusable by causing it to repeatedly crash on launch. These malformed resource identifiers
  can be generated and sent between Wire users. The root cause lies in [wireapp/wire-ios-transport](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios-transport),
  where code responsible for removing sensible tokens before logging may fail and lead to a
  crash (Swift exception) of the application. This causes undesirable behavior, however the
  (greater) Wire system is still functional. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.
  There are no known workarounds for this issue.
