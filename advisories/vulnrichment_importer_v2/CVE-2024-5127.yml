aliases: []
summary: In lunary-ai/lunary versions 1.2.2 through 1.2.25, an improper access control vulnerability
  allows users on the Free plan to invite other members and assign them any role, including
  those intended for Paid and Enterprise plans only. This issue arises due to insufficient backend
  validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially
  exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects
  the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before
  allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized
  access and manipulation of project settings or data.
