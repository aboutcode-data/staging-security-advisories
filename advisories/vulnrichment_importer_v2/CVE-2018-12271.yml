aliases: []
summary: 'An issue was discovered in the com.getdropbox.Dropbox app 100.2 for iOS. The LAContext
  class for Biometric (TouchID) validation allows authentication bypass by overriding the LAContext
  return Boolean value to be "true" because the kSecAccessControlUserPresence protection mechanism
  is not used. In other words, an attacker could authenticate with an arbitrary fingerprint.
  NOTE: the vendor indicates that this is not an attack of interest within the context of their
  threat model, which excludes iOS devices on which a jailbreak has occurred'
