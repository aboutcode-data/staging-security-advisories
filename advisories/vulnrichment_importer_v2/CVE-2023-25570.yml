aliases: []
summary: Apollo is a configuration management system. Prior to version 2.1.0, there are potential
  security issues if users expose apollo-configservice to the internet, which is not recommended.
  This is because there is no authentication feature enabled for the built-in eureka service.
  Malicious hackers may access eureka directly to mock apollo-configservice and apollo-adminservice.
  Login authentication for eureka was added in version 2.1.0. As a workaround, avoid exposing
  apollo-configservice to the internet.
