summary: |
  D-Link DAP-1360 webproc var:sys_Token Heap-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of D-Link DAP-1360 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

  The specific flaw exists within the handling requests to the /cgi-bin/webproc endpoint. When parsing the var:sys_Token parameter, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.
  . Was ZDI-CAN-18418.
