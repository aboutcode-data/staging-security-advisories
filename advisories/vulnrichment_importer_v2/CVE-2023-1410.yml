aliases: []
summary: "Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. \n\nGrafana had\
  \ a stored XSS vulnerability in the Graphite FunctionDescription tooltip. \n\nThe stored XSS\
  \ vulnerability was possible due the value of the Function Description was not properly sanitized.\n\
  \nAn attacker needs to have control over the Graphite data source in order to manipulate a\
  \ function description and a Grafana admin needs to configure the data source, later a Grafana\
  \ user needs to select a tampered function and hover over the description. \n\n  Users may\
  \ upgrade to version 8.5.22, 9.2.15 and 9.3.11 to receive a fix."
