aliases: []
summary: 'An issue was discovered in the character definitions of the Unicode Specification
  through 14.0. The specification allows an adversary to produce source code identifiers such
  as function names using homoglyphs that render visually identical to a target identifier.
  Adversaries can leverage this to inject code via adversarial identifier definitions in upstream
  software dependencies invoked deceptively in downstream software. NOTE: the Unicode Consortium
  offers the following alternative approach to presenting this concern. An issue is noted in
  the nature of international text that can affect applications that implement support for The
  Unicode Standard (all versions). Unless mitigated, an adversary could produce source code
  identifiers using homoglyph characters that render visually identical to but are distinct
  from a target identifier. In this way, an adversary could inject adversarial identifier definitions
  in upstream software that are not detected by human reviewers and are invoked deceptively
  in downstream software. The Unicode Consortium has documented this class of security vulnerability
  in its document, Unicode Technical Report #36, Unicode Security Considerations. The Unicode
  Consortium also provides guidance on mitigations for this class of issues in Unicode Technical
  Standard #39, Unicode Security Mechanisms.'
