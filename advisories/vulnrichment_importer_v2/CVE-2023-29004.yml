aliases: []
summary: hap-wi/roxy-wi is a web interface for managing Haproxy, Nginx, Apache and Keepalived
  servers. A Path Traversal vulnerability was found in the current version of Roxy-WI (6.3.9.0
  at the moment of writing this report). The vulnerability can be exploited via an HTTP request
  to /app/options.py and the config_file_name parameter. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability
  could allow an attacker with user level privileges to obtain the content of arbitrary files
  on the file server within the scope of what the server process has access to. The root-cause
  of the vulnerability lies in the get_config function of the /app/modules/config/config.py
  file, which only checks for relative path traversal, but still allows to read files from absolute
  locations passed via the config_file_name parameter.
