summary: The WPGYM - Wordpress Gym Management System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
  file uploads due to missing file type validation in the MJ_gmgt_user_avatar_image_upload()

  attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code
  execution possible.
