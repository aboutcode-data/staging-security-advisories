aliases: []
summary: The MStore API – Create Native Android & iOS Apps On The Cloud plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to limited privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 4.17.4.
  This is due to a lack of restriction of role when registering. This makes it possible for
  unauthenticated attackers to to register with the 'wcfm_vendor' role, which is a Store Vendor
  role in the WCFM Marketplace – Multivendor Marketplace for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress.
  The vulnerability can only be exploited if the WCFM Marketplace – Multivendor Marketplace
  for WooCommerce plugin is installed and activated. The vulnerability was partially patched
  in version 4.17.3.
