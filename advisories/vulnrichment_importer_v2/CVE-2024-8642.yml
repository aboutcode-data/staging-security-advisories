datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2024/8xxx/CVE-2024-8642.json
aliases: []
summary: In Eclipse Dataspace Components, from version 0.5.0 and before version 0.9.0, the ConsumerPullTransferTokenValidationApiController
  does not check for token validity (expiry, not-before, issuance date), which can allow an
  attacker to bypass the check for token expiration. The issue requires to have a dataplane
  configured to support http proxy consumer pull AND include the module "transfer-data-plane".
  The affected code was marked deprecated from the version 0.6.0 in favour of Dataplane Signaling.
  In 0.9.0 the vulnerable code has been removed.
