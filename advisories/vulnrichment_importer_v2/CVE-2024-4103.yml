aliases: []
summary: The ADFO – Custom data in admin dashboard plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.0. This is due to missing or incorrect
  nonce validation on several functions hooked via the controller() function. This makes it
  possible for unauthenticated attackers to edit the plugin's settings via a forged request
  granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on
  a link.
