summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mm: vmalloc: check if a hash-index is in cpu_possible_mask

  The problem is that there are systems where cpu_possible_mask has gaps
  between set CPUs, for example SPARC.  In this scenario addr_to_vb_xa()
  hash function can return an index which accesses to not-possible and not
  setup CPU area using per_cpu() macro.  This results in an oops on SPARC.

  A per-cpu vmap_block_queue is also used as hash table, incorrectly
  assuming the cpu_possible_mask has no gaps.  Fix it by adjusting an index
  to a next possible CPU.
