aliases: []
summary: The WPC Smart Wishlist for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure
  Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 5.0.3 via several wishlist AJAX
  functions due to missing validation on a user controlled key that is exposed when wishlists
  are shared. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to empty and add to other
  user's wishlists, if they have access to the key.
