summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  of: dynamic: Synchronize of_changeset_destroy() with the devlink removals

  In the following sequence:
    1) of_platform_depopulate()
    2) of_overlay_remove()

  During the step 1, devices are destroyed and devlinks are removed.
  During the step 2, OF nodes are destroyed but
  __of_changeset_entry_destroy() can raise warnings related to missing
  of_node_put():
    ERROR: memory leak, expected refcount 1 instead of 2 ...

  Indeed, during the devlink removals performed at step 1, the removal
  itself releasing the device (and the attached of_node) is done by a job
  queued in a workqueue and so, it is done asynchronously with respect to
  function calls.
  When the warning is present, of_node_put() will be called but wrongly
  too late from the workqueue job.

  In order to be sure that any ongoing devlink removals are done before
  the of_node destruction, synchronize the of_changeset_destroy() with the
  devlink removals.
