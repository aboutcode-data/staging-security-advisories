aliases: []
summary: The OWASP core rule set (CRS) is a set of generic attack detection rules for use with
  compatible web application firewalls. Prior to versions 4.22.0 and 3.3.8, the current rule
  922110 has a bug when processing multipart requests with multiple parts. When the first rule
  in a chain iterates over a collection (like `MULTIPART_PART_HEADERS`), the capture variables
  (`TX:0`, `TX:1`) get overwritten with each iteration. Only the last captured value is available
  to the chained rule, which means malicious charsets in earlier parts can be missed if a later
  part has a legitimate charset. Versions 4.22.0 and 3.3.8 patch the issue.
