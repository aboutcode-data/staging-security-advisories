summary: A vulnerability in the web-based interface of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Software
  could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view sensitive information. The issue is
  due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input in HTTP request parameters that describe

  techniques to submit a path to a desired file location. A successful exploit could allow the
  attacker to view system files on the targeted device, which may contain sensitive information.
