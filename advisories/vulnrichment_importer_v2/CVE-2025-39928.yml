  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  i2c: rtl9300: ensure data length is within supported range

  Add an explicit check for the xfer length to 'rtl9300_i2c_config_xfer'
  to ensure the data length isn't within the supported range. In
  particular a data length of 0 is not supported by the hardware and
  causes unintended or destructive behaviour.

  This limitation becomes obvious when looking at the register
  documentation [1]. 4 bits are reserved for DATA_WIDTH and the value
  of these 4 bits is used as N + 1, allowing a data length range of
  1 <= len <= 16.

  Affected by this is the SMBus Quick Operation which works with a data
  length of 0. Passing 0 as the length causes an underflow of the value
  due to:

  (len - 1) & 0xf

  and effectively specifying a transfer length of 16 via the registers.
  This causes a 16-byte write operation instead of a Quick Write. For
  example, on SFP modules without write-protected EEPROM this soft-bricks
  them by overwriting some initial bytes.

  For completeness, also add a quirk for the zero length.
