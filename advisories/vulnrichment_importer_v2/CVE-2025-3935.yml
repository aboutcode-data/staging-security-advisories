aliases: []
summary: "ScreenConnect versions 25.2.3 and earlier versions may be susceptible to a ViewState\
  \ code injection attack. ASP.NET Web Forms use ViewState to preserve page and control state,\
  \ with data encoded using Base64 protected by machine keys. \nIt is important to note that\
  \ to obtain these machine keys, privileged system level access must be obtained. \n\n\n\n\
  If these machine keys are compromised, attackers could create and send a malicious ViewState\
  \ to the website, potentially leading to remote code execution on the server. \n\n\n\nThe\
  \ risk does not originate from a vulnerability introduced by ScreenConnect, but from platform\
  \ level behavior.  This had no direct impact to ScreenConnect Client. ScreenConnect 2025.4\
  \ patch disables ViewState and removes any dependency on it."
