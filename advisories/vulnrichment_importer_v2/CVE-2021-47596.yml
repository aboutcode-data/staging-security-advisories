  net: hns3: fix use-after-free bug in hclgevf_send_mbx_msg

  Currently, the hns3_remove function firstly uninstall client instance,
  and then uninstall acceletion engine device. The netdevice is freed in

  process still use it to trace runtime information. This causes a use after
  free problem.

  So fixes it by check the instance register state to avoid use after free.
