aliases: []
summary: Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host prior to version 25.1.102
  and Application prior to version 25.1.1413 (Windows client deployments) contain a registry
  key that can be enabled by administrators, causing the client to skip SSL/TLS certificate
  validation. An attacker who can intercept HTTPS traffic can then inject malicious driver DLLs,
  resulting in remote code execution with SYSTEM privileges; a local attacker can achieve local
  privilege escalation via a junction‑point DLL injection. This vulnerability has been confirmed
  to be remediated, but it is unclear as to when the patch was introduced.
