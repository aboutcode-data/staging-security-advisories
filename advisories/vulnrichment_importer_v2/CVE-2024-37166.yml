aliases: []
summary: ghtml is software that uses tagged templates for template engine functionality. It
  is possible to introduce user-controlled JavaScript code and trigger a Cross-Site Scripting
  (XSS) vulnerability in some cases. Version 2.0.0 introduces changes to mitigate this issue.
  Version 2.0.0 contains updated documentation to clarify that while ghtml escapes characters
  with special meaning in HTML, it does not provide comprehensive protection against all types
  of XSS attacks in every scenario. This aligns with the approach taken by other template engines.
  Developers should be cautious and take additional measures to sanitize user input and prevent
  potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, the backtick character (`) is now also escaped to
  prevent the creation of strings in most cases where a malicious actor somehow gains the ability
  to write JavaScript. This does not provide comprehensive protection either.
