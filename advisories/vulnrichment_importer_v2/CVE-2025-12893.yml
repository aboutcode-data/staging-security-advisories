aliases: []
summary: "Clients may successfully perform a TLS handshake with a MongoDB server despite presenting\
  \ a client certificate not aligning with the documented Extended Key Usage (EKU) requirements.\
  \ A certificate that specifies extendedKeyUsage but is missing extendedKeyUsage = clientAuth\
  \ may still be successfully authenticated via the TLS handshake as a client. This issue is\
  \ specific to MongoDB servers running on Windows or Apple as the expected validation behavior\
  \ functions correctly on Linux systems.\n\nAdditionally, MongoDB servers may successfully\
  \ establish egress TLS connections with servers that present server certificates not aligning\
  \ with the documented Extended Key Usage (EKU) requirements. A certificate that specifies\
  \ extendedKeyUsage but is missing extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth may still be successfully\
  \ authenticated via the TLS handshake as a server. This issue is specific to MongoDB servers\
  \ running on Apple as the expected validation behavior functions correctly on both Linux and\
  \ Windows systems. \n\nThis vulnerability affects MongoDB Server v7.0 versions prior to 7.0.26,\
  \ MongoDB Server v8.0 versions prior to 8.0.16 and MongoDB Server v8.2 versions prior to 8.2.2"
