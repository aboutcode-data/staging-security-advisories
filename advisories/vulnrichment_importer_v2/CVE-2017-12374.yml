aliases: []
summary: The ClamAV AntiVirus software versions 0.99.2 and prior contain a vulnerability that
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition
  on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation checking mechanisms
  during certain mail parsing operations (mbox.c operations on bounce messages). If successfully
  exploited, the ClamAV software could allow a variable pointing to the mail body which could
  cause a used after being free (use-after-free) instance which may lead to a disruption of
  services on an affected device to include a denial of service condition.
