summary: Adobe Document Service allows an attacker with administrator privileges to send a crafted
  request from a vulnerable web application. It is usually used to target internal systems behind
  firewalls that are normally inaccessible to an attacker from the external network, resulting
  in a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability. On successful exploitation, the attacker can
  read or modify any file and/or make the entire system unavailable.
