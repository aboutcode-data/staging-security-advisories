aliases: []
summary: The YSlider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery to Stored
  Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 1.1. This is due to missing nonce
  verification on the content configuration page and insufficient input sanitization and output
  escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
  in pages via a forged request granted they can trick an administrator into performing an action
  such as clicking on a link. The injected scripts will execute whenever a user accesses an
  injected page.
