aliases: []
summary: eGovFramework/egovframe-common-components versions up to and including 4.3.1 includes Web
  Editor image upload and related file delivery functionality that uses symmetric encryption
  to protect URL parameters, but exposes an encryption oracle that allows attackers to generate
  valid ciphertext for chosen values. The image upload endpoints /utl/wed/insertImage.do and
  /utl/wed/insertImageCk.do encrypt server-side paths, filenames, and MIME types and embed them
  directly into a download URL that is returned to the client. Because these same encrypted
  parameters are trusted by other endpoints, such as /utl/web/imageSrc.do and /cmm/fms/getImage.do,
  an unauthenticated attacker can abuse the upload functionality to obtain encrypted representations
  of attacker-chosen identifiers and then replay those ciphertext values to file-serving APIs.
  This design failure allows an attacker to bypass access controls that rely solely on the secrecy
  of encrypted parameters and retrieve arbitrary stored files that are otherwise expected to
  require an existing session or specific authorization context. KISA/KrCERT has identified
  this unpatched vulnerability as "KVE-2023-5281."
