aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Deterministic Random Bit Generator (DRBG), also known as Pseudorandom
  Number Generator (PRNG), used in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco
  Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
  cause a cryptographic collision, enabling the attacker to discover the private key of an affected
  device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient entropy in the DRBG when generating cryptographic
  keys. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by generating a large number of cryptographic
  keys on an affected device and looking for collisions with target devices. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to impersonate an affected target device or to decrypt traffic secured
  by an affected key that is sent to or from an affected target device.
