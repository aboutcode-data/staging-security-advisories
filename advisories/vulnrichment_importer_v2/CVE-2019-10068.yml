datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2019/10xxx/CVE-2019-10068.json
aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Kentico 12.0.x before 12.0.15, 11.0.x before 11.0.48, 10.0.x
  before 10.0.52, and 9.x versions. Due to a failure to validate security headers, it was possible
  for a specially crafted request to the staging service to bypass the initial authentication
  and proceed to deserialize user-controlled .NET object input. This deserialization then led
  to unauthenticated remote code execution on the server where the Kentico instance was hosted.
