aliases: []
summary: Nukegraphic CMS v3.1.2 contains a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in
  the user profile edit functionality at /ngc-cms/user-edit-profile.php. The application fails
  to properly sanitize user input in the name field before storing it in the database and rendering
  it across multiple CMS pages. An authenticated attacker with low privileges can inject malicious
  JavaScript payloads through the profile edit request, which are then executed site-wide whenever
  the affected user's name is displayed. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript
  in the context of other users' sessions, potentially leading to session hijacking, credential
  theft, or unauthorized actions performed on behalf of victims.
