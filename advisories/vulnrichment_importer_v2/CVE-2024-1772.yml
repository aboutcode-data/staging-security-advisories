aliases: []
summary: The Play.ht – Make Your Blog Posts Accessible With Text to Speech Audio plugin for
  WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.4
  via deserialization of untrusted input from the play_podcast_data post meta. This makes it
  possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject a
  PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present
  via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker
  to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
