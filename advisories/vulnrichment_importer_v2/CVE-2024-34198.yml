aliases: []
summary: TOTOLINK AC1200 Wireless Router A3002RU V2.1.1-B20230720.1011 is vulnerable to Buffer
  Overflow. The formWlEncrypt CGI handler in the boa program fails to limit the length of the
  wlan_ssid field from user input. This allows attackers to craft malicious HTTP requests by
  supplying an excessively long value for the wlan_ssid field, leading to a stack overflow.
  This can be further exploited to execute arbitrary commands or launch denial-of-service attacks.
