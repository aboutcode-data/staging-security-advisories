aliases: []
summary: The Wicked Folders plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to
  a missing capability check on the ajax_delete_folder function in versions up to, and including,
  2.18.16. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions
  and above, to invoke this function and perform actions intended for administrators such as
  modifying the folder structure maintained by the plugin.
