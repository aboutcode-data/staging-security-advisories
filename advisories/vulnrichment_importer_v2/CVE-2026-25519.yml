aliases: []
summary: OpenSlides is a free, web based presentation and assembly system for managing and projecting
  agenda, motions and elections of an assembly. Prior to version 4.2.29, OpenSlides supports
  local logins with username and password or an optionally configurable single sign on with
  SAML via an external IDP. For users synced to OpenSlides via an external IDP, there is an
  incorrect access control regarding the local login of these users. Users can successfully
  login using the local login form and the OpenSlides username of a SAML user and a trivial
  password. This password is valid for all SAML users. This issue has been patched in version
  4.2.29.
