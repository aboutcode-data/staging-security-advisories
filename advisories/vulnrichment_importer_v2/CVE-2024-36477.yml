  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  tpm_tis_spi: Account for SPI header when allocating TPM SPI xfer buffer

  The TPM SPI transfer mechanism uses MAX_SPI_FRAMESIZE for computing the
  maximum transfer length and the size of the transfer buffer. As such, it
  does not account for the 4 bytes of header that prepends the SPI data
  frame. This can result in out-of-bounds accesses and was confirmed with
  KASAN.

  Introduce SPI_HDRSIZE to account for the header and use to allocate the
  transfer buffer.
