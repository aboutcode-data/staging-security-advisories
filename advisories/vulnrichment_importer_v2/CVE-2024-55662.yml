aliases: []
summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 3.3-milestone-1 and
  prior to versions 15.10.9 and 16.3.0, on instances where `Extension Repository Application`
  is installed, any user can execute any code requiring `programming` rights on the server.
  This vulnerability has been fixed in XWiki 15.10.9 and 16.3.0. Since `Extension Repository
  Application` is not mandatory, it can be safely disabled on instances that do not use it as
  a workaround. It is also possible to manually apply the patches from commit 8659f17d500522bf33595e402391592a35a162e8
  to the page `ExtensionCode.ExtensionSheet` and to the page `ExtensionCode.ExtensionAuthorsDisplayer`.
