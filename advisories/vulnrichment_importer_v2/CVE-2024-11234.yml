datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2024/11xxx/CVE-2024-11234.json
aliases: []
summary: In PHP versions 8.1.* before 8.1.31, 8.2.* before 8.2.26, 8.3.* before 8.3.14, when
  using streams with configured proxy and "request_fulluri" option, the URI is not properly
  sanitized which can lead to HTTP request smuggling and allow the attacker to use the proxy
  to perform arbitrary HTTP requests originating from the server, thus potentially gaining access
  to resources not normally available to the external user.
