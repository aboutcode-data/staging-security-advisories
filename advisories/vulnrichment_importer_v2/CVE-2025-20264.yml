aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine\
  \ (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass the authorization mechanisms\
  \ for specific administrative functions.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient\
  \ authorization enforcement mechanisms for users created by SAML SSO integration with an external\
  \ identity provider. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a series of\
  \ specific commands to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to\
  \ modify a limited number of system settings, including some that would result in a system\
  \ restart. In single-node Cisco ISE deployments, devices that are not authenticated to the\
  \ network will not be able to authenticate until the Cisco ISE system comes back online.&nbsp;"
