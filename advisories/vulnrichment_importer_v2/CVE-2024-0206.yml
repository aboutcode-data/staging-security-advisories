summary: A symbolic link manipulation vulnerability in Trellix Anti-Malware Engine prior to
  the January 2024 release allows an authenticated local user to potentially gain an escalation
  of privileges. This was achieved by adding an entry to the registry under the Trellix ENS
  registry folder with a symbolic link to files that the user wouldn't normally have permission
  to. After a scan, the Engine would follow the links and remove the files
