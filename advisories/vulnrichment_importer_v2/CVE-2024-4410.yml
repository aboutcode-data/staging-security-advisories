summary: The IgnitionDeck Crowdfunding Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing
  Authorization in versions up to, and including, 1.9.8. This is due to missing capability checks
  on various functions called via AJAX actions in the ~/classes/class-idf-wizard.php file. This
  makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber access or higher, to execute
  various AJAX actions. This includes actions to change the permalink structure, plugin settings
  and others.
