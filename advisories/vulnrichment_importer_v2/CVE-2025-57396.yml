aliases: []
summary: Tandoor Recipes 2.0.0-alpha-1, fixed in 2.0.0-alpha-2, is vulnerable to privilege escalation.
  This is due to the rework of the API, which resulted in the User Profile API Endpoint containing
  two boolean values indicating whether a user is staff or administrative. Consequently, any
  user can escalate their privileges to the highest level.
