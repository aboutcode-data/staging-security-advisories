  ASoC: qcom: sc7280: Fix missing Soundwire runtime stream alloc

  Commit 15c7fab0e047 ("ASoC: qcom: Move Soundwire runtime stream alloc to
  soundcards") moved the allocation of Soundwire stream runtime from the
  Qualcomm Soundwire driver to each individual machine sound card driver,
  except that it forgot to update SC7280 card.

  Just like for other Qualcomm sound cards using Soundwire, the card
  driver should allocate and release the runtime.  Otherwise sound
  playback will result in a NULL pointer dereference or other effect of
  uninitialized memory accesses (which was confirmed on SDM845 having
  similar issue).
