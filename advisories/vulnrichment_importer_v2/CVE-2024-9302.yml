aliases: []
summary: The App Builder – Create Native Android & iOS Apps On The Flight plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including,
  5.3.7. This is due to the verify_otp_forgot_password() and update_password() functions not
  having enough controls to prevent a successful brute force attack of the OTP to change a password,
  or verify that a password reset request came from an authorized user. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to generate and brute force an OTP that makes it possible to
  change any users passwords, including an administrator.
