aliases: []
summary: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.0.2 of the `stable`
  branch and version 3.1.0.beta3 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, a user logged as
  an administrator can request backups multiple times, which will eat up all the connections
  to the DB. If this is done on a site using multisite, then it can affect the whole cluster.
  The vulnerability is patched in version 3.0.2 of the `stable` branch and version 3.1.0.beta3
  of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. There are no known workarounds.
