summary: Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and
  response. Prior to 4.11.0, fim_alert() implementation does not check whether the return value
  of ctime_r is NULL or not before calling strdup() on it. A compromised agent can cause a crash
  of analysisd by sending a specially crafted message to the wazuh manager. An attacker who
  is able to craft and send an agent message to the wazuh manager can cause analysisd to crash
  and make it unavailable. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.11.0.
