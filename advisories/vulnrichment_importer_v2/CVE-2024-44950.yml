  serial: sc16is7xx: fix invalid FIFO access with special register set

  When enabling access to the special register set, Receiver time-out and
  RHR interrupts can happen. In this case, the IRQ handler will try to read
  from the FIFO thru the RHR register at address 0x00, but address 0x00 is
  mapped to DLL register, resulting in erroneous FIFO reading.

  Call graph example:
      sc16is7xx_startup(): entry
      sc16is7xx_ms_proc(): entry
      sc16is7xx_set_termios(): entry
      sc16is7xx_set_baud(): DLH/DLL = $009C --> access special register set
      sc16is7xx_port_irq() entry            --> IIR is 0x0C
      sc16is7xx_handle_rx() entry
      sc16is7xx_fifo_read(): --> unable to access FIFO (RHR) because it is
                                 mapped to DLL (LCR=LCR_CONF_MODE_A)
      sc16is7xx_set_baud(): exit --> Restore access to general register set

  Fix the problem by claiming the efr_lock mutex when accessing the Special
  register set.
