aliases: []
summary: 'Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco Discovery Protocol implementation for Cisco
  Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP Cameras could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker
  to execute code remotely or cause a reload of an affected IP camera. These vulnerabilities
  are due to missing checks when the IP cameras process a Cisco Discovery Protocol packet. An
  attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol
  packet to the targeted IP camera. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute
  code on the affected IP camera or cause it to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of
  service (DoS) condition. Note: Cisco Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit
  these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device
  (Layer 2 adjacent).'
