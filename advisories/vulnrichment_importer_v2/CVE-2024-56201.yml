aliases: []
summary: Jinja is an extensible templating engine. In versions on the 3.x branch prior to 3.1.5,
  a bug in the Jinja compiler allows an attacker that controls both the content and filename
  of a template to execute arbitrary Python code, regardless of if Jinja's sandbox is used.
  To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control both the filename and the contents
  of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This
  vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates where the template
  author can also choose the template filename. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.5.
