  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  rxrpc: Fix missing locking causing hanging calls

  If a call gets aborted (e.g. because kafs saw a signal) between it being
  queued for connection and the I/O thread picking up the call, the abort
  will be prioritised over the connection and it will be removed from
  local->new_client_calls by rxrpc_disconnect_client_call() without a lock
  being held.  This may cause other calls on the list to disappear if a race
  occurs.

  Fix this by taking the client_call_lock when removing a call from whatever
  list its ->wait_link happens to be on.
