aliases: []
summary: Passport-SAML is a SAML 2.0 authentication provider for Passport, the Node.js authentication
  library. A remote attacker may be able to bypass SAML authentication on a website using passport-saml.
  A successful attack requires that the attacker is in possession of an arbitrary IDP signed
  XML element. Depending on the IDP used, fully unauthenticated attacks (e.g without access
  to a valid user) might also be feasible if generation of a signed message can be triggered.
  Users should upgrade to passport-saml version 3.2.2 or newer. The issue was also present in
  the beta releases of `node-saml` before version 4.0.0-beta.5. If you cannot upgrade, disabling
  SAML authentication may be done as a workaround.
