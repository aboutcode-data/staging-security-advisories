summary: The directory-pro WordPress plugin before 1.9.5, final-user-wp-frontend-user-profiles
  WordPress plugin before 1.2.2, producer-retailer WordPress plugin through TODO, photographer-directory
  WordPress plugin before 1.0.9, real-estate-pro WordPress plugin before 1.7.1, institutions-directory
  WordPress plugin before 1.3.1, lawyer-directory WordPress plugin before 1.2.9, doctor-listing
  WordPress plugin before 1.3.6, Hotel Listing WordPress plugin before 1.3.7, fitness-trainer
  WordPress plugin before 1.4.1, wp-membership WordPress plugin before 1.5.7, sold by the same
  developer (e-plugins), do not implementing any security measures in some AJAX calls. For example
  in the file plugin.php, the function iv_directories_update_profile_setting() uses update_user_meta
  with any data provided by the ajax call, which can be used to give the logged in user admin
  capabilities. Since the plugins allow user registration via a custom form (even if the blog
  does not allow users to register) it makes any site using it vulnerable.
