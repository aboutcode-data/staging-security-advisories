  RDMA/rxe: Fix seg fault in rxe_comp_queue_pkt

  In rxe_comp_queue_pkt() an incoming response packet skb is enqueued to the
  resp_pkts queue and then a decision is made whether to run the completer
  task inline or schedule it. Finally the skb is dereferenced to bump a 'hw'
  performance counter. This is wrong because if the completer task is
  already running in a separate thread it may have already processed the skb
  and freed it which can cause a seg fault.  This has been observed
  infrequently in testing at high scale.

  This patch fixes this by changing the order of enqueuing the packet until
  after the counter is accessed.
