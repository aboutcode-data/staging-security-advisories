aliases: []
summary: Magix Musik Maker 16 is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow due to improper
  handling of .mmm arrangement files. The vulnerability arises from an unsafe strcpy() operation
  that fails to validate input length, allowing attackers to overwrite the Structured Exception
  Handler (SEH). By crafting a malicious .mmm file, an attacker can trigger the overflow when
  the file is opened, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability was
  remediated in version 17.
