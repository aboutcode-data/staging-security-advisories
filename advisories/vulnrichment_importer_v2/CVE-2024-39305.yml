aliases: []
summary: Envoy is a cloud-native, open source edge and service proxy. Prior to versions 1.30.4,
  1.29.7, 1.28.5, and 1.27.7. Envoy references already freed memory when route hash policy is
  configured with cookie attributes. Note that this vulnerability has been fixed in the open
  as the effect would be immediately apparent if it was configured. Memory allocated for holding
  attribute values is freed after configuration was parsed. During request processing Envoy
  will attempt to copy content of de-allocated memory into request cookie header. This can lead
  to arbitrary content of Envoy's memory to be sent to the upstream service or abnormal process
  termination. This vulnerability is fixed in Envoy versions v1.30.4, v1.29.7, v1.28.5, and
  v1.27.7. As a workaround, do not use cookie attributes in route action hash policy.
