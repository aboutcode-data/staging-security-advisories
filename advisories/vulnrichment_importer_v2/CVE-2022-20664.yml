datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2022/20xxx/CVE-2022-20664.json
aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web management interface of Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager,
  formerly Cisco Security Management Appliance (SMA), and Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA)
  could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to retrieve sensitive information from a Lightweight
  Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) external authentication server connected to an affected device.
  This vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization while querying the external
  authentication server. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted query
  through an external authentication web page. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to gain access to sensitive information, including user credentials from the external authentication
  server. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid operator-level (or higher)
  credentials.
