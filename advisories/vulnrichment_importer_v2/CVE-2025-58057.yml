aliases: []
summary: Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development
  of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. In netty-codec-compression versions
  4.1.124.Final and below, and netty-codec versions 4.2.4.Final and below, when supplied with
  specially crafted input, BrotliDecoder and certain other decompression decoders will allocate
  a large number of reachable byte buffers, which can lead to denial of service. BrotliDecoder.decompress
  has no limit in how often it calls pull, decompressing data 64K bytes at a time. The buffers
  are saved in the output list, and remain reachable until OOM is hit. This is fixed in versions
  4.1.125.Final of netty-codec and 4.2.5.Final of netty-codec-compression.
