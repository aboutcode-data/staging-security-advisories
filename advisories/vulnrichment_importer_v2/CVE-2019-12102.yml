aliases: []
summary: 'Kentico 11 through 12 lets attackers upload and explore files without authentication
  via the cmsmodules/medialibrary/formcontrols/liveselectors/insertimageormedia/tabs_media.aspx
  URI. NOTE: The vendor disputes the report because the researcher did not configure the media
  library permissions correctly. The vendor states that by default all users can read/modify/upload
  files, and it’s up to the administrator to decide who should have access to the media library
  and set the permissions accordingly. See the vendor documentation in the references for more
  information'
