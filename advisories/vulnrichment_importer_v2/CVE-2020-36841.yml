summary: The WooCommerce Smart Coupons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass
  due to a missing capability check on the woocommerce_coupon_admin_init function in versions

  themselves gift certificates of any value, which could be redeemed for products sold on the
  victim’s storefront.
