aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the reassembly logic for fragmented IPv4 packets of Cisco StarOS
  running on virtual platforms could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a
  reload of the npusim process, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. There are
  four instances of the npusim process running per Service Function (SF) instance, each handling
  a subset of all traffic flowing across the device. It is possible to trigger a reload of all
  four instances of the npusim process around the same time. The vulnerability is due to improper
  handling of fragmented IPv4 packets containing options. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a malicious IPv4 packet across an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker
  to trigger a restart of the npusim process, which will result in all traffic queued toward
  this instance of the npusim process to be dropped while the process is restarting. The npusim
  process typically restarts within less than a second. This vulnerability affects: Cisco Virtualized
  Packet Core-Single Instance (VPC-SI), Cisco Virtualized Packet Core-Distributed Instance (VPC-DI),
  Cisco Ultra Packet Core (UPC). Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvh29613.'
