aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Cisco Packet Tracer for Windows could allow an authenticated, local
  attacker to perform a DLL injection attack on an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability,
  the attacker must have valid credentials on the Windows system. This vulnerability is due
  to incorrect handling of directory paths at run time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by inserting a configuration file in a specific path on the system, which can cause a malicious
  DLL file to be loaded when the application starts. A successful exploit could allow an attacker
  with normal user privileges to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges
  of another user&rsquo;s account.
