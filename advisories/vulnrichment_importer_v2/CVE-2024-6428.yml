aliases: []
summary: Mattermost versions 9.8.0, 9.7.x <= 9.7.4, 9.6.x <= 9.6.2, 9.5.x <= 9.5.5 fail to prevent
  specifying a RemoteId when creating a new user which allows an attacker to specify both a
  remoteId and the user ID, resulting in creating a user with a user-defined user ID. This can
  cause some broken functionality in User Management such administrative actions against the
  user not working.
