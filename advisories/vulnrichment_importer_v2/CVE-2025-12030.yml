aliases: []
summary: The ACF to REST API plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference
  in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.4. This is due to insufficient capability checks
  in the update_item_permissions_check() method, which only verifies that the current user has
  the edit_posts capability without checking object-specific permissions (e.g., edit_post($id),
  edit_user($id), manage_options). This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
  Contributor-level access and above, to modify ACF fields on posts they do not own, any user
  account, comments, taxonomy terms, and even the global options page via the /wp-json/acf/v3/{type}/{id}
  endpoints, granted they can authenticate to the site.
