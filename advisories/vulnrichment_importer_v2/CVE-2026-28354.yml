aliases: []
summary: 'ClipBucket v5 is an open source video sharing platform. Prior to version 5.5.3 #59,
  collection item operations are vulnerable to authorization flaws, allowing a normal authenticated
  user to modify another user’s collection items. This affects both add item (/actions/add_to_collection.php)
  due to missing authorization checks and delete item (/manage_collections.php?mode=manage_items...)
  due to a broken ownership check in removeItemFromCollection(). As a result, attackers can
  insert and remove items from collections they do not own. Version 5.5.3 #59 fixes the issue.'
