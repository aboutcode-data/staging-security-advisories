aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the application programming interface (API) of Cisco Smart Software
  Manager On-Prem could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to change user account information
  which can prevent users from logging in, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition
  of the web interface. The vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation in the API.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected
  device. An exploit could allow the attacker to change or corrupt user account information
  which could grant the attacker administrator access or prevent legitimate user access to the
  web interface, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
