aliases: []
summary: The WooCommerce Photo Reviews Premium plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication
  bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.13.2. This is due to the plugin not properly
  validating what user transient is being used in the login() function and not properly verifying
  the user's identity. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as user
  that has dismissed an admin notice in the past 30 days, which is often an administrator. Alternatively,
  a user can log in as any user with any transient that has a valid user_id as the value, though
  it would be more difficult to exploit this successfully.
