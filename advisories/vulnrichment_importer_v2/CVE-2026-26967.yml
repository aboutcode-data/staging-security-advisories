summary: PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C. In versions
  2.16 and below, there is a critical Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in PJSIP's H.264
  unpacketizer. The bug occurs when processing malformed SRTP packets, where the unpacketizer
  reads a 2-byte NAL unit size field without validating that both bytes are within the payload
  buffer bounds. The vulnerability affects applications that receive video using H.264. A patch
  is available at https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/commit/f821c214e52b11bae11e4cd3c7f0864538fb5491.
