aliases: []
summary: The PayPal Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.0.3. This is due to missing nonce validation on the form
  creation and management functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
  create new PayPal forms and modify PayPal payment settings via a forged request granted they
  can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
