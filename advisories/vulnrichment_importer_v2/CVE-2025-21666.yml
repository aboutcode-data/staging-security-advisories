aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  vsock: prevent null-ptr-deref in vsock_*[has_data|has_space]

  Recent reports have shown how we sometimes call vsock_*_has_data()
  when a vsock socket has been de-assigned from a transport (see attached
  links), but we shouldn't.

  Previous commits should have solved the real problems, but we may have
  more in the future, so to avoid null-ptr-deref, we can return 0
  (no space, no data available) but with a warning.

  This way the code should continue to run in a nearly consistent state
  and have a warning that allows us to debug future problems.
