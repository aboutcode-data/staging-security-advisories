aliases: []
summary: 'The side-channel protected T-Table implementation in wolfSSL up to version 5.6.5 protects
  against a side-channel attacker with cache-line resolution. In a controlled environment such
  as Intel SGX, an attacker can gain a per instruction sub-cache-line resolution allowing them
  to break the cache-line-level protection. For details on the attack refer to:  https://doi.org/10.46586/tches.v2024.i1.457-500'
