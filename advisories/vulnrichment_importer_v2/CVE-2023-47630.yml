aliases: []
summary: Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes. An issue was found in Kyverno that
  allowed an attacker to control the digest of images used by Kyverno users. The issue would
  require the attacker to compromise the registry that the Kyverno users fetch their images
  from. The attacker could then return an vulnerable image to the the user and leverage that
  to further escalate their position. As such, the attacker would need to know which images
  the Kyverno user consumes and know of one of multiple exploitable vulnerabilities in previous
  digests of the images. Alternatively, if the attacker has compromised the registry, they could
  craft a malicious image with a different digest with intentionally placed vulnerabilities
  and deliver the image to the user.  Users pulling their images by digests and from trusted
  registries are not impacted by this vulnerability. There is no evidence of this being exploited
  in the wild. The issue has been patched in 1.10.5. All users are advised to upgrade. There
  are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
