summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Content Security Management
  Appliance (SMA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface. The vulnerability
  is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface
  of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of
  the interface to click a maliciously crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive,
  browser-based information.
