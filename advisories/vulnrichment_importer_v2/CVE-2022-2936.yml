aliases: []
summary: The Image Hover Effects Ultimate plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via Video Link values that can be added to an Image Hover in versions up to, and
  including, 9.7.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
  possible for authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute
  whenever a user accesses an injected page. By default, the plugin only allows administrators
  access to edit Image Hovers, however, if a site admin makes the plugin's features available
  to lower privileged users through the 'Who Can Edit?' setting then this can be exploited by
  those users.
