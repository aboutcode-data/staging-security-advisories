aliases: []
summary: All versions of the package github.com/greenpau/caddy-security are vulnerable to Improper
  Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts via the two-factor authentication (2FA).
  Although the application blocks the user after several failed attempts to provide 2FA codes,
  attackers can bypass this blocking mechanism by automating the application’s full multistep
  2FA process.
