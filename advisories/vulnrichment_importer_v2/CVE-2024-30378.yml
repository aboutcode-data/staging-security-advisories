summary: "A Use After Free vulnerability in command processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS\
  \ on MX Series allows a local, authenticated attacker to cause the broadband edge service\
  \ manager daemon (bbe-smgd) to crash upon execution of specific CLI commands, creating a Denial\
  \ of Service (DoS) condition.  The process crashes and restarts automatically.\n\nWhen specific\
  \ CLI commands are executed, the bbe-smgd daemon attempts to write into an area of memory\
  \ (mgd socket) that was already closed, causing the process to crash.  This process manages\
  \ and controls the configuration of broadband subscriber sessions and services.  While the\
  \ process is unavailable, additional subscribers will not be able to connect to the device,\
  \ causing a temporary Denial of Service condition.\n\nThis issue only occurs if Graceful Routing\
  \ Engine Switchover (GRES) and Subscriber Management are enabled.\nThis issue affects Junos\
  \ OS:\n\n\n  *  All versions before 20.4R3-S5, \n  *  from 21.1 before 21.1R3-S4, \n  *  from\
  \ 21.2 before 21.2R3-S3, \n  *  from 21.3 before 21.3R3-S5, \n  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S5,\
  \ \n  *  from 22.1 before 22.1R3, \n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3, \n  *  from 22.3 before\
  \ 22.3R2;"
