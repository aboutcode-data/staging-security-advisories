  net: hns3: fix kernel crash when devlink reload during initialization

  The devlink reload process will access the hardware resources,
  but the register operation is done before the hardware is initialized.
  So, processing the devlink reload during initialization may lead to kernel
  crash.

  This patch fixes this by registering the devlink after
  hardware initialization.
