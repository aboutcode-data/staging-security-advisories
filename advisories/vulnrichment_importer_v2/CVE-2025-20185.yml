aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the implementation of the remote access functionality of Cisco\
  \ AsyncOS Software for Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager, Cisco Secure Email Gateway, and\
  \ Cisco Secure Web Appliance could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges\
  \ to root. The attacker must authenticate with valid administrator credentials.\r\n\r\nThis\
  \ vulnerability is due to an architectural flaw in the password generation algorithm for the\
  \ remote access functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by generating\
  \ a temporary password for the service account. A successful exploit could allow the attacker\
  \ to execute arbitrary commands as root and access the underlying operating system.\r\nNote:\
  \ The Security Impact Rating (SIR) for this vulnerability is Medium due to the unrestricted\
  \ scope of information that is accessible to an attacker."
