summary: 'A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the routing
  protocol daemon of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated,
  network based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). In a BGP rib sharding scenario,
  when an attribute of an active BGP route is updated memory will leak. As rpd memory usage
  increases over time the rpd process will eventually run out of memory, crash, and restart.
  The memory utilization can be monitored with the following CLI commands: show task memory
  show system processes extensive | match rpd This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS
