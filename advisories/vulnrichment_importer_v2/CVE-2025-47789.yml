aliases: []
summary: Horilla is a free and open source Human Resource Management System (HRMS). In versions
  up to and including 1.3, an attacker can craft a Horilla URL that refers to an external domain.
  Upon clicking and logging in, the user is redirected to an external domain. This allows the
  redirection to any arbitrary site, including phishing or malicious domains, which can be used
  to impersonate Horilla and trick users. Commit 1c72404df6888bb23af73c767fdaee5e6679ebd6 fixes
  the issue.
