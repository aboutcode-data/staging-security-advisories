summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  cachestat: do not flush stats in recency check

  syzbot detects that cachestat() is flushing stats, which can sleep, in its
  RCU read section (see [1]).  This is done in the workingset_test_recent()
  step (which checks if the folio's eviction is recent).

  Move the stat flushing step to before the RCU read section of cachestat,
  and skip stat flushing during the recency check.
