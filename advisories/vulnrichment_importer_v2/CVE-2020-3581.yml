aliases: []
summary: 'Multiple vulnerabilities in the web services interface of Cisco Adaptive Security
  Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an
  unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against a user
  of the web services interface of an affected device. The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient
  validation of user-supplied input by the web services interface of an affected device. An
  attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface to click
  a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script
  code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive, browser-based
  information. Note: These vulnerabilities affect only specific AnyConnect and WebVPN configurations.
  For more information, see the Vulnerable Products section.'
