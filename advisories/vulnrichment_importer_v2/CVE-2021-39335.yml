aliases: []
summary: The WpGenius Job Listing WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  due to insufficient input validation and sanitization via several parameters found in the
  ~/src/admin/class/class-wpgenious-job-listing-options.php file which allowed attackers with
  administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including
  1.0.2. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators,
  and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled.
