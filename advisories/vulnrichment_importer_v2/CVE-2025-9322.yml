aliases: []
summary: The Stripe Payment Forms by WP Full Pay – Accept Credit Card Payments, Donations &
  Subscriptions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'wpfs-form-name'
  parameter in all versions up to, and including, 8.3.1 due to insufficient escaping on the
  user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This
  makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already
  existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
