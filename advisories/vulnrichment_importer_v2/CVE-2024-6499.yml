aliases: []
summary: The WordPress Button Plugin MaxButtons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to information
  exposure in all versions up to, and including, 9.7.8. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to obtain the full path to instances, which they may be able to use in combination
  with other vulnerabilities or to simplify reconnaissance work. On its own, this information
  is of very limited use.
