  net: macsec: Fix offload support for NETDEV_UNREGISTER event

  Current macsec netdev notify handler handles NETDEV_UNREGISTER event by
  releasing relevant SW resources only, this causes resources leak in case
  of macsec HW offload, as the underlay driver was not notified to clean
  it's macsec offload resources.

  Fix by calling the underlay driver to clean it's relevant resources
  by moving offload handling from macsec_dellink() to macsec_common_dellink()
  when handling NETDEV_UNREGISTER event.
