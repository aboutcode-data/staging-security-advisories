aliases: []
summary: The WP Project Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in
  versions up to, and including, 2.6.4 due to insufficient restriction on the 'save_users_map_name'
  function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such
  as a subscriber, to modify their user role by supplying the 'usernames' parameter.
