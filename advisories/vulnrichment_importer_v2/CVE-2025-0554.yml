aliases: []
summary: The Podlove Podcast Publisher plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the Feed Name value in version <= 4.1.25 due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level
  access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
  an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
  has been disabled.
