aliases: []
summary: MindsDB is a platform for building artificial intelligence from enterprise data. Prior
  to version 25.11.1, an unauthenticated path traversal in the file upload API lets any caller
  read arbitrary files from the server filesystem and move them into MindsDB’s storage, exposing
  sensitive data. The PUT handler in file.py directly joins user-controlled data into a filesystem
  path when the request body is JSON and source_type is not "url". Only multipart uploads and
  URL-sourced uploads receive sanitization; JSON uploads lack any call to clear_filename or
  equivalent checks. This vulnerability is fixed in 25.11.1.
