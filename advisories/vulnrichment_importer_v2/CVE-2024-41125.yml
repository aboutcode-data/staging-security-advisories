aliases: []
summary: 'Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for IoT devices. An
  out-of-bounds read of 1 byte can be triggered when sending a packet to a device running the
  Contiki-NG operating system with SNMP enabled. The SNMP module is disabled in the default
  Contiki-NG configuration. The vulnerability exists in the os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-ber.c
  module, where the function snmp_ber_decode_string_len_buffer decodes the string length from
  a received SNMP packet. In one place, one byte is read from the buffer, without checking that
  the buffer has another byte available, leading to a possible out-of-bounds read. The problem
  has been patched in Contiki-NG pull request #2936. It will be included in the next release
  of Contiki-NG. Users are advised to apply the patch manually or to wait for the next release.
  A workaround is to disable the SNMP module in the Contiki-NG build configuration.'
