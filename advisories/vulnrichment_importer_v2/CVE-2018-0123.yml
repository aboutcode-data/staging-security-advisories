aliases: []
summary: 'A Path Traversal vulnerability in the diagnostic shell for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software
  could allow an authenticated, local attacker to use certain diagnostic shell commands that
  can overwrite system files. These system files may be sensitive and should not be able to
  be overwritten by a user of the diagnostic shell. The vulnerability is due to lack of proper
  input validation for certain diagnostic shell commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by authenticating to the device, entering the diagnostic shell, and providing crafted user
  input to commands at the local diagnostic shell CLI. Successful exploitation could allow the
  attacker to overwrite system files that should be restricted. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg41950.'
