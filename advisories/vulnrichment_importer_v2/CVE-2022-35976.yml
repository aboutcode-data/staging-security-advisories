datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2022-35976

aliases: []
summary: The GitOps Tools Extension for VSCode relies on kubeconfigs in order to communicate
  with Kubernetes clusters. A specially crafted kubeconfig leads to arbitrary code execution
  on behalf of the user running VSCode. Users relying on kubeconfigs that are generated or altered
  by other processes or users are affected by this issue. Please note that the vulnerability
  is specific to this extension, and the same kubeconfig would not result in arbitrary code
  execution when used with kubectl. Using only trust-worthy kubeconfigs is a safe mitigation.
  However, updating to the latest version of the extension is still highly recommended.
