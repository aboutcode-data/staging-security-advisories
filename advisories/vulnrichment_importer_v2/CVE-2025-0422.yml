aliases: []
summary: An authenticated user in the "bestinformed Web" application can execute commands on
  the underlying server running the application. (Remote Code Execution) For this, the user
  must be able to create "ScriptVars" with the type „script" and preview them by, for example,
  creating a new "Info". By default, admin users have those permissions, but with the granular
  permission system, those permissions may be assigned to other users. An attacker is able to
  execute commands on the server running the "bestinformed Web" application if an account with
  the correct permissions was compromised before.
