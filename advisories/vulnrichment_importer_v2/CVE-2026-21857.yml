aliases: []
summary: REDAXO is a PHP-based content management system. Prior to version 5.20.2, authenticated
  users with backup permissions can read arbitrary files within the webroot via path traversal
  in the Backup addon's file export functionality. The Backup addon does not validate the `EXPDIR`
  POST parameter against the UI-generated allowlist of permitted directories. An attacker can
  supply relative paths containing `../` sequences (or even absolute paths inside the document
  root) to include any readable file in the generated `.tar.gz` archive. Version 5.20.2 fixes
  this issue.
