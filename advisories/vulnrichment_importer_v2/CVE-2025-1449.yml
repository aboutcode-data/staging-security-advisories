aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability exists in the Rockwell Automation Verve Asset Manager due to insufficient
  variable sanitizing. A portion of the administrative web interface for Verve's Legacy Agentless
  Device Inventory (ADI) capability (deprecated since the 1.36 release) allows users to change
  a variable with inadequate sanitizing. If exploited, it could allow a threat actor with administrative
  access to run arbitrary commands in the context of the container running the service.
