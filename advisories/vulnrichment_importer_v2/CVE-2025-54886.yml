aliases: []
summary: skops is a Python library which helps users share and ship their scikit-learn based
  models. In versions 0.12.0 and below, the Card.get_model does not contain any logic to prevent
  arbitrary code execution. The Card.get_model function supports both joblib and skops for model
  loading. When loading .skops models, it uses skops' secure loading with trusted type validation,
  raising errors for untrusted types unless explicitly allowed. However, when non-.zip file
  formats are provided, the function silently falls back to joblib without warning. Unlike skops,
  joblib allows arbitrary code execution during loading, bypassing security measures and potentially
  enabling malicious code execution. This issue is fixed in version 0.13.0.
