aliases: []
summary: '`gh` is GitHub’s official command line tool. Starting in version 2.49.0 and prior
  to version 2.67.0, under certain conditions, a bug in GitHub''s Artifact Attestation cli tool
  `gh attestation verify` causes it to return a zero exit status when no attestations are present.
  This behavior is incorrect: When no attestations are present, `gh attestation verify` should
  return a non-zero exit status code, thereby signaling verification failure. An attacker can
  abuse this flaw to, for example, deploy malicious artifacts in any system that uses `gh attestation
  verify`''s exit codes to gatekeep deployments. Users are advised to update `gh` to patched
  version `v2.67.0` as soon as possible.'
