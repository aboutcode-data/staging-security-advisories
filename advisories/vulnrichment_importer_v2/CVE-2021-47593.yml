  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mptcp: clear 'kern' flag from fallback sockets

  The mptcp ULP extension relies on sk->sk_sock_kern being set correctly:
  It prevents setsockopt(fd, IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_ULP, "mptcp", 6); from
  working for plain tcp sockets (any userspace-exposed socket).

  But in case of fallback, accept() can return a plain tcp sk.
  In such case, sk is still tagged as 'kernel' and setsockopt will work.

  This will crash the kernel, The subflow extension has a NULL ctx->conn
  mptcp socket:
