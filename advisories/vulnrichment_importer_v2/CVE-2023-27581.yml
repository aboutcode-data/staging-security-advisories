aliases: []
summary: github-slug-action is a GitHub Action to expose slug value of GitHub environment variables
  inside of one's GitHub workflow. Starting in version 4.0.0` and prior to version 4.4.1, this
  action uses the `github.head_ref` parameter in an insecure way. This vulnerability can be
  triggered by any user on GitHub on any workflow using the action on pull requests. They just
  need to create a pull request with a branch name, which can contain the attack payload. This
  can be used to execute code on the GitHub runners and to exfiltrate any secrets one uses in
  the CI pipeline. A patched action is available in version 4.4.1. No workaround is available.
