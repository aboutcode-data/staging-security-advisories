summary: CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security
  Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running
  the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. A critical heap buffer overflow vulnerability
  was identified in the `Crypto_AOS_ProcessSecurity` function of CryptoLib versions 1.3.3 and
  prior. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) or potentially
  execute arbitrary code (RCE) by providing a maliciously crafted AOS frame with an insufficient
  length. The vulnerability lies in the function `Crypto_AOS_ProcessSecurity`, specifically
  during the processing of the Frame Error Control Field (FECF). The affected code attempts
  to read from the `p_ingest` buffer at indices `current_managed_parameters_struct.max_frame_size
  - 2` and `current_managed_parameters_struct.max_frame_size - 1` without verifying if `len_ingest`
  is sufficiently large. This leads to a heap buffer overflow when `len_ingest` is smaller than
  `max_frame_size`. As of time of publication, no known patched versions exist.
