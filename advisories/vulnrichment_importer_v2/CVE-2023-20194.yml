aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the ERS API of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker
  to read arbitrary files on the underlying operating system of an affected device. To exploit
  this vulnerability, an attacker must have valid Administrator-level privileges on the affected
  device. This vulnerability is due to improper privilege management in the ERS API. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to an affected device. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to elevate their privileges beyond the sphere of their intended
  access level, which would allow them to obtain sensitive information from the underlying operating
  system. Note: The ERS is not enabled by default. To verify the status of the ERS API in the
  Admin GUI, choose Administration > Settings > API Settings > API Service Settings.'
