aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the `/3/Parse` endpoint of h2oai/h2o-3 version 3.46.0.1 allows for
  a denial of service (DoS) attack. The endpoint uses a user-specified string to construct a
  regular expression, which is then applied to another user-specified string. By sending multiple
  simultaneous requests, an attacker can exhaust all available threads, leading to a complete
  denial of service.
