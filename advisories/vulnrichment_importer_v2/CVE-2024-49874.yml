  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  i3c: master: svc: Fix use after free vulnerability in svc_i3c_master Driver Due to Race Condition

  In the svc_i3c_master_probe function, &master->hj_work is bound with
  svc_i3c_master_hj_work, &master->ibi_work is bound with
  svc_i3c_master_ibi_work. And svc_i3c_master_ibi_work  can start the
  hj_work, svc_i3c_master_irq_handler can start the ibi_work.

  If we remove the module which will call svc_i3c_master_remove to
  make cleanup, it will free master->base through i3c_master_unregister
  while the work mentioned above will be used. The sequence of operations
  that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:

  CPU0                                         CPU1

                                      | svc_i3c_master_hj_work
  svc_i3c_master_remove               |
  i3c_master_unregister(&master->base)|
  device_unregister(&master->dev)     |
  device_release                      |
  //free master->base                 |
                                      | i3c_master_do_daa(&master->base)
                                      | //use master->base

  Fix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding with the
  cleanup in svc_i3c_master_remove.
