aliases: []
summary: immudb is a database with built-in cryptographic proof and verification. In versions
  prior to 1.4.1, a malicious immudb server can provide a falsified proof that will be accepted
  by the client SDK signing a falsified transaction replacing the genuine one. This situation
  can not be triggered by a genuine immudb server and requires the client to perform a specific
  list of verified operations resulting in acceptance of an invalid state value. This vulnerability
  only affects immudb client SDKs, the immudb server itself is not affected by this vulnerability.
  This issue has been patched in version 1.4.1.
