summary: The WordPress CRM, Email & Marketing Automation for WordPress | Award Winner — Groundhogg
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation
  in the gh_big_file_upload() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.7.3.5. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary
  files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
