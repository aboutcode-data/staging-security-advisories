aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the OSPF Version 2 (OSPFv2) implementation of Cisco Adaptive Security
  Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an
  unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial
  of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation when the
  affected software processes certain OSPFv2 packets with Link-Local Signaling (LLS) data. An
  attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed OSPFv2 packet to an affected
  device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an affected device to reload,
  resulting in a DoS condition.
