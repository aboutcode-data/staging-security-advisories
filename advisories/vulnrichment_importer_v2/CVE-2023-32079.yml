aliases: []
summary: Netmaker makes networks with WireGuard. A Mass assignment vulnerability was found in
  versions prior to 0.17.1 and 0.18.6 that allows a non-admin user to escalate privileges to
  those of an admin user. The issue is patched in 0.17.1 and fixed in 0.18.6. If Users are using
  0.17.1, they should run `docker pull gravitl/netmaker:v0.17.1` and `docker-compose up -d`.
  This will switch them to the patched users If users are using v0.18.0-0.18.5, they should
  upgrade to v0.18.6 or later. As a workaround, someone using version 0.17.1 can pull the latest
  docker image of the backend and restart the server.
