aliases: []
summary: Nextcloud Talk is a video and audio conferencing app for Nextcloud. Prior to versions
  12.2.7, 13.0.7, and 14.0.3, password protected conversations are susceptible to brute force
  attacks if the attacker has the link/conversation token. It is recommended that the Nextcloud
  Talk application is upgraded to 12.2.7, 13.0.7 or 14.0.3. There are currently no known workarounds
  available apart from not having password protected conversations.
