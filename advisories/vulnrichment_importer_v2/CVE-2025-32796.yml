summary: Dify is an open-source LLM app development platform. Prior to version 0.6.12, a vulnerability
  was identified in the DIFY where normal users can enable or disable apps through the API,
  even though the web UI button for this action is disabled and normal users are not permitted
  to make such changes. This access control flaw allows non-admin users to make unauthorized
  changes, which can disrupt the functionality and availability of the APPS. This issue has
  been patched in version 0.6.12. A workaround for this vulnerability involves updating the
  API access control mechanisms to enforce stricter user role permissions and implementing role-based
  access controls (RBAC) to ensure that only users with admin privileges can send enable or
  disable requests for apps.
