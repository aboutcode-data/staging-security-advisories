summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  netfilter: nf_tables: use timestamp to check for set element timeout

  Add a timestamp field at the beginning of the transaction, store it
  in the nftables per-netns area.

  Update set backend .insert, .deactivate and sync gc path to use the
  timestamp, this avoids that an element expires while control plane
  transaction is still unfinished.

  .lookup and .update, which are used from packet path, still use the
  current time to check if the element has expired. And .get path and dump
  also since this runs lockless under rcu read size lock. Then, there is
  async gc which also needs to check the current time since it runs
  asynchronously from a workqueue.
