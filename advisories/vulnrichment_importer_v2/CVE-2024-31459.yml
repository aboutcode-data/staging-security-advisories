aliases: []
summary: Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework. Prior to version
  1.2.27, there is a file inclusion issue in the `lib/plugin.php` file. Combined with SQL injection
  vulnerabilities, remote code execution can be implemented. There is a file inclusion issue
  with the `api_plugin_hook()` function in the `lib/plugin.php` file, which reads the plugin_hooks
  and plugin_config tables in database. The read data is directly used to concatenate the file
  path which is used for file inclusion. Version 1.2.27 contains a patch for the issue.
