aliases: []
summary: Flask-AppBuilder is an application development framework. Prior to version 4.8.1, when
  Flask-AppBuilder is configured to use OAuth, LDAP, or other non-database authentication methods,
  the password reset endpoint remains registered and accessible, despite not being displayed
  in the user interface. This allows an enabled user to reset their password and be able to
  create JWT tokens even after the user is disabled on the authentication provider. Users should
  upgrade to Flask-AppBuilder version 4.8.1 or later to receive a fix. If immediate upgrade
  is not possible, manually disable password reset routes in the application configuration;
  implement additional access controls at the web server or proxy level to block access to the
  reset my password URL; and/or monitor for suspicious password reset attempts from disabled
  accounts.
