aliases: []
summary: Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications
  on Linux. In versions prior to 1.10.8, 1.12.8, 1.14.4, and 1.15.4, if an attacker publishes
  a Flatpak app with elevated permissions, they can hide those permissions from users of the
  `flatpak(1)` command-line interface by setting other permissions to crafted values that contain
  non-printable control characters such as `ESC`. A fix is available in versions 1.10.8, 1.12.8,
  1.14.4, and 1.15.4. As a workaround, use a GUI like GNOME Software rather than the command-line
  interface, or only install apps whose maintainers you trust.
