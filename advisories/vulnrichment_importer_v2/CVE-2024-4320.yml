aliases: []
summary: A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in the '/install_extension' endpoint
  of the parisneo/lollms-webui application, specifically within the `@router.post("/install_extension")`
  route handler. The vulnerability arises due to improper handling of the `name` parameter in
  the `ExtensionBuilder().build_extension()` method, which allows for local file inclusion (LFI)
  leading to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting
  a malicious `name` parameter that causes the server to load and execute a `__init__.py` file
  from an arbitrary location, such as the upload directory for discussions. This vulnerability
  affects the latest version of parisneo/lollms-webui and can lead to remote code execution
  without requiring user interaction, especially when the application is exposed to an external
  endpoint or operated in headless mode.
