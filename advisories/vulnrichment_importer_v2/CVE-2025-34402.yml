aliases: []
summary: MailEnable versions prior to 10.54 contain a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
  in the FieldCc parameter of /Mondo/lang/sys/Forms/AddressBook.aspx. The FieldCc value is not
  properly sanitized when processed via a GET request and is reflected inside a <script> block
  in the JavaScript variable var CCFieldProvided. By supplying a crafted payload that terminates
  the existing LoadCurAddresses() function, inserts attacker-controlled script, and comments
  out remaining code, a remote attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim’s browser
  when the victim attempts to send an email. Successful exploitation can redirect victims to
  malicious sites, steal non-HttpOnly cookies, inject arbitrary HTML or CSS, and perform actions
  as the authenticated user.
