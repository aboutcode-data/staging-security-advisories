aliases: []
summary: The Gutenberg Template Library & Redux Framework plugin <= 4.2.11 for WordPress registered
  several AJAX actions available to unauthenticated users in the `includes` function in `redux-core/class-redux-core.php`
  that were unique to a given site but deterministic and predictable given that they were based
  on an md5 hash of the site URL with a known salt value of '-redux' and an md5 hash of the
  previous hash with a known salt value of '-support'. These AJAX actions could be used to retrieve
  a list of active plugins and their versions, the site's PHP version, and an unsalted md5 hash
  of site’s `AUTH_KEY` concatenated with the `SECURE_AUTH_KEY`.
