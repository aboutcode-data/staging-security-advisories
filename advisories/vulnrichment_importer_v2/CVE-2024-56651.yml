aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  can: hi311x: hi3110_can_ist(): fix potential use-after-free

  The commit a22bd630cfff ("can: hi311x: do not report txerr and rxerr
  during bus-off") removed the reporting of rxerr and txerr even in case
  of correct operation (i. e. not bus-off).

  The error count information added to the CAN frame after netif_rx() is
  a potential use after free, since there is no guarantee that the skb
  is in the same state. It might be freed or reused.

  Fix the issue by postponing the netif_rx() call in case of txerr and
  rxerr reporting.
