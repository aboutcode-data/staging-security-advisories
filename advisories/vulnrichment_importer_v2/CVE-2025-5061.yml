aliases: []
summary: The WP Import Export Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
  due to missing file type validation in the 'wpie_parse_upload_data' function in all versions
  up to, and including, 3.9.29. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
  access and above, and permissions granted by an Administrator, to upload arbitrary files on
  the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. The vulnerability
  was partially patched in version 3.9.29.
