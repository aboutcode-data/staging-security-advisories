aliases: []
summary: Applio is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.7 and prior are vulnerable to server-side
  request forgery (SSRF) and file write in `model_download.py` (line 156 in 3.2.7). The blind
  SSRF allows for sending requests on behalf of Applio server and can be leveraged to probe
  for other vulnerabilities on the server itself or on other back-end systems on the internal
  network, that the Applio server can reach. The blind SSRF can also be coupled with the an
  arbitrary file read (e.g., CVE-2025-27784) to read files from hosts on the internal network,
  that the Applio server can reach, which would make it a full SSRF. The file write allows for
  writing files on the server, which can be coupled with other vulnerabilities, for example
  an unsafe deserialization, to achieve remote code execution on the Applio server. As of time
  of publication, no known patches are available.
