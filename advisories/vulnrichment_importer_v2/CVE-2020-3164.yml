aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco AsyncOS for Cisco Email
  Security Appliance (ESA), Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA), and Cisco Content Security Management
  Appliance (SMA) could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause high CPU usage on
  an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is
  due to improper validation of specific HTTP request headers. An attacker could exploit this
  vulnerability by sending a malformed HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to trigger a prolonged status of high CPU utilization relative to
  the GUI process(es). Upon successful exploitation of this vulnerability, an affected device
  will still be operative, but its response time and overall performance may be degraded.
