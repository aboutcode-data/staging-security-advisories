aliases: []
summary: "In snapd versions prior to 2.62, when using AppArmor for enforcement of \nsandbox\
  \ permissions, snapd failed to restrict writes to the $HOME/bin\npath. In Ubuntu, when this\
  \ path exists, it is automatically added to\nthe users PATH. An attacker who could convince\
  \ a user to install a\nmalicious snap which used the 'home' plug could use this vulnerability\n\
  to install arbitrary scripts into the users PATH which may then be run\nby the user outside\
  \ of the expected snap sandbox and hence allow them\nto escape confinement."
