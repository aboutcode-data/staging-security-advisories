summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mptcp: pm: only decrement add_addr_accepted for MPJ req

  Adding the following warning ...

    WARN_ON_ONCE(msk->pm.add_addr_accepted == 0)

  ... before decrementing the add_addr_accepted counter helped to find a
  bug when running the "remove single subflow" subtest from the
  mptcp_join.sh selftest.

  Removing a 'subflow' endpoint will first trigger a RM_ADDR, then the
  subflow closure. Before this patch, and upon the reception of the
  RM_ADDR, the other peer will then try to decrement this
  add_addr_accepted. That's not correct because the attached subflows have
  not been created upon the reception of an ADD_ADDR.

  A way to solve that is to decrement the counter only if the attached
  subflow was an MP_JOIN to a remote id that was not 0, and initiated by
  the host receiving the RM_ADDR.
