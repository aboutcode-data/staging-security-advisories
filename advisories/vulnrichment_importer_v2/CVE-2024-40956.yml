  dmaengine: idxd: Fix possible Use-After-Free in irq_process_work_list

  Use list_for_each_entry_safe() to allow iterating through the list and
  deleting the entry in the iteration process. The descriptor is freed via
  idxd_desc_complete() and there's a slight chance may cause issue for
  the list iterator when the descriptor is reused by another thread
  without it being deleted from the list.
