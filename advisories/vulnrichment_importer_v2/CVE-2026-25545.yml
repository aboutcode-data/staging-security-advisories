aliases: []
summary: Astro is a web framework. Prior to version 9.5.4, Server-Side Rendered pages that return
  an error with a prerendered custom error page (eg. `404.astro` or `500.astro`) are vulnerable
  to SSRF. If the `Host:` header is changed to an attacker's server, it will be fetched on `/500.html`
  and they can redirect this to any internal URL to read the response body through the first
  request. An attacker who can access the application without `Host:` header validation (eg.
  through finding the origin IP behind a proxy, or just by default) can fetch their own server
  to redirect to any internal IP. With this they can fetch cloud metadata IPs and interact with
  services in the internal network or localhost. For this to be vulnerable, a common feature
  needs to be used, with direct access to the server (no proxies). Version 9.5.4 fixes the issue.
