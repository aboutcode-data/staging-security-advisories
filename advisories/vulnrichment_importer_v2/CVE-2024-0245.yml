summary: A misconfiguration in the AndroidManifest.xml file in hamza417/inure before build97
  allows for task hijacking. This vulnerability permits malicious applications to inherit permissions
  of the vulnerable app, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive information. An attacker
  can create a malicious app that hijacks the legitimate Inure app, intercepting and stealing
  sensitive information when installed on the victim's device. This issue affects all Android
  versions before Android 11.
