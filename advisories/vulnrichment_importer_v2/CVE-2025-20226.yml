datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2025/20xxx/CVE-2025-20226.json
aliases: []
summary: In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.4.1, 9.3.3, 9.2.5, and 9.1.8 and Splunk Cloud
  Platform versions below 9.3.2408.107, 9.2.2406.111, and 9.1.2308.214, a low-privileged user
  that does not hold the "admin" or "power" Splunk roles could run a saved search with a risky
  command using the permissions of a higher-privileged user to bypass the SPL safeguards for
  risky commands on the "/services/streams/search" endpoint through its "q" parameter. The vulnerability
  requires the attacker to phish the victim by tricking them into initiating a request within
  their browser. The authenticated user should not be able to exploit the vulnerability at will.
