aliases: []
summary: The Mini Course Generator | Embed mini-courses and interactive content plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'mcg' shortcode in all versions
  up to, and including, 1.0.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on
  user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses an injected page.
