aliases: []
summary: An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary
  repository, version 0.3.0, within the project update endpoint. The vulnerability allows authenticated
  users to modify the name of any project within the system without proper authorization checks,
  by directly referencing the project's ID in the PATCH request to the '/v1/projects/:projectId'
  endpoint. This issue arises because the endpoint does not verify if the provided project ID
  belongs to the currently authenticated user, enabling unauthorized modifications across different
  organizational projects.
