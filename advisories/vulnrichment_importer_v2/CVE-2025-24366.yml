aliases: []
summary: SFTPGo is an open source, event-driven file transfer solution. SFTPGo supports execution
  of a defined set of commands via SSH. Besides a set of default commands some optional commands
  can be activated, one of them being `rsync`. It is disabled in the default configuration and
  it is limited to the local filesystem, it does not work with cloud/remote storage backends.
  Due to missing sanitization of the client provided `rsync` command, an authenticated remote
  user can use some options of the rsync command to read or write files with the permissions
  of the SFTPGo server process. This issue was fixed in version v2.6.5 by checking the client
  provided arguments. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
  vulnerability.
