aliases: []
summary: Due to a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver (ABAP Keyword Documentation),
  an unauthenticated attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into a web page through an unprotected
  parameter. When a victim accesses the affected page, the script executes in their browser,
  providing the attacker limited access to restricted information. The vulnerability does not
  affect data integrity or availability and operates entirely within the context of the client's
  browser.
