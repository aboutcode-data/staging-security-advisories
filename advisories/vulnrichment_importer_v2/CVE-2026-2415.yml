aliases: []
summary: "Emails sent by pretix can utilize placeholders that will be filled with customer data.\
  \ For example, when {name}\n is used in an email template, it will  be replaced with the buyer's\
  \ \nname for the final email. This mechanism contained two security-relevant\n bugs:\n\n\n\
  \n  *  \nIt was possible to exfiltrate information about the pretix system through specially\
  \ crafted placeholder names such as {{event.__init__.__code__.co_filename}}.\n This way, an\
  \ attacker with the ability to control email templates \n(usually every user of the pretix\
  \ backend) could retrieve sensitive \ninformation from the system configuration, including\
  \ even database \npasswords or API keys. pretix does include mechanisms to prevent the usage\
  \ of such \nmalicious placeholders, however due to a mistake in the code, they were \nnot\
  \ fully effective for the email subject.\n\n\n\n\n  *  \nPlaceholders in subjects and plain\
  \ text bodies of emails were \nwrongfully evaluated twice. Therefore, if the first evaluation\
  \ of a \nplaceholder again contains a placeholder, this second placeholder was \nrendered.\
  \ This allows the rendering of placeholders controlled by the \nticket buyer, and therefore\
  \ the exploitation of the first issue as a \nticket buyer. Luckily, the only buyer-controlled\
  \ placeholder available \nin pretix by default (that is not validated in a way that prevents\
  \ the \nissue) is {invoice_company}, which is very unusual (but not\n impossible) to be contained\
  \ in an email subject template. In addition \nto broadening the attack surface of the first\
  \ issue, this could \ntheoretically also leak information about an order to one of the \n\
  attendees within that order. However, we also consider this scenario \nvery unlikely under\
  \ typical conditions.\n\n\nOut of caution, we recommend that you rotate all passwords and\
  \ API keys contained in your  pretix.cfg https://docs.pretix.eu/self-hosting/config/  file."
