aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the 802.1X feature of Cisco Catalyst 2960-L Series Switches and
  Cisco Catalyst CDB-8P Switches could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to forward
  broadcast traffic before being authenticated on the port. The vulnerability exists because
  broadcast traffic that is received on the 802.1X-enabled port is mishandled. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by sending broadcast traffic on the port before being authenticated.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send and receive broadcast traffic on the
  802.1X-enabled port before authentication.
