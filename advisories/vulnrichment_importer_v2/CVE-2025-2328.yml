aliases: []
summary: The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the 'dnd_remove_uploaded_files'
  function in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.8.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to add arbitrary file paths (such as ../../../../wp-config.php) to uploaded files
  on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when an Administrator deletes
  the message. Exploiting this vulnerability requires the Flamingo plugin to be installed and
  activated.
