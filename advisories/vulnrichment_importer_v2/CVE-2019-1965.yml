aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Virtual Shell (VSH) session management for Cisco NX-OS Software
  could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a VSH process to fail to delete upon
  termination. This can lead to a build-up of VSH processes that overtime can deplete system
  memory. When there is no system memory available, this can cause unexpected system behaviors
  and crashes. The vulnerability is due to the VSH process not being properly deleted when a
  remote management connection to the device is disconnected. An attacker could exploit this
  vulnerability by repeatedly performing a remote management connection to the device and terminating
  the connection in an unexpected manner. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause
  the VSH processes to fail to delete, which can lead to a system-wide denial of service (DoS)
  condition. The attacker must have valid user credentials to log in to the device using the
  remote management connection.
