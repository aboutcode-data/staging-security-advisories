summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine
  (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to modify parts of the configuration on
  an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper enforcement of role-based access
  control (RBAC) within the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to modify parts of the configuration. The modified configuration could either
  allow unauthorized devices onto the network or prevent authorized devices from accessing the
  network. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid Read-Only Administrator
  credentials.
