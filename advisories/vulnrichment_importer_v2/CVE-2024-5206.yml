aliases: []
summary: A sensitive data leakage vulnerability was identified in scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer,
  specifically in versions up to and including 1.4.1.post1, which was fixed in version 1.5.0.
  The vulnerability arises from the unexpected storage of all tokens present in the training
  data within the `stop_words_` attribute, rather than only storing the subset of tokens required
  for the TF-IDF technique to function. This behavior leads to the potential leakage of sensitive
  information, as the `stop_words_` attribute could contain tokens that were meant to be discarded
  and not stored, such as passwords or keys. The impact of this vulnerability varies based on
  the nature of the data being processed by the vectorizer.
