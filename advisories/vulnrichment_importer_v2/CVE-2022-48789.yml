  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  nvme-tcp: fix possible use-after-free in transport error_recovery work

  While nvme_tcp_submit_async_event_work is checking the ctrl and queue
  state before preparing the AER command and scheduling io_work, in order
  to fully prevent a race where this check is not reliable the error
  recovery work must flush async_event_work before continuing to destroy
  the admin queue after setting the ctrl state to RESETTING such that
  there is no race .submit_async_event and the error recovery handler
  itself changing the ctrl state.
