aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Integrated Management
  Controller (IMC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary commands
  and obtain root privileges. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied
  input in the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) function of the web-based management interface.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted CSR in the web-based
  management interface. A successful exploit could allow an attacker with administrator privileges
  to execute arbitrary commands on the device with full root privileges.
