  mailbox: th1520: Fix memory corruption due to incorrect array size

  The functions th1520_mbox_suspend_noirq and th1520_mbox_resume_noirq are
  intended to save and restore the interrupt mask registers in the MBOX
  ICU0. However, the array used to store these registers was incorrectly
  sized, leading to memory corruption when accessing all four registers.

  This commit corrects the array size to accommodate all four interrupt
  mask registers, preventing memory corruption during suspend and resume
  operations.
