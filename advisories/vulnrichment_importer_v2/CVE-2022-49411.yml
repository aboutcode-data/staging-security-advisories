  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  bfq: Make sure bfqg for which we are queueing requests is online

  Bios queued into BFQ IO scheduler can be associated with a cgroup that
  was already offlined. This may then cause insertion of this bfq_group
  into a service tree. But this bfq_group will get freed as soon as last
  bio associated with it is completed leading to use after free issues for
  service tree users. Fix the problem by making sure we always operate on
  online bfq_group. If the bfq_group associated with the bio is not
  online, we pick the first online parent.
