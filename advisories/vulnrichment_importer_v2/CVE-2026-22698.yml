summary: 'RustCrypto: Elliptic Curves is general purpose Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) support,
  including types and traits for representing various elliptic curve forms, scalars, points,
  and public/secret keys composed thereof. In versions 0.14.0-pre.0 and 0.14.0-rc.0, a  critical
  vulnerability exists in the SM2 Public Key Encryption (PKE) implementation where the ephemeral
  nonce k is generated with severely reduced entropy. A unit mismatch error causes the nonce
  generation function to request only 32 bits of randomness instead of the expected 256 bits.
  This reduces the security of the encryption from a 128-bit level to a trivial 16-bit level,
  allowing a practical attack to recover the nonce k and decrypt any ciphertext given only the
  public key and ciphertext. This issue has been patched via commit e4f7778.'
