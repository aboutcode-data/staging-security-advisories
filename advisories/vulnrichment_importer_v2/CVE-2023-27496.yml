aliases: []
summary: Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications.
  Prior to versions 1.26.0, 1.25.3, 1.24.4, 1.23.6, and 1.22.9, the OAuth filter assumes that
  a `state` query param is present on any response that looks like an OAuth redirect response.
  Sending it a request with the URI path equivalent to the redirect path, without the `state`
  parameter, will lead to abnormal termination of Envoy process. Versions 1.26.0, 1.25.3, 1.24.4,
  1.23.6, and 1.22.9 contain a patch. The issue can also be mitigated by locking down OAuth
  traffic, disabling the filter, or by filtering traffic before it reaches the OAuth filter
  (e.g. via a lua script).
