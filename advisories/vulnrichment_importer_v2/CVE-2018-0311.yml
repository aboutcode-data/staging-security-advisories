aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Cisco Fabric Services component of Cisco FXOS Software and
  Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of
  service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the affected
  software insufficiently validates Cisco Fabric Services packets when the software processes
  packet data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a maliciously crafted
  Cisco Fabric Services packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to cause a buffer overflow condition on the device, which could cause process crashes and
  result in a DoS condition on the device. This vulnerability affects Firepower 4100 Series
  Next-Generation Firewalls, Firepower 9300 Security Appliance, MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches,
  Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders, Nexus 3000 Series Switches, Nexus 3500 Platform Switches,
  Nexus 5500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5600 Platform Switches, Nexus 6000 Series Switches, Nexus
  7000 Series Switches, Nexus 7700 Series Switches, Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone
  NX-OS mode, Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules, UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnects,
  UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects, UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects. Cisco Bug IDs:
  CSCvd69960, CSCve02463, CSCve04859, CSCve41530, CSCve41537, CSCve41541, CSCve41557.'
