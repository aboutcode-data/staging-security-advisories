summary: 'pypdf is a free and open-source pure-python PDF library. An attacker who uses an infinite
  loop vulnerability that is present in versions prior to 6.6.2 can craft a PDF which leads
  to an infinite loop. This requires accessing the outlines/bookmarks. This has been fixed in
  pypdf 6.6.2. If projects cannot upgrade yet, consider applying the changes from PR #3610 manually.'
