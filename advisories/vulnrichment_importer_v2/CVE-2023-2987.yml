aliases: []
summary: The Wordapp plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to an use
  of insufficiently unique cryptographic signature on the 'wa_pdx_op_config_set' function in
  versions up to, and including, 1.5.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to the plugin to change the 'validation_token' in the plugin config, providing access to the
  plugin's remote control functionalities, such as creating an admin access URL, which can be
  used for privilege escalation.
