aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Network Address Translation (NAT) Session Initiation Protocol
  (SIP) Application Layer Gateway (ALG) of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload. The vulnerability is due to improper
  processing of SIP packets in transit while NAT is performed on an affected device. An unauthenticated,
  remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SIP packets via UDP port
  5060 through an affected device that is performing NAT for SIP packets. A successful exploit
  could allow an attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS)
  condition.
