  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/amd/display: Refactor DMCUB enter/exit idle interface

  [Why]
  We can hang in place trying to send commands when the DMCUB isn't
  powered on.

  [How]
  We need to exit out of the idle state prior to sending a command,
  but the process that performs the exit also invokes a command itself.

  Fixing this issue involves the following:

  1. Using a software state to track whether or not we need to start
     the process to exit idle or notify idle.

  It's possible for the hardware to have exited an idle state without
  driver knowledge, but entering one is always restricted to a driver
  allow - which makes the SW state vs HW state mismatch issue purely one
  of optimization, which should seldomly be hit, if at all.

  2. Refactor any instances of exit/notify idle to use a single wrapper
     that maintains this SW state.

  This works simialr to dc_allow_idle_optimizations, but works at the
  DMCUB level and makes sure the state is marked prior to any notify/exit
  idle so we don't enter an infinite loop.

  3. Make sure we exit out of idle prior to sending any commands or
     waiting for DMCUB idle.

  This patch takes care of 1/2. A future patch will take care of wrapping
  DMCUB command submission with calls to this new interface.
