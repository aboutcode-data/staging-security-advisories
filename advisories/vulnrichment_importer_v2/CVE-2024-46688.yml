  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  erofs: fix out-of-bound access when z_erofs_gbuf_growsize() partially fails

  If z_erofs_gbuf_growsize() partially fails on a global buffer due to
  memory allocation failure or fault injection (as reported by syzbot [1]),
  new pages need to be freed by comparing to the existing pages to avoid
  memory leaks.

  However, the old gbuf->pages[] array may not be large enough, which can
  lead to null-ptr-deref or out-of-bound access.

  Fix this by checking against gbuf->nrpages in advance.
