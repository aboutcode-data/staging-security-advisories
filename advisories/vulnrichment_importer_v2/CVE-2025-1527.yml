summary: The ShopLentor – WooCommerce Builder for Elementor & Gutenberg +20 Modules – All in
  One Solution (formerly WooLentor) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to a Stored DOM-Based
  Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's Flash Sale Countdown module in all versions up to, and
  including, 3.1.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied
  attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access
  and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
  an injected page.
