aliases: []
summary: WeKnora is an LLM-powered framework designed for deep document understanding and semantic
  retrieval. Prior to version 0.2.5, after WeKnora enables the Agent service, it allows users
  to call the database query tool. Due to insufficient backend validation, an attacker can use
  prompt‑based bypass techniques to evade query restrictions and obtain sensitive information
  from the target server and database. This issue has been patched in version 0.2.5.
