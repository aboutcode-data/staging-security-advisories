aliases: []
summary: Discourse Patreon enables syncronization between Discourse Groups and Patreon rewards.
  On sites with Patreon login enabled, an improper authentication vulnerability could be used
  to take control of a victim's forum account. This vulnerability is patched in commit number
  846d012151514b35ce42a1636c7d70f6dcee879e of the discourse-patreon plugin. Out of an abundance
  of caution, any Discourse accounts which have logged in with an unverified-email Patreon account
  will be logged out and asked to verify their email address on their next login. As a workaround,
  disable the patreon integration and log out all users with associated Patreon accounts.
