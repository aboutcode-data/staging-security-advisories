aliases: []
summary: Nuxt is a free and open-source framework to create full-stack web applications and
  websites with Vue.js. Nuxt Devtools is missing authentication on the `getTextAssetContent`
  RPC function which is vulnerable to path traversal.  Combined with a lack of Origin checks
  on the WebSocket handler,  an attacker is able to interact with a locally running devtools
  instance and exfiltrate data abusing this vulnerability. In certain configurations an attacker
  could leak the devtools authentication token and then abuse other RPC functions to achieve
  RCE. The `getTextAssetContent` function does not check for path traversals, this could allow
  an attacker to read arbitrary files over the RPC WebSocket. The WebSocket server does not
  check the origin of the request leading to cross-site-websocket-hijacking. This may be intentional
  to allow certain configurations to work correctly. Nuxt Devtools authentication tokens are
  placed within the home directory of the current user. The malicious webpage can connect to
  the Devtools WebSocket, perform a directory traversal brute force to find the authentication
  token, then use the *authenticated* `writeStaticAssets` function to create a new Component,
  Nitro Handler or `app.vue` file which will run automatically as the file is changed. This
  vulnerability has been addressed in release version 1.3.9. All users are advised to upgrade.
  There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
