aliases: []
summary: 'Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host versions prior to 22.0.843
  and Application prior to 20.0.1923 (VA and SaaS deployments) contains dangerous PHP dead code
  present in multiple Docker-hosted PHP instances. A script named /var/www/app/resetroot.php
  (found in several containers) lacks authentication checks and, when executed, performs a SQL
  update that sets the database administrator username to ''root'' and its password hash to
  the SHA-512 hash of the string ''password''. Separately, commented-out code in /var/www/app/lib/common/oses.php
  would unserialize session data (unserialize($_SESSION[''osdata'']))—a pattern that can enable
  remote code execution if re-enabled or reached with attacker-controlled serialized data. An
  attacker able to reach the resetroot.php endpoint can trivially reset the MySQL root password
  and obtain full database control; combined with deserialization issues this can lead to full
  remote code execution and system compromise. This vulnerability has been identified by the
  vendor as: V-2023-003 — Dead / Insecure PHP Code.'
