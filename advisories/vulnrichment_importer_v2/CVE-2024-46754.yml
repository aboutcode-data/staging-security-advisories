aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  bpf: Remove tst_run from lwt_seg6local_prog_ops.

  The syzbot reported that the lwt_seg6 related BPF ops can be invoked
  via bpf_test_run() without without entering input_action_end_bpf()
  first.

  Martin KaFai Lau said that self test for BPF_PROG_TYPE_LWT_SEG6LOCAL
  probably didn't work since it was introduced in commit 04d4b274e2a
  ("ipv6: sr: Add seg6local action End.BPF"). The reason is that the
  per-CPU variable seg6_bpf_srh_states::srh is never assigned in the self
  test case but each BPF function expects it.

  Remove test_run for BPF_PROG_TYPE_LWT_SEG6LOCAL.
