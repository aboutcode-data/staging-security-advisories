summary: The Master Currency WP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the plugin's currencyconverterform shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.61

  makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to
  inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page.
