aliases: []
summary: A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt,
  as of commit 20b2e02. The server uses the regex pattern `r'<[^>]+>'` to parse user input.
  In Python's default regex engine, this pattern can take polynomial time to match certain crafted
  inputs. An attacker can exploit this by uploading a malicious JSON payload, causing the server
  to consume 100% CPU for an extended period. This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition,
  potentially affecting the entire server.
