aliases: []
summary: pnpm is a package manager. Versions 10.0.0 through 10.25 allow git-hosted dependencies
  to execute arbitrary code during pnpm install, circumventing the v10 security feature "Dependency
  lifecycle scripts execution disabled by default". While pnpm v10 blocks postinstall scripts
  via the onlyBuiltDependencies mechanism, git dependencies can still execute prepare, prepublish,
  and prepack scripts during the fetch phase, enabling remote code execution without user consent
  or approval. This issue is fixed in version 10.26.0.
