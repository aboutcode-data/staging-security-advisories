aliases: []
summary: 'Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Fidra Lighthouse CMS 1.1.0 and earlier
  allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the search parameter in
  a query_string to the home page. NOTE: The vendor disputes this issue, saying "Lighthouse
  does not in any way make use of the PHP technology.  [It] is an application server ... A technology
  like this cannot be susceptible to client-side cross-site-scripting-attacks on its own, but
  only applications created based on such a technology. This does not only apply to Lighthouse,
  but also to Perl, PHP or web applications based on Java Servlet technology."  Since the original
  researcher is known to test demo pages and is sometimes inaccurate, it is likely that this
  issue will be REJECTED'
