aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Import Cisco IMC configuration utility of Cisco Integrated Management
  Controller (IMC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service
  (DoS) condition and implement arbitrary commands with root privileges on an affected device.
  The vulnerability is due to improper bounds checking by the import-config process. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets to an affected device. When
  the packets are processed, an exploitable buffer overflow condition may occur. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to implement arbitrary code on the affected device with elevated
  privileges.
