aliases: []
summary: The Ads Pro Plugin - Multi-Purpose WordPress Advertising Manager plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the ‘bsa_pro_id’ parameter in all versions up
  to, and including, 4.89 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack
  of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used
  to extract sensitive information from the database.
