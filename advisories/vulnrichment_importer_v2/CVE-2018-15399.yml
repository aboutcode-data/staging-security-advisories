aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the TCP syslog module of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA)
  Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to exhaust the 1550-byte buffers on an affected device, resulting in a denial
  of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a missing boundary check in an internal
  function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing a man-in-the-middle
  position between an affected device and its configured TCP syslog server and then maliciously
  modifying the TCP header in segments that are sent from the syslog server to the affected
  device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust buffer on the affected device
  and cause all TCP-based features to stop functioning, resulting in a DoS condition. The affected
  TCP-based features include AnyConnect SSL VPN, clientless SSL VPN, and management connections
  such as Secure Shell (SSH), Telnet, and HTTPS.
