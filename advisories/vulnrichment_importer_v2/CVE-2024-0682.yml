aliases: []
summary: The Page Restrict plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to information disclosure in all
  versions up to, and including, 2.5.5. This is due to the plugin not properly restricting access
  to posts via the REST API when a page has been made private. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to view protected posts.
