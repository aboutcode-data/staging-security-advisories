summary: The Interactive Geo Maps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the action content parameter in versions up to, and including, 1.5.9 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers with editor level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web
  scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
