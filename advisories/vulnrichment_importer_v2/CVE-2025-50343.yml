aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in matio 1.5.28. A heap-based memory corruption can occur in
  Mat_VarCreateStruct() when the nfields value does not match the actual number of strings in
  the fields array. This leads to out-of-bounds reads and invalid memory frees during cleanup,
  potentially causing a segmentation fault or heap corruption.
