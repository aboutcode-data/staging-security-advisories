aliases: []
summary: The Tiger theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions
  up to, and including, 101.2.1. This is due to the 'paypal-submit.php' file not restricting
  what user roles a user can register with. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to supply the 'administrator' role during registration and gain administrator access to the
  site.
