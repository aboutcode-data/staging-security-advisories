aliases: []
summary: "Version 10.11 of webMethods OneData runs an embedded instance of Azul Zulu Java 11.0.15\
  \ which hosts a Java RMI registry (listening on TCP port 2099 by default) and two RMI interfaces\
  \ (listening on a single, dynamically assigned TCP high port).\r\n\r\nPort 2099 serves as\
  \ a Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) registry which allows for remotely loading and processing\
  \ data via RMI interfaces. An unauthenticated attacker with network connectivity to the RMI\
  \ registry and RMI interface ports can abuse this functionality to instruct the webMethods\
  \ OneData application to load a malicious serialized Java object as a parameter to one of\
  \ the available Java methods presented by the RMI interface. Once deserialized on the vulnerable\
  \ server, the malicious code runs as whichever operating system account is used to run the\
  \ software, which in most cases is the local System account on Windows."
