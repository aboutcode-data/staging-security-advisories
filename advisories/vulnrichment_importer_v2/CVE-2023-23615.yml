summary: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. The embeddable comments can be exploited
  to create new topics as any user but without any clear title or content. This issue is patched
  in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse. As a workaround, disable
  embeddable comments by deleting all embeddable hosts.
