summary: The OceanWP theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the
  Select HTML tag in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.9 due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level
  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses an injected page.
