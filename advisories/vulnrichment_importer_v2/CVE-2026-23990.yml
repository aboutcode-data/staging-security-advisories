aliases: []
summary: The Flux Operator is a Kubernetes CRD controller that manages the lifecycle of CNCF
  Flux CD and the ControlPlane enterprise distribution. Starting in version 0.36.0 and prior
  to version 0.40.0, a privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the Flux Operator Web UI
  authentication code that allows an attacker to bypass Kubernetes RBAC impersonation and execute
  API requests with the operator's service account privileges. In order to be vulnerable, cluster
  admins must configure the Flux Operator with an OIDC provider that issues tokens lacking the
  expected claims (e.g., `email`, `groups`), or configure custom CEL expressions that can evaluate
  to empty values. After OIDC token claims are processed through CEL expressions, there is no
  validation that the resulting `username` and `groups` values are non-empty. When both values
  are empty, the Kubernetes client-go library does not add impersonation headers to API requests,
  causing them to be executed with the flux-operator service account's credentials instead of
  the authenticated user's limited permissions. This can result in privilege escalation, data
  exposure, and/or information disclosure. Version 0.40.0 patches the issue.
