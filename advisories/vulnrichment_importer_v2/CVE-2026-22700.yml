aliases: []
summary: 'RustCrypto: Elliptic Curves is general purpose Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) support,
  including types and traits for representing various elliptic curve forms, scalars, points,
  and public/secret keys composed thereof. In versions 0.14.0-pre.0 and 0.14.0-rc.0, a denial-of-service
  vulnerability exists in the SM2 public-key encryption (PKE) implementation: the decrypt()
  path performs unchecked slice::split_at operations on input buffers derived from untrusted
  ciphertext. An attacker can submit short/undersized ciphertext or carefully-crafted DER-encoded
  structures to trigger bounds-check panics (Rust unwinding) which crash the calling thread
  or process. This issue has been patched via commit e60e991.'
