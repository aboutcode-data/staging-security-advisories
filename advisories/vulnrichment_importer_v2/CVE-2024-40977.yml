  wifi: mt76: mt7921s: fix potential hung tasks during chip recovery

  During chip recovery (e.g. chip reset), there is a possible situation that
  kernel worker reset_work is holding the lock and waiting for kernel thread
  stat_worker to be parked, while stat_worker is waiting for the release of
  the same lock.
  It causes a deadlock resulting in the dumping of hung tasks messages and
  possible rebooting of the device.

  This patch prevents the execution of stat_worker during the chip recovery.
