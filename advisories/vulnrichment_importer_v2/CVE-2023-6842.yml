aliases: []
summary: The Formidable Forms – Contact Form, Survey, Quiz, Payment, Calculator Form & Custom
  Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the name
  field label and description field label parameter in all versions up to 6.7 (inclusive) due
  to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that
  will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. By default, this only affects multi-site
  installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled. However, in the formidable
  settings admins can extend form creation, deletion and other management permissions to other
  user types, which makes it possible for this vulnerability to be exploited by lower level
  user types as long as they have been granted the proper permissions.
