aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Foxit PDF and Editor for Windows and macOS before 13.2 and
  2025 before 2025.2. They allow potential arbitrary code execution when processing crafted
  PDF files. The vulnerability stems from insufficient handling of memory allocation failures
  after assigning an extremely large value to a form field's charLimit property via JavaScript.
  This can result in memory corruption and may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by
  persuading a user to open a malicious file.
