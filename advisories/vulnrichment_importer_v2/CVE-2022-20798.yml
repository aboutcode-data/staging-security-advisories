aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the external authentication functionality of Cisco Secure Email
  and Web Manager, formerly known as Cisco Security Management Appliance (SMA), and Cisco Email
  Security Appliance (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication
  and log in to the web management interface of an affected device. This vulnerability is due
  to improper authentication checks when an affected device uses Lightweight Directory Access
  Protocol (LDAP) for external authentication. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by entering a specific input on the login page of the affected device. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the web-based management interface
  of the affected device.
