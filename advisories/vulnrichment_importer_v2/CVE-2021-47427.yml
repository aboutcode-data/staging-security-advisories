  scsi: iscsi: Fix iscsi_task use after free

  Commit d39df158518c ("scsi: iscsi: Have abort handler get ref to conn")
  added iscsi_get_conn()/iscsi_put_conn() calls during abort handling but
  then also changed the handling of the case where we detect an already
  completed task where we now end up doing a goto to the common put/cleanup
  code. This results in a iscsi_task use after free, because the common
  cleanup code will do a put on the iscsi_task.

  This reverts the goto and moves the iscsi_get_conn() to after we've checked
  if the iscsi_task is valid.
