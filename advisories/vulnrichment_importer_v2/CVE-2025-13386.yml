summary: The Social Images Widget plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification
  of data due to a missing capability check on the 'options_update' function in all versions

  the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
  performing an action such as clicking on a link.
