aliases: []
summary: DataEase is an open source business intelligence and data visualization tool. Prior
  to version 2.10.11, a threat actor may take advantage of a feature in Java in which the character
  "ı" becomes "I" when converted to uppercase, and the character "ſ" becomes "S" when converted
  to uppercase. A threat actor who uses a carefully crafted message that exploits this character
  conversion can cause remote code execution. The vulnerability has been fixed in v2.10.11.
  No known workarounds are available.
