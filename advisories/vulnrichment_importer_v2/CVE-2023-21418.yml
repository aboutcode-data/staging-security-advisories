summary: Sandro Poppi, member of the AXIS OS Bug Bounty Program, has found that the VAPIX API
  irissetup.cgi was vulnerable to path traversal attacks that allows for file deletion. This
  flaw can only be exploited after authenticating with an operator- or administrator-privileged
  service account. The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is lower with operator service
  accounts and limited to non-system files compared to administrator-privileges. Axis has released
  patched AXIS OS versions for the highlighted flaw. Please refer to the Axis security advisory
  for more information and solution.
