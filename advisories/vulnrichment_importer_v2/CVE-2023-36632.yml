aliases: []
summary: 'The legacy email.utils.parseaddr function in Python through 3.11.4 allows attackers
  to trigger "RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object"
  via a crafted argument. This argument is plausibly an untrusted value from an application''s
  input data that was supposed to contain a name and an e-mail address. NOTE: email.utils.parseaddr
  is categorized as a Legacy API in the documentation of the Python email package. Applications
  should instead use the email.parser.BytesParser or email.parser.Parser class. NOTE: the vendor''s
  perspective is that this is neither a vulnerability nor a bug. The email package is intended
  to have size limits and to throw an exception when limits are exceeded; they were exceeded
  by the example demonstration code.'
