aliases: []
summary: OpenMetadata is a unified metadata platform. Prior to 1.11.8, calls issued by the UI
  against /api/v1/ingestionPipelines leak JWTs used by ingestion-bot for certain services (Glue
  / Redshift / Postgres). Any read-only user can gain access to a highly privileged account,
  typically which has the Ingestion Bot Role. This enables destructive changes in OpenMetadata
  instances, and potential data leakage (e.g. sample data, or service metadata which would be
  unavailable per roles/policies). This vulnerability is fixed in 1.11.8.
