aliases: []
summary: Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. In versions 8.2.0
  and above, a user can run the XACKDEL command with multiple ID's and trigger a stack buffer
  overflow, which may potentially lead to remote code execution. This issue is fixed in version
  8.2.3. To workaround this issue without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent
  users from executing XACKDEL operation. This can be done using ACL to restrict XACKDEL command.
