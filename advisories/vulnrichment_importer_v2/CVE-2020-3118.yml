aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol implementation for Cisco IOS XR Software
  could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a reload
  on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of string input from
  certain fields in Cisco Discovery Protocol messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to an affected device. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to cause a stack overflow, which could allow the attacker
  to execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges on an affected device. Cisco Discovery
  Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be in the
  same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).
