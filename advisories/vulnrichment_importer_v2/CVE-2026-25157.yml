summary: OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to version 2026.1.29, there is an OS command
  injection vulnerability via the Project Root Path in sshNodeCommand. The sshNodeCommand function
  constructed a shell script without properly escaping the user-supplied project path in an
  error message. When the cd command failed, the unescaped path was interpolated directly into
  an echo statement, allowing arbitrary command execution on the remote SSH host. The parseSSHTarget
  function did not validate that SSH target strings could not begin with a dash. An attacker-supplied
  target like -oProxyCommand=... would be interpreted as an SSH configuration flag rather than
  a hostname, allowing arbitrary command execution on the local machine. This issue has been
  patched in version 2026.1.29.
