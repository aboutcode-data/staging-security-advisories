aliases: []
summary: Scylladb is a NoSQL data store using the seastar framework, compatible with Apache
  Cassandra. Authenticated users who are authorized to create tables in a keyspace can escalate
  their privileges to access a table in the same keyspace, even if they don't have permissions
  for that table. This issue has not yet been patched. A workaround to address this issue is
  to disable CREATE privileges on a keyspace, and create new tables on behalf of other users.
