datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2025-7771
datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2025/7xxx/CVE-2025-7771.json
aliases: []
summary: ThrottleStop.sys, a legitimate driver, exposes two IOCTL interfaces that allow arbitrary
  read and write access to physical memory via the MmMapIoSpace function. This insecure implementation
  can be exploited by a malicious user-mode application to patch the running Windows kernel
  and invoke arbitrary kernel functions with ring-0 privileges. The vulnerability enables local
  attackers to execute arbitrary code in kernel context, resulting in privilege escalation and
  potential follow-on attacks, such as disabling security software or bypassing kernel-level
  protections. ThrottleStop.sys version 3.0.0.0 and possibly others are affected. Apply updates
  per vendor instructions.
