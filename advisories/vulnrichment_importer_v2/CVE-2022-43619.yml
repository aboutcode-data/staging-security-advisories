aliases: []
summary: This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected
  installations of D-Link DIR-1935 1.03 routers. Although authentication is required to exploit
  this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The specific flaw
  exists within the handling of ConfigFileUpload requests to the web management portal. The
  issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it
  as a format specifier. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the
  context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-16141.
