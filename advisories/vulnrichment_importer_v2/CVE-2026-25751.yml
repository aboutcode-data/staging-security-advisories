aliases: []
summary: FUXA is a web-based Process Visualization (SCADA/HMI/Dashboard) software. An information
  disclosure vulnerability in FUXA allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to retrieve sensitive
  administrative database credentials. Exploitation allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to obtain the full system configuration, including administrative credentials for the InfluxDB
  database. Possession of these credentials may allow an attacker to authenticate directly to
  the database service, enabling them to read, modify, or delete all historical process data,
  or perform a Denial of Service by corrupting the database. This affects FUXA through version
  1.2.9. This issue has been patched in FUXA version 1.2.10.
