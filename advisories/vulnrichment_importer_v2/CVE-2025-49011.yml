aliases: []
summary: SpiceDB is an open source database for storing and querying fine-grained authorization
  data. Prior to version 1.44.2, on schemas involving arrows with caveats on the arrow’ed relation,
  when the path to resolve a CheckPermission request involves the evaluation of multiple caveated
  branches, requests may return a negative response when a positive response is expected. Version
  1.44.2 fixes the issue. As a workaround, do not use caveats in the schema over an arrow’ed
  relation.
