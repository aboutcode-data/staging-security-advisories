aliases: []
summary: The Terraform Provider for Linode versions prior to v3.9.0 logged sensitive information
  including some passwords, StackScript content, and object storage data in debug logs without
  redaction. Provider debug logging is not enabled by default. This issue is exposed when debug/provider
  logs are explicitly enabled (for example in local troubleshooting, CI/CD jobs, or centralized
  log collection). If enabled, sensitive values may be written to logs and then retained, shared,
  or exported beyond the original execution environment. An authenticated user with access to
  provider debug logs (through log aggregation systems, CI/CD pipelines, or debug output) would
  thus be able to extract these sensitive credentials. Versions 3.9.0 and later sanitize debug
  logs by logging only non-sensitive metadata such as labels, regions, and resource IDs while
  redacting credentials, tokens, keys, scripts, and other sensitive content. Some other mitigations
  and workarounds are available. Disable Terraform/provider debug logging or set it to `WARN`
  level or above, restrict access to existing and historical logs, purge/retention-trim logs
  that may contain sensitive values, and/or rotate potentially exposed secrets/credentials.
