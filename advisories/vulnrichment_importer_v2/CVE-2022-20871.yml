aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the web management interface of Cisco&nbsp;AsyncOS for Cisco&nbsp;Secure\
  \ Web Appliance, formerly Cisco&nbsp;Web Security Appliance (WSA),&nbsp;could allow an authenticated,\
  \ remote attacker to perform a command injection and elevate privileges to root.\r\nThis vulnerability\
  \ is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input for the web interface. An attacker\
  \ could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the system and sending a crafted HTTP\
  \ packet to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute\
  \ arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system and elevate privileges to root. To\
  \ successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need at least read-only credentials.Cisco&nbsp;has\
  \ released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that\
  \ address this vulnerability.Attention: Simplifying the Cisco&nbsp;portfolio includes the\
  \ renaming of security products under one brand: Cisco&nbsp;Secure. For more information,\
