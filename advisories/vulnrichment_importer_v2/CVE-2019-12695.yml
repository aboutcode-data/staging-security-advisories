aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Clientless SSL VPN (WebVPN) portal of Cisco Adaptive Security
  Appliance (ASA) and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based
  management interface of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation
  of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted
  link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the
  context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.
