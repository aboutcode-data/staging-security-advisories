aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 300 Series
  Managed Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attack against a user of the interface of an affected system. The vulnerability exists
  because the affected management interface performs insufficient validation of user-supplied
  input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface
  to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
  script code in the context of the affected interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive,
  browser-based information.
