aliases: []
summary: js-libp2p is the official javascript Implementation of libp2p networking stack. Versions
  older than `v0.38.0` of js-libp2p are vulnerable to targeted resource exhaustion attacks.
  These attacks target libp2p’s connection, stream, peer, and memory management. An attacker
  can cause the allocation of large amounts of memory, ultimately leading to the process getting
  killed by the host’s operating system. While a connection manager tasked with keeping the
  number of connections within manageable limits has been part of js-libp2p, this component
  was designed to handle the regular churn of peers, not a targeted resource exhaustion attack.
  Users are advised to update their js-libp2p dependency to `v0.38.0` or greater. There are
  no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
