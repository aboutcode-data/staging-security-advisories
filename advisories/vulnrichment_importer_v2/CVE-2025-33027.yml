summary: 'In Bandisoft Bandizip through 7.37, there is a Mark-of-the-Web Bypass Vulnerability.
  This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web protection mechanism on
  affected installations of Bandizip. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability
  in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw
  exists within the handling of archived files. When extracting files from a crafted archive
  that bears the Mark-of-the-Web, Bandizip does not propagate the Mark-of-the-Web to the extracted
  files. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context
  of the current user. NOTE: this is disputed because Mark-of-the-Web propagation can increase
  risk via security-warning habituation, and because the intended control sphere for file-origin
  metadata (e.g., HostUrl in Zone.Identifier) may be narrower than that for reading the file''s
  content.'
