summary: An issue was discovered on One2Track 2019-12-08 devices. Any SIM card used with the
  device cannot have a PIN configured. If a PIN is configured, the device simply produces a
  "Remove PIN and restart!" message, and cannot be used. This makes it easier for an attacker
  to use the SIM card by stealing the device.
