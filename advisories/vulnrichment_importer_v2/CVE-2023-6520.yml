aliases: []
summary: The WP 2FA – Two-factor authentication for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.0. This is due to
  missing or incorrect nonce validation on the send_backup_codes_email function. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send emails with arbitrary content to registered
  users via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator or other registered
  user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. While a nonce check is present,
  it is only executed if a nonce is set. By omitting a nonce from the request, the check can
  be bypassed.
