aliases: []
summary: The Members Import plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Self Cross-Site Scripting
  via the user_login parameter in an imported CSV file in versions up to, and including, 1.4.2
  due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for attackers
  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a site's
  administrator into uploading a CSV file with the malicious payload.
