aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the WebVPN service of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance
  (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated,
  remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the WebVPN
  portal of an affected device. The vulnerabilities exist because the software insufficiently
  validates user-supplied input on an affected device. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities
  by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface
  or access sensitive browser-based information. An attacker would need administrator privileges
  on the device to exploit these vulnerabilities.
