aliases: []
summary: 'Fleet is open source device management software. In versions prior to 4.80.1, Fleet
  generated device lock and wipe PINs using a predictable algorithm based solely on the current
  Unix timestamp. Because no secret key or additional entropy was used, the resulting PIN could
  potentially be derived if the approximate time the device was locked is known. Fleet’s device
  lock and wipe commands generate a 6-digit PIN that is displayed to administrators for unlocking
  a device. In affected versions, this PIN was deterministically derived from the current timestamp.
  An attacker with physical possession of a locked device and knowledge of the approximate time
  the lock command was issued could theoretically predict the correct PIN within a limited search
  window. However, successful exploitation is constrained by multiple factors: Physical access
  to the device is required, the approximate lock time must be known, the operating system enforces
  rate limiting on PIN entry attempts, attempts would need to be spread over, and device wipe
  operations would typically complete before sufficient attempts could be made. As a result,
  this issue does not allow remote exploitation, fleet-wide compromise, or bypass of Fleet authentication
  controls. Version 4.80.1 contains a patch. No known workarounds are available.'
