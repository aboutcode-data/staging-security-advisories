aliases: []
summary: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `MapStage`
  is vulnerable a `CHECK`-fail if the key tensor is not a scalar. The fix will be included in
  TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3,
  and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
