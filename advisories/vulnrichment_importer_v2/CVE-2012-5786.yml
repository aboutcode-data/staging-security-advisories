summary: 'The wsdl_first_https sample code in distribution/src/main/release/samples/wsdl_first_https/src/main/
  in Apache CXF before 2.7.0 does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name
  in the subject''s Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which
  allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.
  NOTE: The vendor states that the sample had specifically used a flag to bypass the DN check'
