aliases: []
summary: 'Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Versions prior
  to 9.1.6 and 8.5.13 are vulnerable to an escalation from admin to server admin when auth proxy
  is used, allowing an admin to take over the server admin account and gain full control of
  the grafana instance. All installations should be upgraded as soon as possible. As a workaround
  deactivate auth proxy following the instructions at: https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-security/configure-authentication/auth-proxy/'
