summary: |
  When etcupdate encounters conflicts while merging files, it saves a version containing conflict markers in /var/db/etcupdate/conflicts.  This version does not preserve the mode of the input file, and is world-readable.  This applies to files that would normally have restricted visibility, such as /etc/master.passwd.

  An unprivileged local user may be able to read encrypted root and user passwords from the temporary master.passwd file created in /var/db/etcupdate/conflicts.  This is possible only when conflicts within the password file arise during an update, and the unprotected file is deleted when conflicts are resolved.
