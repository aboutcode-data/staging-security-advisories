aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the implementation of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) processing
  in Cisco Small Business SPA514G IP Phones could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to cause an affected device to become unresponsive, resulting in a denial of service (DoS)
  condition. The vulnerability is due to improper processing of SIP request messages by an affected
  device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SIP messages to an
  affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device
  to become unresponsive, resulting in a DoS condition that persists until the device is restarted
  manually. Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. This vulnerability
  affects Cisco Small Business SPA514G IP Phones that are running firmware release 7.6.2SR2
  or earlier.
