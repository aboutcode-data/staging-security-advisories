summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  xen: privcmd: Switch from mutex to spinlock for irqfds

  irqfd_wakeup() gets EPOLLHUP, when it is called by
  eventfd_release() by way of wake_up_poll(&ctx->wqh, EPOLLHUP), which
  gets called under spin_lock_irqsave(). We can't use a mutex here as it
  will lead to a deadlock.

  Fix it by switching over to a spin lock.
