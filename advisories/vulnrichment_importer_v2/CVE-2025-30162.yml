aliases: []
summary: 'Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane.
  For Cilium users who use Gateway API for Ingress for some services and use LB-IPAM or BGP
  for LB Service implementation and use network policies to block egress traffic from workloads
  in a namespace to workloads in other namespaces, egress traffic from workloads covered by
  such network policies to LoadBalancers configured by `Gateway` resources will incorrectly
  be allowed. LoadBalancer resources not deployed via a Gateway API configuration are not affected
  by this issue. This issue affects: Cilium v1.15 between v1.15.0 and v1.15.14 inclusive, v1.16
  between v1.16.0 and v1.16.7 inclusive, and v1.17 between v1.17.0 and v1.17.1 inclusive. This
  issue is fixed in Cilium v1.15.15, v1.16.8, and v1.17.2. A Clusterwide Cilium Network Policy
  can be used to work around this issue for users who are unable to upgrade.'
