datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2025/1xxx/CVE-2025-1396.json
aliases: []
summary: |
  A username enumeration vulnerability exists in multiple WSO2 products when Multi-Attribute Login is enabled. In this configuration, the system returns a distinct "User does not exist" error message to the login form, regardless of the validate_username setting. This behavior allows malicious actors to determine which usernames exist in the system based on observable discrepancies in the application's responses.


  Exploitation of this vulnerability could aid in brute-force attacks, targeted phishing campaigns, or other social engineering techniques by confirming the validity of user identifiers within the system.
