aliases: []
summary: A relative path traversal vulnerability in a FileUtil class used by the PEAR management
  component of Apache UIMA allows an attacker to create files outside the designated target
  directory using carefully crafted ZIP entry names. This issue affects Apache UIMA Apache UIMA
  version 3.3.0 and prior versions. Note that PEAR files should never be installed into an UIMA
  installation from untrusted sources because PEAR archives are executable plugins that will
  be able to perform any actions with the same privileges as the host Java Virtual Machine.
