aliases: []
summary: Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and
  response. Starting in version 4.4.0 and prior to version 4.9.1, an unsafe deserialization
  vulnerability allows for remote code execution on Wazuh servers. DistributedAPI parameters
  are a serialized as JSON and deserialized using `as_wazuh_object` (in `framework/wazuh/core/cluster/common.py`).
  If an attacker manages to inject an unsanitized dictionary in DAPI request/response, they
  can forge an unhandled exception (`__unhandled_exc__`) to evaluate arbitrary python code.
  The vulnerability can be triggered by anybody with API access (compromised dashboard or Wazuh
  servers in the cluster) or, in certain configurations, even by a compromised agent. Version
  4.9.1 contains a fix.
