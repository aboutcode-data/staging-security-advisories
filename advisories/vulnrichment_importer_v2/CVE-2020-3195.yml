aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) implementation in Cisco Adaptive
  Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could
  allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak on an affected device. The
  vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of certain OSPF packets. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted OSPF packets to be processed by an affected
  device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to continuously consume memory on an
  affected device and eventually cause it to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS)
  condition.
