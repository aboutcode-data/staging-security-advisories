aliases: []
summary: Dell SupportAssist for Business PCs version 3.4.0 contains a local Authentication Bypass
  vulnerability that allows locally authenticated non-admin users to gain temporary privilege
  within the SupportAssist User Interface on their respective PC. The Run as Admin temporary
  privilege feature enables IT/System Administrators to perform driver scans and Dell-recommended
  driver installations without requiring them to log out of the local non-admin user session.
  However, the granted privilege is limited solely to the SupportAssist User Interface and automatically
  expires after 15 minutes.
