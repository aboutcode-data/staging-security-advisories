aliases: []
summary: "The functions to fetch e-mail via POP3 or IMAP as well as sending e-mail via SMTP\
  \ use OpenSSL for static SSL or TLS based communication. As the \nSSL_get_verify_result()\
  \ function is not used the certificated is trusted always and it can not be ensured that the\
  \ certificate \nsatisfies all necessary security requirements.\n\nThis could allow an \nattacker\
  \ to use an invalid certificate to claim to be a trusted host, \nuse expired certificates,\
  \ or conduct other attacks that could be \ndetected if the certificate is properly validated.\n\
  \nThis issue affects OTRS: from 7.0.X before 7.0.47, from 8.0.X before 8.0.37; ((OTRS)) Community\
  \ Edition: from 6.0.X through 6.0.34."
