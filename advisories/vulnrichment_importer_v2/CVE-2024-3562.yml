aliases: []
summary: The Custom Field Suite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Code Injection in
  all versions up to, and including, 2.6.7 via the Loop custom field. This is due to insufficient
  sanitization of input prior to being used in a call to the eval() function. This makes it
  possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to execute
  arbitrary PHP code on the server.
