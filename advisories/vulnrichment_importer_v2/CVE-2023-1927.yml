summary: The WP Fastest Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in versions up to, and including, 1.1.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the deleteCssAndJsCacheToolbar function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to perform cache deletion via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
