aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco&nbsp;PI and Cisco&nbsp;EPNM\
  \ could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a path traversal attack on an affected\
  \ device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid credentials on the system.\r\
  \n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of the HTTPS URL by the web-based\
  \ management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted\
  \ request that contains directory traversal character sequences to an affected device. A successful\
  \ exploit could allow the attacker to write arbitrary files to the host system.\r\nCisco&nbsp;has\
  \ released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that\
  \ address these vulnerabilities."
