aliases: []
summary: curl can be told to parse a `.netrc` file for credentials. If that file endsin a line
  with 4095 consecutive non-white space letters and no newline, curlwould first read past the
  end of the stack-based buffer, and if the readworks, write a zero byte beyond its boundary.This
  will in most cases cause a segfault or similar, but circumstances might also cause different
  outcomes.If a malicious user can provide a custom netrc file to an application or otherwise
  affect its contents, this flaw could be used as denial-of-service.
