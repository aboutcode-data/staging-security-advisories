aliases: []
summary: The Widgets for Tiktok Feed plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the plugin's 'trustindex-feed' shortcode in all versions up to, and including,
  1.7.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above,
  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page.
