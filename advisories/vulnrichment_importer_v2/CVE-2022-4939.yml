aliases: []
summary: THe WCFM Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions
  up to, and including 2.10.0, due to a missing capability check on the wp_ajax_nopriv_wcfm_ajax_controller
  AJAX action that controls membership settings. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to modify the membership registration form in a way that allows them to set the
  role for registration to that of any user including administrators. Once configured, the attacker
  can then register as an administrator.
