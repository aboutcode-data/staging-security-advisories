  platform/x86: panasonic-laptop: Fix SINF array out of bounds accesses

  The panasonic laptop code in various places uses the SINF array with index
  values of 0 - SINF_CUR_BRIGHT(0x0d) without checking that the SINF array
  is big enough.

  Not all panasonic laptops have this many SINF array entries, for example
  the Toughbook CF-18 model only has 10 SINF array entries. So it only
  supports the AC+DC brightness entries and mute.

  Check that the SINF array has a minimum size which covers all AC+DC
  brightness entries and refuse to load if the SINF array is smaller.

  For higher SINF indexes hide the sysfs attributes when the SINF array
  does not contain an entry for that attribute, avoiding show()/store()
  accessing the array out of bounds and add bounds checking to the probe()
  and resume() code accessing these.
