  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  cxl/region: Fix null pointer dereference for resetting decoder

  Not all decoders have a reset callback.

  The CXL specification allows a host bridge with a single root port to
  have no explicit HDM decoders. Currently the region driver assumes there
  are none.  As such the CXL core creates a special pass through decoder
  instance without a commit/reset callback.

  Prior to this patch, the ->reset() callback was called unconditionally when
  calling cxl_region_decode_reset. Thus a configuration with 1 Host Bridge,
  1 Root Port, and one directly attached CXL type 3 device or multiple CXL
  type 3 devices attached to downstream ports of a switch can cause a null
  pointer dereference.

  Before the fix, a kernel crash was observed when we destroy the region, and
  a pass through decoder is reset.

  The issue can be reproduced as below,
      1) create a region with a CXL setup which includes a HB with a
      single root port under which a memdev is attached directly.
      2) destroy the region with cxl destroy-region regionX -f.
