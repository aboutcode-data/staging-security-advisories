aliases: []
summary: |
  A device API
  endpoint was missing access controls on Western Digital My Cloud OS 5 iOS and Anroid Mobile Apps, My Cloud Home iOS and Android Mobile Apps, SanDisk ibi iOS and Android Mobile Apps, My Cloud OS 5 Web App, My Cloud Home Web App and the SanDisk ibi Web App. Due to a permissive CORS policy
  and missing authentication requirement for private IPs, a remote attacker on
  the same network as the device could obtain device information by convincing a
  victim user to visit an attacker-controlled server and issue a cross-site
  request.



  This issue affects
  My Cloud OS 5 Mobile App: before 4.21.0; My Cloud Home Mobile App: before 4.21.0; ibi Mobile App: before 4.21.0; My
  Cloud OS 5 Web App: before 4.26.0-6126; My Cloud Home Web App: before 4.26.0-6126;
