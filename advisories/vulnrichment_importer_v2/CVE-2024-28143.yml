aliases: []
summary: The password change function at /cgi/admin.cgi does not require the current/old password,
  which makes the application vulnerable to account takeover. An attacker can use this to forcefully
  set a new password within the -rsetpass+-aaction+- parameter for a user without knowing the
  old password, e.g. by exploiting a CSRF issue.
