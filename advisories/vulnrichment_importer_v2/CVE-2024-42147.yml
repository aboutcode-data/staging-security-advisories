  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  crypto: hisilicon/debugfs - Fix debugfs uninit process issue

  During the zip probe process, the debugfs failure does not stop
  the probe. When debugfs initialization fails, jumping to the
  error branch will also release regs, in addition to its own
  rollback operation.

  As a result, it may be released repeatedly during the regs
  uninit process. Therefore, the null check needs to be added to
  the regs uninit process.
