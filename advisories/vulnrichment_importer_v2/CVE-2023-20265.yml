aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of a small subset of Cisco IP
  Phones could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attack against a user of the interface on an affected device. This vulnerability is
  due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by persuading a user of an affected interface to view a page containing malicious HTML or
  script content. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script
  code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
  To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid credentials to access the web-based
  management interface of the affected device.
