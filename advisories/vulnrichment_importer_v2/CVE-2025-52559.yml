aliases: []
summary: Zulip is an open-source team chat application. From versions 2.0.0-rc1 to before 10.4
  in Zulip Server, the /digest/ URL of a server shows a preview of what the email weekly digest
  would contain. This URL, though not the digest itself, contains a cross-site scripting (XSS)
  vulnerability in both topic names and channel names. This issue has been fixed in Zulip Server
  10.4. A workaround for this issue involves denying access to /digest/.
