aliases: []
summary: 'Riverbed RiOS through 9.6.0 does not require a bootloader password, which makes it
  easier for physically proximate attackers to defeat the secure-vault protection mechanism
  via a crafted boot. NOTE: the vendor believes that this does not meet the definition of a
  vulnerability. The product contains correct computational logic for a bootloader password;
  however, this password is optional to meet different customers'' needs'
