aliases: []
summary: Dify is an LLM application development platform. In Dify versions through 1.9.1, the
  MCP OAuth component is vulnerable to cross-site scripting when a victim connects to an attacker-controlled
  remote MCP server. The vulnerability exists in the OAuth flow implementation where the authorization_url
  provided by a remote MCP server is directly passed to window.open without validation or sanitization.
  An attacker can craft a malicious MCP server that returns a JavaScript URI (such as javascript:alert(1))
  in the authorization_url field, which is then executed when the victim attempts to connect
  to the MCP server. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context
  of the Dify application.
