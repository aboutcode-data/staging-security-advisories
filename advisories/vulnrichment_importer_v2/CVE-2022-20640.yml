aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Security Manager
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting attacks against
  a user of the interface. These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied
  input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities
  by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based
  information.
