aliases: []
summary: A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary
  repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git
  be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression
  /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests.
  This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity,
  which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input.
