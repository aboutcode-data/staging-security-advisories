summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsignal: restore\
  \ the override_rlimit logic\n\nPrior to commit d64696905554 (\"Reimplement RLIMIT_SIGPENDING\
  \ on top of\nucounts\") UCOUNT_RLIMIT_SIGPENDING rlimit was not enforced for a class of\n\
  signals.  However now it's enforced unconditionally, even if\noverride_rlimit is set.  This\
  \ behavior change caused production issues.  \n\nFor example, if the limit is reached and\
  \ a process receives a SIGSEGV\nsignal, sigqueue_alloc fails to allocate the necessary resources\
  \ for the\nsignal delivery, preventing the signal from being delivered with siginfo. \nThis\
  \ prevents the process from correctly identifying the fault address and\nhandling the error.\
  \  From the user-space perspective, applications are\nunaware that the limit has been reached\
  \ and that the siginfo is\neffectively 'corrupted'.  This can lead to unpredictable behavior\
  \ and\ncrashes, as we observed with java applications.\n\nFix this by passing override_rlimit\
  \ into inc_rlimit_get_ucounts() and skip\nthe comparison to max there if override_rlimit is\
  \ set.  This effectively\nrestores the old behavior."
