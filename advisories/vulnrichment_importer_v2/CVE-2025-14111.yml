summary: 'A security vulnerability has been detected in Rarlab RAR App up to 7.11 Build 127
  on Android. This affects an unknown part of the component com.rarlab.rar. Such manipulation
  leads to path traversal. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. Attacks of this nature
  are highly complex. It is indicated that the exploitability is difficult. The exploit has
  been disclosed publicly and may be used. Upgrading to version 7.20 build 128 is able to mitigate
  this issue. You should upgrade the affected component. The vendor responded very professional:
  "This is the real vulnerability affecting RAR for Android only. WinRAR and Unix RAR versions
  are not affected. We already fixed it in RAR for Android 7.20 build 128 and we publicly mentioned
  it in that version changelog. (...) To avoid confusion among users, it would be useful if
  such disclosure emphasizes that it is RAR for Android only issue and WinRAR isn''t affected."'
