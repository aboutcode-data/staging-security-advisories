aliases: []
summary: An unauthenticated file upload vulnerability exists in the Fanwei E-Office <= v9.4
  web management interface. The vulnerability affects the /general/index/UploadFile.php endpoint,
  which improperly validates uploaded files when invoked with certain parameters (uploadType=eoffice_logo
  or uploadType=theme). An attacker can exploit this flaw by sending a crafted HTTP POST request
  to upload arbitrary files without requiring authentication. Successful exploitation could
  enable remote code execution on the affected server, leading to complete compromise of the
  web application and potentially the underlying system. Exploitation evidence was observed
  by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2025-02-05 UTC.
