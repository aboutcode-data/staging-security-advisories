summary: A vulnerability has been identified in the Bitdefender Total Security HTTPS scanning
  functionality where the product incorrectly checks the site's certificate, which allows an
  attacker to make MITM SSL connections to an arbitrary site. The product trusts certificates
  that are issued using the MD5 and SHA1 collision hash functions which allow attackers to create
  rogue certificates that appear legitimate.
