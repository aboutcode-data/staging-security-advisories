aliases: []
summary: 'In the python-libnmap package through 0.7.2 for Python, remote command execution can
  occur (if used in a client application that does not validate arguments). NOTE: the vendor
  believes it would be unrealistic for an application to call NmapProcess with arguments taken
  from input data that arrived over an untrusted network, and thus the CVSS score corresponds
  to an unrealistic use case. None of the NmapProcess documentation implies that this is an
  expected use case'
