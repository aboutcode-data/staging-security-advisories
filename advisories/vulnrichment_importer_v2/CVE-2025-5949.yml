aliases: []
summary: The Service Finder Bookings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
  via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 6.0. This is due to the plugin
  not properly validating a user's identity prior to processing a password change request. This
  makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber access or higher to reset other
  users' passwords, including those of admins.
