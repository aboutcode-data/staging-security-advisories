aliases: []
summary: The CE21 Suite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions
  up to, and including, 2.2.0. This is due to hardcoded encryption key in the 'ce21_authentication_phrase'
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user
  on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the email.
