aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the SSL/TLS inspection of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software
  for Cisco Firepower 2100 Series firewalls could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due
  to improper input validation for certain fields of specific SSL/TLS messages. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed SSL/TLS message through an affected
  device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload,
  resulting in a DoS condition. No manual intervention is needed to recover the device after
  it has reloaded.
