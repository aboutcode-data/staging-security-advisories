aliases: []
summary: Moodle PDF Annotator plugin v1.5 release 9 allows stored cross-site scripting (XSS)
  via the Public Comments feature. An attacker with a low-privileged account (e.g., Student)
  can inject arbitrary JavaScript payloads into a comment. When any other user (Student, Teacher,
  or Admin) views the annotated PDF, the payload is executed in their browser, leading to session
  hijacking, credential theft, or other attacker-controlled actions.
