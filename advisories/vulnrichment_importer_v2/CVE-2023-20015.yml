aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Firepower 4100 Series, Cisco Firepower 9300 Security
  Appliances, and Cisco UCS 6200, 6300, 6400, and 6500 Series Fabric Interconnects could allow
  an authenticated, local attacker to inject unauthorized commands. This vulnerability is due
  to insufficient input validation of commands supplied by the user. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by authenticating to a device and submitting crafted input to the affected
  command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute unauthorized commands within
  the CLI. An attacker with Administrator privileges could also execute arbitrary commands on
  the underlying operating system of Cisco UCS 6400 and 6500 Series Fabric Interconnects with
  root-level privileges.
