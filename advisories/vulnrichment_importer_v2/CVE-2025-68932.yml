aliases: []
summary: FreshRSS is a free, self-hostable RSS aggregator. Prior to version 1.28.0, FreshRSS
  uses cryptographically weak random number generators (mt_rand() and uniqid()) to generate
  remember-me authentication tokens and challenge-response nonces. This allows attackers to
  predict valid session tokens, leading to account takeover through persistent session hijacking.
  The remember-me tokens provide permanent authentication and are the sole credential for "keep
  me logged in" functionality. This issue has been patched in version 1.28.0.
