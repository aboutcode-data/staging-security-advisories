summary: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access in the AWS VPN Client for macOS versions
  1.3.2- 5.2.0 allows a local user to execute code with elevated privileges. Insufficient validation
  checks on the log destination directory during log rotation could allow a non-administrator
  user to create a symlink from a client log file to a privileged location. On log rotation,
  this could lead to code execution with root privileges if the user made crafted API calls
  which injected arbitrary code into the log file. We recommend users upgrade to AWS VPN Client
  for macOS 5.2.1 or the latest version.
