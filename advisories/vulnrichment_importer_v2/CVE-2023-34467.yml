aliases: []
summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 3.5-milestone-1 and
  prior to versions 14.4.8, 14.10.4, and 15.0-rc-1, the mail obfuscation configuration was not
  fully taken into account. While the mail displayed to the end user was obfuscated, the rest
  response was also containing the mail unobfuscated and users were able to filter and sort
  on the unobfuscated, allowing them to infer the mail content. The consequence was the possibility
  to retrieve the email addresses of all users even when obfuscated. This has been patched in
  XWiki 14.4.8, 14.10.4, and 15.0-rc-1.
