aliases: []
summary: vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the EVM. Vyper handles AugAssign statements
  by first caching the target location to avoid double evaluation. However, in the case when
  target is an access to a DynArray and the rhs modifies the array, the cached target will evaluate
  first, and the bounds check will not be re-evaluated during the write portion of the statement.
  This issue has been addressed in version 0.4.1 and all users are advised to upgrade. There
  are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
