  x86/kexec: Fix bug with call depth tracking

  The call to cc_platform_has() triggers a fault and system crash if call depth
  tracking is active because the GS segment has been reset by load_segments() and
  GS_BASE is now 0 but call depth tracking uses per-CPU variables to operate.

  Call cc_platform_has() earlier in the function when GS is still valid.
