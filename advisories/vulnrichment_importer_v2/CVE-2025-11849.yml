aliases: []
summary: Versions of the package mammoth from 0.3.25 and before 1.11.0; versions of the package
  mammoth from 0.3.25 and before 1.11.0; versions of the package mammoth before 1.11.0; versions
  of the package org.zwobble.mammoth:mammoth before 1.11.0 are vulnerable to Directory Traversal
  due to the lack of path or file type validation when processing a docx file containing an
  image with an external link (r:link attribute instead of embedded r:embed). The library resolves
  the URI to a file path and after reading, the content is encoded as base64 and included in
  the HTML output as a data URI. An attacker can read arbitrary files on the system where the
  conversion is performed or cause an excessive resources consumption by crafting a docx file
  that links to special device files such as /dev/random or /dev/zero.
