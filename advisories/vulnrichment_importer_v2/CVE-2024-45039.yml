aliases: []
summary: gnark is a fast zk-SNARK library that offers a high-level API to design circuits. Versions
  prior to 0.11.0 have a soundness issue - in case of multiple commitments used inside the circuit
  the prover is able to choose all but the last commitment. As gnark uses the commitments for
  optimized non-native multiplication, lookup checks etc. as random challenges, then it could
  impact the soundness of the whole circuit. However, using multiple commitments has been discouraged
  due to the additional cost to the verifier and it has not been supported in the recursive
  in-circuit Groth16 verifier and Solidity verifier. gnark's maintainers expect the impact of
  the issue be very small - only for the users who have implemented the native Groth16 verifier
  or are using it with multiple commitments. We do not have information of such users. The issue
  has been patched in version 0.11.0. As a workaround, users should follow gnark maintainers'
  recommendation to use only a single commitment and then derive in-circuit commitments as needed
  using the `std/multicommit` package.
