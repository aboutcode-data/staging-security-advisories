datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2024/47xxx/CVE-2024-47252.json
aliases: []
summary: |
  Insufficient escaping of user-supplied data in mod_ssl in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.63 and earlier allows an untrusted SSL/TLS client to insert escape characters into log files in some configurations.

  In a logging configuration where CustomLog is used with "%{varname}x" or "%{varname}c" to log variables provided by mod_ssl such as SSL_TLS_SNI, no escaping is performed by either mod_log_config or mod_ssl and unsanitized data provided by the client may appear in log files.
