  firmware: qcom: scm: Fix missing read barrier in qcom_scm_get_tzmem_pool()

  Commit 2e4955167ec5 ("firmware: qcom: scm: Fix __scm and waitq
  completion variable initialization") introduced a write barrier in probe
  function to store global '__scm' variable.  We all known barriers are
  paired (see memory-barriers.txt: "Note that write barriers should
  normally be paired with read or address-dependency barriers"), therefore
  accessing it from concurrent contexts requires read barrier.  Previous
  commit added such barrier in qcom_scm_is_available(), so let's use that
  directly.

  Lack of this read barrier can result in fetching stale '__scm' variable
  value, NULL, and dereferencing it.

  Note that barrier in qcom_scm_is_available() satisfies here the control
  dependency.
