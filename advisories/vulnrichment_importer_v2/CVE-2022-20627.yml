aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management
  Center (FMC) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface. These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient
  validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could
  exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context
  of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
