aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series
  Smart Switches could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a command injection
  attack. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious request to certain parts of the web
  management interface. To send the malicious request, the attacker needs a valid login session
  in the web management interface as a privilege level 15 user. Depending on the configuration
  of the affected switch, the malicious request must be sent via HTTP or HTTPS. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of
  the root user.
