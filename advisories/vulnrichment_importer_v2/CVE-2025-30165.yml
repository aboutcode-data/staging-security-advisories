aliases: []
summary: vLLM is an inference and serving engine for large language models. In a multi-node
  vLLM deployment using the V0 engine, vLLM uses ZeroMQ for some multi-node communication purposes.
  The secondary vLLM hosts open a `SUB` ZeroMQ socket and connect to an `XPUB` socket on the
  primary vLLM host. When data is received on this `SUB` socket, it is deserialized with `pickle`.
  This is unsafe, as it can be abused to execute code on a remote machine. Since the vulnerability
  exists in a client that connects to the primary vLLM host, this vulnerability serves as an
  escalation point. If the primary vLLM host is compromised, this vulnerability could be used
  to compromise the rest of the hosts in the vLLM deployment. Attackers could also use other
  means to exploit the vulnerability without requiring access to the primary vLLM host. One
  example would be the use of ARP cache poisoning to redirect traffic to a malicious endpoint
  used to deliver a payload with arbitrary code to execute on the target machine. Note that
  this issue only affects the V0 engine, which has been off by default since v0.8.0. Further,
  the issue only applies to a deployment using tensor parallelism across multiple hosts, which
  we do not expect to be a common deployment pattern. Since V0 is has been off by default since
  v0.8.0 and the fix is fairly invasive, the maintainers of vLLM have decided not to fix this
  issue. Instead, the maintainers recommend that users ensure their environment is on a secure
  network in case this pattern is in use. The V1 engine is not affected by this issue.
