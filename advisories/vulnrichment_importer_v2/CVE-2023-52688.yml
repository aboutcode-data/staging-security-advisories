  wifi: ath12k: fix the error handler of rfkill config

  When the core rfkill config throws error, it should free the
  allocated resources. Currently it is not freeing the core pdev
  create resources. Avoid this issue by calling the core pdev
  destroy in the error handler of core rfkill config.

  Found this issue in the code review and it is compile tested only.
