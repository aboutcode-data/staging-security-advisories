summary: A vulnerability in the Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) feature of Cisco IOS XR
  Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the PIM process to restart,
  resulting in a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due
  to the incorrect processing of crafted AutoRP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending crafted packets to port UDP 496 on a reachable IP address on the device. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to cause the PIM process to restart. Software versions prior
  to 6.2.3, 6.3.2, 6.4.0, and 6.5.1 are affected.
