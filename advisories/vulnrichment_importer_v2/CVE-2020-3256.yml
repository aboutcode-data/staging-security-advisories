summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Hosted Collaboration
  Mediation Fulfillment (HCM-F) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain
  read access to information that is stored on an affected system. To exploit this vulnerability,
  an attacker would need administrative privileges on the Cisco HCM-F Software. The vulnerability
  is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML
  files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests that contain
  references in XML entities to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to retrieve files from the local system, resulting in the disclosure of sensitive information.
