aliases: []
summary: ExpressVPN before 12.73.0 on Windows, when split tunneling is used, sends DNS requests
  according to the Windows configuration (e.g., sends them to DNS servers operated by the user's
  ISP instead of to the ExpressVPN DNS servers), which may allow remote attackers to obtain
  sensitive information about websites visited by VPN users.
