aliases: []
summary: picklescan before 0.0.23 is vulnerable to a ZIP archive manipulation attack that causes
  it to crash when attempting to extract and scan PyTorch model archives. By modifying the filename
  in the ZIP header while keeping the original filename in the directory listing, an attacker
  can make PickleScan raise a BadZipFile error. However, PyTorch's more forgiving ZIP implementation
  still allows the model to be loaded, enabling malicious payloads to bypass detection.
