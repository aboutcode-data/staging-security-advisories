aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) of Cisco TelePresence Management
  Suite (TMS) software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized
  access to an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper access and authentication
  controls on the affected TMS software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by gaining
  access to internal, trusted networks to send crafted SOAP calls to the affected device. If
  successful, an exploit could allow the attacker to access system management tools. Under normal
  circumstances, this access should be prohibited.
