aliases: []
summary: The WP Booking Calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Post-Confirmation
  Booking Manipulation in all versions up to, and including, 10.10. This is due to the plugin
  not properly requiring re-verification after a booking has been made and a change is being
  attempted. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to manipulate their confirmed
  bookings, even after they have been approved.
