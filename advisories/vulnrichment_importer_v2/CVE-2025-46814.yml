aliases: []
summary: FastAPI Guard is a security library for FastAPI that provides middleware to control
  IPs, log requests, and detect penetration attempts. An HTTP header injection vulnerability
  has been identified in versions prior to 2.0.0. By manipulating the X-Forwarded-For header,
  an attacker can potentially inject arbitrary IP addresses into the request. This vulnerability
  can allow attackers to bypass IP-based access controls, mislead logging systems, and impersonate
  trusted clients. It is especially impactful when the application relies on the X-Forwarded-For
  header for IP-based authorization or authentication. Users should upgrade to FastAPI Guard
  version 2.0.0 to receive a fix.
