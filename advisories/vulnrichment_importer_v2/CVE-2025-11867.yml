aliases: []
summary: The Bg Book Publisher plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the `book_author` post meta, rendered through the `[book_author]` shortcode, in all versions
  up to, and including, 1.25. This is due to the plugin not properly escaping the meta value
  before output. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses an injected page.
