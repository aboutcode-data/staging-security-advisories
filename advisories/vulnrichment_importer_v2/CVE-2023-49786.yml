aliases: []
summary: Asterisk is an open source private branch exchange and telephony toolkit. In Asterisk
  prior to versions 18.20.1, 20.5.1, and 21.0.1; as well as certified-asterisk prior to 18.9-cert6;
  Asterisk is susceptible to a DoS due to a race condition in the hello handshake phase of the
  DTLS protocol when handling DTLS-SRTP for media setup. This attack can be done continuously,
  thus denying new DTLS-SRTP encrypted calls during the attack. Abuse of this vulnerability
  may lead to a massive Denial of Service on vulnerable Asterisk servers for calls that rely
  on DTLS-SRTP. Commit d7d7764cb07c8a1872804321302ef93bf62cba05 contains a fix, which is part
  of versions 18.20.1, 20.5.1, 21.0.1, amd 18.9-cert6.
