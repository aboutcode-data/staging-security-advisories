aliases: []
summary: CyberGhostVPNSetup.exe (Windows installer) is signed using the weak cryptographic hash
  algorithm SHA-1, which is vulnerable to collision attacks. This allows a malicious actor to
  craft a fake installer with a forged SHA-1 certificate that may still be accepted by Windows
  signature verification mechanisms, particularly on systems without strict SmartScreen or trust
  policy enforcement. Additionally, the installer lacks High Entropy Address Space Layout Randomization
  (ASLR), as confirmed by BinSkim (BA2015 rule) and repeated WinDbg analysis. The binary consistently
  loads into predictable memory ranges, increasing the success rate of memory corruption exploits.
  These two misconfigurations, when combined, significantly lower the bar for successful supply-chain
  style attacks or privilege escalation through fake installers.
