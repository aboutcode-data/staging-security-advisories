aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the handler for HTTP authentication for resources accessed through
  the Clientless SSL VPN portal of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow
  an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected
  device or to obtain portions of process memory from an affected device. This vulnerability
  is due to insufficient bounds checking when parsing specific HTTP authentication messages.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious traffic to an affected device
  acting as a VPN Gateway. To send this malicious traffic, an attacker would need to control
  a web server that can be accessed through the Clientless SSL VPN portal. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition, or to
  retrieve bytes from the device process memory that may contain sensitive information.
