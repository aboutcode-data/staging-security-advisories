aliases: []
summary: The JS Help Desk – The Ultimate Help Desk & Support Plugin plugin for WordPress is
  vulnerable to PHP Code Injection leading to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and
  including, 2.8.6 via the 'storeTheme' function. This is due to a lack of sanitization on user-supplied
  values, which replace values in the style.php file, along with missing capability checks.
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute code on the server. This issue
  was partially patched in 2.8.6 when the code injection issue was resolved, and fully patched
  in 2.8.7 when the missing authorization and cross-site request forgery protection was added.
