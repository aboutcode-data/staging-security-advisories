aliases: []
summary: Runtipi is a personal homeserver orchestrator. Starting in version 4.5.0 and prior
  to version 4.7.2, an unauthenticated Path Traversal vulnerability in the `UserConfigController`
  allows any remote user to overwrite the system's `docker-compose.yml` configuration file.
  By exploiting insecure URN parsing, an attacker can replace the primary stack configuration
  with a malicious one, resulting in full Remote Code Execution (RCE) and host filesystem compromise
  the next time the instance is restarted by the operator. Version 4.7.2 fixes the vulnerability.
