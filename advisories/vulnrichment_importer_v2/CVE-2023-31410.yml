datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2023/31xxx/CVE-2023-31410.json
aliases: []
summary: A remote unprivileged attacker can intercept the communication via e.g. Man-In-The-Middle,
  due to the absence of Transport Layer Security (TLS) in the SICK EventCam App. This lack of
  encryption in the communication channel can lead to the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive
  information. The attacker can exploit this weakness to eavesdrop on the communication between
  the EventCam App and the Client, and potentially manipulate the data being transmitted.
