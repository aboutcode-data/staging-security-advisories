aliases: []
summary: The adapter @hono/node-server allows you to run your Hono application on Node.js. Prior
  to 1.10.1, the application hangs when receiving a Host header with a value that `@hono/node-server`
  can't handle well. Invalid values are those that cannot be parsed by the `URL` as a hostname
  such as an empty string, slashes `/`, and other strings. The version 1.10.1 includes the fix
  for this issue.
