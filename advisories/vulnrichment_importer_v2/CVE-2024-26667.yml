  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/msm/dpu: check for valid hw_pp in dpu_encoder_helper_phys_cleanup

  The commit 8b45a26f2ba9 ("drm/msm/dpu: reserve cdm blocks for writeback
  in case of YUV output") introduced a smatch warning about another
  conditional block in dpu_encoder_helper_phys_cleanup() which had assumed
  hw_pp will always be valid which may not necessarily be true.

  Lets fix the other conditional block by making sure hw_pp is valid
  before dereferencing it.
