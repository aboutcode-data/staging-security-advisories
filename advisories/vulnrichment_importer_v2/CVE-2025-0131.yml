aliases: []
summary: An incorrect privilege management vulnerability in the OPSWAT MetaDefender Endpoint
  Security SDK used by the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect™ app on Windows devices allows a
  locally authenticated non-administrative Windows user to escalate their privileges to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.
  However, execution requires that the local user also successfully exploits a race condition,
  which makes this vulnerability difficult to exploit.
