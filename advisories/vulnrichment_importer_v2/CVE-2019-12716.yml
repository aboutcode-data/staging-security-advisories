aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager
  and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (SME) could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based
  interface. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the
  web-based interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface
  or access sensitive browser-based information.
