summary: "A vulnerability in the interaction of SIP and Snort 3 for Cisco Firepower Threat Defense\
  \ (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the Snort 3 detection\
  \ engine to restart.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to a lack of error-checking when SIP\
  \ bidirectional flows are being inspected by Snort 3. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by sending a stream of crafted SIP traffic through an interface on the targeted device.\
  \ A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a restart of the Snort 3 process,\
  \ resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition."
