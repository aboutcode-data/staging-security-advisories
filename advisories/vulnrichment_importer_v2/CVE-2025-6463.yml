aliases: []
summary: The Forminator Forms – Contact Form, Payment Form & Custom Form Builder plugin for
  WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation
  in the 'entry_delete_upload_files' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.44.2.
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include arbitrary file paths in a
  form submission. The file will be deleted when the form submission is deleted, whether by
  an Administrator or via auto-deletion determined by plugin settings. This can easily lead
  to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
