aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the 802.11 Generic Advertisement Service (GAS) frame processing
  function of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote
  attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS). The
  vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of the 802.11 GAS frames that are processed
  by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted 802.11
  GAS frame over the air to an access point (AP), and that frame would then be relayed to the
  affected WLC. Also, an attacker with Layer 3 connectivity to the WLC could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a malicious 802.11 GAS payload in a Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access
  Points (CAPWAP) packet to the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause
  the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS.
