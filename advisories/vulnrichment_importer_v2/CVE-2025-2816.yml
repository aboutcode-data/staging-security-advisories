aliases: []
summary: The Page View Count plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification
  of data that can lead to a denial of service due to a missing capability check on the yellow_message_dontshow()
  function in versions 2.8.0 to 2.8.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
  Subscriber-level access and above, to update option values to one on the WordPress site. This
  can be leveraged to update an option that would create an error on the site and deny service
  to legitimate users or be used to set some values to true such as registration.
