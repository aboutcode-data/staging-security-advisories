aliases: []
summary: MCP Watch is a comprehensive security scanner for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.
  In 0.1.2 and earlier, the MCPScanner class contains a critical Command Injection vulnerability
  in the cloneRepo method. The application passes the user-supplied githubUrl argument directly
  to a system shell via execSync without sanitization. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary
  commands on the host machine by appending shell metacharacters to the URL.
