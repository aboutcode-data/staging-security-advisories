summary: 'Missing protection mechanism for alternate hardware interface in the Intel(R) Quick
  Assist Technology for some Intel(R) Platforms within Ring 0: Kernel may allow an escalation
  of privilege. System software adversary with a privileged user combined with a low complexity
  attack may enable escalation of privilege. This result may potentially occur via local access
  when attack requirements are present with special internal knowledge and requires no user
  interaction. The potential vulnerability may impact the confidentiality (high), integrity
  (high) and availability (none) of the vulnerable system, resulting in subsequent system confidentiality
  (none), integrity (none) and availability (none) impacts.'
