  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/xe: reset mmio mappings with devm

  Set our various mmio mappings to NULL. This should make it easier to
  catch something rogue trying to mess with mmio after device removal. For
  example, we might unmap everything and then start hitting some mmio
  address which has already been unmamped by us and then remapped by
  something else, causing all kinds of carnage.
