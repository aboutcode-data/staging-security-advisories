aliases: []
summary: Appsmith is a platform to build admin panels, internal tools, and dashboards. Prior
  to 1.93, the server uses the Origin value from the request headers as the email link baseUrl
  without validation. If an attacker controls the Origin, password reset / email verification
  links in emails can be generated pointing to the attacker’s domain, causing authentication
  tokens to be exposed and potentially leading to account takeover. This vulnerability is fixed
  in 1.93.
