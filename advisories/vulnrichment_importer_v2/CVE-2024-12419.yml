aliases: []
summary: The The Design for Contact Form 7 Style WordPress Plugin – CF7 WOW Styler plugin for
  WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including,
  1.7.0. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly
  validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to execute arbitrary shortcodes. This functionality is also vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
  Scripting. Version 1.7.0 patched the Reflected XSS issue, however, the arbitrary shortcode
  execution issue remains.
