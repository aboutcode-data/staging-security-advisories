aliases: []
summary: |
  In SAP Commerce, a user can misuse the forgotten
  password functionality to gain access to a Composable Storefront B2B site for
  which early login and registration is activated, without requiring the merchant
  to approve the account beforehand. If the site is not configured as isolated
  site, this can also grant access to other non-isolated early login sites, even
  if registration is not enabled for those other sites.
