aliases: []
summary: 'Seerr is an open-source media request and discovery manager for Jellyfin, Plex, and
  Emby. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 3.1.0, an authentication guard logic
  flaw in `POST /api/v1/auth/jellyfin` allows an unauthenticated attacker to register a new
  Seerr account on any Plex-configured instance by authenticating with an attacker-controlled
  Jellyfin server. The attacker receives an authenticated session and can immediately use the
  application with default permissions, including the ability to submit media requests to Radarr/Sonarr.
  Any Seerr deployment where all three of the following are true may be vulnerable: `settings.main.mediaServerType`
  is set to `PLEX` (the most common deployment).; `settings.jellyfin.ip` is set to `""` (default,
  meaning Jellyfin was never configured); and `settings.main.newPlexLogin` is set to `true`
  (default). Jellyfin-configured and Emby-configured deployments are not affected. Version 3.1.0
  of Seerr fixes this issue.'
