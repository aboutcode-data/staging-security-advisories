datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2024-21496

aliases: []
summary: All versions of the package github.com/greenpau/caddy-security are vulnerable to Cross-site
  Scripting (XSS) via the Referer header, due to improper input sanitization. Although the Referer
  header is sanitized by escaping some characters that can allow XSS (e.g., [&], [<], [>], ["],
  [']), it does not account for the attack based on the JavaScript URL scheme (e.g., javascript:alert(document.domain)//
  payload). Exploiting this vulnerability may not be trivial, but it could lead to the execution
  of malicious scripts in the context of the target user’s browser, compromising user sessions.
