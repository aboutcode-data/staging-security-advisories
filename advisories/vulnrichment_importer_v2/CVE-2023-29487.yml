aliases: []
summary: 'An issue was discovered in Heimdal Thor agent versions 3.4.2 and before on Windows
  and 2.6.9 and before on macOS, allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DoS) via the
  Threat To Process Correlation threat prevention module. NOTE: Heimdal asserts this is not
  a valid vulnerability. Their DNS Security for Endpoint solution includes an optional feature
  to provide extra information on the originating process that made a DNS request. The lack
  of process identification in DNS logs is therefore falsely categorized as a DoS issue.'
