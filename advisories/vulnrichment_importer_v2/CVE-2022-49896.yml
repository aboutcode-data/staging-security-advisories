  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  cxl/pmem: Fix cxl_pmem_region and cxl_memdev leak

  When a cxl_nvdimm object goes through a ->remove() event (device
  physically removed, nvdimm-bridge disabled, or nvdimm device disabled),
  then any associated regions must also be disabled. As highlighted by the
  cxl-create-region.sh test [1], a single device may host multiple
  regions, but the driver was only tracking one region at a time. This
  leads to a situation where only the last enabled region per nvdimm
  device is cleaned up properly. Other regions are leaked, and this also
  causes cxl_memdev reference leaks.

  Fix the tracking by allowing cxl_nvdimm objects to track multiple region
  associations.
