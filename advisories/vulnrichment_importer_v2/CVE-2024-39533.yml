summary: |
  An Unimplemented or Unsupported Feature in the UI vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX5000 Series and EX4600 Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a minor integrity impact to downstream networks.If one or more of the following match conditions

  ip-source-address
  ip-destination-address
  arp-type

  which are not supported for this type of filter, are used in an ethernet switching filter, and then this filter is applied as an output filter, the configuration can be committed but the filter will not be in effect.




  This issue affects Junos OS on QFX5000 Series and EX4600 Series:

    *  All version before 21.2R3-S7, 
    *  21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S6,
    *  22.1 versions before 22.1R3-S5,
    *  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S3,
    *  22.3 versions before 22.3R3-S2, 
    *  22.4 versions before 22.4R3,
    *  23.2 versions before 23.2R2.



  Please note that the implemented fix ensures these unsupported match conditions cannot be committed anymore.
