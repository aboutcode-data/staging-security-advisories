aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Industrial Network Director
  (IND) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery
  (CSRF) attack and perform arbitrary actions on an affected device. The vulnerability is due
  to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of the affected device.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow
  a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use a web browser and the
  privileges of the user to perform arbitrary actions on an affected device. For more information
  about CSRF attacks and potential mitigations, see Understanding Cross-Site Request Forgery
  Threat Vectors.
