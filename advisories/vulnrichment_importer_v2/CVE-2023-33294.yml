aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in KaiOS 3.0 before 3.1. The /system/bin/tctweb_server binary
  exposes a local web server that responds to GET and POST requests on port 2929. The server
  accepts arbitrary Bash commands and executes them as root. Because it is not permission or
  context restricted and returns proper CORS headers, it's accessible to all websites via the
  browser. At a bare minimum, this allows an attacker to retrieve a list of the user's installed
  apps, notifications, and downloads. It also allows an attacker to delete local files and modify
  system properties including the boolean persist.moz.killswitch property (which would render
  the device inoperable). This vulnerability is partially mitigated by SELinux which prevents
  reads, writes, or modifications to files or permissions within protected partitions.
