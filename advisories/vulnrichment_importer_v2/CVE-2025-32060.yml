advisory_id: CVE-2025-32060
datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2025-32060
datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2025/32xxx/CVE-2025-32060.json
aliases: []
summary: |
  The system suffers from the absence of a kernel module signature verification. If an attacker can execute commands on behalf of root user (due to additional vulnerabilities), then he/she is also able to load custom kernel modules to the kernel space and execute code in the kernel context. Such a flaw can lead to taking control over the entire system.



  First identified on Nissan Leaf ZE1 manufactured in 2020.
