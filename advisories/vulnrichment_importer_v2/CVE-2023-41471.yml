summary: 'Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in copyparty before 1.9.2 allows a local attacker
  to execute arbitrary code via a crafted payload to the WEEKEND-PLANS function. NOTE: this
  is disputed because WEEKEND-PLANS is accessible only to actors who already have write access
  to the server, and they can more simply upload HTML files containing JavaScript.'
