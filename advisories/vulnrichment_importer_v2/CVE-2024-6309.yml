aliases: []
summary: The Attachment File Icons (AF Icons) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload in versions up to, and including, 1.3. This is due
  to missing nonce validation in the 'afi_overview' function and missing file type validation
  in the 'upload_icons' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload
  arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible
  via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
  such as clicking on a link.
