aliases: []
summary: The WP Import Export WordPress plugin (both free and premium versions) is vulnerable
  to unauthenticated sensitive data disclosure due to a missing capability check on the download
  function wpie_process_file_download found in the ~/includes/classes/class-wpie-general.php
  file. This made it possible for unauthenticated attackers to download any imported or exported
  information from a vulnerable site which can contain sensitive information like user data.
  This affects versions up to, and including, 3.9.15.
