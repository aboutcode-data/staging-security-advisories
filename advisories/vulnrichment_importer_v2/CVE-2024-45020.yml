  bpf: Fix a kernel verifier crash in stacksafe()

  Daniel Hodges reported a kernel verifier crash when playing with sched-ext.
  Further investigation shows that the crash is due to invalid memory access
  in stacksafe(). More specifically, it is the following code:

      if (exact != NOT_EXACT &&
          old->stack[spi].slot_type[i % BPF_REG_SIZE] !=
          cur->stack[spi].slot_type[i % BPF_REG_SIZE])
              return false;

  The 'i' iterates old->allocated_stack.
  If cur->allocated_stack < old->allocated_stack the out-of-bound
  access will happen.

  To fix the issue add 'i >= cur->allocated_stack' check such that if
  the condition is true, stacksafe() should fail. Otherwise,
  cur->stack[spi].slot_type[i % BPF_REG_SIZE] memory access is legal.
