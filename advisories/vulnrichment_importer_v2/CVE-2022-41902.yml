aliases: []
summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The function MakeGrapplerFunctionItem
  takes arguments that determine the sizes of inputs and outputs. If the inputs given are greater
  than or equal to the sizes of the outputs, an out-of-bounds memory read or a crash is triggered.
  We have patched the issue in GitHub commit a65411a1d69edfb16b25907ffb8f73556ce36bb7. The fix
  will be included in TensorFlow 2.11.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.8.4,
  2.9.3, and 2.10.1.
