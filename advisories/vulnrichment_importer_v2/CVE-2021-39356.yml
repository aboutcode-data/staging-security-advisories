aliases: []
summary: The Content Staging WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due
  to insufficient input validation and escaping via several parameters that are echo'd out via
  the ~/templates/settings.php file which allowed attackers with administrative user access
  to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 2.0.1. This affects multi-site
  installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html
  is disabled.
