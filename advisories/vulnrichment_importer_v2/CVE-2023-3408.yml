aliases: []
summary: The Bricks theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions
  up to, and including, 1.8.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'save_settings'
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the theme's settings,
  including enabling a setting which allows lower-privileged users such as contributors to perform
  code execution, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
  an action such as clicking on a link.
