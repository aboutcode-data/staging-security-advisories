aliases: []
summary: CollabPlatform is a full-stack, real-time doc collaboration platform. In all versions
  of CollabPlatform, the Appwrite project used by the application is misconfigured to allow
  arbitrary origins in CORS responses while also permitting credentialed requests. An attacker-controlled
  domain can issue authenticated cross-origin requests and read sensitive user account information,
  including email address, account identifiers, and MFA status. The issue did not have a fix
  at the time of publication.
