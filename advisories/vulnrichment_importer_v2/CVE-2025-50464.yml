aliases: []
summary: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the upload.cgi module of the iptime NAS firmware
  v1.5.04. The vulnerability arises due to the unsafe use of the strcpy function to copy attacker-controlled
  data from the CONTENT_TYPE HTTP header into a fixed-size stack buffer (v8, allocated 8 bytes)
  without bounds checking. Since this operation occurs before authentication logic is executed,
  the vulnerability is exploitable pre-authentication.
