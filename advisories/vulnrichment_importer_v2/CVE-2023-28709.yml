aliases: []
summary: The fix for CVE-2023-24998 was incomplete for Apache Tomcat 11.0.0-M2 to 11.0.0-M4,
  10.1.5 to 10.1.7, 9.0.71 to 9.0.73 and 8.5.85 to 8.5.87. If non-default HTTP       connector
  settings were used such that the maxParameterCount could be reached using query string parameters
  and a request was       submitted that supplied exactly maxParameterCount parameters in the
  query string, the limit for uploaded request parts could be bypassed with the potential for
  a denial of service to occur.
