aliases: []
summary: The Blocksy theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the
  className parameter in the About Me block in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.39 due
  to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with contributor access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that
  will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
