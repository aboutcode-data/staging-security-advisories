aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the Network Configuration Access Control Module (NACM) of Cisco\
  \ IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to obtain unauthorized read\
  \ access to configuration or operational data.\r\n\r This vulnerability exists because a subtle\
  \ change in inner API call behavior causes results to be filtered incorrectly. An attacker\
  \ could exploit this vulnerability by using either NETCONF, RESTCONF, or gRPC Network Management\
  \ Interface (gNMI) protocols and query data on paths that may have been denied by the NACM\
  \ configuration. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access data that should\
  \ have been restricted according to the NACM configuration.\r\n\r Note: This vulnerability\
  \ requires that the attacker obtain the credentials from a valid user with privileges lower\
  \ than 15, and that NACM was configured to provide restricted read access for that user."
