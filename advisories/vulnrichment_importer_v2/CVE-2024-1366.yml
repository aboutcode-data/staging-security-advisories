aliases: []
summary: The Happy Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the ‘archive_title_tag’ attribute of the Archive Title widget in all versions
  up to, and including, 3.10.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This
  makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to
  inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page.
