aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) feature\
  \ of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker\
  \ to bypass command authorization and copy files to or from the file system of an affected\
  \ device using the Secure Copy Protocol (SCP).\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to incorrect\
  \ processing of SCP commands in AAA command authorization checks. An attacker with valid credentials\
  \ and level 15 privileges could exploit this vulnerability by using SCP to connect to an affected\
  \ device from an external machine. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain\
  \ or change the configuration of the affected device and put files on or retrieve files from\
  \ the affected device."
