aliases: []
summary: support_uri parameter in the WARP client local settings file (mdm.xml) lacked proper
  validation which allowed for privilege escalation and launching an arbitrary executable on
  the local machine upon clicking on the "Send feedback" option. An attacker with access to
  the local file system could use a crafted XML config file pointing to a malicious file or
  set a local path to the executable using Cloudflare Zero Trust Dashboard (for Zero Trust enrolled
  clients).
