aliases: []
summary: Roo Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent that lives in users' editors. Versions
  below 3.26.0 contain a vulnerability in the command parsing logic where the Bash parameter
  expansion and indirect reference were not handled correctly. If the agent was configured to
  auto-approve execution of certain commands, an attacker able to influence prompts could abuse
  this weakness to execute additional arbitrary commands alongside the intended one. This is
  fixed in version 3.26.0.
