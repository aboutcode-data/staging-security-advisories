aliases: []
summary: Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for internet of things
  (IoT) devices. In versions 4.8 and prior, an out-of-bounds write can occur in the BLE L2CAP
  module of the Contiki-NG operating system.  The network stack of Contiki-NG uses a global
  buffer (packetbuf) for processing of packets, with the size of PACKETBUF_SIZE. In particular,
  when using the BLE L2CAP module with the default configuration, the PACKETBUF_SIZE value becomes
  larger then the actual size of the packetbuf.  When large packets are processed by the L2CAP
  module, a buffer overflow can therefore occur when copying the packet data to the packetbuf.
  The vulnerability has been patched in the "develop" branch of Contiki-NG, and will be included
  in release 4.9. The problem can be worked around by applying the patch manually.
