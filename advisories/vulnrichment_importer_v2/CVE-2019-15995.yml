summary: 'A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco DNA Spaces: Connector could allow an authenticated,
  remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries. The vulnerability exists because the web
  UI does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by entering malicious SQL statements in an affected field in the web UI. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to remove the SQL database, which would require the reinstallation
  of the Connector VM.'
