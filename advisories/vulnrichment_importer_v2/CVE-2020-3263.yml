summary: A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to execute programs on an affected end-user system. The vulnerability is due
  to improper validation of input that is supplied to application URLs. The attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a malicious URL. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to cause the application to execute other programs that are already present
  on the end-user system. If malicious files are planted on the system or on an accessible network
  file path, the attacker could execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
