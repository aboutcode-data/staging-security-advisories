  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  sfc: fix null pointer dereference in efx_hard_start_xmit

  Trying to get the channel from the tx_queue variable here is wrong
  because we can only be here if tx_queue is NULL, so we shouldn't
  dereference it. As the above comment in the code says, this is very
  unlikely to happen, but it's wrong anyway so let's fix it.

  I hit this issue because of a different bug that caused tx_queue to be
  NULL. If that happens, this is the error message that we get here:
    BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000020
    [...]
    RIP: 0010:efx_hard_start_xmit+0x153/0x170 [sfc]
