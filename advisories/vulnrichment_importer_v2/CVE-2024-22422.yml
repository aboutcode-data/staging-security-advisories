aliases: []
summary: AnythingLLM is an application that turns any document, resource, or piece of content
  into context that any LLM can use as references during chatting. In versions prior to commit
  `08d33cfd8` an unauthenticated API route (file export) can allow attacker to crash the server
  resulting in a denial of service attack. The “data-export” endpoint is used to export files
  using the filename parameter as user input. The endpoint takes the user input, filters it
  to avoid directory traversal attacks, fetches the file from the server, and afterwards deletes
  it. An attacker can trick the input filter mechanism to point to the current directory, and
  while attempting to delete it the server will crash as there is no error-handling wrapper
  around it. Moreover, the endpoint is public and does not require any form of authentication,
  resulting in an unauthenticated Denial of Service issue, which crashes the instance using
  a single HTTP packet. This issue has been addressed in commit `08d33cfd8`. Users are advised
  to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
