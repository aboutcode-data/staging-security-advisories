aliases: []
summary: GeoServer is an open source software server written in Java that allows users to share
  and edit geospatial data. A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in versions
  prior to 2.23.3 and 2.24.0 that enables an authenticated administrator with workspace-level
  privileges to store a JavaScript payload in uploaded style/legend resources or in a specially
  crafted datastore file that will execute in the context of another user's browser when viewed
  in the Style Publisher. Access to the Style Publisher is available to all users although data
  security may limit users' ability to trigger the XSS. Versions 2.23.3 and 2.24.0 contain a
  fix for this issue.
