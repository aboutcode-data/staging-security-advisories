summary: The Image Map Pro – Drag-and-drop Builder for Interactive Images – Lite plugin for
  WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.0.0.
  This is due to a missing capability check on the ajax_store_save() function. This makes it
  possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to modify
  plugin settings and inject malicious web scripts.
