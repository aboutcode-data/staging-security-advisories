aliases: []
summary: GoCD is an open source a continuous delivery server. The bundled gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin
  included with the GoCD Server fails to correctly escape special characters when using the
  username to construct LDAP queries. While this does not directly allow arbitrary LDAP data
  exfiltration, it can allow an existing LDAP-authenticated GoCD user with malicious intent
  to construct and execute malicious queries, allowing them to deduce facts about other users
  or entries within the LDAP database (e.g alternate fields, usernames, hashed passwords etc)
  through brute force mechanisms. This only affects users who have a working LDAP authorization
  configuration enabled on their GoCD server, and only is exploitable by users authenticating
  using such an LDAP configuration. This issue has been fixed in GoCD 22.1.0, which is bundled
  with gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin v2.2.0-144.
