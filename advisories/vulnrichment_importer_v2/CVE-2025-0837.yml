summary: The Puzzles theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via shortcodes
  in versions up to, and including, 4.2.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output

  contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
  execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
