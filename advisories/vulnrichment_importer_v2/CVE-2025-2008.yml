aliases: []
summary: The Import Export Suite for CSV and XML Datafeed plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the import_single_post_as_csv()
  function in all versions up to, and including, 7.19. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected
  site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
