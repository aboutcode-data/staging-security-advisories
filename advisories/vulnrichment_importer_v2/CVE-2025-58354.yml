aliases: []
summary: Kata Containers is an open source project focusing on a standard implementation of
  lightweight Virtual Machines (VMs) that perform like containers. In Kata Containers versions
  from 3.20.0 and before, a malicious host can circumvent initdata verification. On TDX systems
  running confidential guests, a malicious host can selectively fail IO operations to skip initdata
  verification. This allows an attacker to launch arbitrary workloads while being able to attest
  successfully to Trustee impersonating any benign workload. This issue has been patched in
  Kata Containers version 3.21.0.
