datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2024-0243
datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2024/0xxx/CVE-2024-0243.json
aliases: []
summary: |
  With the following crawler configuration:

  ```python
  from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as Soup

  url = "https://example.com"
  loader = RecursiveUrlLoader(
      url=url, max_depth=2, extractor=lambda x: Soup(x, "html.parser").text
  )
  docs = loader.load()
  ```

  An attacker in control of the contents of `https://example.com` could place a malicious HTML file in there with links like "https://example.completely.different/my_file.html" and the crawler would proceed to download that file as well even though `prevent_outside=True`.
