summary: "Exim libspf2 Integer Underflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability\
  \ allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of\
  \ Exim libspf2. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \n\nThe specific\
  \ flaw exists within the parsing of SPF macros. When parsing SPF macros, the process does\
  \ not properly validate user-supplied data, which can result in an integer underflow before\
  \ writing to memory. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context\
  \ of the service account.\n. Was ZDI-CAN-17578."
