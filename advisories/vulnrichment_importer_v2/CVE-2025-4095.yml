aliases: []
summary: Registry Access Management (RAM) is a security feature allowing administrators to restrict
  access for their developers to only allowed registries. When a MacOS configuration profile
  is used to enforce organization sign-in, the RAM policies are not being applied, which would
  allow Docker Desktop users to pull down unapproved, and potentially malicious images from
  any registry.
