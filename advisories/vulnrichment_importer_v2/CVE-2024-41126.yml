aliases: []
summary: Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for IoT devices. An out-of-bounds
  read of 1 byte can be triggered when sending a packet to a device running the Contiki-NG operating
  system with SNMP enabled. The SNMP module is disabled in the default Contiki-NG configuration.
  The vulnerability exists in the os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-message.c module, where the snmp_message_decode
  function fails to check the boundary of the message buffer when reading a byte from it immediately
  after decoding an object identifier (OID). The problem has been patched in Contiki-NG pull
  request 2937. It will be included in the next release of Contiki-NG. Users are advised to
  either apply the patch manually or to wait for the next release. A workaround is to disable
  the SNMP module in the Contiki-NG build configuration.
