aliases: []
summary: Nextcloud text is a collaborative document editing using Markdown built for the nextcloud
  server. Due to an issue with the Nextcloud Text application, which is by default shipped with
  Nextcloud Server, an attacker is able to access the folder names of "File Drop". For successful
  exploitation an attacker requires knowledge of the sharing link. It is recommended that users
  upgrade their Nextcloud Server to 20.0.14, 21.0.6 or 22.2.1. Users unable to upgrade should
  disable the Nextcloud Text application in the application settings.
