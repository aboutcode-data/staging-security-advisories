aliases: []
summary: v8n is a javascript validation library. Versions of v8n prior to 1.5.1 were found to
  have an inefficient regular expression complexity in the `lowercase()` and `uppercase()` regex
  which could lead to a denial of service attack. In testing of the `lowercase()` function a
  payload of 'a' + 'a'.repeat(i) + 'A' with 32 leading characters took 29443 ms to execute.
  The same issue happens with uppercase(). Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
  workarounds for this issue.
