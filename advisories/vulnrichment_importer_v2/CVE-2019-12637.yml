aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services
  Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attacks against a user of the web-based management interface. The vulnerabilities are
  due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input that is processed by the web-based management
  interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface
  to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
  script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
