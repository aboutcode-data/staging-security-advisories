aliases: []
summary: 'An issue was discovered in BMC PATROL Agent through 11.3.01. It was found that the
  PatrolCli application can allow for lateral movement and escalation of privilege inside a
  Windows Active Directory environment. It was found that by default the PatrolCli / PATROL
  Agent application only verifies if the password provided for the given username is correct;
  it does not verify the permissions of the user on the network. This means if you have PATROL
  Agent installed on a high value target (domain controller), you can use a low privileged domain
  user to authenticate with PatrolCli and then connect to the domain controller and run commands
  as SYSTEM. This means any user on a domain can escalate to domain admin through PATROL Agent.
  NOTE: the vendor disputes this because they believe it is adequate to prevent this escalation
  by means of a custom, non-default configuration'
