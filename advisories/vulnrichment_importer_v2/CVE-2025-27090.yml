aliases: []
summary: Sliver is an open source cross-platform adversary emulation/red team framework, it
  can be used by organizations of all sizes to perform security testing. The reverse port forwarding
  in sliver teamserver allows the implant to open a reverse tunnel on the sliver teamserver
  without verifying if the operator instructed the implant to do so. The only impact that has
  been shown is the exposure of the server's IP address to a third party. This issue has been
  addressed in version 1.5.43 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
  for this vulnerability.
