summary: eLabFTW is an open source electronic lab notebook for research labs. The application
  served uploaded SVG files inline. Because SVG supports active content, an attacker could upload
  a crafted SVG that executes script when viewed, resulting in stored XSS under the application
  origin. A victim who opens the SVG URL or any page embedding it could have their session hijacked,
  data exfiltrated, or actions performed on their behalf. This vulnerability is fixed n 5.3.0.
