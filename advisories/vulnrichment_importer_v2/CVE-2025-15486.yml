aliases: []
summary: "The Kunze Law plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via\
  \ plugin's shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.1 due to the plugin fetching\
  \ HTML content from a remote server and injecting it into pages without any sanitization or\
  \ escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access\
  \ and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses\
  \ an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html\
  \ has been disabled.\r\nAdditional presence of a path traversal vulnerability in the shortcode\
  \ name allows writing malicious HTML files to arbitrary writable locations on the server."
