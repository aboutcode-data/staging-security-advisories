aliases: []
summary: Traefik is an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. In versions 2.11.27 and below,
  3.0.0 through 3.4.4 and 3.5.0-rc1, a path traversal vulnerability was discovered in WASM Traefik’s
  plugin installation mechanism. By supplying a maliciously crafted ZIP archive containing file
  paths with ../ sequences, an attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the system outside
  of the intended plugin directory. This can lead to remote code execution (RCE), privilege
  escalation, persistence, or denial of service. This is fixed in versions 2.11.28, 3.4.5 and
  3.5.0.
