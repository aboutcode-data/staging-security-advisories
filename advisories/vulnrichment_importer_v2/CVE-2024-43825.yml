  iio: Fix the sorting functionality in iio_gts_build_avail_time_table

  The sorting in iio_gts_build_avail_time_table is not working as intended.
  It could result in an out-of-bounds access when the time is zero.

  Here are more details:

  1. When the gts->itime_table[i].time_us is zero, e.g., the time
  sequence is `3, 0, 1`, the inner for-loop will not terminate and do
  out-of-bound writes. This is because once `times[j] > new`, the value
  `new` will be added in the current position and the `times[j]` will be
  moved to `j+1` position, which makes the if-condition always hold.
  Meanwhile, idx will be added one, making the loop keep running without
  termination and out-of-bound write.
  2. If none of the gts->itime_table[i].time_us is zero, the elements
  will just be copied without being sorted as described in the comment
  "Sort times from all tables to one and remove duplicates".
