aliases: []
summary: The ELEX WordPress HelpDesk & Customer Ticketing System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.2. This is due to missing
  authorization checks on the eh_crm_edit_agent AJAX action. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to escalate their WSDesk privileges from
  limited "Reply Tickets" permissions to full helpdesk administrator capabilities, gaining unauthorized
  access to ticket management, settings configuration, agent administration, and sensitive customer
  data.
