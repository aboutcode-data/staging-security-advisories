  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  netfilter: nf_tables: fix memory leak during stateful obj update

  stateful objects can be updated from the control plane.
  The transaction logic allocates a temporary object for this purpose.

  The ->init function was called for this object, so plain kfree() leaks
  resources. We must call ->destroy function of the object.

  nft_obj_destroy does this, but it also decrements the module refcount,
  but the update path doesn't increment it.

  To avoid special-casing the update object release, do module_get for
  the update case too and release it via nft_obj_destroy().
