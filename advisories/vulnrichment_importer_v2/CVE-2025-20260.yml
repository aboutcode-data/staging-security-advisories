aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the PDF scanning processes of ClamAV could allow an unauthenticated,\
  \ remote attacker to cause a buffer overflow condition, cause a denial of service (DoS) condition,\
  \ or execute arbitrary code on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because\
  \ memory buffers are allocated incorrectly when PDF files are processed. An attacker could\
  \ exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted PDF file to be scanned by ClamAV on an\
  \ affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a buffer overflow,\
  \ likely resulting in the termination of the ClamAV scanning process and a DoS condition on\
  \ the affected software. Although unproven, there is also a possibility that an attacker could\
  \ leverage the buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the ClamAV\
  \ process."
