aliases: []
summary: KaTeX is a JavaScript library for TeX math rendering on the web. KaTeX users who render
  untrusted mathematical expressions could encounter malicious input using `\def` or `\newcommand`
  that causes a near-infinite loop, despite setting `maxExpand` to avoid such loops. KaTeX supports
  an option named maxExpand which aims to prevent infinitely recursive macros from consuming
  all available memory and/or triggering a stack overflow error. Unfortunately, support for
  "Unicode (sub|super)script characters" allows an attacker to bypass this limit. Each sub/superscript
  group instantiated a separate Parser with its own limit on macro executions, without inheriting
  the current count of macro executions from its parent. This has been corrected in KaTeX v0.16.10.
