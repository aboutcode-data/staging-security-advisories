aliases: []
summary: |
  Bitnami Sealed Secrets is vulnerable to a scope-widening attack during
  the secret rotation (/v1/rotate) flow. The rotation handler derives the
  sealing scope for the newly encrypted output from untrusted
  spec.template.metadata.annotations present in the input SealedSecret.
  By submitting a victim SealedSecret to the rotate endpoint with the
  annotation sealedsecrets.bitnami.com/cluster-wide=true injected into the
  template metadata, a remote attacker can obtain a rotated version of the
  secret that is cluster-wide. This bypasses original "strict" or
  "namespace-wide" constraints, allowing the attacker to retarget and unseal
  the secret in any namespace or under any name to recover the plaintext
  credentials.
