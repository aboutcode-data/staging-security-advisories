summary: OpenSTAManager is an open source management software for technical assistance and invoicing.
  OpenSTAManager v2.9.8 and earlier contain a critical Error-Based SQL Injection vulnerability
  in the bulk operations handler for the Scadenzario (Payment Schedule) module. The application
  fails to validate that elements of the id_records array are integers before using them in
  an SQL IN() clause, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL commands and extract sensitive
  data through XPATH error messages.
