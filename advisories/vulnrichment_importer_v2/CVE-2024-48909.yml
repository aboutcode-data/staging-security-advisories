aliases: []
summary: SpiceDB is an open source database for scalably storing and querying fine-grained authorization
  data. Starting in version 1.35.0 and prior to version 1.37.1, clients that have enabled `LookupResources2`
  and have caveats in the evaluation path for their requests can return a permissionship of
  `CONDITIONAL` with context marked as missing, even then the context was supplied. LookupResources2
  is the new default in SpiceDB 1.37.0 and has been opt-in since SpiceDB 1.35.0. The bug is
  patched as part of SpiceDB 1.37.1. As a workaround, disable LookupResources2 via the `--enable-experimental-lookup-resources`
  flag by setting it to `false`.
