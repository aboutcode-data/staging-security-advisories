aliases: []
summary: The List categories plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the plugin's 'categories' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 0.4 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary
  web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
