aliases: []
summary: The Echo RSS Feed Post Generator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
  in all versions up to, and including, 5.4.6. This is due to the plugin not properly restricting
  the roles that can set during registration through the echo_check_post_header_sent() function.
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register as an administrator.
