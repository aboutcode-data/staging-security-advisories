aliases: []
summary: RabbitMQ is a messaging and streaming broker. In versions 3.13.7 and prior, RabbitMQ
  is logging authorization headers in plaintext encoded in base64. When querying RabbitMQ api
  with HTTP/s with basic authentication it creates logs with all headers in request, including
  authorization headers which show base64 encoded username:password. This is easy to decode
  and afterwards could be used to obtain control to the system depending on credentials. This
  issue has been patched in version 4.0.8.
