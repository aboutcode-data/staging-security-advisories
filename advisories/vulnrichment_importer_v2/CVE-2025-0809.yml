summary: The Link Fixer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via
  broken links in all versions up to, and including, 3.4 due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary
  web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
