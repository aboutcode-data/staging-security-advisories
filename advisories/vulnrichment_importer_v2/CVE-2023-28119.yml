aliases: []
summary: The crewjam/saml go library contains a partial implementation of the SAML standard
  in golang. Prior to version 0.4.13, the package's use of `flate.NewReader` does not limit
  the size of the input. The user can pass more than 1 MB of data in the HTTP request to the
  processing functions, which will be decompressed server-side using the Deflate algorithm.
  Therefore, after repeating the same request multiple times, it is possible to achieve a reliable
  crash since the operating system kills the process. This issue is patched in version 0.4.13.
