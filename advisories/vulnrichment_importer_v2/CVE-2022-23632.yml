aliases: []
summary: Traefik is an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. Prior to version 2.6.1, Traefik
  skips the router transport layer security (TLS) configuration when the host header is a fully
  qualified domain name (FQDN). For a request, the TLS configuration choice can be different
  than the router choice, which implies the use of a wrong TLS configuration. When sending a
  request using FQDN handled by a router configured with a dedicated TLS configuration, the
  TLS configuration falls back to the default configuration that might not correspond to the
  configured one. If the CNAME flattening is enabled, the selected TLS configuration is the
  SNI one and the routing uses the CNAME value, so this can skip the expected TLS configuration.
  Version 2.6.1 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, one may add the FDQN to the
  host rule. However, there is no workaround if the CNAME flattening is enabled.
