aliases: []
summary: The Paid Memberships Pro – Content Restriction, User Registration, & Paid Subscriptions
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and
  including, 3.0.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the pmpro_update_level_group_order()
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update order levels via
  a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such
  as clicking on a link.
