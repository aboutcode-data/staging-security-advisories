aliases: []
summary: Nimforum is a lightweight alternative to Discourse written in Nim. In versions prior
  to 2.2.0 any forum user can create a new thread/post with an include referencing a file local
  to the host operating system. Nimforum will render the file if able. This can also be done
  silently by using NimForum's post "preview" endpoint. Even if NimForum is running as a non-critical
  user, the forum.json secrets can be stolen. Version 2.2.0 of NimForum includes patches for
  this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as is possible. There are no known
  workarounds for this issue.
