  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/amd/display: Check UnboundedRequestEnabled's value

  CalculateSwathAndDETConfiguration_params_st's UnboundedRequestEnabled
  is a pointer (i.e. dml_bool_t *UnboundedRequestEnabled), and thus
  if (p->UnboundedRequestEnabled) checks its address, not bool value.

  This fixes 1 REVERSE_INULL issue reported by Coverity.
