aliases: []
summary: The WP-Orphanage Extended plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce
  validation on the wporphanageex_menu_settings() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to escalate the privileges of all orphan accounts via a forged request granted they
  can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
