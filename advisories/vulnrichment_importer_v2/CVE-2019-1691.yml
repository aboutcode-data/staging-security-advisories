aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the detection engine of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the unexpected restart of the SNORT
  detection engine, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due
  to the incomplete error handling of the SSL or TLS packet header during the connection establishment.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SSL or TLS packet during
  the connection handshake. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the SNORT detection
  engine to unexpectedly restart, resulting in a partial DoS condition while the detection engine
  restarts. Versions prior to 6.2.3.4 are affected.
