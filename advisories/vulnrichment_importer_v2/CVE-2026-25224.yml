aliases: []
summary: Fastify is a fast and low overhead web framework, for Node.js. Prior to version 5.7.3,
  a denial-of-service vulnerability in Fastify’s Web Streams response handling can allow a remote
  client to exhaust server memory. Applications that return a ReadableStream (or Response with
  a Web Stream body) via reply.send() are impacted. A slow or non-reading client can trigger
  unbounded buffering when backpressure is ignored, leading to process crashes or severe degradation.
  This issue has been patched in version 5.7.3.
