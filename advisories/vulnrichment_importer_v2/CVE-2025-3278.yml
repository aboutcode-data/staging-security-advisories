aliases: []
summary: The UrbanGo Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in
  versions up to, and including, 1.0.4. This is due to the plugin allowing users who are registering
  new accounts to set their own role or by supplying 'user_register_role' field. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain elevated privileges by creating an account
  with the administrator role.
