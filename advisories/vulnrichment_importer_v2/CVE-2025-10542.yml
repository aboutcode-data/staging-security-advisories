aliases: []
summary: iMonitor EAM 9.6394 ships with default administrative credentials that are also displayed
  within the management client’s connection dialog. If the administrator does not change these
  defaults, a remote attacker can authenticate to the EAM server and gain full control over
  monitored agents and data. This enables reading highly sensitive telemetry (including keylogger
  output) and issuing arbitrary actions to all connected clients.
