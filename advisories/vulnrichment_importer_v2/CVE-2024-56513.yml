aliases: []
summary: Karmada is a Kubernetes management system that allows users to run cloud-native applications
  across multiple Kubernetes clusters and clouds. Prior to version 1.12.0, the PULL mode clusters
  registered with the `karmadactl register` command have excessive privileges to access control
  plane resources. By abusing these permissions, an attacker able to authenticate as the karmada-agent
  to a karmada cluster would be able to obtain administrative privileges over the entire federation
  system including all registered member clusters. Since Karmada v1.12.0, command `karmadactl
  register` restricts the access permissions of pull mode member clusters to control plane resources.
  This way, an attacker able to authenticate as the karmada-agent cannot control other member
  clusters in Karmada. As a workaround, one may restrict the access permissions of pull mode
  member clusters to control plane resources according to Karmada Component Permissions Docs.
