summary: "Versions of the package dash-core-components before 2.13.0; versions of the package\
  \ dash-core-components before 2.0.0; versions of the package dash before 2.15.0; versions\
  \ of the package dash-html-components before 2.0.0; versions of the package dash-html-components\
  \ before 2.0.16 are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) when the href of the a tag is\
  \ controlled by an adversary. An authenticated attacker who stores a view that exploits this\
  \ vulnerability could steal the data that's visible to another user who opens that view -\
  \ not just the data already included on the page, but they could also, in theory, make additional\
  \ requests and access other data accessible to this user. In some cases, they could also steal\
  \ the access tokens of that user, which would allow the attacker to act as that user, including\
  \ viewing other apps and resources hosted on the same server.\r\r**Note:**\r\rThis is only\
  \ exploitable in Dash apps that include some mechanism to store user input to be reloaded\
  \ by a different user."
