aliases: []
summary: NuProcess is an external process execution implementation for Java. In all the versions
  of NuProcess where it forks processes by using the JVM's Java_java_lang_UNIXProcess_forkAndExec
  method (1.2.0+), attackers can use NUL characters in their strings to perform command line
  injection. Java's ProcessBuilder isn't vulnerable because of a check in ProcessBuilder.start.
  NuProcess is missing that check. This vulnerability can only be exploited to inject command
  line arguments on Linux. Version 2.0.5 contains a patch. As a workaround, users of the library
  can sanitize command strings to remove NUL characters prior to passing them to NuProcess for
  execution.
