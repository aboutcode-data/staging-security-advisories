summary: The FreePBX module tts (Text to Speech) for FreePBX, an open-source web-based graphical
  user interface (GUI) that manages Asterisk. Versions prior to 16.0.5 and 17.0.5 are vulnerable
  to SQL injection by authenticated users with administrator access. Authenticated users with
  administrative access to the Administrator Control Panel (ACP) can leverage this SQL injection
  vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database and execute code on the system
  as the `asterisk` user with chained elevation to `root` privileges. Users should upgrade to
  version 16.0.5 or 17.0.5 to receive a fix.
