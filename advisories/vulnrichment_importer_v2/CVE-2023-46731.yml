aliases: []
summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications
  built on top of it. XWiki doesn't properly escape the section URL parameter that is used in
  the code for displaying administration sections. This allows any user with read access to
  the document `XWiki.AdminSheet` (by default, everyone including unauthenticated users) to
  execute code including Groovy code. This impacts the confidentiality, integrity and availability
  of the whole XWiki instance. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 14.10.14, 15.6 RC1
  and 15.5.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unablr to upgrade may apply the fix in commit
  `fec8e0e53f9` manually. Alternatively, to protect against attacks from unauthenticated users,
  view right for guests can be removed from this document (it is only needed for space and wiki
  admins).
