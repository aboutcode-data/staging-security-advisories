aliases: []
summary: Code Dx versions prior to 2023.4.2 are vulnerable to user impersonation attack where
  a malicious actor is able to gain access to another user's account by crafting a custom "Remember
  Me" token. This is possible due to the use of a hard-coded cipher which was used when generating
  the token. A malicious actor who creates this token can supply it to a separate Code Dx system,
  provided they know the username they want to impersonate, and impersonate the user.  Score 6.7
