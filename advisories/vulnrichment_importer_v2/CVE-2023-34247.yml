aliases: []
summary: Keystone is a content management system for Node.JS. There is an open redirect in the
  `@keystone-6/auth` package versions 7.0.0 and prior, where the redirect leading `/` filter
  can be bypassed. Users may be redirected to domains other than the relative host, thereby
  it might be used by attackers to re-direct users to an unexpected location. To mitigate this
  issue, one may apply a patch from pull request 8626 or avoid using the `@keystone-6/auth`
  package.
