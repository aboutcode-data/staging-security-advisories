summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The `AvgPoolOp` function
  takes an argument `ksize` that must be positive but is not checked. A negative `ksize` can
  trigger a `CHECK` failure and crash the program. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
  3a6ac52664c6c095aa2b114e742b0aa17fdce78f. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We
  will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2,
  as these are also affected and still in supported range. There are no known workarounds to
  this issue.
