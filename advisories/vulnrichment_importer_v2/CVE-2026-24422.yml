aliases: []
summary: phpMyFAQ is an open source FAQ web application. In versions 4.0.16 and below, multiple
  public API endpoints improperly expose sensitive user information due to insufficient access
  controls. The OpenQuestionController::list() endpoint calls Question::getAll() with showAll=true
  by default, returning records marked as non-public (isVisible=false) along with user email
  addresses, with similar exposures present in comment, news, and FAQ APIs. This information
  disclosure vulnerability could enable attackers to harvest email addresses for phishing campaigns
  or access content that was explicitly marked as private. This issue has been fixed in version
  4.0.17.
