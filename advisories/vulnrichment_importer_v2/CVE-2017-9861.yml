aliases: []
summary: 'An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. The SIP implementation does
  not properly use authentication with encryption: it is vulnerable to replay attacks, packet
  injection attacks, and man in the middle attacks. An attacker is able to successfully use
  SIP to communicate with the device from anywhere within the LAN. An attacker may use this
  to crash the device, stop it from communicating with the SMA servers, exploit known SIP vulnerabilities,
  or find sensitive information from the SIP communications. Furthermore, because the SIP communication
  channel is unencrypted, an attacker capable of understanding the protocol can eavesdrop on
  communications. For example, passwords can be extracted. NOTE: the vendor''s position is that
  authentication with encryption is not required on an isolated subnetwork. Also, only Sunny
  Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected'
