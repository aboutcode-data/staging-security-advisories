aliases: []
summary: 'Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host prior to version 22.0.1049
  and Application prior to version 20.0.2786 (VA and SaaS deployments) contain a private SSL
  key and matching public certificate stored in cleartext. The key belongs to the hostname `pl‑local.com`
  and is used by the appliance to terminate TLS connections on ports 80/443. Because the key
  is hardcoded, any attacker who can gain container-level access can simply read the files and
  obtain the private key. With the private key, the attacker can decrypt TLS traffic, perform
  man-in-the-middle attacks, or forge TLS certificates. This enables impersonation of the appliance’s
  web UI, interception of credentials, and unrestricted access to any services that trust the
  certificate. The same key is identical across all deployed appliances meaning a single theft
  compromises the confidentiality of every Vasion Print installation. This vulnerability has
  been identified by the vendor as: V-2024-025 — Hardcoded SSL Certificate & Private Keys.'
