summary: The WP EasyCart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in
  versions up to, and including, 5.4.8. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the process_duplicate_product function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to duplicate products via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
  performing an action such as clicking on a link.
