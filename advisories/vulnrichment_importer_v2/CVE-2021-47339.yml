  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  media: v4l2-core: explicitly clear ioctl input data

  As seen from a recent syzbot bug report, mistakes in the compat ioctl
  implementation can lead to uninitialized kernel stack data getting used
  as input for driver ioctl handlers.

  The reported bug is now fixed, but it's possible that other related
  bugs are still present or get added in the future. As the drivers need
  to check user input already, the possible impact is fairly low, but it
  might still cause an information leak.

  To be on the safe side, always clear the entire ioctl buffer before
  calling the conversion handler functions that are meant to initialize
  them.
