aliases: []
summary: The WordPress Social Login and Register (Discord, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn) plugin
  for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 7.6.4.
  This is due to insufficient encryption on the user being supplied during a login validated
  through the plugin. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any
  existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they know the email address associated
  with that user. This was partially patched in version 7.6.4 and fully patched in version 7.6.5.
