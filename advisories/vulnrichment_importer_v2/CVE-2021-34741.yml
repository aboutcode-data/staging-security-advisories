aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the email scanning algorithm of Cisco AsyncOS software for Cisco
  Email Security Appliance (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform
  a denial of service (DoS) attack against an affected device. This vulnerability is due to
  insufficient input validation of incoming emails. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a crafted email through Cisco ESA. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to exhaust all the available CPU resources on an affected device for an extended period of
  time, preventing other emails from being processed and resulting in a DoS condition.
