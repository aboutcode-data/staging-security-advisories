aliases: []
summary: The Omnishop plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Registration Bypass
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.9. Its /users/register endpoint is exposed to the
  public (permission_callback always returns true) and invokes wp_create_user() unconditionally,  ignoring
  the site’s users_can_register option and any nonce or CAPTCHA checks. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to create arbitrary user accounts (customer) on sites where
  registrations should be closed.
