  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  pipe: wakeup wr_wait after setting max_usage

  Commit c73be61cede5 ("pipe: Add general notification queue support") a
  regression was introduced that would lock up resized pipes under certain
  conditions. See the reproducer in [1].

  The commit resizing the pipe ring size was moved to a different
  function, doing that moved the wakeup for pipe->wr_wait before actually
  raising pipe->max_usage. If a pipe was full before the resize occured it
  would result in the wakeup never actually triggering pipe_write.

  Set @max_usage and @nr_accounted before waking writers if this isn't a
  watch queue.
