aliases: []
summary: 'Metabase is an open source data analytics platform. Affected versions are subject
  to Improper Privilege Management. As intended, recipients of dashboards subscriptions can
  view the data as seen by the creator of that subscription. This allows someone with greater
  access to data to create a dashboard subscription, add people with fewer data privileges,
  and all recipients of that subscription receive the same data: the charts shown in the email
  would abide by the privileges of the user who created the subscription. The issue is users
  with fewer privileges who can view a dashboard are able to add themselves to a dashboard subscription
  created by someone with additional data privileges, and thus get access to more data via email.
  This issue is patched in versions 0.43.7.1, 1.43.7.1, 0.44.6.1, 1.44.6.1, 0.45.2.1, and 1.45.2.1.
  On Metabase instances running Enterprise Edition, admins can disable the "Subscriptions and
  Alerts" permission for groups that have restricted data permissions, as a workaround.'
