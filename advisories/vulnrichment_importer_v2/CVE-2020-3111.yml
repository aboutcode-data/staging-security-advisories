aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol implementation for the Cisco IP Phone
  could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to remotely execute code with root privileges
  or cause a reload of an affected IP phone. The vulnerability is due to missing checks when
  processing Cisco Discovery Protocol messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to the targeted IP phone. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to remotely execute code with root privileges or cause a
  reload of an affected IP phone, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Cisco Discovery
  Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be in the
  same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).
