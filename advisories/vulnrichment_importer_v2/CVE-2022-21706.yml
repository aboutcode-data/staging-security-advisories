aliases: []
summary: 'Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool with topic-based threading. Zulip
  Server version 2.0.0 and above are vulnerable to insufficient access control with multi-use
  invitations. A Zulip Server deployment which hosts multiple organizations is vulnerable to
  an attack where an invitation created in one organization (potentially as a role with elevated
  permissions) can be used to join any other organization. This bypasses any restrictions on
  required domains on users'' email addresses, may be used to gain access to organizations which
  are only accessible by invitation, and may be used to gain access with elevated privileges.
  This issue has been patched in release 4.10. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
