aliases: []
summary: GoCD is a continuous delivery server. GoCD helps you automate and streamline the build-test-release
  cycle for continuous delivery of your product. GoCD versions prior to 21.1.0 are vulnerable
  to remote code execution on the server from a malicious or compromised agent. The Spring RemoteInvocation
  endpoint exposed agent communication and allowed deserialization of arbitrary java objects,
  as well as subsequent remote code execution. Exploitation requires agent-level authentication,
  thus an attacker would need to either compromise an existing agent, its network communication
  or register a new agent to practically exploit this vulnerability. This issue is fixed in
  GoCD version 21.1.0. There are currently no known workarounds.
