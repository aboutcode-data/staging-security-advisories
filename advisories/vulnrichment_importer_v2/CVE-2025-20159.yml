summary: "A vulnerability in the management interface access control list (ACL) processing feature\
  \ in Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass configured\
  \ ACLs for the SSH, NetConf, and gRPC features.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because management\
  \ interface ACLs have not been supported on Cisco IOS XR Software Packet I/O infrastructure\
  \ platforms for Linux-handled features such as SSH, NetConf, or gRPC. An attacker could exploit\
  \ this vulnerability by attempting to send traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit\
  \ could allow the attacker to bypass an ingress ACL that is applied on the management interface\
  \ of the affected device."
