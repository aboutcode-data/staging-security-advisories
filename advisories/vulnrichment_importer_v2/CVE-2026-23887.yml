aliases: []
summary: Group-Office is an enterprise customer relationship management and groupware tool.
  In versions 6.8.148 and below, and 25.0.1 through 25.0.79, the application stores unsanitized
  filenames in the database, which can lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Users who
  interact with these specially crafted file names within the Group-Office application are affected.
  While the scope is limited to the file-viewing context, it could still be used to interfere
  with user sessions or perform unintended actions in the browser. This issue is fixed in versions
  6.8.149 and 25.0.80.
