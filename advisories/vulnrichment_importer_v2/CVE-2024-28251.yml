aliases: []
summary: Querybook is a Big Data Querying UI, combining collocated table metadata and a simple
  notebook interface. Querybook's datadocs functionality works by using a Websocket Server.
  The client talks to this WSS whenever updating/deleting/reading any cells as well as for watching
  the live status of query executions. Currently the CORS setting allows all origins, which
  could result in cross-site websocket hijacking and allow attackers to read/edit/remove datadocs
  of the user. This issue has been addressed in version 3.32.0. Users are advised to upgrade.
  There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
