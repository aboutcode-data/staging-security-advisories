aliases: []
summary: The GiveWP – Donation Plugin and Fundraising Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 3.15.1. This is due to the plugin
  utilizing Symfony and leaving display_errors on within test files. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can
  be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires
  another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.
