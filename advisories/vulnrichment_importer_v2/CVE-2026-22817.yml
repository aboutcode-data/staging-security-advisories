aliases: []
summary: Hono is a Web application framework that provides support for any JavaScript runtime.
  Prior to 4.11.4, there is a flaw in Hono’s JWK/JWKS JWT verification middleware allowed the
  JWT header’s alg value to influence signature verification when the selected JWK did not explicitly
  specify an algorithm. This could enable JWT algorithm confusion and, in certain configurations,
  allow forged tokens to be accepted. As part of this fix, the JWT middleware now requires the
  alg option to be explicitly specified. This prevents algorithm confusion by ensuring that
  the verification algorithm is not derived from untrusted JWT header values. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 4.11.4.
