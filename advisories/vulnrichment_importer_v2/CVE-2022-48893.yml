  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/i915/gt: Cleanup partial engine discovery failures

  If we abort driver initialisation in the middle of gt/engine discovery,
  some engines will be fully setup and some not. Those incompletely setup
  engines only have 'engine->release == NULL' and so will leak any of the
  common objects allocated.

  v2:
   - Drop the destroy_pinned_context() helper for now.  It's not really
     worth it with just a single callsite at the moment.  (Janusz)
