aliases: []
summary: CuteFlow version 2.11.2 and earlier contains an arbitrary file upload vulnerability
  in the restart_circulation_values_write.php script. The application fails to validate or restrict
  uploaded file types, allowing unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary PHP files to the
  upload/___1/ directory. These files are then accessible via the web server, enabling remote
  code execution.
