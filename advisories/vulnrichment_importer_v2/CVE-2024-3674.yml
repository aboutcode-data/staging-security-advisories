aliases: []
summary: The Inline Google Spreadsheet Viewer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the plugin's 'gdoc' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 0.13.2 due
  to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes such as
  'chart_resolution'. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses an injected page.
