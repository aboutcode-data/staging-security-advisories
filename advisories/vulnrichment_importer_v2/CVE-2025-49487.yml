aliases: []
summary: "An uncontrolled search path vulnerability in the Trend Micro Worry-Free Business Security\
  \ Services (WFBSS) agent could have allowed an attacker with physical access to a machine\
  \ to execute arbitrary code on affected installations.\r\n\r\nAn attacker must have had physical\
  \ access to the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability due to need to access\
  \ a certain hardware component.\r\n\r\nAlso note: this vulnerability only affected the SaaS\
  \ client version of WFBSS only, meaning the on-premise version of Worry-Free Business Security\
  \ was not affected, and this issue was addressed in a previous WFBSS monthly maintenance update.\
  \ Therefore no other customer action is required to mitigate if the WFBSS agents are on the\
  \ regular SaaS maintenance deployment schedule and this disclosure is for informational purposes\
  \ only."
