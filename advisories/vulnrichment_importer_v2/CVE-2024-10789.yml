aliases: []
summary: The WP User Profile Avatar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce
  validation on the wpupa_user_admin() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to update the plugins setting which controls access to the functionality via a forged
  request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
  on a link.
