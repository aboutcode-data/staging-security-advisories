aliases: []
summary: gradle-completion provides Bash and Zsh completion support for Gradle. A command injection
  vulnerability was found in gradle-completion up to and including 9.3.0 that allows arbitrary
  code execution when a user triggers Bash tab completion in a project containing a malicious
  Gradle build file. The `gradle-completion` script for Bash fails to adequately sanitize Gradle
  task names and task descriptions, allowing command injection via a malicious Gradle build
  file when the user completes a command in Bash (without them explicitly running any task in
  the build). For example, given a task description that includes a string between backticks,
  then that string would be evaluated as a command when presenting the task description in the
  completion list. While task execution is the core feature of Gradle, this inherent execution
  may lead to unexpected outcomes. The vulnerability does not affect zsh completion. The first
  patched version is 9.3.1. As a workaround, it is possible and effective to temporarily disable
  bash completion for Gradle by removing `gradle-completion` from `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`.
