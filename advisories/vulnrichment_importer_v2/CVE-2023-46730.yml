aliases: []
summary: Group-Office is an enterprise CRM and groupware tool. In affected versions there is
  full Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the /api/upload.php endpoint. The
  /api/upload.php endpoint does not filter URLs which allows a malicious user to cause the server
  to make resource requests to untrusted domains. Note that protocols like file:// can also
  be used to access the server disk. The request result (on success) can then be retrieved using
  /api/download.php. This issue has been addressed in versions 6.8.15, 6.7.54, and 6.6.177.
  Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
