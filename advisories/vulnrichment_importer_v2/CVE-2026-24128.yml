aliases: []
summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications
  built on top of it. Versions 7.0-milestone-2 through 16.10.11, 17.0.0-rc-1 through 17.4.4,
  and 17.5.0-rc-1 through 17.7.0 contain a reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability,
  which allows an attacker to craft a malicious URL and execute arbitrary actions with the same
  privileges as the victim. If the victim has administrative or programming rights, those rights
  can be exploited to gain full access to the XWiki installation. This issue has been patched
  in versions 17.8.0-rc-1, 17.4.5 and 16.10.12. To workaround, the patch can be applied manually,
  only a single line in templates/logging_macros.vm needs to be changed, no restart is required.
