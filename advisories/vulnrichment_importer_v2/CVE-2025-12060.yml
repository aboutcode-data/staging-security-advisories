aliases: []
summary: The keras.utils.get_file API in Keras, when used with the extract=True option for tar
  archives, is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The utility uses Python's tarfile.extractall
  function without the filter="data" feature. A remote attacker can craft a malicious tar archive
  containing special symlinks, which, when extracted, allows them to write arbitrary files to
  any location on the filesystem outside of the intended destination folder. This vulnerability
  is linked to the underlying Python tarfile weakness, identified as CVE-2025-4517. Note that
  upgrading Python to one of the versions that fix CVE-2025-4517 (e.g. Python 3.13.4) is not
  enough. One additionally needs to upgrade Keras to a version with the fix (Keras 3.12).
