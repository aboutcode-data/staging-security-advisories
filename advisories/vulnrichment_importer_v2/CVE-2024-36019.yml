  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  regmap: maple: Fix cache corruption in regcache_maple_drop()

  When keeping the upper end of a cache block entry, the entry[] array
  must be indexed by the offset from the base register of the block,
  i.e. max - mas.index.

  The code was indexing entry[] by only the register address, leading
  to an out-of-bounds access that copied some part of the kernel
  memory over the cache contents.

  This bug was not detected by the regmap KUnit test because it only
  tests with a block of registers starting at 0, so mas.index == 0.
