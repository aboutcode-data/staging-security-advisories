aliases: []
summary: kirby is a content management system (CMS) that adapts to many different projects and
  helps you build your own ideal interface. Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of vulnerability
  that allows execution of any kind of JavaScript code inside the Panel session of the same
  or other users. In the Panel, a harmful script can for example trigger requests to Kirby's
  API with the permissions of the victim. If bad actors gain access to your group of authenticated
  Panel users they can escalate their privileges via the Panel session of an admin user. Depending
  on your site, other JavaScript-powered attacks are possible. The multiselect field allows
  selection of tags from an autocompleted list. Unfortunately, the Panel in Kirby 3.5 used HTML
  rendering for the raw option value. This allowed **attackers with influence on the options
  source** to store HTML code. The browser of the victim who visited a page with manipulated
  multiselect options in the Panel will then have rendered this malicious HTML code when the
  victim opened the autocomplete dropdown. Users are *not* affected by this vulnerability if
  you don't use the multiselect field or don't use it with options that can be manipulated by
  attackers. The problem has been patched in Kirby 3.5.8.1.
