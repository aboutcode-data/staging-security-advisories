summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  vsock: fix recursive ->recvmsg calls

  After a vsock socket has been added to a BPF sockmap, its prot->recvmsg
  has been replaced with vsock_bpf_recvmsg(). Thus the following
  recursiion could happen:

  vsock_bpf_recvmsg()
   -> __vsock_recvmsg()
    -> vsock_connectible_recvmsg()
     -> prot->recvmsg()
      -> vsock_bpf_recvmsg() again

  We need to fix it by calling the original ->recvmsg() without any BPF
  sockmap logic in __vsock_recvmsg().
