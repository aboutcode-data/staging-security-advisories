summary: 'An Incorrect Permission Assignment vulnerability in shell processing of Juniper Networks
  Junos OS Evolved allows a low-privileged local user to modify the contents of a configuration
  file which could cause another user to execute arbitrary commands within the context of the
  follow-on user''s session. If the follow-on user is a high-privileged administrator, the attacker
  could leverage this vulnerability to take complete control of the target system. While this
  issue is triggered by a user, other than the attacker, accessing the Junos shell, an attacker
  simply requires Junos CLI access to exploit this vulnerability. This issue affects Juniper
  Networks Junos OS Evolved: 20.4-EVO versions prior to 20.4R3-S1-EVO; All versions of 21.1-EVO;
  21.2-EVO versions prior to 21.2R3-EVO; 21.3-EVO versions prior to 21.3R2-EVO. This issue does
  not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved versions prior to 19.2R1-EVO.'
