aliases: []
summary: Anaconda 3 2023.03-1-Linux allows local users to disrupt TLS certificate validation
  by modifying the cacert.pem file used by the installed pip program. This occurs because many
  files are installed as world-writable on Linux, ignoring umask, even when these files are
  installed as root. Miniconda is also affected.
