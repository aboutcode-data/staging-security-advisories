summary: imartinez/privategpt version 0.2.0 is vulnerable to a local file inclusion vulnerability
  that allows attackers to read arbitrary files from the filesystem. By manipulating file upload
  functionality to ingest arbitrary local files, attackers can exploit the 'Search in Docs'
  feature or query the AI to retrieve or disclose the contents of any file on the system. This
  vulnerability could lead to various impacts, including but not limited to remote code execution
  by obtaining private SSH keys, unauthorized access to private files, source code disclosure
  facilitating further attacks, and exposure of configuration files.
