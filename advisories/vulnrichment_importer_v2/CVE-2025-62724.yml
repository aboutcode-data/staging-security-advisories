aliases: []
summary: Open OnDemand is an open-source HPC portal. Prior to versions 4.0.8 and 3.1.16, users
  can craft a "Time of Check to Time of Use" (TOCTOU) attack when downloading zip files to access
  files outside of the OOD_ALLOWLIST. This vulnerability impacts sites that use the file browser
  allowlists in all current versions of OOD. However, files accessed are still protected by
  the UNIX permissions. Open OnDemand versions 4.0.8 and 3.1.16 have been patched for this vulnerability.
