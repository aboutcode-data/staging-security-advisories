aliases: []
summary: The SportsPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions
  up to, and including, 2.7.26 via shortcodes 'template_name' attribute. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level and above permissions, to include and

  This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution
  in cases where php file type can be uploaded and included.
