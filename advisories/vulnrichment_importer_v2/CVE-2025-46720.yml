aliases: []
summary: 'Keystone is a content management system for Node.js. Prior to version 6.5.0, `{field}.isFilterable`
  access control can be bypassed in `update` and `delete` mutations by adding additional unique
  filters. These filters can be used as an oracle to probe the existence or value of otherwise
  unreadable fields. Specifically, when a mutation includes a `where` clause with multiple unique
  filters (e.g. `id` and `email`), Keystone will attempt to match records even if filtering
  by the latter fields would normally be rejected by `field.isFilterable` or `list.defaultIsFilterable`.
  This can allow malicious actors to infer the presence of a particular field value when a filter
  is successful in returning a result. This affects any project relying on the default or dynamic
  `isFilterable` behavior (at the list or field level) to prevent external users from using
  the filtering of fields as a discovery mechanism. While this access control is respected during
  `findMany` operations, it was not completely enforced during `update` and `delete` mutations
  when accepting more than one unique `where` values in filters. This has no impact on projects
  using `isFilterable: false` or `defaultIsFilterable: false` for sensitive fields, or for those
  who have otherwise omitted filtering by these fields from their GraphQL schema. This issue
  has been patched in `@keystone-6/core` version 6.5.0. To mitigate this issue in older versions
  where patching is not a viable pathway, set `isFilterable: false` statically for relevant
  fields to prevent filtering by them earlier in the access control pipeline (that is, don''t
  use functions); set `{field}.graphql.omit.read: true` for relevant fields, which implicitly
  removes filtering by these fields from the GraphQL schema; and/or deny `update` and `delete`
  operations for the relevant lists completely.'
