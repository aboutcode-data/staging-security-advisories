  The Administration session expiration was set to one week, when an attacker has stolen the
  session cookie they could use it for a long period of time. In version 6.4.18.1 an automatic
  logout into the Administration session has been added. As a result the user will be logged
  out when they are inactive. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for
  this issue.
