aliases: []
summary: In deployments using the ScreenConnect™ Certificate Signing Extension, encrypted configuration
  values including an Azure Key Vault-related key, could be returned to unauthenticated users
  through a client-facing endpoint under certain conditions. The values remained encrypted and
  securely stored at rest; however, an encrypted representation could be exposed in client responses.
  Updating the Certificate Signing Extension to version 1.0.12 or higher ensures configuration
  handling occurs exclusively on the server side, preventing encrypted values from being transmitted
  to or rendered by client-side components.
