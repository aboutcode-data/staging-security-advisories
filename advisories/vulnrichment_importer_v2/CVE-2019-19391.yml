aliases: []
summary: 'In LuaJIT through 2.0.5, as used in Moonjit before 2.1.2 and other products, debug.getinfo
  has a type confusion issue that leads to arbitrary memory write or read operations, because
  certain cases involving valid stack levels and > options are mishandled. NOTE: The LuaJIT
  project owner states that the debug libary is unsafe by definition and that this is not a
  vulnerability. When LuaJIT was originally developed, the expectation was that the entire debug
  library had no security guarantees and thus it made no sense to assign CVEs. However, not
  all users of later LuaJIT derivatives share this perspective'
