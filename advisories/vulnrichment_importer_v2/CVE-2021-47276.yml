summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ftrace: Do not blindly read the ip address in ftrace_bug()

  It was reported that a bug on arm64 caused a bad ip address to be used for
  updating into a nop in ftrace_init(), but the error path (rightfully)
  returned -EINVAL and not -EFAULT, as the bug caused more than one error to
  occur. But because -EINVAL was returned, the ftrace_bug() tried to report
  what was at the location of the ip address, and read it directly. This
  caused the machine to panic, as the ip was not pointing to a valid memory
  address.

  Instead, read the ip address with copy_from_kernel_nofault() to safely
  access the memory, and if it faults, report that the address faulted,
  otherwise report what was in that location.
