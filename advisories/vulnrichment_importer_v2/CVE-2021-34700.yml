summary: A vulnerability in the CLI interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an
  authenticated, local attacker to read arbitrary files on the underlying file system of an
  affected system. This vulnerability exists because access to sensitive information on an affected

  unauthorized access to sensitive information on an affected system. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to create forged authentication requests and gain unauthorized access to
  the web UI of an affected system.
