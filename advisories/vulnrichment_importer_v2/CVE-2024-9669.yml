aliases: []
summary: The File Manager Pro – Filester plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local JavaScript
  File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.5 via the 'fm_locale' parameter.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above,
  to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any code in
  those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve
  code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included.
  The vulnerability was partially patched in version 1.8.5.
