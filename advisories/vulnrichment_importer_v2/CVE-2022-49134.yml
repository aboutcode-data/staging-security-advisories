summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mlxsw: spectrum: Guard against invalid local ports

  When processing events generated by the device's firmware, the driver
  protects itself from events reported for non-existent local ports, but
  not for the CPU port (local port 0), which exists, but does not have all
  the fields as any local port.

  This can result in a NULL pointer dereference when trying access
  'struct mlxsw_sp_port' fields which are not initialized for CPU port.

  Commit 63b08b1f6834 ("mlxsw: spectrum: Protect driver from buggy firmware")
  already handled such issue by bailing early when processing a PUDE event
  reported for the CPU port.

  Generalize the approach by moving the check to a common function and
  making use of it in all relevant places.
