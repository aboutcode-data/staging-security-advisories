aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of certain Cisco Small Business
  RV Series Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges
  to inject arbitrary commands into the underlying operating system. When processed, the commands
  will be executed with root privileges. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation
  of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing malicious
  input to a specific field in the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating
  system as the root user.
