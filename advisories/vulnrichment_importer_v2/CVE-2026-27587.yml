aliases: []
summary: Caddy is an extensible server platform that uses TLS by default. Prior to version 2.11.1,
  Caddy's HTTP `path` request matcher is intended to be case-insensitive, but when the match
  pattern contains percent-escape sequences (`%xx`) it compares against the request's escaped
  path without lowercasing. An attacker can bypass path-based routing and any access controls
  attached to that route by changing the casing of the request path. Version 2.11.1 contains
  a fix for the issue.
