aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in binary-husky/gpt_academic version git 310122f allows for remote
  code execution. The application supports the extraction of user-provided RAR files without
  proper validation. The Python rarfile module, which supports symlinks, can be exploited to
  perform arbitrary file writes. This can lead to remote code execution by writing to sensitive
  files such as SSH keys, crontab files, or the application's own code.
