aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) implementation for Cisco
  FXOS Software and Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to
  cause a denial of service (DoS) condition when the device unexpectedly reloads. The vulnerability
  is due to improper input validation of certain type, length, value (TLV) fields of the LLDP
  frame header. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted LLDP packet
  to an interface on the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause
  the switch to reload unexpectedly.
