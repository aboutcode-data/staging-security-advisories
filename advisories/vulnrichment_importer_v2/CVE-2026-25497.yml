aliases: []
summary: Craft is a platform for creating digital experiences. In Craft versions from 4.0.0-RC1
  to before 4.17.0-beta.1 and 5.9.0-beta.1, there is a Privilege Escalation vulnerability in
  Craft CMS’s GraphQL API that allows an authenticated user with write access to one asset volume
  to escalate their privileges and modify/transfer assets belonging to any other volume, including
  restricted or private volumes to which they should not have access. The saveAsset GraphQL
  mutation validates authorization against the schema-resolved volume but fetches the target
  asset by ID without verifying that the asset belongs to the authorized volume. This allows
  unauthorized cross-volume asset modification and transfer. This vulnerability is fixed in
  4.17.0-beta.1 and 5.9.0-beta.1.
