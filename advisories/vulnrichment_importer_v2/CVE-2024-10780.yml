summary: The Restaurant & Cafe Addon for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information
  Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.9 via the 'narestaurant_elementor_template'
  shortcode due to insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract data from
  private or draft posts created by Elementor that they should not have access to.
