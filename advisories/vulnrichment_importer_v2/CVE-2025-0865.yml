aliases: []
summary: The WP Media Category Management plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery in versions 2.0 to 2.3.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on
  the wp_mcm_handle_action_settings() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to alter plugin settings, such as the taxonomy used for media, the base slug for media categories,
  and the default media category via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
