aliases: []
summary: Kirby is an open-source content management system. From versions 5.0.0 to 5.1.3, attackers
  could change the title of any page or the name of any user to a malicious string. Then they
  could modify any content field of the same model without saving, making the model a candidate
  for display in the "Changes" dialog. If another authenticated user subsequently opened the
  dialog in their Panel, the malicious code would be executed. This vulnerability affects all
  Kirby 5 sites that might have potential attackers in the group of authenticated Panel users
  or that allow external visitors to update page titles or usernames. The attack requires user
  interaction by another Panel user and cannot be automated. This issue has been patched in
  version 5.1.4.
