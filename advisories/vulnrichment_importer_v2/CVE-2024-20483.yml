aliases: []
summary: "Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Routed PON Controller Software, which runs as a\
  \ docker container on hardware that is supported by Cisco IOS XR Software, could allow an\
  \ authenticated, remote attacker with Administrator-level privileges on the PON Manager or\
  \ direct access to the PON Manager MongoDB instance to perform command injection attacks on\
  \ the PON Controller container and execute arbitrary commands as root.\r\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities\
  \ are due to insufficient validation of arguments that are passed to specific configuration\
  \ commands. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by including crafted input as\
  \ the argument of an affected configuration command. A successful exploit could allow the\
  \ attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root on the PON controller."
