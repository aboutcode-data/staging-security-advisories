aliases: []
summary: Grav is a file-based Web platform. Prior to 1.8.0-beta.27, a Denial of Service (DoS)
  vulnerability was identified in the "Languages" submenu of the Grav admin configuration panel
  (/admin/config/system). Specifically, the Supported parameter fails to properly validate user
  input. If a malformed value is inserted—such as a single forward slash (/) or an XSS test
  string—it causes a fatal regular expression parsing error on the server. This leads to application-wide
  failure due to the use of the preg_match() function with an improperly constructed regular
  expression, resulting in an error. Once triggered, the site becomes completely unavailable
  to all users. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.8.0-beta.27.
