aliases: []
summary: 'An issue in OrangeHRM v.5.7 allows an attacker to escalate privileges via UserService.php
  and the checkForOldHash function. Authentication decisions may be made via PHP loose-equality
  comparisons if a specific MD5 value is present in the credential store. NOTE: this is disputed
  by the Supplier because an adversary has no way to place the specific MD5 value into the credential
  store (unless they already have full privileges) and because the specific MD5 value would
  not realistically be present otherwise.'
