summary: |
  A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series allows an adjacent, unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

  If an MX Series device receives PTP packets on an MPC3E that doesn't support PTP this causes a memory leak which will result in unpredictable behavior and ultimately in an MPC crash and restart.

  To monitor for this issue, please use the following FPC vty level commands:

  show heap
  shows an increase in "LAN buffer" utilization and

  show clksync ptp nbr-upd-info
  shows non-zero "Pending PFEs" counter.

  This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MPC3E:



    *  All versions earlier than 20.4R3-S3;
    *  21.1 versions earlier than 21.1R3-S4;
