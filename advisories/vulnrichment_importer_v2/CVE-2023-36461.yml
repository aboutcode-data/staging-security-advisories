aliases: []
summary: Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on ActivityPub. When performing
  outgoing HTTP queries, Mastodon sets a timeout on individual read operations. Prior to versions
  3.5.9, 4.0.5, and 4.1.3, a malicious server can indefinitely extend the duration of the response
  through slowloris-type attacks. This vulnerability can be used to keep all Mastodon workers
  busy for an extended duration of time, leading to the server becoming unresponsive. Versions
  3.5.9, 4.0.5, and 4.1.3 contain a patch for this issue.
