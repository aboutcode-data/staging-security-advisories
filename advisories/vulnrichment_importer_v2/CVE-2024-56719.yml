  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: stmmac: fix TSO DMA API usage causing oops

  Commit 66600fac7a98 ("net: stmmac: TSO: Fix unbalanced DMA map/unmap
  for non-paged SKB data") moved the assignment of tx_skbuff_dma[]'s
  members to be later in stmmac_tso_xmit().

  The buf (dma cookie) and len stored in this structure are passed to
  dma_unmap_single() by stmmac_tx_clean(). The DMA API requires that
  the dma cookie passed to dma_unmap_single() is the same as the value
  returned from dma_map_single(). However, by moving the assignment
  later, this is not the case when priv->dma_cap.addr64 > 32 as "des"
  is offset by proto_hdr_len.

  This causes problems such as:

    dwc-eth-dwmac 2490000.ethernet eth0: Tx DMA map failed

  and with DMA_API_DEBUG enabled:

    DMA-API: dwc-eth-dwmac 2490000.ethernet: device driver tries to +free DMA memory it has not allocated [device address=0x000000ffffcf65c0] [size=66 bytes]

  Fix this by maintaining "des" as the original DMA cookie, and use
  tso_des to pass the offset DMA cookie to stmmac_tso_allocator().
