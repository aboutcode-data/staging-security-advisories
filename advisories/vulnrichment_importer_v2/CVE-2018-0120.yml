summary: 'A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Unified Communications Manager could
  allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct an SQL injection attack against an affected
  system. The vulnerability exists because the affected software fails to validate user-supplied
  input in certain SQL queries that bypass protection filters. An attacker could exploit this
  vulnerability by submitting crafted HTTP requests that contain malicious SQL statements to
  an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to determine the presence
  of certain values in the database of the affected system. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg74810.'
