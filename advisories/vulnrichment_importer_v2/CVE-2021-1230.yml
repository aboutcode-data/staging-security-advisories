aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability with the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for Cisco Nexus 9000 Series
  Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to cause a routing process to crash, which could lead to a denial of service
  (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to an issue with the installation of routes upon
  receipt of a BGP update. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted
  BGP update to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the
  routing process to crash, which could cause the device to reload. This vulnerability applies
  to both Internal BGP (IBGP) and External BGP (EBGP). Note: The Cisco implementation of BGP
  accepts incoming BGP traffic from explicitly configured peers only. To exploit this vulnerability,
  an attacker would need to send a specific BGP update message over an established TCP connection
  that appears to come from a trusted BGP peer.'
