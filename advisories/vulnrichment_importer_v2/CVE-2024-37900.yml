aliases: []
summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications
  built on top of it. When uploading an attachment with a malicious filename, malicious JavaScript
  code could be executed. This requires a social engineering attack to get the victim into uploading
  a file with a malicious name. The malicious code is solely executed during the upload and
  affects only the user uploading the attachment. While this allows performing actions in the
  name of that user, it seems unlikely that a user wouldn't notice the malicious filename while
  uploading the attachment. This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.21, 15.5.5, 15.10.6 and 16.0.0.
