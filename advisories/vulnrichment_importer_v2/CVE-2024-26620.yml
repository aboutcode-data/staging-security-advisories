  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  s390/vfio-ap: always filter entire AP matrix

  The vfio_ap_mdev_filter_matrix function is called whenever a new adapter or
  domain is assigned to the mdev. The purpose of the function is to update
  the guest's AP configuration by filtering the matrix of adapters and
  domains assigned to the mdev. When an adapter or domain is assigned, only
  the APQNs associated with the APID of the new adapter or APQI of the new
  domain are inspected. If an APQN does not reference a queue device bound to
  the vfio_ap device driver, then it's APID will be filtered from the mdev's
  matrix when updating the guest's AP configuration.

  Inspecting only the APID of the new adapter or APQI of the new domain will
  result in passing AP queues through to a guest that are not bound to the
  vfio_ap device driver under certain circumstances. Consider the following:

  guest's AP configuration (all also assigned to the mdev's matrix):
  14.0004
  14.0005
  14.0006
  16.0004
  16.0005
  16.0006

  unassign domain 4
  unbind queue 16.0005
  assign domain 4

  When domain 4 is re-assigned, since only domain 4 will be inspected, the
  APQNs that will be examined will be:
  14.0004
  16.0004

  Since both of those APQNs reference queue devices that are bound to the
  vfio_ap device driver, nothing will get filtered from the mdev's matrix
  when updating the guest's AP configuration. Consequently, queue 16.0005
  will get passed through despite not being bound to the driver. This
  violates the linux device model requirement that a guest shall only be
  given access to devices bound to the device driver facilitating their
  pass-through.

  To resolve this problem, every adapter and domain assigned to the mdev will
  be inspected when filtering the mdev's matrix.
