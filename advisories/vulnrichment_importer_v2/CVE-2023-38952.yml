aliases: []
summary: Insecure access control in ZKTeco BioTime through 9.0.1 allows authenticated attackers
  to escalate their privileges due to the fact that session ids are not validated for the type
  of user accessing the application by default. Privilege restrictions between non-admin and
  admin users are not enforced and any authenticated user can leverage admin functions without
  restriction by making direct requests to administrative endpoints.
