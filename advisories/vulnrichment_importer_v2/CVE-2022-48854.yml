  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: arc_emac: Fix use after free in arc_mdio_probe()

  If bus->state is equal to MDIOBUS_ALLOCATED, mdiobus_free(bus) will free
  the "bus". But bus->name is still used in the next line, which will lead
  to a use after free.

  We can fix it by putting the name in a local variable and make the
  bus->name point to the rodata section "name",then use the name in the
  error message without referring to bus to avoid the uaf.
