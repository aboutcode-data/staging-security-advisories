aliases: []
summary: Traccar is an open source GPS tracking system. Default installs of Traccar on Windows
  between versions 6.1-  6.8.1 and non default installs between versions 5.8 - 6.0 are vulnerable
  to unauthenticated local file inclusion attacks which can lead to leakage of passwords or
  any file on the file system including the Traccar configuration file. Versions 5.8 - 6.0 are
  only vulnerable if <entry key='web.override'>./override</entry> is set in the configuration
  file. Versions 6.1 - 6.8.1 are vulnerable by default as the web override is enabled by default.
  The vulnerable code is removed in version 6.9.0.
