aliases: []
summary: The Nextcloud Android app is the Android client for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity
  platform. The Nextcloud Android app uses content providers to manage its data. Prior to version
  3.18.1, the providers `FileContentProvider` and `DiskLruImageCacheFileProvider` have security
  issues (an SQL injection, and an insufficient permission control, respectively) that allow
  malicious apps in the same device to access Nextcloud's data bypassing the permission control
  system. Users should upgrade to version 3.18.1 to receive a patch. There are no known workarounds
  aside from upgrading.
