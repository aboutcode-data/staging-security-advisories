aliases: []
summary: The Shariff Wrapper plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the plugin's 'shariff' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 4.6.10 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes such as 'align'. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject
  arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
