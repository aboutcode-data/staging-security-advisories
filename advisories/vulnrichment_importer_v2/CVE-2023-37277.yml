aliases: []
summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications
  built on top of it. The REST API allows executing all actions via POST requests and accepts
  `text/plain`, `multipart/form-data` or `application/www-form-urlencoded` as content types
  which can be sent via regular HTML forms, thus allowing cross-site request forgery. With the
  interaction of a user with programming rights, this allows remote code execution through script
  macros and thus impacts the integrity, availability and confidentiality of the whole XWiki
  installation. For regular cookie-based authentication, the vulnerability is mitigated by SameSite
  cookie restrictions but as of March 2023, these are not enabled by default in Firefox and
  Safari. The vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 14.10.8 and 15.2 by requiring a CSRF token
  header for certain request types that are susceptible to CSRF attacks.
