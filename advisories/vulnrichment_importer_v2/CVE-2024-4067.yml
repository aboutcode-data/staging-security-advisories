aliases: []
summary: The NPM package `micromatch` prior to 4.0.8 is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial
  of Service (ReDoS). The vulnerability occurs in `micromatch.braces()` in `index.js` because
  the pattern `.*` will greedily match anything. By passing a malicious payload, the pattern
  matching will keep backtracking to the input while it doesn't find the closing bracket. As
  the input size increases, the consumption time will also increase until it causes the application
  to hang or slow down. There was a merged fix but further testing shows the issue persists.
  This issue should be mitigated by using a safe pattern that won't start backtracking the regular
  expression due to greedy matching. This issue was fixed in version 4.0.8.
