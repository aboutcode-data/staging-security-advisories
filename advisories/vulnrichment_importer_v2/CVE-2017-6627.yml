aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the UDP processing code of Cisco IOS 15.1, 15.2, and 15.4 and IOS
  XE 3.14 through 3.18 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the input queue
  of an affected system to hold UDP packets, causing an interface queue wedge and a denial of
  service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to Cisco IOS Software application changes
  that create UDP sockets and leave the sockets idle without closing them. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by sending UDP packets with a destination port of 0 to an affected
  device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause UDP packets to be held in the
  input interfaces queue, resulting in a DoS condition. The input interface queue will stop
  holding UDP packets when it receives 250 packets. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCup10024, CSCva55744, CSCva95506.'
