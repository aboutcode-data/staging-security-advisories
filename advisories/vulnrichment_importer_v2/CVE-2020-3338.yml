aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) feature for IPv6 networks
  (PIM6) of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a
  denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper
  error handling when processing inbound PIM6 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending multiple crafted PIM6 packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to cause the PIM6 application to leak system memory. Over time, this memory
  leak could cause the PIM6 application to stop processing legitimate PIM6 traffic, leading
  to a DoS condition on the affected device.
