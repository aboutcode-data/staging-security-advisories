aliases: []
summary: go-ethereum (Geth) is a golang execution layer implementation of the Ethereum protocol.
  Prior to version 1.16.9, through a flaw in the ECIES cryptography implementation, an attacker
  may be able to extract bits of the p2p node key. The issue is resolved in the v1.16.9 and
  v1.17.0 releases of Geth. Geth maintainers recommend rotating the node key after applying
  the upgrade, which can be done by removing the file `<datadir>/geth/nodekey` before starting
  Geth.
