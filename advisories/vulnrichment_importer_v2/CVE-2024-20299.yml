aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the AnyConnect firewall for Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA)
  Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to bypass a configured access control list (ACL) and allow traffic that should
  have been denied to flow through an affected device. This vulnerability is due to a logic
  error in populating group ACLs when an AnyConnect client establishes a new session toward
  an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing an AnyConnect
  connection to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass
  configured ACL rules.
