aliases: []
summary: XWiki is a generic wiki platform. When editing content that contains "dangerous" macros
  like malicious script macros that were authored by a user with fewer rights, XWiki warns about
  the execution of these macros since XWiki 15.9RC1. These required rights analyzers that trigger
  these warnings are incomplete, allowing an attacker to hide malicious content. For most macros,
  the existing analyzers don't consider non-lowercase parameters. Further, most macro parameters
  that can contain XWiki syntax like titles of information boxes weren't analyzed at all. Similarly,
  the "source" parameters of the content and context macro weren't anylzed even though they
  could contain arbitrary XWiki syntax. In the worst case, this could allow a malicious to add
  malicious script macros including Groovy or Python macros to a page that are then executed
  after another user with programming righs edits the page, thus allowing remote code execution.
  The required rights analyzers have been made more robust and extended to cover those cases
  in XWiki 16.4.7, 16.10.3 and 17.0.0.
