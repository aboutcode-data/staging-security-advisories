aliases: []
summary: A mismatch caused by client-triggered server-sent stream resets between HTTP/2 specifications
  and the internal architectures of some HTTP/2 implementations may result in excessive server
  resource consumption leading to denial-of-service (DoS).  By opening streams and then rapidly
  triggering the server to reset them—using malformed frames or flow control errors—an attacker
  can exploit incorrect stream accounting. Streams reset by the server are considered closed
  at the protocol level, even though backend processing continues. This allows a client to cause
  the server to handle an unbounded number of concurrent streams on a single connection. This
  CVE will be updated as affected product details are released.
