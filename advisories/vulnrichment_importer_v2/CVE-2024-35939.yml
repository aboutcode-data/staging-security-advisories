summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  dma-direct: Leak pages on dma_set_decrypted() failure

  On TDX it is possible for the untrusted host to cause
  set_memory_encrypted() or set_memory_decrypted() to fail such that an
  error is returned and the resulting memory is shared. Callers need to
  take care to handle these errors to avoid returning decrypted (shared)
  memory to the page allocator, which could lead to functional or security
  issues.

  DMA could free decrypted/shared pages if dma_set_decrypted() fails. This
  should be a rare case. Just leak the pages in this case instead of
  freeing them.
