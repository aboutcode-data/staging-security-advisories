aliases: []
summary: 'libosdp is an implementation of IEC 60839-11-5 OSDP (Open Supervised Device Protocol)
  and provides a C library with support for C++, Rust and Python3. At ospd_common.c, on the
  osdp_reply_name function, any reply id between REPLY_ACK and REPLY_XRD is valid, but names
  array do not declare all of the range. On a case of an undefined reply id within the range,
  name will be null (name = names[reply_id - REPLY_ACK];). Null name will casue a crash on next
  line: if (name[0] == ''\0'') as null[0] is invalid. As this logic is not limited to a secure
  connection, attacker may trigger this vulnerability without any prior knowledge. This issue
  is fixed in 2.4.0.'
