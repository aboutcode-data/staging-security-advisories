summary: "This vulnerability occurs when a WebSocket endpoint does not enforce \nproper authentication\
  \ mechanisms, allowing unauthorized users to \nestablish connections. As a result, attackers\
  \ can exploit this weakness \nto gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or perform unauthorized\
  \ \nactions. Given that no authentication is required, this can lead to \nprivilege escalation\
  \ and potentially compromise the security of the \nentire system."
