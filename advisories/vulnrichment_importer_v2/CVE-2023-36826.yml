aliases: []
summary: Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform. Starting in version
  8.21.0 and prior to version 23.5.2, an authenticated user can download a debug or artifact
  bundle from arbitrary organizations and projects with a known bundle ID. The user does not
  need to be a member of the organization or have permissions on the project. A patch was issued
  in version 23.5.2 to ensure authorization checks are properly scoped on requests to retrieve
  debug or artifact bundles. Authenticated users who do not have the necessary permissions on
  the particular project are no longer able to download them. Sentry SaaS users do not need
  to take any action. Self-Hosted Sentry users should upgrade to version 23.5.2 or higher.
