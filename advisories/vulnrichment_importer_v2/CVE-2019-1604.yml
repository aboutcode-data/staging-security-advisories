aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the user account management interface of Cisco NX-OS Software could
  allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain elevated privileges on an affected device.
  The vulnerability is due to an incorrect authorization check of user accounts and their associated
  Group ID (GID). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by taking advantage of a logic
  error that will permit the use of higher privileged commands than what is necessarily assigned.
  A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute commands with elevated privileges
  on the underlying Linux shell of an affected device. Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches are
  affected in versions prior to 6.2(22), 8.2(3), and 8.3(2). Nexus 3000 Series Switches are
  affected in versions prior to 7.0(3)I7(4). Nexus 3500 Platform Switches are affected in versions
  prior to 7.0(3)I7(4). Nexus 3600 Platform Switches are affected in versions prior to 7.0(3)F3(5).
