aliases: []
summary: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4.0 expose
  sensitive information to Unauthorized Actors. This issue affects meetings with polls, where
  the attacker is a meeting participant. Subscribing to the current-poll collection does not
  update the client UI, but does give the attacker access to the contents of the collection,
  which include the individual poll responses. This issue is patched in version 2.4.0. There
  are no workarounds.
