aliases: []
summary: Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform. Starting in version
  22.1.0 and prior to version 23.7.2, an attacker with access to a token with few or no scopes
  can query `/api/0/api-tokens/` for a list of all tokens created by a user, including tokens
  with greater scopes, and use those tokens in other requests. There is no evidence that the
  issue was exploited on `sentry.io`. For self-hosted users, it is advised to rotate user auth
  tokens. A fix is available in version 23.7.2 of `sentry` and `self-hosted`. There are no known
  workarounds.
