aliases: []
summary: The File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure
  in all versions up to, and including, 7.2.1 due to insufficient randomness in the backup filenames,
  which use a timestamp plus 4 random digits. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers,
  to extract sensitive data including site backups in configurations where the .htaccess file
  in the directory does not block access.
