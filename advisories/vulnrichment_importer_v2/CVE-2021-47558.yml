  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: stmmac: Disable Tx queues when reconfiguring the interface

  The Tx queues were not disabled in situations where the driver needed to
  stop the interface to apply a new configuration. This could result in a
  kernel panic when doing any of the 3 following actions:
  * reconfiguring the number of queues (ethtool -L)
  * reconfiguring the size of the ring buffers (ethtool -G)
  * installing/removing an XDP program (ip l set dev ethX xdp)

  Prevent the panic by making sure netif_tx_disable is called when stopping
  an interface.

  Without this patch, the following kernel panic can be observed when doing
  any of the actions above:

  Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffff80001238d040
