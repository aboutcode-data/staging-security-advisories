aliases: []
summary: NMIS/BioDose V22.02 and previous versions rely on a common SQL Server user account
  to access data in the database. User access in the client application is restricted by a password
  authentication check in the client software but the underlying database connection always
  has access. The latest version of NMIS/BioDose introduces an option to use Windows user authentication
  with the database, which would restrict this database connection.
