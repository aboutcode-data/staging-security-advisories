aliases: []
summary: "Multiple instances of an Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS\
  \ Command ('OS Command Injection') \n\nvulnerability in the CLI of Juniper Networks Junos\
  \ OS Evolved could be used to elevate privileges and/or execute unauthorized commands.\n\n\
  When an attacker executes crafted CLI commands, the options are processed via a script in\
  \ some cases. These scripts are not hardened so injected commands might be executed via the\
  \ shell, which allows an attacker to perform operations, which they should not be able to\
  \ do according to their assigned permissions.\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS Evolved:\n\n\n\
  \n  *  24.2 versions before 24.2R2-S2-EVO,\n  *  24.4 versions before 24.4R2-EVO.\n\n\n\n\n\
  This issue does not affect Junos OS Evolved versions earlier than 24.2R1-EVO."
