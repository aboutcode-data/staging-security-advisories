aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the bidirectional forwarding detection (BFD) hardware offload feature
  of Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers, ASR 9902
  Compact High-Performance Routers, and ASR 9903 Compact High-Performance Routers could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a line card to reset, resulting in a denial of
  service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of malformed
  BFD packets that are received on line cards where the BFD hardware offload feature is enabled.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv4 BFD packet to an affected
  device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause line card exceptions or a hard
  reset, resulting in loss of traffic over that line card while the line card reloads.
