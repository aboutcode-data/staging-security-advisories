aliases: []
summary: The Wizit Gateway for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated
  Arbitrary Order Cancellation in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.9. This is due to a
  lack of authentication and authorization checks in the 'handle_checkout_redirecturl_response'
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to cancel arbitrary WooCommerce
  orders by sending a crafted request with a valid order ID.
