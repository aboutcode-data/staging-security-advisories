aliases: []
summary: The Metform Elementor Contact Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
  Cross-Site Scripting via text areas on forms in versions up to, and including, 3.1.2 due to
  insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
  an injected page, which is the submissions page.
