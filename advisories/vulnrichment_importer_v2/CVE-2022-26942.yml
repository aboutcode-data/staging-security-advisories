aliases: []
summary: The Motorola MTM5000 series firmwares lack pointer validation on arguments passed to
  trusted execution environment (TEE) modules. Two modules are used, one responsible for KVL
  key management and the other for TETRA cryptographic functionality. In both modules, an adversary
  with non-secure supervisor level code execution can exploit the issue in order to gain secure
  supervisor code execution within the TEE. This constitutes a full break of the TEE module,
  exposing the device key as well as any TETRA cryptographic keys and the confidential TETRA
  cryptographic primitives.
