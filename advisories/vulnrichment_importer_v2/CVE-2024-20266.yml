aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the DHCP version 4 (DHCPv4) server feature of Cisco IOS XR Software\
  \ could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a crash of the dhcpd process,\
  \ resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r This vulnerability exists because\
  \ certain DHCPv4 messages are improperly validated when they are processed by an affected\
  \ device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed DHCPv4 message\
  \ to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a crash of\
  \ the dhcpd process. While the dhcpd process is restarting, which may take approximately two\
  \ minutes, DHCPv4 server services are unavailable on the affected device. This could temporarily\
  \ prevent network access to clients that join the network during that time period and rely\
  \ on the DHCPv4 server of the affected device.\r\n\r Notes: \r\n\r \r Only the dhcpd process\
  \ crashes and eventually restarts automatically. The router does not reload.\r This vulnerability\
  \ only applies to DHCPv4. DHCP version 6 (DHCPv6) is not affected."
