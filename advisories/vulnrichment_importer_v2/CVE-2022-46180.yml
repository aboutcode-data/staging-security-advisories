aliases: []
summary: Discourse Mermaid (discourse-mermaid-theme-component) allows users of Discourse, open-source
  forum software, to create graphs using the Mermaid syntax. Users of discourse-mermaid-theme-component
  version 1.0.0 who can create posts are able to inject arbitrary HTML on that post. The issue
  has been fixed on the `main` branch of the GitHub repository, with 1.1.0 named as a patched
  version. Admins can update the theme component through the admin UI. As a workaround, admins
  can temporarily disable discourse-mermaid-theme-component.
