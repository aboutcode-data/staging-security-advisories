summary: |
  Dokploy is a self-hostable Platform as a Service (PaaS) that simplifies the deployment and management of applications and databases. An authenticated, low-privileged user can run arbitrary OS commands on the Dokploy host. The tRPC procedure
  docker.getContainersByAppNameMatch interpolates the attacker-supplied appName value into a Docker CLI call without sanitisation, enabling command injection under the Dokploy service account. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.23.7.
