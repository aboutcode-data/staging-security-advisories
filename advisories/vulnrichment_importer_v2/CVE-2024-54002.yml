aliases: []
summary: Dependency-Track is a Component Analysis platform that allows organizations to identify
  and reduce risk in the software supply chain. Performing a login request against the /api/v1/user/login
  endpoint with a username that exist in the system takes significantly longer than performing
  the same action with a username that is not known by the system. The observable difference
  in request duration can be leveraged by actors to enumerate valid names of managed users.
  LDAP and OpenID Connect users are not affected. The issue has been fixed in Dependency-Track
  4.12.2.
