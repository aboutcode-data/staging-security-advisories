aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in the MustGather.managed.openshift.io Custom Defined Resource (CRD)
  of OpenShift Dedicated. A non-privileged user on the cluster can create a MustGather object
  with a specially crafted file and set the most privileged service account to run the job.
  This can allow a standard developer user to escalate their privileges to a cluster administrator
  and pivot to the AWS environment.
