aliases: []
summary: The ArchiveReader.extractContents() function used by cctl image load and container
  image load performs no pathname validation before extracting an archive member. This means
  that a carelessly or maliciously constructed archive can extract a file into any user-writable
  location on the system using relative pathnames. This issue is addressed in container 0.8.0
  and containerization 0.21.0.
