aliases: []
summary: The Zox News theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data
  that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check on the 'backup_options'
  and 'restore_options' function in all versions up to, and including, 3.16.0. This makes it
  possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary
  options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration
  to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access
  to a vulnerable site.
