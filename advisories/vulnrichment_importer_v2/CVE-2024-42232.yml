  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  libceph: fix race between delayed_work() and ceph_monc_stop()

  The way the delayed work is handled in ceph_monc_stop() is prone to
  races with mon_fault() and possibly also finish_hunting().  Both of
  these can requeue the delayed work which wouldn't be canceled by any of
  the following code in case that happens after cancel_delayed_work_sync()
  runs -- __close_session() doesn't mess with the delayed work in order
  to avoid interfering with the hunting interval logic.  This part was
  missed in commit b5d91704f53e ("libceph: behave in mon_fault() if
  cur_mon < 0") and use-after-free can still ensue on monc and objects
  that hang off of it, with monc->auth and monc->monmap being
  particularly susceptible to quickly being reused.

  To fix this:

  - clear monc->cur_mon and monc->hunting as part of closing the session
    in ceph_monc_stop()
  - bail from delayed_work() if monc->cur_mon is cleared, similar to how
    it's done in mon_fault() and finish_hunting() (based on monc->hunting)
  - call cancel_delayed_work_sync() after the session is closed
