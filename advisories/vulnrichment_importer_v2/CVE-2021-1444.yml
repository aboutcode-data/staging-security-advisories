summary: "A vulnerability in the web services interface of Cisco&nbsp;Adaptive Security Appliance\
  \ (ASA) Software and Cisco&nbsp;Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated,\
  \ remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against a user of the interface.\r\

  \ access sensitive, browser-based information.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that\
  \ address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.This\
  \ advisory is part of the October 2021 release of the Cisco&nbsp;ASA, FTD, and FMC Security\
