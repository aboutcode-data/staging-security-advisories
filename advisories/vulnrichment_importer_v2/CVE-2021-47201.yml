aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  iavf: free q_vectors before queues in iavf_disable_vf

  iavf_free_queues() clears adapter->num_active_queues, which
  iavf_free_q_vectors() relies on, so swap the order of these two function
  calls in iavf_disable_vf(). This resolves a panic encountered when the
  interface is disabled and then later brought up again after PF
  communication is restored.
