aliases: []
summary: Anubis is a Web AI Firewall Utility that challenges users' connections in order to
  protect upstream resources from scraper bots. Prior to version 1.23.0, when using subrequest
  authentication, Anubis did not perform validation of the redirect URL and redirects user to
  any URL scheme. While most modern browsers do not allow a redirect to `javascript:` URLs,
  it could still trigger dangerous behavior in some cases. Anybody with a subrequest authentication
  may be affected. Version 1.23.0 contains a fix for the issue.
