  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net/mlx5e: SHAMPO, Fix invalid WQ linked list unlink

  When all the strides in a WQE have been consumed, the WQE is unlinked
  from the WQ linked list (mlx5_wq_ll_pop()). For SHAMPO, it is possible
  to receive CQEs with 0 consumed strides for the same WQE even after the
  WQE is fully consumed and unlinked. This triggers an additional unlink
  for the same wqe which corrupts the linked list.

  Fix this scenario by accepting 0 sized consumed strides without
  unlinking the WQE again.
