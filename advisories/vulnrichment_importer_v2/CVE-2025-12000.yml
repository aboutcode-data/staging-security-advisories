aliases: []
summary: The WPFunnels plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to
  insufficient file path validation in the wpfnl_delete_log() function in all versions up to,
  and including, 3.6.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level
  access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote
  code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
