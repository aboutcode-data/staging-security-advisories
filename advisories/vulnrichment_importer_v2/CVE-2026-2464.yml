aliases: []
summary: Path traversal vulnerability in the AMR Printer Management 1.01 Beta web service, which
  allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files from the underlying Windows system by using
  specially crafted path traversal sequences in requests directed to the web management service.
  The service is accessible without authentication and runs with elevated privileges, amplifying
  the impact of the vulnerability. An attacker can exploit this condition to access sensitive
  and privileged files on the system using path traversal payloads. Successful exploitation
  of this vulnerability could lead to the unauthorized disclosure of internal system information,
  compromising the confidentiality of the affected environment.
