aliases: []
summary: |
  When decoding a frame for a SANM file (ANIM v0 variant), the decoded data can be larger than the buffer allocated for it.

  Frames encoded with codec 48 can specify their resolution (width x height). A buffer of appropriate size is allocated depending on the resolution.

  This codec can encode the frame contents using a run-length encoding algorithm. There are no checks that the decoded frame fits in the allocated buffer, leading to a heap-buffer-overflow.

  process_frame_obj initializes the buffers based on the frame resolution:



  We recommend upgrading to version 8.0 or beyond.
