aliases: []
summary: The CleverDisplay BlueOne hardware player is designed with its USB interfaces physically
  enclosed and inaccessible under normal operating conditions. Researchers demonstrated that,
  after cicumventing the device’s protective enclosure, it was possible to connect a USB keyboard
  and press ESC during boot to access the BIOS setup interface. BIOS settings could be viewed
  but not modified. This behavior slightly increases the attack surface by exposing internal
  system information (CWE-1244) once the enclosure is removed, but does not allow integrity
  or availability compromise under standard or tested configurations.
