aliases: []
summary: Airbyte is a data integration platform for ELT pipelines. Airbyte connection builder
  docker image is vulnerable to RCE via SSTI which allows an authenticated remote attacker to
  execute arbitrary code on the server as the web server user. The connection builder is used
  to create and test new connectors. Sensitive information, such as credentials, could be exposed
  if a user tested a new connector on a compromised instance. The connection builder does not
  have access to any data processes. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.62.2.
