aliases: []
summary: Skipper is an HTTP router and reverse proxy for service composition. The default skipper
  configuration before 0.23.0 was -lua-sources=inline,file. The problem starts if untrusted
  users can create lua filters, because of -lua-sources=inline , for example through a Kubernetes
  Ingress resource. The configuration inline allows these user to create a script that is able
  to read the filesystem accessible to the skipper process and if the user has access to read
  the logs, they an read skipper secrets. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.23.0.
