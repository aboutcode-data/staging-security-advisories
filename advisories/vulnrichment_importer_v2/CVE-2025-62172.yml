aliases: []
summary: Home Assistant is open source home automation software that puts local control and
  privacy first. In versions 2025.1.0 through 2025.10.1, the energy dashboard is vulnerable
  to stored cross-site scripting. An authenticated user can inject malicious JavaScript code
  into an energy entity's name field, which is then executed when any user hovers over data
  points in the energy dashboard graph tooltips. The vulnerability exists because entity names
  containing HTML are not properly sanitized before being rendered in graph tooltips. This could
  allow an attacker with authentication to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of other
  users' sessions. Additionally, if an energy provider (such as Tibber) supplies a malicious
  default name for an entity, the vulnerability can be exploited without direct user action
  when the default name is used. This issue has been patched in version 2025.10.2. No known
  workarounds exist.
