summary: The WPBakery Page Builder for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
  Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's Grid Builder feature in all versions up to, and including,
  8.4.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to
  inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page.
