aliases: []
summary: Izanami is a shared configuration service well-suited for micro-service architecture
  implementation. Attackers can bypass the authentication in this application when deployed
  using the official Docker image. Because a hard coded secret is used to sign the authentication
  token (JWT), an attacker could compromise another instance of Izanami. This issue has been
  patched in version 1.11.0.
