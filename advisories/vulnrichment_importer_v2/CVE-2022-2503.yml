aliases: []
summary: Dm-verity is used for extending root-of-trust to root filesystems. LoadPin builds on
  this property to restrict module/firmware loads to just the trusted root filesystem. Device-mapper
  table reloads currently allow users with root privileges to switch out the target with an
  equivalent dm-linear target and bypass verification till reboot. This allows root to bypass
  LoadPin and can be used to load untrusted and unverified kernel modules and firmware, which
  implies arbitrary kernel execution and persistence for peripherals that do not verify firmware
  updates. We recommend upgrading past commit 4caae58406f8ceb741603eee460d79bacca9b1b5
