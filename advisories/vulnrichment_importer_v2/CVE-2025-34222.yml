aliases: []
summary: 'Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host prior to version 22.0.1049 and
  Application prior to version 20.0.2786 (VA/SaaS deployments) expose four admin routes – /admin/hp/cert_upload,
  /admin/hp/cert_delete, /admin/certs/ca, and /admin/certs/serviceclients/{scid} – without any
  authentication check. The routes are defined in the /var/www/app/routes/web.php file inside
  the printercloud/pi Docker container and are handled by the HPCertificateController class,
  which performs no user validation.  An unauthenticated attacker can therefore upload a new
  TLS/SSL certificate replacing the trusted root used by the appliance, delete an existing certificate
  causing immediate loss of trust for services that rely on it, or download any stored CA or
  client certificate via the service‑clients endpoint which also suffers an IDOR that allows
  enumeration of all client IDs. This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2024-028
  — Unauthenticated Admin APIs Used to Modify SSL Certificates.'
