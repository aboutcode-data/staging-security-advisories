summary: |
  An Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input vulnerability in the packet forwarding engine (pfe) Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX5000 Series allows an unauthenticated, network based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (Dos).

  When a non-clustered SRX5000 device receives a specifically malformed packet this will cause a flowd crash and restart.

  This issue affects Junos OS:

    *  22.1 releases 22.1R1 and later before 22.2R3-S5,
    *  22.3 releases before 22.3R3-S4,
    *  22.4 releases before 22.4R3-S4,
    *  23.2 releases before 23.2R2-S2,
    *  23.4 releases before 23.4R2-S1,
    *  24.2 releases before 24.2R1-S1, 24.2R2.


  Please note that the PR does indicate that earlier versions have been fixed as well, but these won't be adversely impacted by this.
