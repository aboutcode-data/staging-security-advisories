aliases: []
summary: The PowerPack Lite for Beaver Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected
  Cross-Site Scripting via the navigate parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.0.5
  due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick
  an administrative user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
