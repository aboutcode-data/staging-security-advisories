aliases: []
summary: 1Panel is a web interface and MCP Server that manages websites, files, containers,
  databases, and LLMs on a Linux server. In versions 2.0.5 and below, the HTTPS protocol used
  for communication between the Core and Agent endpoints has incomplete certificate verification
  during certificate validation, leading to unauthorized interface access. Due to the presence
  of numerous command execution or high-privilege interfaces in 1Panel, this results in Remote
  Code Execution (RCE). This is fixed in version 2.0.6. The CVE has been translated from Simplified
  Chinese using GitHub Copilot.
