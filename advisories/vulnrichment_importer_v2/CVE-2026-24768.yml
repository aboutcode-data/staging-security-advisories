aliases: []
summary: NocoDB is software for building databases as spreadsheets. Prior to version 0.301.0,
  an unvalidated redirect (open redirect) vulnerability exists in NocoDB’s login flow due to
  missing validation of the `continueAfterSignIn` parameter. During authentication, NocoDB processes
  a user-controlled redirect value and conditionally performs client-side navigation without
  enforcing any restrictions on the destination’s origin, domain or protocol. This allows attackers
  to redirect authenticated users to arbitrary external websites after login. This vulnerability
  enables phishing attacks by leveraging user trust in the legitimate NocoDB login flow. While
  it does not directly expose credentials or bypass authentication, it increases the likelihood
  of credential theft through social engineering. The issue does not allow arbitrary code execution
  or privilege escalation, but it undermines authentication integrity. Version 0.301.0 fixes
  the issue.
