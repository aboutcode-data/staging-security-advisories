aliases: []
summary: A command injection vulnerability exists in the `TranscriptEndpoint` of mudler/localai,
  specifically within the `audioToWav` function used for converting audio files to WAV format
  for transcription. The vulnerability arises due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied
  filenames before passing them to ffmpeg via a shell command, allowing an attacker to execute
  arbitrary commands on the host system. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized
  access, data breaches, or other detrimental impacts, depending on the privileges of the process
  executing the code.
