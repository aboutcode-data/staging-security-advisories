aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the password reset workflow of the Touch Lebanon Mobile App 2.20.2
  allows an attacker to bypass the OTP reset password mechanism. By manipulating the reset process,
  an unauthorized user may be able to reset the password and gain access to the account without
  needing to provide a legitimate authentication factor, such as an OTP. This compromises account
  security and allows for potential unauthorized access to user data.
