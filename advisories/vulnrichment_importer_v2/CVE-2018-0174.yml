aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the DHCP option 82 encapsulation functionality of Cisco IOS Software
  and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected
  device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability exists
  because the affected software performs incomplete input validation of option 82 information
  that it receives in DHCP Version 4 (DHCPv4) packets from DHCP relay agents. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DHCPv4 packet to an affected device. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS
  condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCuh91645.'
