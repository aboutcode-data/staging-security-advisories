summary: The Beaver Builder – WordPress Page Builder for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the 'caption' parameter added to images via the media uploader in versions up
  to, and including, 2.5.5.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This
  makes it possible for authenticated attackers with access to the Beaver Builder editor and
  the ability to upload media files to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute
  whenever a user accesses an injected page.
