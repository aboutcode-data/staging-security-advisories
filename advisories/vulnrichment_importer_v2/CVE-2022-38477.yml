summary: Mozilla developer Nika Layzell and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety
  bugs present in Firefox 103 and Firefox ESR 102.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
  corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited
  to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.2, Thunderbird < 102.2,
  and Firefox < 104.
