aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the cryptographic hardware accelerator driver of Cisco Adaptive
  Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could
  allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting
  in a temporary denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability exists because the affected
  devices have a limited amount of Direct Memory Access (DMA) memory and the affected software
  improperly handles resources in low-memory conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a sustained, high rate of malicious traffic to an affected device to exhaust memory
  on the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust DMA memory on the
  affected device, which could cause the device to reload and result in a temporary DoS condition.
