aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability identified in the Trellix HX Agent driver file  fekern.sys allowed
  a threat actor with local user access the ability to gain elevated system privileges.  Utilization
  of a Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) was leveraged to gain access to the critical
  Windows process memory lsass.exe (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service).  The fekern.sys;
  a driver file associated with Trellix HX Agent (used in all existing HX Agent versions).   
  The vulnerable driver installed in a product or a system running fully functional HX Agent
  is, itself, not exploitable as the product’s tamper protection restricts the ability to communicate
  with the driver to only the agent’s processes.
