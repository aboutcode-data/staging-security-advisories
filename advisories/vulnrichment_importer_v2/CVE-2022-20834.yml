aliases: []
summary: "Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower\
  \ Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct\
  \ a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface of an affected\
  \ device.\r\n     \r\nThese vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied\
  \ input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities\
  \ by inserting crafted input into various data fields in an affected interface. A successful\
  \ exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the\
  \ interface, or access sensitive, browser-based information. In some cases, it is also possible\
  \ to cause a temporary availability impact to portions of the FMC Dashboard."
