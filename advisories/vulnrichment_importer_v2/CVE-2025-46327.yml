aliases: []
summary: gosnowflake is the Snowflake Golang driver. Versions starting from 1.7.0 to before
  1.13.3, are vulnerable to a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition. When using
  the Easy Logging feature on Linux and macOS, the Driver reads logging configuration from a
  user-provided file. On Linux and macOS the Driver verifies that the configuration file can
  be written to only by its owner. That check was vulnerable to a TOCTOU race condition and
  failed to verify that the file owner matches the user running the Driver. This could allow
  a local attacker with write access to the configuration file or the directory containing it
  to overwrite the configuration and gain control over logging level and output location. This
  issue has been patched in version 1.13.3.
