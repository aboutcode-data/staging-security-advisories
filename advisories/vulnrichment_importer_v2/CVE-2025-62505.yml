aliases: []
summary: LobeChat is an open source chat application platform. The web-crawler package in LobeChat
  version 1.136.1 allows server-side request forgery (SSRF) in the tools.search.crawlPages tRPC
  endpoint. A client can supply an arbitrary urls array together with impls containing the value
  naive. The service passes the user URLs to Crawler.crawl and the naive implementation performs
  a server-side fetch of each supplied URL without validating or restricting internal network
  addresses (such as localhost, 127.0.0.1, private IP ranges, or cloud instance metadata endpoints).
  This allows an attacker with a valid user token (or in development mode using a bypass header)
  to make the server disclose responses from internal HTTP services, potentially exposing internal
  API data or cloud metadata credentials. Version 1.136.2 fixes the issue. Update to version
  1.136.2. No known workarounds exist.
