aliases: []
summary: Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. Prior to version 2.0.55, Claude Code failed
  to properly validate commands using piped sed operations with the echo command, allowing attackers
  to bypass file write restrictions. This vulnerability enabled writing to sensitive directories
  like the .claude folder and paths outside the project scope. Exploiting this required the
  ability to execute commands through Claude Code with the "accept edits" feature enabled. This
  issue has been patched in version 2.0.55.
