aliases: []
summary: Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime with secure defaults. When
  you send a request with the Authorization header to one domain, and the response asks to redirect
  to a different domain, Deno'sfetch() redirect handling creates a follow-up redirect request
  that keeps the original Authorization header, leaking its content to that second domain. This
  vulnerability is fixed in 2.1.2.
