aliases: []
summary: quic-go is an implementation of the QUIC protocol in Go. In versions prior to 0.49.0,
  0.54.1, and 0.55.0, a misbehaving or malicious server can cause a denial-of-service (DoS)
  attack on the quic-go client by triggering an assertion failure, leading to a process crash.
  This requires no authentication and can be exploited during the handshake phase. This was
  observed in the wild with certain server implementations. quic-go needs to be able to handle
  misbehaving server implementations, including those that prematurely send a HANDSHAKE_DONE
  frame. Versions 0.49.0, 0.54.1, and 0.55.0 discard Initial keys when receiving a HANDSHAKE_DONE
  frame, thereby correctly handling premature HANDSHAKE_DONE frames.
