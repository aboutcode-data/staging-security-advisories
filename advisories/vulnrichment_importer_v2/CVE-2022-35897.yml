aliases: []
summary: An stack buffer overflow vulnerability leads to arbitrary code execution issue was
  discovered in Insyde InsydeH2O with kernel 5.0 through 5.5. If the attacker modifies specific
  UEFI variables, it can cause a stack overflow, leading to arbitrary code execution. The specific
  variables are normally locked (read-only) at the OS level and therefore an attack would require
  direct SPI modification. If an attacker can change the values of at least two variables out
  of three (SecureBootEnforce, SecureBoot, RestoreBootSettings), it is possible to execute arbitrary
  code.
