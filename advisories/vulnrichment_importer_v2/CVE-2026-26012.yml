aliases: []
summary: vaultwarden is an unofficial Bitwarden compatible server written in Rust, formerly
  known as bitwarden_rs. Prior to 1.35.3, a regular organization member can retrieve all ciphers
  within an organization, regardless of collection permissions. The endpoint /ciphers/organization-details
  is accessible to any organization member and internally uses Cipher::find_by_org to retrieve
  all ciphers. These ciphers are returned with CipherSyncType::Organization without enforcing
  collection-level access control. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.35.3.
