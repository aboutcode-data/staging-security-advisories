aliases: []
summary: PAM-PKCS#11 is a Linux-PAM login module that allows a X.509 certificate based user
  login. In versions 0.6.12 and prior, the pam_pkcs11 module segfaults when a user presses ctrl-c/ctrl-d
  when they are asked for a PIN. When a user enters no PIN at all, `pam_get_pwd` will never
  initialize the password buffer pointer and as such `cleanse` will try to dereference an uninitialized
  pointer. On my system this pointer happens to have the value 3 most of the time when running
  sudo and as such it will segfault. The most likely impact to a system affected by this issue
  is an availability impact due to a daemon that uses PAM crashing. As of time of publication,
  a patch for the issue is unavailable.
