summary: "Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS XE Software of could allow an authenticated,\
  \ local attacker with level-15 privileges or an unauthenticated attacker with physical access\
  \ to the device to execute persistent code at boot time and break the chain of trust.\r\n\r\
  \ These vulnerabilities are due path traversal and improper image integrity validation.  A\
  \ successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute persistent code on the underlying\
  \ operating system.\r\n\r Because this allows the attacker to bypass a major security feature\
  \ of the device, Cisco has raised the Security Impact Rating (SIR) of this advisory from Medium\
  \ to High.\r\n\r For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details [\"#details\"\
  ] section of this advisory.\r\n\r   \r\n\r  \r\n\r  \r\n\r ERP"
