datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2021/27xxx/CVE-2021-27471.json
aliases: []
summary: The parsing mechanism that processes certain file types does not provide input sanitization
  for file paths. This may allow an attacker to craft malicious files that, when opened by Rockwell
  Automation Connected Components Workbench v12.00.00 and prior, can traverse the file system.
  If successfully exploited, an attacker could overwrite existing files and create additional
  files with the same permissions of the Connected Components Workbench software. User interaction
  is required for this exploit to be successful.
