  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ixgbe: fix incorrect map used in eee linkmode

  incorrectly used ixgbe_lp_map in loops intended to populate the
  supported and advertised EEE linkmode bitmaps based on ixgbe_ls_map.
  This results in incorrect bit setting and potential out-of-bounds
  access, since ixgbe_lp_map and ixgbe_ls_map have different sizes
  and purposes.

  ixgbe_lp_map[i] -> ixgbe_ls_map[i]

  Use ixgbe_ls_map for supported and advertised linkmodes, and keep
  ixgbe_lp_map usage only for link partner (lp_advertised) mapping.
