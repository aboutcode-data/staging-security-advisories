aliases: []
summary: LIBPNG is a reference library for use in applications that read, create, and manipulate
  PNG (Portable Network Graphics) raster image files. Prior to 1.6.55, an out-of-bounds read
  vulnerability exists in the png_set_quantize() API function. When the function is called with
  no histogram and the number of colors in the palette is more than twice the maximum supported
  by the user's display, certain palettes will cause the function to enter into an infinite
  loop that reads past the end of an internal heap-allocated buffer. The images that trigger
  this vulnerability are valid per the PNG specification. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.6.55.
