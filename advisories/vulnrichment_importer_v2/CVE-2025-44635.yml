aliases: []
summary: There are multiple unauthorized remote command execution vulnerabilities in the H3C
  ER2200G2, ERG2-450W, ERG2-1200W, ERG2-1350W, NR1200W series routers before ERG2AW-MNW100-R1117;
  H3C ER3100G2, ER3200G2, ER3260G2, ER5100G2, ER5200G2, ER6300G2, ER8300G2, ER8300G2-X series
  routers before ERHMG2-MNW100-R1126; GR3200, GR5200, GR8300 and other series routers before
  MiniGR1B0V100R018L50; GR-1800AX before MiniGRW1B0V100R009L50; GR-3000AX before SWBRW1A0V100R007L50;
  and GR-5400AX before SWBRW1B0V100R009L50. Attackers can bypass authentication by including
  specially crafted text in the request URL or message header, and then inject arbitrary malicious
  commands into some fields related to ACL access control list and user group functions and
  execute to obtain the highest ROOT privileges of remote devices, thereby completely taking
  over the remote target devices.
