aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the health check RPM of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to access the Redis instance that is running within the NOSi container. This
  vulnerability exists because the health check RPM opens TCP port 6379 by default upon activation.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the Redis instance on the open
  port. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to write to the Redis in-memory database,
  write arbitrary files to the container filesystem, and retrieve information about the Redis
  database. Given the configuration of the sandboxed container that the Redis instance runs
  in, a remote attacker would be unable to execute remote code or abuse the integrity of the
  Cisco IOS XR Software host system.
