aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the process of uploading new application images to Cisco FXOS on
  the Cisco Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) and Firepower 9300 Security
  Appliance could allow an authenticated, remote attacker using path traversal techniques to
  create or overwrite arbitrary files on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  validation during the application image upload process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by creating an application image containing malicious code and installing the image on the
  affected device using the CLI or web-based user interface (web UI). These actions occur prior
  to signature verification and could allow the attacker to create and execute arbitrary code
  with root privileges. Note: A missing or invalid signature in the application image will cause
  the upload process to fail, but does not prevent the exploit. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc21901.'
