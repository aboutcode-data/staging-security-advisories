aliases: []
summary: 'It is possible to manipulate the JWT token without the knowledge of the JWT secret
  and authenticate without valid JWT token as any user. This is happening only in the situation
  when zOSMF doesn’t have the APAR PH12143 applied. This issue affects: 1.16 versions to 1.19.
  What happens is that the services using the ZAAS client or the API ML API to query will be
  deceived into believing the information in the JWT token is valid when it isn’t. It’s possible
  to use this to persuade the southbound service that different user is authenticated.'
