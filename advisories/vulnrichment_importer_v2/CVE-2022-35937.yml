aliases: []
summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The `GatherNd` function
  takes arguments that determine the sizes of inputs and outputs. If the inputs given are greater
  than or equal to the sizes of the outputs, an out-of-bounds memory read is triggered. This
  issue has been patched in GitHub commit 595a65a3e224a0362d7e68c2213acfc2b499a196. The fix
  will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1,
  TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported
  range. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
