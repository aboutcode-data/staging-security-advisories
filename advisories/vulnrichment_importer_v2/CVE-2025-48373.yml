aliases: []
summary: Schule is open-source school management system software. The application relies on
  client-side JavaScript (index.js) to redirect users to different panels based on their role.
  Prior to version 1.0.1, this implementation poses a serious security risk because it assumes
  that the value of data.role is trustworthy on the client side. Attackers can manipulate JavaScript
  in the browser (e.g., via browser dev tools or intercepting API responses) and set data.role
  to any arbitrary value (e.g., "admin"), gaining unauthorized access to restricted areas of
  the application.
