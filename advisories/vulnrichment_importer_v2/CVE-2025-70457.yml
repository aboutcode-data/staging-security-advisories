aliases: []
summary: A Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in Sourcecodester Modern Image Gallery
  App v1.0 within the gallery/upload.php component. The application fails to properly validate
  uploaded file contents. Additionally, the application preserves the user-supplied file extension
  during the save process. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to upload arbitrary PHP code
  by spoofing the MIME type as an image, leading to full system compromise.
