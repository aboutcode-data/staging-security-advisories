summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 100,
  300, and 500 Series Wireless APs could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform
  command injection attacks against an affected device. In order to exploit this vulnerability,
  the attacker must have valid administrative credentials for the device. This vulnerability
  is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web-based management interface of an affected device.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on
  the underlying operating system.
