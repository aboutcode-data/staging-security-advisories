  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  kvm: s390: Reject memory region operations for ucontrol VMs

  This change rejects the KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION and
  KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION2 ioctls when called on a ucontrol VM.
  This is necessary since ucontrol VMs have kvm->arch.gmap set to 0 and
  would thus result in a null pointer dereference further in.
  Memory management needs to be performed in userspace and using the
  ioctls KVM_S390_UCAS_MAP and KVM_S390_UCAS_UNMAP.

  Also improve s390 specific documentation for KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION
  and KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION2.
