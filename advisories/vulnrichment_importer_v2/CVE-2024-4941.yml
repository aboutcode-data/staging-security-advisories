aliases: []
summary: A local file inclusion vulnerability exists in the JSON component of gradio-app/gradio
  version 4.25. The vulnerability arises from improper input validation in the `postprocess()`
  function within `gradio/components/json_component.py`, where a user-controlled string is parsed
  as JSON. If the parsed JSON object contains a `path` key, the specified file is moved to a
  temporary directory, making it possible to retrieve it later via the `/file=..` endpoint.
  This issue is due to the `processing_utils.move_files_to_cache()` function traversing any
  object passed to it, looking for a dictionary with a `path` key, and then copying the specified
  file to a temporary directory. The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to read files
  on the remote system, posing a significant security risk.
