aliases: []
summary: TenderDocTransfer developed by Chunghwa Telecom has a Arbitrary File Copy and Paste
  vulnerability.  The application sets up a simple local web server and provides APIs for communication
  with the target website. Due to the lack of CSRF protection in the APIs, unauthenticated remote
  attackers could use these APIs through phishing. Additionally, one of the APIs contains an
  Absolute Path Traversal vulnerability. Attackers can copy arbitrary files on the user's system
  and paste them into any path, which poses a potential risk of information leakage or could
  consume hard drive space by copying files in large volumes.
