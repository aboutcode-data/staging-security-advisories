  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  firmware: qcom: uefisecapp: Fix deadlock in qcuefi_acquire()

  If the __qcuefi pointer is not set, then in the original code, we would
  hold onto the lock.  That means that if we tried to set it later, then
  it would cause a deadlock.  Drop the lock on the error path.  That's
  what all the callers are expecting.
