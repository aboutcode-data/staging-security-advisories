summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager,\
  \ formerly Cisco SD-WAN vManage, could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct\
  \ a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability\
  \ exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied\
  \ input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious data into a specific\
  \ data field in an affected interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute\
  \ arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface."
