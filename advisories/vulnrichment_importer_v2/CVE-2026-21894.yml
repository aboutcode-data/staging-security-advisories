aliases: []
summary: n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. In versions from 0.150.0 to before
  2.2.2, an authentication bypass vulnerability in the Stripe Trigger node allows unauthenticated
  parties to trigger workflows by sending forged Stripe webhook events. The Stripe Trigger creates
  and stores a Stripe webhook signing secret when registering the webhook endpoint, but incoming
  webhook requests were not verified against this secret. As a result, any HTTP client that
  knows the webhook URL could send a POST request containing a matching event type, causing
  the workflow to execute as if a legitimate Stripe event had been received. This issue affects
  n8n users who have active workflows using the Stripe Trigger node. An attacker could potentially
  fake payment or subscription events and influence downstream workflow behavior. The practical
  risk is reduced by the fact that the webhook URL contains a high-entropy UUID; however, authenticated
  n8n users with access to the workflow can view this webhook ID. This issue has been patched
  in version 2.2.2. A temporary workaround for this issue involves users deactivating affected
  workflows or restricting access to workflows containing Stripe Trigger nodes to trusted users
  only.
