  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/i915/gem: Fix Virtual Memory mapping boundaries calculation

  Calculating the size of the mapped area as the lesser value
  between the requested size and the actual size does not consider
  the partial mapping offset. This can cause page fault access.

  Fix the calculation of the starting and ending addresses, the
  total size is now deduced from the difference between the end and
  start addresses.

  Additionally, the calculations have been rewritten in a clearer
  and more understandable form.
