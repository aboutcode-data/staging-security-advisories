summary: A certain software build for the Orbic Maui device (Orbic/RC545L/RC545L:10/ORB545L_V1.4.2_BVZPP/230106:user/release-keys)
  leaks the IMEI and the ICCID to system properties that can be accessed by any local app on
  the device without any permissions or special privileges. Google restricted third-party apps
  from directly obtaining non-resettable device identifiers in Android 10 and higher, but in
  this instance they are leaked by a high-privilege process and can be obtained indirectly.
  This malicious app reads from the "persist.sys.verizon_test_plan_imei" system property to
  indirectly obtain the IMEI and reads the "persist.sys.verizon_test_plan_iccid" system property
  to obtain the ICCID.
