aliases: []
summary: The WPS Hide Login plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Login Page Disclosure in all
  versions up to, and including, 1.9.15.2. This is due to a bypass that is created when the
  'action=postpass' parameter is supplied. This makes it possible for attackers to easily discover
  any login page that may have been hidden by the plugin.
