aliases: []
summary: The Customer Reviews for WooCommerce WordPress plugin before 5.16.0 does not validate
  one of its shortcode attribute, which could allow users with a contributor role and above
  to include arbitrary files via a traversal attack. This could also allow them to read non
  PHP files and retrieve their content. RCE could also be achieved if the attacker manage to
  upload a malicious image containing PHP code, and then include it via the affected attribute,
  on a default WP install, authors could easily achieve that given that they have the upload_file
  capability.
