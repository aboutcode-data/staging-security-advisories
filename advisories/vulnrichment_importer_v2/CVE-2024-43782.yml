aliases: []
summary: This openedx-translations repository contains translation files from Open edX repositories
  to be kept in sync with Transifex. Before moving to pulling translations from the openedx-translations
  repository via openedx-atlas, translations in the edx-platform repository were validated using
  edx-i18n-tools. This validation included protection against malformed translations and translations-based
  script injections. Prior to this patch, the validation implemented in the openedx-translations
  repository did not include the same protections. The maintainer inspected the translations
  in the edx-platform directory of both the main and open-release/redwood.master branches of
  the openedx-translations repository and found no evidence of exploited translation strings.
