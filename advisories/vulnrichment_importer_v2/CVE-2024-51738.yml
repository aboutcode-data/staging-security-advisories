aliases: []
summary: Sunshine is a self-hosted game stream host for Moonlight. In 0.23.1 and earlier, Sunshine's
  pairing protocol implementation does not validate request order and is thereby vulnerable
  to a MITM attack, potentially allowing an unauthenticated attacker to pair a client by hijacking
  a legitimate pairing attempt. This bug may also be used by a remote attacker to crash Sunshine.
  This vulnerability is fixed in 2025.118.151840.
