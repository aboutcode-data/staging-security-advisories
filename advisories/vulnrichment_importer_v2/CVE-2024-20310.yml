summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager\
  \ IM & Presence Service (Unified CM IM&P) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker\
  \ to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against an authenticated user of the interface.\r\
  \n\r This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly\
  \ validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading\
  \ an authenticated user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could\
  \ allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface\
  \ or access sensitive browser-based information."
