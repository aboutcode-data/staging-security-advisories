aliases: []
summary: The Bricks theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the
  ‘customTag' attribute in versions up to, and including, 1.10.1 due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with access to the
  Bricks Builder (admin-only by default), to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
  execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This becomes more of an issue when Bricks
  Builder access is granted to lower-privileged users.
