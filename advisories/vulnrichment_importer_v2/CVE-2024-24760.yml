aliases: []
summary: mailcow is a dockerized email package, with multiple containers linked in one bridged
  network. A security vulnerability has been identified in mailcow affecting versions < 2024-01c.
  This vulnerability potentially allows attackers on the same subnet to connect to exposed ports
  of a Docker container, even when the port is bound to 127.0.0.1. The vulnerability has been
  addressed by implementing additional iptables/nftables rules. These rules drop packets for
  Docker containers on ports 3306, 6379, 8983, and 12345, where the input interface is not `br-mailcow`
  and the output interface is `br-mailcow`.
