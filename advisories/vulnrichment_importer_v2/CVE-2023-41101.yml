aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in the captive portal in OpenNDS before version 10.1.3. get_query
  in http_microhttpd.c does not validate the length of the query string of GET requests. This
  leads to a stack-based buffer overflow in versions 9.x and earlier, and to a heap-based buffer
  overflow in versions 10.x and later. Attackers may exploit the issue to crash OpenNDS (Denial-of-Service
  condition) or to inject and execute arbitrary bytecode (Remote Code Execution). Affected OpenNDS
  before version 10.1.3 fixed in OpenWrt master and OpenWrt 23.05 on 23. November by updating
  OpenNDS to version 10.2.0.
