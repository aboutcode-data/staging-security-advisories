aliases: []
summary: 'A stored Cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in Text Editors and Formats in Backdrop
  CMS before 1.24.2 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the name
  parameter. When a user is editing any content type (e.g., page, post, or card) as an admin,
  the stored XSS payload is executed upon selecting a malicious text formatting option. NOTE:
  the vendor disputes the security relevance of this finding because "any administrator that
  can configure a text format could easily allow Full HTML anywhere."'
