  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  acpi: nfit: vmalloc-out-of-bounds Read in acpi_nfit_ctl

  Fix an issue detected by syzbot with KASAN:

  BUG: KASAN: vmalloc-out-of-bounds in cmd_to_func drivers/acpi/nfit/
  core.c:416 [inline]
  BUG: KASAN: vmalloc-out-of-bounds in acpi_nfit_ctl+0x20e8/0x24a0
  drivers/acpi/nfit/core.c:459

  The issue occurs in cmd_to_func when the call_pkg->nd_reserved2
  array is accessed without verifying that call_pkg points to a buffer
  that is appropriately sized as a struct nd_cmd_pkg. This can lead
  to out-of-bounds access and undefined behavior if the buffer does not
  have sufficient space.

  To address this, a check was added in acpi_nfit_ctl() to ensure that
  buf is not NULL and that buf_len is less than sizeof(*call_pkg)
  before accessing it. This ensures safe access to the members of
  call_pkg, including the nd_reserved2 array.
