aliases: []
summary: OctoPrint provides a web interface for controlling consumer 3D printers. OctoPrint
  versions up until and including 1.10.2 contain a vulnerability that allows an attacker that
  has gained temporary control over an authenticated victim's OctoPrint browser session to retrieve/recreate/delete
  the user's or - if the victim has admin permissions - the global API key without having to
  reauthenticate by re-entering the user account's password. An attacker could use a stolen
  API key to access OctoPrint through its API, or disrupt workflows depending on the API key
  they deleted. This vulnerability will be patched in version 1.10.3 and all users are advised
  to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
