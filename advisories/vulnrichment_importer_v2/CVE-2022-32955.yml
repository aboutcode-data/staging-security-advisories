aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Insyde InsydeH2O with kernel 5.0 through 5.5. DMA attacks
  on the NvmExpressDxe buffer used by SMM and non-SMM code could cause TOCTOU race-condition
  issues that could lead to corruption of SMRAM and escalation of privileges. This attack can
  be mitigated by using IOMMU protection for the ACPI runtime memory used for the command buffer.
  This attack can be mitigated by copying the link data to SMRAM before checking it and verifying
  that all pointers are within the buffer.
