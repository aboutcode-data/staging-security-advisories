summary: An open redirect vulnerability exists in the gradio-app/gradio, affecting the latest
  version. The vulnerability allows an attacker to redirect users to arbitrary websites, which
  can be exploited for phishing attacks, Cross-site Scripting (XSS), Server-Side Request Forgery
  (SSRF), amongst others. This issue is due to improper validation of user-supplied input in

  page.
