aliases: []
summary: 'The Multiple File Upload add-on component 3.1.0 for OutSystems is vulnerable to Unrestricted
  File Upload. This occurs because file extension and size validations are enforced solely on
  the client side. An attacker can intercept the upload request and modify a parameter to bypass
  extension restrictions and upload arbitrary files. NOTE: this is a third-party component that
  is not supplied or supported by OutSystems.'
