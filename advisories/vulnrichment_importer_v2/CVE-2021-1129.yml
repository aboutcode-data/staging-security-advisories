datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2021/1xxx/CVE-2021-1129.json
aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the authentication for the general purpose APIs implementation of
  Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA), Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA), and
  Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access
  general system information and certain configuration information from an affected device.
  The vulnerability exists because a secure authentication token is not required when authenticating
  to the general purpose API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted
  request for information to the general purpose API on an affected device. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to obtain system and configuration information from the affected
  device, resulting in an unauthorized information disclosure.
