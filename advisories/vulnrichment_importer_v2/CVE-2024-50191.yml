  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ext4: don't set SB_RDONLY after filesystem errors

  When the filesystem is mounted with errors=remount-ro, we were setting
  SB_RDONLY flag to stop all filesystem modifications. We knew this misses
  proper locking (sb->s_umount) and does not go through proper filesystem
  remount procedure but it has been the way this worked since early ext2
  days and it was good enough for catastrophic situation damage
  mitigation. Recently, syzbot has found a way (see link) to trigger
  warnings in filesystem freezing because the code got confused by
  SB_RDONLY changing under its hands. Since these days we set
  EXT4_FLAGS_SHUTDOWN on the superblock which is enough to stop all
  filesystem modifications, modifying SB_RDONLY shouldn't be needed. So
  stop doing that.
