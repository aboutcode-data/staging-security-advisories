aliases: []
summary: The WP RealEstate plugin for WordPress, used by the Homeo theme, is vulnerable to authentication
  bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.26. This is due to insufficient role restrictions
  in the 'process_register' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
  register an account with the Administrator role.
