aliases: []
summary: 'Certain software builds for the TCL 20XE Android device contain a vulnerable, pre-installed
  app with a package name of com.tct.gcs.hiddenmenuproxy (versionCode=''2'', versionName=''v11.0.1.0.0201.0'')
  that allows local third-party apps to programmatically perform a factory reset due to inadequate
  access control. No permissions or special privileges are necessary to exploit the vulnerability
  in the com.tct.gcs.hiddenmenuproxy app. No user interaction is required beyond installing
  and running a third-party app. The software build fingerprints for each confirmed vulnerable
  build are as follows: TCL/5087Z_BO/Doha_TMO:11/RP1A.200720.011/PB7I-0:user/release-keys and
  TCL/5087Z_BO/Doha_TMO:11/RP1A.200720.011/PB83-0:user/release-keys. This malicious app sends
  a broadcast intent to the exported com.tct.gcs.hiddenmenuproxy/.rtn.FactoryResetReceiver receiver
  component, which initiates a programmatic factory reset.'
