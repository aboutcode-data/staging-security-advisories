aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the DNS application layer gateway (ALG) functionality used by Network
  Address Translation (NAT) in Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote
  attacker to cause an affected device to reload. The vulnerability is due to a logic error
  that occurs when an affected device inspects certain DNS packets. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by sending crafted DNS packets through an affected device that is performing
  NAT for DNS packets. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause the device to reload,
  resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability
  can be exploited only by traffic that is sent through an affected device via IPv4 packets.
  The vulnerability cannot be exploited via IPv6 traffic.
