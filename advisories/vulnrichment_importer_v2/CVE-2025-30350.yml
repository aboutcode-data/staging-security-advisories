aliases: []
summary: Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. The
  `@directus/storage-driver-s3` package starting in version 9.22.0 and prior to version 12.0.1,
  corresponding to Directus starting in version 9.22.0 and prior to 11.5.0, is vulnerable to
  asset unavailability after a burst of HEAD requests. Some tools use Directus to sync content
  and assets, and some of those tools use the HEAD method to check the existence of files. When
  making many HEAD requests at once, at some point, all assets are eventually served as 403.
  This causes denial of assets for all policies of Directus, including Admin and Public. Version
  12.0.1 of the `@directus/storage-driver-s3` package, corresponding to version 11.5.0 of Directus,
  fixes the issue.
