  Cisco Express Forwarding load balancing using the 3-tuple hash algorithm is enabled. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic through an affected device that should
  otherwise be denied by the configured ACL. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass protection
  offered by a configured ACL on the affected device. There are workarounds that address this
  vulnerability. Affected Cisco IOS XR versions are: Cisco IOS XR Software Release 5.1.1 and
  later till first fixed. First Fixed Releases: 6.5.2 and later, 6.6.1 and later.'
