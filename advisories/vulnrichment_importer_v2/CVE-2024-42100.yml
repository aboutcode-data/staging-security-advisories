aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  clk: sunxi-ng: common: Don't call hw_to_ccu_common on hw without common

  In order to set the rate range of a hw sunxi_ccu_probe calls
  hw_to_ccu_common() assuming all entries in desc->ccu_clks are contained
  in a ccu_common struct. This assumption is incorrect and, in
  consequence, causes invalid pointer de-references.

  Remove the faulty call. Instead, add one more loop that iterates over
  the ccu_clks and sets the rate range, if required.
