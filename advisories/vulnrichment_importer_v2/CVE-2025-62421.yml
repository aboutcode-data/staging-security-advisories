aliases: []
summary: DataEase is a data visualization and analytics platform. In DataEase versions through
  2.10.13, a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exists due to improper file upload validation
  and authentication bypass. The StaticResourceApi interface defines a route upload/{fileId}
  that uses a URL path parameter where both the filename and extension of uploaded files are
  controllable by users. During permission validation, the TokenFilter invokes the WhitelistUtils#match
  method to determine if the URL path is in the allowlist. If the requestURI ends with .js or
  similar extensions, it is directly deemed safe and bypasses permission checks. This allows
  an attacker to access "upload/1.js" while specifying arbitrary file extensions, enabling the
  upload of HTML files containing malicious JavaScript. The vulnerability is fixed in version
  2.10.14. No known workarounds exist.
