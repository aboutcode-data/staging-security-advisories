aliases: []
summary: A flaw in Node.js TLS error handling allows remote attackers to crash or exhaust resources
  of a TLS server when `pskCallback` or `ALPNCallback` are in use. Synchronous exceptions thrown
  during these callbacks bypass standard TLS error handling paths (tlsClientError and error),
  causing either immediate process termination or silent file descriptor leaks that eventually
  lead to denial of service. Because these callbacks process attacker-controlled input during
  the TLS handshake, a remote client can repeatedly trigger the issue. This vulnerability affects
  TLS servers using PSK or ALPN callbacks across Node.js versions where these callbacks throw
  without being safely wrapped.
