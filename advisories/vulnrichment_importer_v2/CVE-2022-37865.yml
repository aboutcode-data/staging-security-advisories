aliases: []
summary: With Apache Ivy 2.4.0 an optional packaging attribute has been introduced that allows
  artifacts to be unpacked on the fly if they used pack200 or zip packaging. For artifacts using
  the "zip", "jar" or "war" packaging Ivy prior to 2.5.1 doesn't verify the target path when
  extracting the archive. An archive containing absolute paths or paths that try to traverse
  "upwards" using ".." sequences can then write files to any location on the local fie system
  that the user executing Ivy has write access to. Ivy users of version 2.4.0 to 2.5.0 should
  upgrade to Ivy 2.5.1.
