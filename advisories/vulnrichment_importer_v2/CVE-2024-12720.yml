aliases: []
summary: A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was identified in the
  huggingface/transformers library, specifically in the file tokenization_nougat_fast.py. The
  vulnerability occurs in the post_process_single() function, where a regular expression processes
  specially crafted input. The issue stems from the regex exhibiting exponential time complexity
  under certain conditions, leading to excessive backtracking. This can result in significantly
  high CPU usage and potential application downtime, effectively creating a Denial of Service
  (DoS) scenario. The affected version is v4.46.3 (latest).
