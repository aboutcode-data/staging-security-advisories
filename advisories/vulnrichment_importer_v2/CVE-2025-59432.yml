aliases: []
summary: SCRAM (Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism) is part of the family of
  Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL, RFC 4422) authentication mechanisms. Prior
  to version 3.2, a timing attack vulnerability exists in the SCRAM Java implementation. The
  issue arises because Arrays.equals was used to compare secret values such as client proofs
  and server signatures. Since Arrays.equals performs a short-circuit comparison, the execution
  time varies depending on how many leading bytes match. This behavior could allow an attacker
  to perform a timing side-channel attack and potentially infer sensitive authentication material.
  All users relying on SCRAM authentication are impacted. This vulnerability has been patched
  in version 3.1 by replacing Arrays.equals with MessageDigest.isEqual, which ensures constant-time
  comparison.
