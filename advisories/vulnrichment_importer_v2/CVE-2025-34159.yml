aliases: []
summary: Coolify versions prior to v4.0.0-beta.420.6 are vulnerable to a remote code execution
  vulnerability in the application deployment workflow. The platform allows authenticated users,
  with low-level member privileges, to inject arbitrary Docker Compose directives during project
  creation. By crafting a malicious service definition that mounts the host root filesystem,
  an attacker can gain full root access to the underlying server.
