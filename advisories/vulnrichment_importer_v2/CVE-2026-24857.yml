aliases: []
summary: '`bulk_extractor` is a digital forensics exploitation tool. Starting in version 1.4,
  `bulk_extractor`’s embedded unrar code has a heap‑buffer‑overflow in the RAR PPM LZ decoding
  path. A crafted RAR inside a disk image causes an out‑of‑bounds write in `Unpack::CopyString`,
  leading to a crash under ASAN (and likely a crash or memory corruption in production builds).
  There''s potential for using this for RCE. As of time of publication, no known patches are
  available.'
