aliases: []
summary: |
  An Improper Input Validation vulnerability exists in Apache Superset that allows an authenticated user with SQLLab access to bypass the read-only verification check when using a PostgreSQL database connection.
  While the system effectively blocks standard Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on read-only connections, it fails to detect them in specially crafted SQL statements.

  This issue affects Apache Superset: before 6.0.0.

  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 6.0.0, which fixes the issue.
