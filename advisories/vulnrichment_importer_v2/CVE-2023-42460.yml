aliases: []
summary: 'Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the EVM. The `_abi_decode()` function
  does not validate input when it is nested in an expression. Uses of `_abi_decode()` can be
  constructed which allow for bounds checking to be bypassed resulting in incorrect results.
  This issue has not yet been fixed, but a fix is expected in release `0.3.10`. Users are advised
  to reference pull request #3626.'
