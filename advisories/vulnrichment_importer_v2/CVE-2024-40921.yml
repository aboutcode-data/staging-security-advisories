  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: bridge: mst: pass vlan group directly to br_mst_vlan_set_state

  Pass the already obtained vlan group pointer to br_mst_vlan_set_state()
  instead of dereferencing it again. Each caller has already correctly
  dereferenced it for their context. This change is required for the
  following suspicious RCU dereference fix. No functional changes
  intended.
