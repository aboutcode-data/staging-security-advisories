aliases: []
summary: The WP Meta SEO plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized sitemap generation
  due to a missing capability check on the regenerateSitemaps function in versions up to, and
  including, 4.5.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level
  access to generate sitemaps. This vulnerability occurred as a result of the plugin relying
  on nonce checks as a means of access control, and that nonce being accessible to all authenticated
  users regardless of role.
