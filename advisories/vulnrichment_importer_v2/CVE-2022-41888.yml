aliases: []
summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. When running on GPU, `tf.image.generate_bounding_box_proposals`
  receives a `scores` input that must be of rank 4 but is not checked. We have patched the issue
  in GitHub commit cf35502463a88ca7185a99daa7031df60b3c1c98. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4,
  as these are also affected and still in supported range.
