  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  dm-integrity: fix a memory leak when rechecking the data

  Memory for the "checksums" pointer will leak if the data is rechecked
  after checksum failure (because the associated kfree won't happen due
  to 'goto skip_io').

  Fix this by freeing the checksums memory before recheck, and just use
  the "checksum_onstack" memory for storing checksum during recheck.
