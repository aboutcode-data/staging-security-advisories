aliases: []
summary: The InWave Jobs plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via password
  reset in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.1. This is due to the plugin not properly
  validating a user's identity prior to updating their password. This makes it possible for
  unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators,
  and leverage that to gain access to their account.
