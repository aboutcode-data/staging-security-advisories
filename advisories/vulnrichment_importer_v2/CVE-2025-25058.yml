summary: 'Improper initialization for some ESXi kernel mode driver for the Intel(R) Ethernet
  800-Series before version 2.2.2.0 (esxi 8.0) &amp; 2.2.3.0 (esxi 9.0) within Ring 1: Device
  Drivers may allow an information disclosure. Unprivileged software adversary with an authenticated
  user combined with a low complexity attack may enable data exposure. This result may potentially
  occur via local access when attack requirements are present without special internal knowledge
  and requires no user interaction. The potential vulnerability may impact the confidentiality
  (low), integrity (none) and availability (none) of the vulnerable system, resulting in subsequent
  system confidentiality (none), integrity (none) and availability (none) impacts.'
