aliases: []
summary: The Funnelforms Free plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion
  in all versions up to, and including, 3.7.3.2 via the 'af2DeleteFontFile' function. This is
  due to the plugin not properly validating a file or its path prior to deleting it. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files, including the wp-config.php
  file, which can make site takeover and remote code execution possible.
