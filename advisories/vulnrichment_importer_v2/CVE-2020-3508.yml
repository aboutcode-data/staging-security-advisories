aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the IP Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) feature of Cisco IOS XE
  Software for Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers with a 20-Gbps Embedded Services
  Processor (ESP) installed could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause an affected
  device to reload, resulting in a denial of service condition. The vulnerability is due to
  insufficient error handling when an affected device has reached platform limitations. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious series of IP ARP messages to an affected
  device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust system resources, which would
  eventually cause the affected device to reload.
