aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker
  to execute commands on the underlying Linux shell of an affected device with root privileges.
  The vulnerability occurs because the affected software improperly sanitizes user-supplied
  input. An attacker who has valid administrator access to an affected device could exploit
  this vulnerability by supplying a username with a malicious payload in the web UI and subsequently
  making a request to a specific endpoint in the web UI. A successful exploit could allow the
  attacker to run arbitrary commands as the root user, allowing complete compromise of the system.
