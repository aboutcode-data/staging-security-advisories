aliases: []
summary: vm2 is a sandbox that can run untrusted code with whitelisted Node's built-in modules.
  Prior to version 3.9.15, vm2 was not properly handling host objects passed to `Error.prepareStackTrace`
  in case of unhandled async errors. A threat actor could bypass the sandbox protections to
  gain remote code execution rights on the host running the sandbox. This vulnerability was
  patched in the release of version 3.9.15 of vm2. There are no known workarounds.
