summary: The JobSearch WP Job Board plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
  due to missing file type validation in the jobsearch_wp_handle_upload() function in all versions

  access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote
  code execution possible.
