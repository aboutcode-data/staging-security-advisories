aliases: []
summary: 'Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host prior to version 25.1.102
  and Application prior to version 25.1.1413 (VA/SaaS deployments) contain a blind server-side
  request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability reachable via the /var/www/app/console_release/lexmark/dellCheck.php
  script that can be exploited by an unauthenticated user. When a printer is registered, the
  software stores the printer’s host name in the variable $printer_vo->str_host_address. The
  code later builds a URL like ''http://<host‑address>:80/DevMgmt/DiscoveryTree.xml'' and sends
  the request with curl. No validation, whitelist, or private‑network filtering is performed
  before the request is made. Because the request is blind, an attacker cannot see the data
  directly, but can still: probe internal services, trigger internal actions, or gather other
  intelligence. This vulnerability has been confirmed to be remediated, but it is unclear as
  to when the patch was introduced.'
