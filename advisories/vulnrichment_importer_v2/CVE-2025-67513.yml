summary: FreePBX Endpoint Manager is a module for managing telephony endpoints in FreePBX systems.
  Versions prior to 16.0.96 and 17.0.1 through 17.0.9 have a weak default password. By default,
  this is a 6 digit numeric value which can be brute forced. (This is the app_password parameter).
  Depending on local configuration, this password could be the extension, voicemail, user manager,
  DPMA or EPM phone admin password. This issue is fixed in versions 16.0.96 and 17.0.10.
