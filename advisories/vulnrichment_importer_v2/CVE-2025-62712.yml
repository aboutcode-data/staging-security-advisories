aliases: []
summary: JumpServer is an open source bastion host and an operation and maintenance security
  audit system. In JumpServer versions prior to v3.10.20-lts and v4.10.11-lts, an authenticated,
  non-privileged user can retrieve connection tokens belonging to other users via the super-connection
  API endpoint (/api/v1/authentication/super-connection-token/). When accessed from a web browser,
  this endpoint returns connection tokens created by all users instead of restricting results
  to tokens owned by or authorized for the requester. An attacker who obtains these tokens can
  use them to initiate connections to managed assets on behalf of the original token owners,
  resulting in unauthorized access and privilege escalation across sensitive systems. This vulnerability
  is fixed in v3.10.20-lts and v4.10.11-lts.
