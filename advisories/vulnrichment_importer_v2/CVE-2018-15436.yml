aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Webex Events Center,
  Cisco Webex Meeting Center, Cisco Webex Support Center, and Cisco Webex Training Center could
  allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against
  a user of the web-based management interface of the affected service. The vulnerability is
  due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface
  of the affected service. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user
  of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive,
  browser-based information.
