aliases: []
summary: view_component is a framework for building reusable, testable, and encapsulated view
  components in Ruby on Rails. Versions prior to 3.9.0 and 2.83.0 have a cross-site scripting
  vulnerability that has the potential to impact anyone rendering a component directly from
  a controller with the view_component gem. Note that only components that define a `#call`
  method (i.e. instead of using a sidecar template) are affected. The return value of the `#call`
  method is not sanitized and can include user-defined content. In addition, the return value
  of the `#output_postamble` methodis not sanitized, which can also lead to cross-site scripting
  issues. Versions 3.9.0 and 2.83.0 have been released and fully mitigate both the `#call` and
  the `#output_postamble` vulnerabilities. As a workaround, sanitize the return value of `#call`.
