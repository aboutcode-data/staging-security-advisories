aliases: []
summary: Mealie is a self hosted recipe manager and meal planner. Prior to 1.4.0, the safe_scrape_html
  function utilizes a user-controlled URL to issue a request to a remote server, however these
  requests are not rate-limited. While there are efforts to prevent DDoS by implementing a timeout
  on requests, it is possible for an attacker to issue a large number of requests to the server
  which will be handled in batches based on the configuration of the Mealie server. The chunking
  of responses is helpful for mitigating memory exhaustion on the Mealie server, however a single
  request to an arbitrarily large external file (e.g. a Debian ISO) is often sufficient to completely
  saturate a CPU core assigned to the Mealie container. Without rate limiting in place, it is
  possible to not only sustain traffic against an external target indefinitely, but also to
  exhaust the CPU resources assigned to the Mealie container. This vulnerability is fixed in
  1.4.0.
