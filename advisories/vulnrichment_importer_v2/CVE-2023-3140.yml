summary: "Missing HTTP headers (X-Frame-Options, Content-Security-Policy) in KNIME\n Business\
  \ Hub before 1.4.0 has left users vulnerable to click \njacking. Clickjacking is an attack\
  \ that occurs when an attacker uses a \ntransparent iframe in a window to trick a user into\
  \ clicking on an \nactionable item, such as a button or link, to another server in which \n\
  they have an identical webpage. The attacker essentially hijacks the \nuser activity intended\
  \ for the original server and sends them to the \nother server."
