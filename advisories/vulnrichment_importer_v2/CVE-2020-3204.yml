summary: A vulnerability in the Tool Command Language (Tcl) interpreter of Cisco IOS Software
  and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker with privileged EXEC
  credentials to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system (OS) with root privileges.
  The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of data passed to the Tcl interpreter.

  device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause memory corruption or execute
  the code with root privileges on the underlying OS of the affected device.
