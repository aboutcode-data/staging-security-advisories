aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the IOx application environment for Cisco IOS Software could allow
  an authenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to the Guest Operating System
  (Guest OS) running on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to incorrect role-based
  access control (RBAC) evaluation when a low-privileged user requests access to a Guest OS
  that should be restricted to administrative accounts. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by authenticating to the Guest OS by using the low-privileged-user credentials. An exploit
  could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the Guest OS as a root user.
