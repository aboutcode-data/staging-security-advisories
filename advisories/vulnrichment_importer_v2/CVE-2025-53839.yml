aliases: []
summary: DRACOON is a file sharing service, and the DRACOON Branding Service allows customers
  to customize their DRACOON interface with their brand. Versions of the DRACOON Branding Service
  prior to 2.10.0 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting. Improper neutralization of input from
  administrative users could inject HTML code into the workflow for newly onboarded users. A
  fix was made available in version 2.10.0 and rolled out to the DRACOON service. DRACOON customers
  do not need to take action.
