aliases: []
summary: RISC Zero is a zero-knowledge verifiable general computing platform, with Ethereum
  integration. The risc0-ethereum repository contains Solidity verifier contracts, Steel EVM
  view call library, and supporting code. Prior to versions 2.1.1 and 2.2.0, the `Steel.validateCommitment`
  Solidity library function will return `true` for a crafted commitment with a digest value
  of zero. This violates the semantics of `validateCommitment`, as this does not commitment
  to a block that is in the current chain. Because the digest is zero, it does not correspond
  to any block and there exist no known openings. As a result, this commitment will never be
  produced by a correct zkVM guest using Steel and leveraging this bug to compromise the soundness
  of a program using Steel would require a separate bug or misuse of the Steel library, which
  is expected to be used to validate the root of state opening proofs. A fix has been released
  as part of `risc0-ethereum` 2.1.1 and 2.2.0. Users for the `Steel` Solidity library versions
  2.1.0 or earlier should ensure they are using `Steel.validateCommitment` in tandem with zkVM
  proof verification of a Steel program, as shown in the ERC-20 counter example, and documentation.
  This is the correct usage of Steel, and users following this pattern are not at risk, and
  do not need to take action. Users not verifying a zkVM proof of a Steel program should update
  their application to do so, as this is incorrect usage of Steel.
