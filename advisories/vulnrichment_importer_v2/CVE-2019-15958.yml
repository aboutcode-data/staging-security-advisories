summary: 'A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI) and Cisco Evolved
  Programmable Network Manager (EPNM) could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute
  arbitrary code with root privileges on the underlying operating system. The vulnerability
  is due to insufficient input validation during the initial High Availability (HA) configuration
  and registration process of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by uploading a malicious file during the HA registration period. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root-level privileges on the underlying
  operating system. Note: This vulnerability can only be exploited during the HA registration
  period. See the Details section for more information.'
