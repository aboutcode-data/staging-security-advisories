aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the ingress packet processing functionality of the Cisco Virtualized
  Packet Core-Distributed Instance (VPC-DI) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote
  attacker to cause both control function (CF) instances on an affected system to reload, resulting
  in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to insufficient handling
  of user-supplied data by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending malicious traffic to the internal distributed instance (DI) network address on
  an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unhandled error
  condition on the affected system, which would cause the CF instances to reload and consequently
  cause the entire VPC to reload, resulting in the disconnection of all subscribers and a DoS
  condition on the affected system. This vulnerability affects Cisco Virtualized Packet Core-Distributed
  Instance (VPC-DI) Software N4.0 through N5.5 with the Cisco StarOS operating system 19.2 through
  21.3. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve17656.'
