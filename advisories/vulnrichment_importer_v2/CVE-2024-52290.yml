aliases: []
summary: LF Edge eKuiper is a lightweight internet of things (IoT) data analytics and stream
  processing engine. Prior to version 2.1.0 user with rights to modificate the service (e.g.
  kuiperUser role) can inject a cross-site scripting payload into Connection Configuration key
  `Name` (`confKey`) parameter. After this setup, when any user with access to this service
  (e.g. admin) tries to delete this key, a payload acts in the victim's browser. Version 2.1.0
  fixes the issue.
