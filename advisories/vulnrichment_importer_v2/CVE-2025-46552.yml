summary: KHC-INVITATION-AUTOMATION is a GitHub automation script that automatically invites
  followers of a bot account to join your organization. In some commits on version 1.2, a vulnerability
  was identified where user data, including email addresses and Discord usernames, were exposed
  in API responses without proper access controls. This allowed unauthorized users to access
  sensitive user information by directly calling specific endpoints. This issue has been patched
  in a later commit on version 1.2.
