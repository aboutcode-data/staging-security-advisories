aliases: []
summary: 'Fortinet FortiOS through 7.6.6 allows attackers to decrypt LDAP credentials stored
  in device configuration files, as exploited in the wild from 2025-12-16 through 2026 (by default,
  the encryption key is the same across all customers'' installations). NOTE: the Supplier''s
  position is that the instance of CWE-1394 is not a vulnerability because customers "are supposed
  to enable" a non-default option that eliminates the weakness. However, that non-default option
  can disrupt functionality as shown in the "Managing FortiGates with private data encryption"
  document, and is therefore intentionally not a default option.'
