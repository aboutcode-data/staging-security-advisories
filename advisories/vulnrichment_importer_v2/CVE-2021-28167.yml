aliases: []
summary: In Eclipse Openj9 to version 0.25.0, usage of the jdk.internal.reflect.ConstantPool
  API causes the JVM in some cases to pre-resolve certain constant pool entries. This allows
  a user to call static methods or access static members without running the class initialization
  method, and may allow a user to observe uninitialized values.
