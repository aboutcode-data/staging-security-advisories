aliases: []
summary: Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. In affected versions
  an attacker can poison the cache for anonymous (i.e. not logged in) users, such that the users
  are shown the crawler view of the site instead of the HTML page. This can lead to a partial
  denial-of-service. This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions
  of Discourse. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
