  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mm/huge_memory: drop beyond-EOF folios with the right number of refs

  When an after-split folio is large and needs to be dropped due to EOF,
  folio_put_refs(folio, folio_nr_pages(folio)) should be used to drop all
  page cache refs.  Otherwise, the folio will not be freed, causing memory
  leak.

  This leak would happen on a filesystem with blocksize > page_size and a
  truncate is performed, where the blocksize makes folios split to >0 order
  ones, causing truncated folios not being freed.
