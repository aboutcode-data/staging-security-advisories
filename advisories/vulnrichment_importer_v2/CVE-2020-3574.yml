aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the TCP packet processing functionality of Cisco IP Phones could
  allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the phone to stop responding to incoming
  calls, drop connected calls, or unexpectedly reload. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  TCP ingress packet rate limiting. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
  a high and sustained rate of crafted TCP traffic to the targeted device. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to impact operations of the phone or cause the phone to reload, leading
  to a denial of service (DoS) condition.
