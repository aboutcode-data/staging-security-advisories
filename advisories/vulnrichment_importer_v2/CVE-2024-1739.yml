aliases: []
summary: lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to an authentication issue due to improper validation
  of email addresses during the signup process. Specifically, the server fails to treat email
  addresses as case insensitive, allowing the creation of multiple accounts with the same email
  address by varying the case of the email characters. For example, accounts for 'abc@gmail.com'
  and 'Abc@gmail.com' can both be created, leading to potential impersonation and confusion
  among users.
