summary: 'A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications
  Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a reflected cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected
  device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the
  web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow
  the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvk15343.'
