aliases: []
summary: Rockwell Automation FactoryTalk View Machine Edition on the PanelView Plus, improperly
  verifies user’s input, which allows unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code executed
  via crafted malicious packets.  The device has the functionality, through a CIP class, to
  execute exported functions from libraries.  There is a routine that restricts it to execute
  specific functions from two dynamic link library files.  By using a CIP class, an attacker
  can upload a self-made library to the device which allows the attacker to bypass the security
  check and execute any code written in the function.
