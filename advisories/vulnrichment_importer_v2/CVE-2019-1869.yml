aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the internal packet-processing functionality of the Cisco StarOS
  operating system running on virtual platforms could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to cause an affected device to stop processing traffic, resulting in a denial of service (DoS)
  condition. The vulnerability is due to a logic error that may occur under specific traffic
  conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted packets
  to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to prevent the targeted
  service interface from receiving any traffic, which would lead to a DoS condition on the affected
  interface. The device may have to be manually reloaded to recover from exploitation of this
  vulnerability.
