aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability was found in the device-mapper-multipath. The device-mapper-multipath
  allows local users to obtain root access, exploited alone or in conjunction with CVE-2022-41973.
  Local users that are able to write to UNIX domain sockets can bypass access controls and manipulate
  the multipath setup. This issue occurs because an attacker can repeat a keyword, which is
  mishandled when arithmetic ADD is used instead of bitwise OR. This could lead to local privilege
  escalation to root.
