aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the handling of specific Ethernet frames by Cisco IOS XR Software\
  \ for various Cisco Network Convergence System (NCS) platforms could allow an unauthenticated,\
  \ adjacent attacker to cause critical priority packets to be dropped, resulting in a denial\
  \ of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to incorrect classification\
  \ of certain types of Ethernet frames that are received on an interface. An attacker could\
  \ exploit this vulnerability by sending specific types of Ethernet frames to or through the\
  \ affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause control plane protocol\
  \ relationships to fail, resulting in a DoS condition. For more information, see the  section\
  \ of this advisory.\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.\
  \ There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
