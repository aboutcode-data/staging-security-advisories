  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  dmaengine: ptdma: Fix the error handling path in pt_core_init()

  In order to free resources correctly in the error handling path of
  pt_core_init(), 2 goto's have to be switched. Otherwise, some resources
  will leak and we will try to release things that have not been allocated
  yet.

  Also move a dev_err() to a place where it is more meaningful.
