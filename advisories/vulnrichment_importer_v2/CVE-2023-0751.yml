aliases: []
summary: When GELI reads a key file from standard input, it does not reuse the key file to initialize
  multiple providers at once resulting in the second and subsequent devices silently using a
  NULL key as the user key file. If a user only uses a key file without a user passphrase, the
  master key is encrypted with an empty key file allowing trivial recovery of the master key.
