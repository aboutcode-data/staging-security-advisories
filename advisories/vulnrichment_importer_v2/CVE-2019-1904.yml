aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based UI (web UI) of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an
  unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on
  an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web
  UI on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user
  of the interface to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user. If the user has
  administrative privileges, the attacker could alter the configuration, execute commands, or
  reload an affected device. This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running a vulnerable
  release of Cisco IOS XE Software with the HTTP Server feature enabled. The default state of
  the HTTP Server feature is version dependent.
