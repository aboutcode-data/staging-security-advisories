aliases: []
summary: WAN Emulator v2.3 contains two unauthenticated command execution vulnerabilities. The
  result.php script calls shell_exec() with unsanitized input from the pc POST parameter, allowing
  remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands as the www-data user. The system also includes
  a SUID-root binary named dosu, which is vulnerable to command injection via its first argument.
  An attacker can exploit both flaws in sequence to achieve full remote code execution and escalate
  privileges to root.
