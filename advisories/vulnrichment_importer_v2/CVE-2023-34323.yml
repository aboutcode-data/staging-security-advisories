aliases: []
summary: |
  When a transaction is committed, C Xenstored will first check
  the quota is correct before attempting to commit any nodes.  It would
  be possible that accounting is temporarily negative if a node has
  been removed outside of the transaction.

  Unfortunately, some versions of C Xenstored are assuming that the
  quota cannot be negative and are using assert() to confirm it.  This
  will lead to C Xenstored crash when tools are built without -DNDEBUG
  (this is the default).
