aliases: []
summary: A Stored HTML Injection vulnerability was discovered in the Asset List functionality
  due to improper validation of network traffic data. An unauthenticated attacker can send specially
  crafted network packets to inject HTML tags into asset attributes. When a victim views the
  affected assets in the Asset List (and similar functions), the injected HTML renders in their
  browser, enabling phishing and possibly open redirect attacks. Full XSS exploitation and direct
  information disclosure are prevented by the existing input validation and Content Security
  Policy configuration.
