aliases: []
summary: Insider Threat Management (ITM) Server versions prior to 7.17.2 contain an authentication
  bypass vulnerability that allows unauthenticated users on an adjacent network to perform agent
  unregistration when the number of registered agents exceeds the licensed limit. Successful
  exploitation prevents the server from receiving new events from affected agents, resulting
  in a partial loss of integrity and availability with no impact to confidentiality.
