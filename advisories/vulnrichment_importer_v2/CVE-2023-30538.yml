aliases: []
summary: 'Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. Due to the improper
  sanitization of SVG files, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript on the users’ browsers
  by uploading a crafted SVG file. This issue is patched in the latest stable and tests-passed
  versions of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. For users unable to upgrade there are
  two possible workarounds: enable CDN handing of uploads (and ensure the CDN sanitizes SVG
  files) or disable SVG file uploads by ensuring that the `authorized extensions` site setting
  does not include `svg` (or reset that setting to the default, by default Discourse doesn''t
  enable SVG uploads by users).'
