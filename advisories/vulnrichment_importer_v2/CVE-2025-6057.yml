aliases: []
summary: The WPBookit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing
  file type validation in the handle_image_upload() function in all versions up to, and including,
  1.0.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and
  above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code
  execution possible.
