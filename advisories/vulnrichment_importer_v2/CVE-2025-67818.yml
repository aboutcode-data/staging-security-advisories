aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Weaviate OSS before 1.33.4. An attacker with access to insert
  data into the database can craft an entry name with an absolute path (e.g., /etc/...) or use
  parent directory traversal (../../..) to escape the restore root when a backup is restored,
  potentially creating or overwriting files in arbitrary locations within the application's
  privilege scope.
