aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in parisneo/lollms-webui v13 arises from the server's handling of multipart
  boundaries in file uploads. The server does not limit or validate the length of the boundary
  or the characters appended to it, allowing an attacker to craft requests with excessively
  long boundaries, leading to resource exhaustion and eventual denial of service (DoS). Despite
  an attempted patch in commit 483431bb, which blocked hyphen characters from being appended
  to the multipart boundary, the fix is insufficient. The server remains vulnerable if other
  characters (e.g., '4', 'a') are used instead of hyphens. This allows attackers to exploit
  the vulnerability using different characters, causing resource exhaustion and service unavailability.
