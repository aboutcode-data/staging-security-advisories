aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the restricted security domain implementation of Cisco Application
  Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to modify
  the behavior of default system policies, such as quality of service (QoS) policies, on an
  affected system.&nbsp;This vulnerability is due to improper access control when restricted
  security domains are used to implement multi-tenancy. An attacker with a valid user account
  associated with a restricted security domain could exploit this vulnerability. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to read, modify, or delete child policies created under default
  system policies, which are implicitly used by all tenants in the fabric, resulting in disruption
  of network traffic. Exploitation is not possible for policies under tenants that an attacker
  has no authorization to access.
