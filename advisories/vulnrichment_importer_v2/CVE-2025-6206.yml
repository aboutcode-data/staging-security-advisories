summary: The Aiomatic - Automatic AI Content Writer & Editor, GPT-3 & GPT-4, ChatGPT ChatBot
  & AI Toolkit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file
  type validation in the 'aiomatic_image_editor_ajax_submit' function in all versions up to,
  and including, 2.5.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
