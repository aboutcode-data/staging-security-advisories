aliases: []
summary: parse-duraton is software that allows users to convert a human readable duration to
  milliseconds. Versions prior to 2.1.3 are vulnerable to an event loop delay due to the CPU-bound
  operation of resolving the provided string, from a 0.5ms and up to ~50ms per one operation,
  with a varying size from 0.01 MB and up to 4.3 MB respectively, and an out of memory that
  would crash a running Node.js application due to a string size of roughly 10 MB that utilizes
  unicode characters. Version 2.1.3 contains a patch.
