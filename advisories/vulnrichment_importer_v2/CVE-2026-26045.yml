aliases: []
summary: A flaw was identified in Moodle’s backup restore functionality where specially crafted
  backup files were not properly validated during processing. If a malicious backup file is
  restored, it could lead to unintended execution of server-side code. Since restore capabilities
  are typically available to privileged users, exploitation requires authenticated access. Successful
  exploitation could result in full compromise of the Moodle server.
