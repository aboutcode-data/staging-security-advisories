aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Dynamicweb before 9.12.8. An attacker can add a new administrator
  user without authentication. This flaw exists due to a logic issue when determining if the
  setup phases of the product can be run again. Once an attacker is authenticated as the new
  admin user they have added, it is possible to upload an executable file and achieve command
  execution. This is fixed in 9.5.9, 9.6.16, 9.7.8, 9.8.11, 9.9.8, 9.10.18, 9.12.8, and 9.13.0
  (and later).
