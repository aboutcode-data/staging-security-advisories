aliases: []
summary: PMD is an extensible multilanguage static code analyzer. The passphrase for the PMD
  and PMD Designer release signing keys are included in jar published to Maven Central. The
  private key itself is not known to have been compromised itself, but given its passphrase
  is, it must also be considered potentially compromised. As a mitigation, both compromised
  keys have been revoked so that no future use of the keys are possible. Note, that the published
  artifacts in Maven Central under the group id net.sourceforge.pmd are not compromised and
  the signatures are valid.
