aliases: []
summary: The Digits plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions
  up to, and including, 8.4.1. This is due to missing nonce validation in the 'digits_save_settings'
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the default role
  of registered users to elevate user privileges via a forged request granted they can trick
  a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
