summary: CasaOS-UserService provides user management functionalities to CasaOS. Starting in
  version 0.4.4.3 and prior to version 0.4.7, CasaOS doesn't defend against password brute force

  over the login attempts. This vulnerability allows attackers to get super user-level access
  over the server. Version 0.4.7 contains a patch for this issue.
