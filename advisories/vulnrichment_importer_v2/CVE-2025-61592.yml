aliases: []
summary: Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. In versions 1.7 and below, automatic
  loading of project-specific CLI configuration from the current working directory (<project>/.cursor/cli.json)
  could override certain global configurations in Cursor CLI. This allowed users running the
  CLI inside a malicious repository to be vulnerable to Remote Code Execution through a combination
  of permissive configuration (allowing shell commands) and prompt injection delivered via project-specific
  Rules (<project>/.cursor/rules/rule.mdc) or other mechanisms. The fix for this issue is currently
  available as a patch 2025.09.17-25b418f. As of October 3, 2025 there is no release version.
