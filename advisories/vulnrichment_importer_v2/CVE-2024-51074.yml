aliases: []
summary: 'Incorrect access control in KIA Seltos vehicle instrument cluster with software and
  hardware v1.0 allows attackers to arbitrarily change odometer readings in the vehicle by targeting
  the instrument cluster through the unsecured CAN network. NOTE: this is disputed by the supplier
  because the CAN bus is not externally exposed, and because the packets can only increase the
  odometer reading (which typically has no value to an adversary). Also, this is disputed by
  the Supplier because the findings came from a potentially unrealistic test environment (an
  isolated ECU part that was not in a vehicle), and because the observed behavior follows the
  UDS (Unified Diagnostic Services) specification.'
