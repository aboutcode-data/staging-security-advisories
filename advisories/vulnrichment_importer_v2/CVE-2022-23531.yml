aliases: []
summary: GuardDog is a CLI tool to identify malicious PyPI packages. Versions prior to 0.1.5
  are vulnerable to Relative Path Traversal when scanning a specially-crafted local PyPI package.
  Running GuardDog against a specially-crafted package can allow an attacker to write an arbitrary
  file on the machine where GuardDog is executed due to a path traversal vulnerability when
  extracting the .tar.gz file of the package being scanned, which exists by design in the tarfile.TarFile.extractall
  function. This issue is patched in version 0.1.5.
