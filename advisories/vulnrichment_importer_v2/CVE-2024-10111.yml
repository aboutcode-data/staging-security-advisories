aliases: []
summary: The OAuth Single Sign On – SSO (OAuth Client) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 6.26.3. This is due to insufficient
  verification on the user being returned by the social login token. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator,
  if they have access to the username and the user does not have an already-existing account
  for the service returning the token.
