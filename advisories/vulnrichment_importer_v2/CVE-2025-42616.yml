aliases: []
summary: "Some endpoints in vulnerability-lookup that modified \napplication state (e.g. changing\
  \ database entries, user data, \nconfigurations, or other privileged actions) may have been\
  \ accessible \nvia HTTP GET requests without requiring a CSRF token. This flaw leaves \nthe\
  \ application vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks:\n an attacker who tricks\
  \ a logged-in user into visiting a malicious \nwebsite could cause the user’s browser to issue\
  \ GET requests that \nperform unintended state-changing operations in the context of their\
  \ \nauthenticated session.\n\n\nBecause the server would treat these GET requests as valid\
  \ (since no \nCSRF protection or POST method enforcement was in place), the attacker \ncould\
  \ exploit this to escalate privileges, change settings, or carry out\n other unauthorized\
  \ actions without needing the user’s explicit consent \nor awareness. \nThe fix ensures that\
  \ all state-changing endpoints now require HTTP POST \nrequests and include a valid CSRF token.\
  \ This enforces that state \nchanges cannot be triggered by arbitrary cross-site GET requests. This\
  \ issue affects Vulnerability-Lookup: before 2.18.0."
