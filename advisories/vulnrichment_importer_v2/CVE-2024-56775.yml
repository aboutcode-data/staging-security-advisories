  drm/amd/display: Fix handling of plane refcount

  [Why]
  The mechanism to backup and restore plane states doesn't maintain
  refcount, which can cause issues if the refcount of the plane changes
  in between backup and restore operations, such as memory leaks if the
  refcount was supposed to go down, or double frees / invalid memory
  accesses if the refcount was supposed to go up.

  [How]
  Cache and re-apply current refcount when restoring plane states.
