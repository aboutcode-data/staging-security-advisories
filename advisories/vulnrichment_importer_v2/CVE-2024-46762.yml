  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  xen: privcmd: Fix possible access to a freed kirqfd instance

  Nothing prevents simultaneous ioctl calls to privcmd_irqfd_assign() and
  privcmd_irqfd_deassign(). If that happens, it is possible that a kirqfd
  created and added to the irqfds_list by privcmd_irqfd_assign() may get
  removed by another thread executing privcmd_irqfd_deassign(), while the
  former is still using it after dropping the locks.

  This can lead to a situation where an already freed kirqfd instance may
  be accessed and cause kernel oops.

  Use SRCU locking to prevent the same, as is done for the KVM
  implementation for irqfds.
