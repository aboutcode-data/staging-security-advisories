aliases: []
summary: runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI
  specification. A bug was found in runc prior to version 1.1.2 where `runc exec --cap` created
  processes with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux
  environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities
  to the permitted set during execve(2). This bug did not affect the container security sandbox
  as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's
  bounding set. This bug has been fixed in runc 1.1.2. This fix changes `runc exec --cap` behavior
  such that the additional capabilities granted to the process being executed (as specified
  via `--cap` arguments) do not include inheritable capabilities. In addition, `runc spec` is
  changed to not set any inheritable capabilities in the created example OCI spec (`config.json`)
  file.
