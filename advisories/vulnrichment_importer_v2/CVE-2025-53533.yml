aliases: []
summary: Pi-hole Admin Interface is a web interface for managing Pi-hole, a network-level advertisement
  and internet tracker blocking application. Pi-hole Admin Interface versions 6.2.1 and earlier
  are vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) via a malformed URL path. The 404 error
  page includes the requested path in the class attribute of the body tag without proper sanitization
  or escaping. An attacker can craft a URL containing an onload attribute that will execute
  arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser when a victim visits the malicious link. If an attacker
  sends a crafted pi-hole link to a victim and the victim visits it, attacker-controlled JavaScript
  code is executed in the browser of the victim. This has been patched in version 6.3.
