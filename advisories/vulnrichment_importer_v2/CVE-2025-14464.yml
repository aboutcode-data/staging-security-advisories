aliases: []
summary: The PDF Resume Parser plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to the plugin registering an AJAX action
  handler that is accessible to unauthenticated users and exposes SMTP configuration data including
  credentials. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive SMTP
  credentials (username and password) from the WordPress configuration, which could be leveraged
  to compromise email accounts and potentially gain unauthorized access to other systems using
  the same credentials.
