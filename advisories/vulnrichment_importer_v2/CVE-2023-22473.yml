summary: Talk-Android enables users to have video & audio calls through Nextcloud on Android.
  Due to passcode bypass, an attacker is able to access the user's Nextcloud files and view

  device. There are currently no known workarounds available. It is recommended that the Nextcloud
  Talk Android app is upgraded to 15.0.2.
