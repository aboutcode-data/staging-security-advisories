aliases: []
summary: The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to arbitrary file uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.6 due to accepting a user‐supplied
  supported_type string and the uploaded filename without enforcing real extension or MIME checks
  within the upload() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload
  arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
