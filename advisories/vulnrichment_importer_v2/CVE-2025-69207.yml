aliases: []
summary: Khoj is a self-hostable artificial intelligence app. Prior to 2.0.0-beta.23, an IDOR
  in the Notion OAuth callback allows an attacker to hijack any user's Notion integration by
  manipulating the state parameter. The callback endpoint accepts any user UUID without verifying
  the OAuth flow was initiated by that user, allowing attackers to replace victims' Notion configurations
  with their own, resulting in data poisoning and unauthorized access to the victim's Khoj search
  index. This attack requires knowing the user's UUID which can be leaked through shared conversations
  where an AI generated image is present. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.0.0-beta.23.
