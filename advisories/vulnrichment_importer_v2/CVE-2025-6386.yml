aliases: []
summary: The parisneo/lollms repository is affected by a timing attack vulnerability in the
  `authenticate_user` function within the `lollms_authentication.py` file. This vulnerability
  allows attackers to enumerate valid usernames and guess passwords incrementally by analyzing
  response time differences. The affected version is the latest, and the issue is resolved in
  version 20.1. The vulnerability arises from the use of Python's default string equality operator
  for password comparison, which compares characters sequentially and exits on the first mismatch,
  leading to variable response times based on the number of matching initial characters.
