aliases: []
summary: Zitadel is open-source identity infrastructure software. Versions prior to 2.64.1,
  2.63.6, 2.62.8, 2.61.4, 2.60.4, 2.59.5, and 2.58.7 have a flaw in the URL validation mechanism
  of Zitadel actions allows bypassing restrictions intended to block requests to localhost (127.0.0.1).
  The isHostBlocked check, designed to prevent such requests, can be circumvented by creating
  a DNS record that resolves to 127.0.0.1. This enables actions to send requests to localhost
  despite the intended security measures. This vulnerability potentially allows unauthorized
  access to unsecured internal endpoints, which may contain sensitive information or functionalities.
  Versions 2.64.1, 2.63.6, 2.62.8, 2.61.4, 2.60.4, 2.59.5, and 2.58.7 contain a patch. No known
  workarounds are available.
