aliases: []
summary: EVerest is an EV charging software stack. In versions 2025.9.0 and below, an attacker
  can exhaust the operating system's memory and cause the module to terminate by initiating
  an unlimited number of TCP connections that never proceed to ISO 15118-2 communication. This
  is possible because a new thread is started for each incoming plain TCP or TLS socket connection
  before any verification occurs, and the verification performed is too permissive. The EVerest
  processes and all its modules shut down, affecting all EVSE functionality. This issue is fixed
  in version 2025.10.0.
