summary: A vulnerability in the UDP protocol implementation for Cisco IoT Field Network Director
  (IoT-FND) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to exhaust system resources, resulting
  in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper resource management
  for UDP ingress packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate
  of UDP packets to an affected system within a short period of time. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to exhaust available system resources, resulting in a DoS condition.
