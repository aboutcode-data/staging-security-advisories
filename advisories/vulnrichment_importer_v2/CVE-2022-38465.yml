summary: "A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC Drive Controller family (All versions\
  \ < V2.9.2), SIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller CPU 1515SP PC (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions),\
  \ SIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller CPU 1515SP PC2 (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions <\
  \ V21.9), SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU family (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V4.5.0), SIMATIC\
  \ S7-1500 CPU family (incl. related ET200 CPUs and SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V2.9.2),\
  \ SIMATIC S7-1500 Software Controller (All versions < V21.9), SIMATIC S7-PLCSIM Advanced (All\
  \ versions < V4.0), SINUMERIK MC (All versions < V6.21), SINUMERIK ONE (All versions < V6.21).\
  \ Affected products  protect the built-in global private key in a way that cannot be considered\
  \ sufficient any longer. The key is used for the legacy protection of confidential configuration\
  \ data and the legacy PG/PC and HMI communication.\r\n\r\nThis could allow attackers to discover\
  \ the private key of a CPU product family by an offline attack against a single CPU of the\
  \ family. Attackers could then use this knowledge to extract confidential configuration data\
  \ from projects that are protected by that key or to perform attacks against legacy PG/PC\
  \ and HMI communication."
