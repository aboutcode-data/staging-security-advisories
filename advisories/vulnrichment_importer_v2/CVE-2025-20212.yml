aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server of Cisco Meraki MX and Cisco Meraki\
  \ Z Series devices could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service\
  \ (DoS) condition in the Cisco AnyConnect service on an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability,\
  \ the attacker must have valid VPN user credentials on the affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability\
  \ exists because a variable is not initialized when an SSL VPN session is established. An\
  \ attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying crafted attributes while establishing\
  \ an SSL VPN session with an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker\
  \ to cause the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server to restart, resulting in the failure of the established\
  \ SSL VPN sessions and forcing remote users to initiate a new VPN connection and reauthenticate.\
  \ A sustained attack could prevent new SSL VPN connections from being established.\r\n\r Note:\
  \ When the attack traffic stops, the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server recovers without manual intervention."
