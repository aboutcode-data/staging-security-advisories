aliases: []
summary: The WP Easy Post Types plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in
  versions up to, and including, 1.4.4 via deserialization of untrusted input from the 'text'
  parameter in the 'ajax_import_content' function. This allows authenticated attackers, with
  subscriber-level permissions and above, to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in
  the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed
  on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive
  data, or execute code.
