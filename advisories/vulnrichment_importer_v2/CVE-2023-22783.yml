summary: There are buffer overflow vulnerabilities in multiple underlying services that could
  lead to unauthenticated remote code execution by sending specially crafted packets destined

  of these vulnerabilities result in the ability to execute arbitrary code as a privileged user
  on the underlying operating system.
