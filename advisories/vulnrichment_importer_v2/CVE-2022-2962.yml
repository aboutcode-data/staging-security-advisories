aliases: []
summary: A DMA reentrancy issue was found in the Tulip device emulation in QEMU. When Tulip
  reads or writes to the rx/tx descriptor or copies the rx/tx frame, it doesn't check whether
  the destination address is its own MMIO address. This can cause the device to trigger MMIO
  handlers multiple times, possibly leading to a stack or heap overflow. A malicious guest could
  use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition.
