aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the FUSE filesystem functionality for Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure
  Controller (APIC) software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to escalate privileges
  to root on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation for
  certain command strings issued on the CLI of the affected device. An attacker with write permissions
  for files within a readable folder on the device could alter certain definitions in the affected
  file. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause the underlying FUSE driver to
  execute said crafted commands, elevating the attacker's privileges to root on an affected
  device.
