aliases: []
summary: 'OpenBao exists to provide a software solution to manage, store, and distribute sensitive
  data including secrets, certificates, and keys. In versions 0.1.0 through 2.3.1, when using
  OpenBao''s userpass auth method, user enumeration was possible due to timing difference between
  non-existent users and users with stored credentials. This is independent of whether the supplied
  credentials were valid for the given user. This issue was fixed in version 2.3.2. To work
  around this issue, users may use another auth method or apply rate limiting quotas to limit
  the number of requests in a period of time: https://openbao.org/api-docs/system/rate-limit-quotas/.'
