aliases: []
summary: The Advanced Form Integration – Connect WooCommerce and Contact Form 7 to Google Sheets
  and other platforms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the ‘integration_id’
  parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.82.0 due to insufficient escaping on the
  user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This
  makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already
  existing queries and subsequently inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they
  can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
