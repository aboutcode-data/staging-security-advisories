aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App for Windows, Cisco Webex Meetings
  Server, Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for Windows, and Cisco Webex Teams for Windows
  could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a DLL injection attack on an affected
  device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid credentials on the Windows
  system. This vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of directory paths at run time. An
  attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting a configuration file in a specific
  path in the system, which can cause a malicious DLL file to be loaded when the application
  starts. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected
  system with the privileges of another user account.
