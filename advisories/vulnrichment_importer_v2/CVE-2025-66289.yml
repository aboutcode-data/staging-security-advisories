aliases: []
summary: OrangeHRM is a comprehensive human resource management (HRM) system. From version 5.0
  to 5.7, the application does not invalidate existing sessions when a user is disabled or when
  a password change occurs, allowing active session cookies to remain valid indefinitely. As
  a result, a disabled user, or an attacker using a compromised account, can continue to access
  protected pages and perform operations as long as a prior session remains active. Because
  the server performs no session revocation or session-store cleanup during these critical state
  changes, disabling an account or updating credentials has no effect on already-established
  sessions. This makes administrative disable actions ineffective and allows unauthorized users
  to retain full access even after an account is closed or a password is reset, exposing the
  system to prolonged unauthorized use and significantly increasing the impact of account takeover
  scenarios. This issue has been patched in version 5.8.
