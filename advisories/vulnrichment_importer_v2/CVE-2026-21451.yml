aliases: []
summary: Bagisto is an open source laravel eCommerce platform. A stored Cross-Site Scripting
  (XSS) vulnerability exists in Bagisto prior to version 2.3.10 within the CMS page editor.
  Although the platform normally attempts to sanitize `<script>` tags, the filtering can be
  bypassed by manipulating the raw HTTP POST request before submission. As a result, arbitrary
  JavaScript can be stored in the CMS content and executed whenever the page is viewed or edited.
  This exposes administrators to a high-severity risk, including complete account takeover,
  backend hijacking, and malicious script execution. Version 2.3.10 fixes the issue.
