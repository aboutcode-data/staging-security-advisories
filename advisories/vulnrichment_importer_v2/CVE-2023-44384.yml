aliases: []
summary: Discourse-jira is a Discourse plugin allows Jira projects, issue types, fields and
  field options will be synced automatically. An administrator user can make an SSRF attack
  by setting the Jira URL to an arbitrary location and enabling the `discourse_jira_verbose_log`
  site setting. A moderator user could manipulate the request path to the Jira API, allowing
  them to perform arbitrary GET requests using the Jira API credentials, potentially with elevated
  permissions, used by the application.
