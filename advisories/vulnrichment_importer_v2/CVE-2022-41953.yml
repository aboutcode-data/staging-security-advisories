aliases: []
summary: Git GUI is a convenient graphical tool that comes with Git for Windows. Its target
  audience is users who are uncomfortable with using Git on the command-line. Git GUI has a
  function to clone repositories. Immediately after the local clone is available, Git GUI will
  automatically post-process it, among other things running a spell checker called `aspell.exe`
  if it was found. Git GUI is implemented as a Tcl/Tk script. Due to the unfortunate design
  of Tcl on Windows, the search path when looking for an executable _always includes the current
  directory_. Therefore, malicious repositories can ship with an `aspell.exe` in their top-level
  directory which is executed by Git GUI without giving the user a chance to inspect it first,
  i.e. running untrusted code. This issue has been addressed in version 2.39.1. Users are advised
  to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid using Git GUI for cloning. If that is not
  a viable option, at least avoid cloning from untrusted sources.
