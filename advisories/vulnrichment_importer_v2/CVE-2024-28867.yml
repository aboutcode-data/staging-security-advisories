aliases: []
summary: Swift Prometheus is a Swift client for the Prometheus monitoring system, supporting
  counters, gauges and histograms. In code which applies _un-sanitized string values into metric
  names or labels_, an attacker could make use of this and send a `?lang` query parameter containing
  newlines, `}`  or similar characters which can lead to the attacker taking over the exported
  format -- including creating unbounded numbers of stored metrics, inflating server memory
  usage, or causing "bogus" metrics. This vulnerability is fixed in2.0.0-alpha.2.
