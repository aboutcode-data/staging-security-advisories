aliases: []
summary: WebAuthn4J Spring Security provides Web Authentication specification support for Spring
  applications. Affected versions are subject to improper signature counter value handling.
  A flaw was found in webauthn4j-spring-security-core. When an authneticator returns an incremented
  signature counter value during authentication, webauthn4j-spring-security-core does not properly
  persist the value, which means cloned authenticator detection does not work. An attacker who
  cloned valid authenticator in some way can use the cloned authenticator without being detected.
  This issue has been addressed in version `0.9.1.RELEASE`. Users are advised to upgrade. There
  are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
