datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2025-27458
datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2025/27xxx/CVE-2025-27458.json
aliases: []
summary: The VNC authentication mechanism bases on a challenge-response system where both server
  and client use the same password for encryption. The challenge is sent from the server to
  the client, is encrypted by the client and sent back. The server does the same encryption
  locally and if the responses match it is prooven that the client knows the correct password.
  Since all VNC communication is unencrypted, an attacker can obtain the challenge and response
  and try to derive the password from this information.
