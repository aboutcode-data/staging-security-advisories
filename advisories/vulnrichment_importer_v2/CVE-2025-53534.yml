summary: RatPanel is a server operation and maintenance management panel. In versions 2.3.19
  through 2.5.5, when an attacker obtains the backend login path of RatPanel (including but
  not limited to weak default paths, brute-force cracking, etc.), they can execute system commands
  or take over hosts managed by the panel without logging in. In addition to this remote code
  execution (RCE) vulnerability, the flawed code also leads to unauthorized access. RatPanel
  uses the CleanPath middleware provided by github.com/go-chi/chi package to clean URLs, but
  but the middleware does not process r.URL.Path, which can cause the paths to be misinterpreted.
  This is fixed in version 2.5.6.
