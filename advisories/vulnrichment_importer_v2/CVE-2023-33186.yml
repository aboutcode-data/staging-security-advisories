aliases: []
summary: Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool with unique topic-based threading that
  combines the best of email and chat to make remote work productive and delightful. The main
  development branch of Zulip Server from May 2, 2023 and later, including beta versions 7.0-beta1
  and 7.0-beta2, is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability in tooltips on the message
  feed. An attacker who can send messages could maliciously craft a topic for the message, such
  that a victim who hovers the tooltip for that topic in their message feed triggers execution
  of JavaScript code controlled by the attacker.
