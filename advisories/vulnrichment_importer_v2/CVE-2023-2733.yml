aliases: []
summary: The MStore API plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions
  up to, and including, 3.9.0. This is due to insufficient verification on the user being supplied
  during the coupon redemption REST API request through the plugin. This makes it possible for
  unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator,
  if they have access to the user id.
