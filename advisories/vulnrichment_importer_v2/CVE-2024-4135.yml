aliases: []
summary: The WP Latest Posts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution
  in all versions up to, and including, 5.0.7. This is due to the plugin allowing users to execute
  an action that does not properly validate a user-supplied value prior to using that value
  in a call to do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute
  arbitrary shortcodes.
