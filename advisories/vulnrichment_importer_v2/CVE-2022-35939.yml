aliases: []
summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The `ScatterNd` function
  takes an input argument that determines the indices of of the output tensor. An input index
  greater than the output tensor or less than zero will either write content at the wrong index
  or trigger a crash. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit b4d4b4cb019bd7240a52daa4ba61e3cc814f0384.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported
  range. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
