  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  jfs: fix out-of-bounds in dbNextAG() and diAlloc()

  In dbNextAG() , there is no check for the case where bmp->db_numag is
  greater or same than MAXAG due to a polluted image, which causes an
  out-of-bounds. Therefore, a bounds check should be added in dbMount().

  And in dbNextAG(), a check for the case where agpref is greater than
  bmp->db_numag should be added, so an out-of-bounds exception should be
  prevented.

  Additionally, a check for the case where agno is greater or same than
  MAXAG should be added in diAlloc() to prevent out-of-bounds.
