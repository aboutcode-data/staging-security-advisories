aliases: []
summary: Spring Security, versions 5.7 prior to 5.7.5, and 5.6 prior to 5.6.9, and older unsupported
  versions could be susceptible to a privilege escalation under certain conditions. A malicious
  user or attacker can modify a request initiated by the Client (via the browser) to the Authorization
  Server which can lead to a privilege escalation on the subsequent approval. This scenario
  can happen if the Authorization Server responds with an OAuth2 Access Token Response containing
  an empty scope list (per RFC 6749, Section 5.1) on the subsequent request to the token endpoint
  to obtain the access token.
