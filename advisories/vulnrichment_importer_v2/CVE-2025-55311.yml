aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Foxit PDF and Editor for Windows and macOS before 13.2 and
  2025 before 2025.2. A crafted PDF can use JavaScript to alter annotation content and subsequently
  clear the file's modification status via JavaScript interfaces. This circumvents digital signature
  verification by hiding document modifications, allowing an attacker to mislead users about
  the document's integrity and compromise the trustworthiness of signed PDFs.
