aliases: []
summary: Dongsheng Logistics Software exposes an unauthenticated endpoint at /CommMng/Print/UploadMailFile
  that fails to enforce proper file type validation and access control. An attacker can upload
  arbitrary files, including executable scripts such as .ashx, via a crafted multipart/form-data
  POST request. This allows remote code execution on the server, potentially leading to full
  system compromise. The vulnerability is presumed to affect builds released prior to July 2025
  and is said to be remediated in newer versions of the product, though the exact affected range
  remains undefined. Exploitation evidence was first observed by the Shadowserver Foundation
  on 2025-07-23 UTC.
