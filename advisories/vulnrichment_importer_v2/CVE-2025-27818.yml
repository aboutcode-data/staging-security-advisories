aliases: []
summary: "A possible security vulnerability has been identified in Apache Kafka.\nThis requires\
  \ access to a alterConfig to the cluster resource, or Kafka Connect worker, and the ability\
  \ to create/modify connectors on it with an arbitrary Kafka client SASL JAAS config\nand a\
  \ SASL-based security protocol, which has been possible on Kafka clusters since Apache Kafka\
  \ 2.0.0 (Kafka Connect 2.3.0).\nWhen configuring the broker via config file or AlterConfig\
  \ command, or connector via the Kafka Kafka Connect REST API, an authenticated operator can\
  \ set the `sasl.jaas.config`\nproperty for any of the connector's Kafka clients to \"com.sun.security.auth.module.LdapLoginModule\"\
  , which can be done via the\n`producer.override.sasl.jaas.config`, `consumer.override.sasl.jaas.config`,\
  \ or `admin.override.sasl.jaas.config` properties.\nThis will allow the server to connect\
  \ to the attacker's LDAP server\nand deserialize the LDAP response, which the attacker can\
  \ use to execute java deserialization gadget chains on the Kafka connect server.\nAttacker\
  \ can cause unrestricted deserialization of untrusted data (or) RCE vulnerability when there\
  \ are gadgets in the classpath.\n\nSince Apache Kafka 3.0.0, users are allowed to specify\
  \ these properties in connector configurations for Kafka Connect clusters running with out-of-the-box\n\
  configurations. Before Apache Kafka 3.0.0, users may not specify these properties unless the\
  \ Kafka Connect cluster has been reconfigured with a connector\nclient override policy that\
  \ permits them.\n\nSince Apache Kafka 3.9.1/4.0.0, we have added a system property (\"-Dorg.apache.kafka.disallowed.login.modules\"\
  ) to disable the problematic login modules usage\nin SASL JAAS configuration. Also by default\
  \ \"com.sun.security.auth.module.JndiLoginModule,com.sun.security.auth.module.LdapLoginModule\"\
  \ are disabled in Apache Kafka Connect 3.9.1/4.0.0. \n\nWe advise the Kafka users to validate\
  \ connector configurations and only allow trusted LDAP configurations. Also examine connector\
  \ dependencies for \nvulnerable versions and either upgrade their connectors, upgrading that\
  \ specific dependency, or removing the connectors as options for remediation. Finally,\nin\
  \ addition to leveraging the \"org.apache.kafka.disallowed.login.modules\" system property,\
  \ Kafka Connect users can also implement their own connector\nclient config override policy,\
  \ which can be used to control which Kafka client properties can be overridden directly in\
  \ a connector config and which cannot."
