aliases: []
summary: CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework. When an application uses (1) multiple
  session cookies (e.g., one for user pages and one for admin pages) and (2)  a session handler
  is set to `DatabaseHandler`, `MemcachedHandler`, or `RedisHandler`, then if an attacker gets
  one session cookie (e.g., one for user pages), they may be able to access pages that require
  another session cookie (e.g., for admin pages). This issue has been patched, please upgrade
  to version 4.2.11 or later. As a workaround, use only one session cookie.
