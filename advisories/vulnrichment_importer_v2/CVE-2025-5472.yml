aliases: []
summary: The JSONReader in run-llama/llama_index versions 0.12.28 is vulnerable to a stack overflow
  due to uncontrolled recursive JSON parsing. This vulnerability allows attackers to trigger
  a Denial of Service (DoS) by submitting deeply nested JSON structures, leading to a RecursionError
  and crashing applications. The root cause is the unsafe recursive traversal design and lack
  of depth validation, which makes the JSONReader susceptible to stack overflow when processing
  deeply nested JSON. This impacts the availability of services, making them unreliable and
  disrupting workflows. The issue is resolved in version 0.12.38.
