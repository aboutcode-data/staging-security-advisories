  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/i915: Fix potential context UAFs

  gem_context_register() makes the context visible to userspace, and which
  point a separate thread can trigger the I915_GEM_CONTEXT_DESTROY ioctl.
  So we need to ensure that nothing uses the ctx ptr after this.  And we
  need to ensure that adding the ctx to the xarray is the *last* thing
  that gem_context_register() does with the ctx pointer.

  [tursulin: Stable and fixes tags add/tidy.]
  (cherry picked from commit bed4b455cf5374e68879be56971c1da563bcd90c)
