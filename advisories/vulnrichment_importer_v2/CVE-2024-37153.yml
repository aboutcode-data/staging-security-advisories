aliases: []
summary: Evmos is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Hub on the Cosmos Network. There is an
  issue with how to liquid stake using Safe which itself is a contract. The bug only appears
  when there is a local state change together with an ICS20 transfer in the same function and
  uses the contract's balance, that is using the contract address as the sender parameter in
  an ICS20 transfer using the ICS20 precompile. This is in essence the "infinite money glitch"
  allowing contracts to double the supply of Evmos after each transaction.The issue has been
  patched in versions >=V18.1.0.
