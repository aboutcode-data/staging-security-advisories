aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the vDaemon process in Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a buffer overflow on an affected device. This
  vulnerability is due to insufficient bounds checking when the device processes traffic. An
  attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic to the device. The attacker
  must have a man-in-the-middle position between Cisco vManage and an associated device that
  is running an affected version of Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software. An exploit could allow the
  attacker to conduct a controllable buffer overflow attack (and possibly execute arbitrary
  commands as the root user) or cause a device reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS)
  condition.
