summary: The Exclusive Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected
  Cross-Site Scripting via the Countdown Expired Title in all versions up to, and including,

  for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they
  can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
