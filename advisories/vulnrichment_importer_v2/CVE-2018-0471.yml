summary: A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) module of Cisco IOS XE Software
  Releases 16.6.1 and 16.6.2 could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a memory
  leak that may lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incorrect
  processing of certain CDP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
  certain CDP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could cause an affected device
  to continuously consume memory and eventually result in a memory allocation failure that leads
  to a crash, triggering a reload of the affected device.
