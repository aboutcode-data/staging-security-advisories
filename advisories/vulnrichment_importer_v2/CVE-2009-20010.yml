aliases: []
summary: Dogfood CRM version 2.0.10 contains a remote command execution vulnerability in the
  spell.php script used by its mail subsystem. The vulnerability arises from unsanitized user
  input passed via a POST request to the data parameter, which is processed by the underlying
  shell without adequate escaping. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary shell commands
  and execute them on the server. The flaw is exploitable without authentication and was discovered
  by researcher LSO.
