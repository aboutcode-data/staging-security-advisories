aliases: []
summary: Sealos is an open source cloud operating system distribution based on the Kubernetes
  kernel. In versions of Sealos prior to 4.2.1-rc4 an improper configuration of role based access
  control (RBAC) permissions resulted in an attacker being able to obtain cluster control permissions,
  which could control the entire cluster deployed with Sealos, as well as hundreds of pods and
  other resources within the cluster. This issue has been addressed in version 4.2.1-rc4. Users
  are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
