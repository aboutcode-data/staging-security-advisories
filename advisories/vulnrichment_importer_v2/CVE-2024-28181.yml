aliases: []
summary: turbo_boost-commands is a set of commands to help you build robust reactive applications
  with Rails & Hotwire. TurboBoost Commands has existing protections in place to guarantee that
  only public methods on Command classes can be invoked; however, the existing checks aren't
  as robust as they should be. It's possible for a sophisticated attacker to invoke more methods
  than should be permitted depending on the the strictness of authorization checks that individual
  applications enforce. Being able to call some of these methods can have security implications.
  Commands verify that the class must be a `Command` and that the method requested is defined
  as a public method; however, this isn't robust enough to guard against all unwanted code execution.
  The library should more strictly enforce which methods are considered safe before allowing
  them to be executed. This issue has been addressed in versions 0.1.3, and 0.2.2. Users are
  advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should see the repository GHSA for workaround
  advice.
