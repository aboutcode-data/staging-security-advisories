  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  btrfs: fix use-after-free when COWing tree bock and tracing is enabled

  When a COWing a tree block, at btrfs_cow_block(), and we have the
  tracepoint trace_btrfs_cow_block() enabled and preemption is also enabled
  (CONFIG_PREEMPT=y), we can trigger a use-after-free in the COWed extent
  buffer while inside the tracepoint code. This is because in some paths
  that call btrfs_cow_block(), such as btrfs_search_slot(), we are holding
  the last reference on the extent buffer @buf so btrfs_force_cow_block()
  drops the last reference on the @buf extent buffer when it calls
  free_extent_buffer_stale(buf), which schedules the release of the extent
  buffer with RCU. This means that if we are on a kernel with preemption,
  the current task may be preempted before calling trace_btrfs_cow_block()
  and the extent buffer already released by the time trace_btrfs_cow_block()
  is called, resulting in a use-after-free.

  Fix this by moving the trace_btrfs_cow_block() from btrfs_cow_block() to
  btrfs_force_cow_block() before the COWed extent buffer is freed.
  This also has a side effect of invoking the tracepoint in the tree defrag
  code, at defrag.c:btrfs_realloc_node(), since btrfs_force_cow_block() is
  called there, but this is fine and it was actually missing there.
