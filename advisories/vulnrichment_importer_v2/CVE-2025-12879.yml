aliases: []
summary: The User Generator and Importer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery in versions up to and including 1.2.2. This is due to missing nonce validation in
  the "Import Using CSV File" function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to elevate user privileges by creating arbitrary accounts with administrator privileges via
  a forged request, provided they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such
  as clicking on a link.
