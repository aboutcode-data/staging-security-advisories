aliases: []
summary: A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in mintplex-labs/anything-llm, affecting
  both the desktop application version 1.2.0 and the latest version of the web application.
  The vulnerability arises from the application's feature to fetch and embed content from websites
  into workspaces, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary JavaScript code. In the desktop
  application, this flaw can be escalated to Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to insecure application
  settings, specifically the enabling of 'nodeIntegration' and the disabling of 'contextIsolation'
  in Electron's webPreferences. The issue has been addressed in version 1.4.2 of the desktop
  application.
