aliases: []
summary: DLL injection in Veeam Agent for Windows can occur if the system's PATH variable includes
  insecure locations. When the agent runs, it searches these directories for necessary DLLs.
  If an attacker places a malicious DLL in one of these directories, the Veeam Agent might load
  it inadvertently, allowing the attacker to execute harmful code. This could lead to unauthorized
  access, data theft, or disruption of services
