aliases: []
summary: LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g. users, groups,
  DHCP settings) stored in an LDAP directory. In versions prior to 8.0 incorrect regular expressions
  allow to upload PHP scripts to config/templates/pdf. This vulnerability could lead to a Remote
  Code Execution if the /config/templates/pdf/ directory is accessible for remote users. This
  is not a default configuration of LAM. This issue has been fixed in version 8.0. There are
  no known workarounds for this issue.
