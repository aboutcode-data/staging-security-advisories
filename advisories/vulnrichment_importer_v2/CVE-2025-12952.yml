aliases: []
summary: "A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in Google Cloud's Dialogflow CX.\n\nDialogflow\
  \ agent developers with Webhook editor permission are able to configure Webhooks using Dialogflow\
  \ service agent access token authentication. \nThis allows the attacker to escalate their\
  \ privileges from agent-level to project-level, granting them unauthorized access to manage\
  \ resources in services associated with the project, leading to unexpected costs and resource\
  \ depletion for the producer project.\n\nA fix was applied on the server side to protect from\
  \ this vulnerability in February 2025. No customer action is required."
