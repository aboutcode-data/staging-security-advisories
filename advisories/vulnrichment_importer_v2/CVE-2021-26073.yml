summary: 'Broken Authentication in Atlassian Connect Express (ACE) from version 3.0.2 before
  version 6.6.0: Atlassian Connect Express is a Node.js package for building Atlassian Connect
  apps. Authentication between Atlassian products and the Atlassian Connect Express app occurs
  with a server-to-server JWT or a context JWT. Atlassian Connect Express versions from 3.0.2
  before 6.6.0 erroneously accept context JWTs in lifecycle endpoints (such as installation)
  where only server-to-server JWTs should be accepted, permitting an attacker to send authenticated
  re-installation events to an app.'
