aliases: []
summary: The UserPro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions
  up to, and including, 5.1.1. This is due to missing nonce validation in the 'admin_page',
  'userpro_verify_user' and 'verifyUnverifyAllUsers' functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to modify the role of verified users to elevate verified user privileges to that
  of any user such as 'administrator' via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
