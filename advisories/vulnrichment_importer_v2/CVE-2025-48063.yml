aliases: []
summary: XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In XWiki 16.10.0, required rights were introduced
  as a way to limit which rights a document can have. Part of the security model of required
  rights is that a user who doesn't have a right also cannot define that right as required right.
  That way, users who are editing documents on which required rights are enforced can be sure
  that they're not giving a right to a script or object that it didn't have before. A bug in
  the implementation of the enforcement of this rule means that in fact, it was possible for
  any user with edit right on a document to set programming right as required right. If then
  a user with programming right edited that document, the content of that document would gain
  programming right, allowing remote code execution. This thereby defeats most of the security
  benefits of required rights. As XWiki still performs the required rights analysis when a user
  edits a page even when required rights are enforced, the user with programming right would
  still be warned about the dangerous content unless the attacker managed to bypass this check.
  Note also that none of the affected versions include a UI for enabling the enforcing of required
  rights so it seems unlikely that anybody relied on them for security in the affected versions.
  As this vulnerability provides no additional attack surface unless all documents in the wiki
  enforce required rights, we consider the impact of this attack to be low even though gaining
  programming right could have a high impact. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 16.10.4
  and 17.1.0RC1. No known workarounds are available except for upgrading.
