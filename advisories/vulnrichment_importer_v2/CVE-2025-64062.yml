aliases: []
summary: The Primakon Pi Portal 1.0.18 /api/V2/pp_users?email endpoint is used for user data
  filtering but lacks proper server-side validation against the authenticated session. By manipulating
  the email parameter to an arbitrary value (e.g., otheruser@user.com), an attacker can assume
  the session and gain full access to the target user's data and privileges. Also, if the email
  parameter is left blank, the application defaults to the first user in the list, who is typically
  the application administrator, resulting in an immediate Privilege Escalation to the highest
  level.
