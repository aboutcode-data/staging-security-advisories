aliases: []
summary: TinyWeb is a web server (HTTP, HTTPS) written in Delphi for Win32. Versions prior to
  version 2.02 are vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack known as Slowloris. The server
  spawns a new OS thread for every incoming connection without enforcing a maximum concurrency
  limit or an appropriate request timeout. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exhaust server
  concurrency limits and memory by opening numerous connections and sending data exceptionally
  slowly (e.g. 1 byte every few minutes). Anyone hosting services using TinyWeb is impacted.
  Version 2.02 fixes the issue. The patch introduces a `CMaxConnections` limit (set to 512)
  and a `CConnectionTimeoutSecs` idle timeout (set to 30 seconds). As a temporary workaround
  if upgrading is not immediately possible, consider placing the server behind a robust reverse
  proxy or Web Application Firewall (WAF) such as nginx, HAProxy, or Cloudflare, configured
  to buffer incomplete requests and aggressively enforce connection limits and timeouts.
