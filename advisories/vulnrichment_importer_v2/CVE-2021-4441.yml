  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  spi: spi-zynq-qspi: Fix a NULL pointer dereference in zynq_qspi_exec_mem_op()

  In zynq_qspi_exec_mem_op(), kzalloc() is directly used in memset(),
  which could lead to a NULL pointer dereference on failure of
  kzalloc().

  Fix this bug by adding a check of tmpbuf.

  This bug was found by a static analyzer. The analysis employs
  differential checking to identify inconsistent security operations
  (e.g., checks or kfrees) between two code paths and confirms that the
  inconsistent operations are not recovered in the current function or
  the callers, so they constitute bugs.

  Note that, as a bug found by static analysis, it can be a false
  positive or hard to trigger. Multiple researchers have cross-reviewed
  the bug.

  Builds with CONFIG_SPI_ZYNQ_QSPI=m show no new warnings,
  and our static analyzer no longer warns about this code.
