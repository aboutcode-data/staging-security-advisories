aliases: []
summary: phpMyFAQ is an Open Source FAQ web application for PHP 8.1+ and MySQL, PostgreSQL and
  other databases. The 'sharing FAQ' functionality allows any unauthenticated actor to misuse
  the phpMyFAQ application to send arbitrary emails to a large range of targets. The phpMyFAQ
  application has a functionality where anyone can share a FAQ item to others. The front-end
  of this functionality allows any phpMyFAQ articles to be shared with 5 email addresses. Any
  unauthenticated actor can perform this action. There is a CAPTCHA in place, however the amount
  of people you email with a single request is not limited to 5 by the backend. An attacker
  can thus solve a single CAPTCHA and send thousands of emails at once. An attacker can utilize
  the target application's email server to send phishing messages. This can get the server on
  a blacklist, causing all emails to end up in spam. It can also lead to reputation damages.
  This issue has been patched in version 3.2.5.
