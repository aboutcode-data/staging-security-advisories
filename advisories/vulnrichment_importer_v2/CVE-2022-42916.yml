aliases: []
summary: In curl before 7.86.0, the HSTS check could be bypassed to trick it into staying with
  HTTP. Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS directly (instead of using
  an insecure cleartext HTTP step) even when HTTP is provided in the URL. This mechanism could
  be bypassed if the host name in the given URL uses IDN characters that get replaced with ASCII
  counterparts as part of the IDN conversion, e.g., using the character UTF-8 U+3002 (IDEOGRAPHIC
  FULL STOP) instead of the common ASCII full stop of U+002E (.). The earliest affected version
  is 7.77.0 2021-05-26.
