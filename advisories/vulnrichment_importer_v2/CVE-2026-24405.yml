summary: iccDEV provides libraries and tools for interacting with, manipulating, and applying
  ICC color management profiles. Versions 2.3.1.1 and below have a Heap Buffer Overflow vulnerability
  in CIccMpeCalculator::Read(). This occurs when user-controllable input is unsafely incorporated

  an attacker to perform DoS, manipulate data, bypass application logic and Code Execution.
  This issue has been fixed in version 2.3.1.2.
