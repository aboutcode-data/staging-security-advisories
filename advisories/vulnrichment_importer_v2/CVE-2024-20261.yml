aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the file policy feature that is used to inspect encrypted archive
  files of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote
  attacker to bypass a configured file policy to block an encrypted archive file. This vulnerability
  exists because of a logic error when a specific class of encrypted archive files is inspected.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted, encrypted archive file
  through the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send an encrypted
  archive file, which could contain malware and should have been blocked and dropped at the
  Cisco FTD device.
