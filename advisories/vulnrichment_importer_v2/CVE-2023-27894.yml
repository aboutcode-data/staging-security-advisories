aliases: []
summary: SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence Platform (Web Services) - versions 420, 430,
  allows an attacker to inject arbitrary values as CMS parameters to perform lookups on the
  internal network which is otherwise not accessible externally. On successful exploitation,
  attacker can scan internal network to determine internal infrastructure for further attacks
  like remote file inclusion, retrieve server files, bypass firewall and force the vulnerable
  server to execute malicious requests, resulting in sensitive information disclosure. This
  causes limited impact on confidentiality of data.
