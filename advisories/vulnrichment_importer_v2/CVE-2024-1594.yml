aliases: []
summary: A path traversal vulnerability exists in the mlflow/mlflow repository, specifically
  within the handling of the `artifact_location` parameter when creating an experiment. Attackers
  can exploit this vulnerability by using a fragment component `#` in the artifact location
  URI to read arbitrary files on the server in the context of the server's process. This issue
  is similar to CVE-2023-6909 but utilizes a different component of the URI to achieve the same
  effect.
