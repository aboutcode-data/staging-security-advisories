aliases: []
summary: The RegistrationMagic – Custom Registration Forms, User Registration, Payment, and
  User Login plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to
  3.7.9.3 (exclusive) via deserialization of untrusted input from the is_expired_by_date() function.
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. The additional
  presence of a POP chain allows attackers to fetch a remote file and install it on the site.
