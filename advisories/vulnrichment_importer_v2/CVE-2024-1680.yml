aliases: []
summary: The Premium Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the Image Settings URL of the Banner, Team Members, and Image Scroll widgets
  in all versions up to, and including, 4.10.21 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
  escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access
  and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
  an injected page.
