summary: Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework. Prior to version
  1.2.27, a SQL injection vulnerability in `automation_get_new_graphs_sql` function of `api_automation.php`
  allows authenticated users to exploit these SQL injection vulnerabilities to perform privilege
  escalation and remote code execution. In `api_automation.php` line 856, the `get_request_var('filter')`
  is being concatenated into the SQL statement without any sanitization. In `api_automation.php`
  line 717, The filter of `'filter'` is `FILTER_DEFAULT`, which means there is no filter for
  it. Version 1.2.27 contains a patch for the issue.
