aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) feature of
  Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to exhaust process memory
  of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient queue management for Internet
  Group Management Protocol (IGMP) packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
  sending crafted IGMP traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to cause memory exhaustion, resulting in instability of other processes. These processes may
  include, but are not limited to, interior and exterior routing protocols. Cisco will release
  software updates that address this vulnerability.
