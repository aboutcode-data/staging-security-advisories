aliases: []
summary: Due to insufficient encoding of user input, SAP NetWeaver - versions 700, 701, 702,
  731, 740, 750, allows an unauthenticated attacker to inject code that may expose sensitive
  data like user ID and password, which could lead to reflected Cross-Site scripting. These
  endpoints are normally exposed over the network and successful exploitation can partially
  impact confidentiality of the application.
