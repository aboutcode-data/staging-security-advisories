aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the IP packet processing of Cisco Access Point (AP) Software could\
  \ allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on\
  \ an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of\
  \ certain IPv4 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted\
  \ IPv4 packet either to or through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the\
  \ attacker to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition.\
  \ To successfully exploit this vulnerability, the attacker does not need to be associated\
  \ with the affected AP. This vulnerability cannot be exploited by sending IPv6 packets."
