aliases: []
summary: 'The DHCP relay subsystem of Cisco IOS 12.2 through 15.6 and Cisco IOS XE Software
  contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary
  code and gain full control of an affected system. The attacker could also cause an affected
  system to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due
  to a buffer overflow condition in the DHCP relay subsystem of the affected software. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DHCP Version 4 (DHCPv4) packet to an
  affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and
  gain full control of the affected system or cause the affected system to reload, resulting
  in a DoS condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCsm45390, CSCuw77959.'
