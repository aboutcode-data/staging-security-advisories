aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability was found in Scada-LTS 2.7.8.1. Affected is an unknown function of
  the file pointHierarchy/new/. Performing manipulation of the argument Title results in cross
  site scripting. The attack is possible to be carried out remotely. The exploit has been made
  public and could be used. The vendor explains: "[T]he risks of indicated vulnerabilities seem
  to be minimal as all scenarios likely require admin permissions. Moreover, regardless our
  team fixes those vulnerabilities - the overall risk change to the user due to malicious admin
  actions will not be lower. An admin user - by definition - has full control over HTML and
  JS code that is delivered to users in regular synoptic panels. In other words - due to the
  design of the system it is not possible to limit the admin user to attack the users."'
