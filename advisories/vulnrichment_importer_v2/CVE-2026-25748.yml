aliases: []
summary: authentik is an open-source identity provider. Prior to 2025.10.4 and 2025.12.4, with
  a malformed cookie it was possible to bypass authentication when using forward authentication
  in the authentik Proxy Provider when used in conjunction with Traefik or Caddy as reverse
  proxy. When a malicious cookie was used, none of the authentik-specific X-Authentik-* headers
  were set which depending on application can grant access to an attacker. authentik 2025.10.4
  and 2025.12.4 fix this issue.
