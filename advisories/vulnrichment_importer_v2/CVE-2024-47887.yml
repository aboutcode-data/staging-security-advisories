aliases: []
summary: Action Pack is a framework for handling and responding to web requests. Starting in
  version 4.0.0 and prior to versions 6.1.7.9, 7.0.8.5, 7.1.4.1, and 7.2.1.1, there is a possible
  ReDoS vulnerability in Action Controller's HTTP Token authentication. For applications using
  HTTP Token authentication via `authenticate_or_request_with_http_token` or similar, a carefully
  crafted header may cause header parsing to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting
  in a DoS vulnerability. All users running an affected release should either upgrade to versions
  6.1.7.9, 7.0.8.5, 7.1.4.1, or 7.2.1.1 or apply the relevant patch immediately. One may choose
  to use Ruby 3.2 as a workaround.Ruby 3.2 has mitigations for this problem, so Rails applications
  using Ruby 3.2 or newer are unaffected. Rails 8.0.0.beta1 depends on Ruby 3.2 or greater so
  is unaffected.
