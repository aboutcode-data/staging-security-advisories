summary: A vulnerability in the Flexible NetFlow Version 9 packet processor of Cisco IOS XE
  Software for Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controllers could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability
  is due to improper validation of parameters in a Flexible NetFlow Version 9 record. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed Flexible NetFlow Version 9 packet
  to the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) data port of an affected
  device. An exploit could allow the attacker to trigger an infinite loop, resulting in a process
  crash that would cause a reload of the device.
