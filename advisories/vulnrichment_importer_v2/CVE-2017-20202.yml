aliases: []
summary: Web Developer for Chrome v0.4.9 contained malicious code that generated a domain via
  a DGA and fetched a remote script. The fetched script conditionally loaded follow-on modules
  that performed extensive ad substitution and malvertising, displayed fake “repair” alerts
  that redirected users to affiliate programs, and attempted to harvest credentials when users
  logged in. Injected components enumerate common banner sizes for substitution, replace third-party
  ad calls, and redirect victim traffic to affiliate landing pages. Potential impacts include user-level
  code execution in the browser context, large-scale ad fraud and traffic hijacking, credential
  theft, and exposure to additional payloads delivered by the actor. The compromise was reported
  on by the maintainer of Web Developer for Chrome on August 2, 2017 and remediated in v0.5.0.
