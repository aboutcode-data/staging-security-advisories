aliases: []
summary: The Real Spaces - WordPress Properties Directory Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable
  to privilege escalation via the 'change_role_member' parameter in all versions up to, and
  including, 3.5. This is due to a lack of restriction in the profile update role. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to arbitrarily choose their role, including the
  Administrator role, during a profile update.
