aliases: []
summary: The Comments – wpDiscuz plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass
  in all versions up to, and including, 7.6.24. This is due to insufficient verification on
  the user being returned by the social login token. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have
  access to the email and the user does not have an already-existing account for the service
  returning the token.
