aliases: []
summary: In setAllowOnlyVpnForUids of NetworkManagementService.java, there is a possible security
  settings bypass due to a missing permission check. This could lead to local escalation of
  privilege allowing users to access non-VPN networks, when they are supposed to be restricted
  to the VPN networks, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not
  needed for exploitation.
