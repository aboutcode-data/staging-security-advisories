aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Secure Login Enhancements capability of Cisco Nexus 1000V Switch
  for VMware vSphere could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected Nexus
  1000V Virtual Supervisor Module (VSM) to become inaccessible to users through the CLI. The
  vulnerability is due to improper resource allocation during failed CLI login attempts when
  login parameters that are part of the Secure Login Enhancements capability are configured
  on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing a high amount
  of login attempts against the affected device. A successful exploit could cause the affected
  device to become inaccessible to other users, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition
  requiring a manual power cycle of the VSM to recover.
