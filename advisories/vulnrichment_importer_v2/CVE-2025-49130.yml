aliases: []
summary: Laravel Translation Manager is a package to manage Laravel translation files. Prior
  to version 0.6.8, the application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due
  to incorrect input validation and sanitization of user-input data. An attacker can inject
  arbitrary HTML code, including JavaScript scripts, into the page processed by the user's browser,
  allowing them to steal sensitive data, hijack user sessions, or conduct other malicious activities.
  Only authenticated users with access to the translation manager are impacted. The issue is
  fixed in version 0.6.8.
