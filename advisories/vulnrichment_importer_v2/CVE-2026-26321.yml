aliases: []
summary: OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to OpenClaw version 2026.2.14, the Feishu
  extension previously allowed `sendMediaFeishu` to treat attacker-controlled `mediaUrl` values
  as local filesystem paths and read them directly. If an attacker can influence tool calls
  (directly or via prompt injection), they may be able to exfiltrate local files by supplying
  paths such as `/etc/passwd` as `mediaUrl`. Upgrade to OpenClaw `2026.2.14` or newer to receive
  a fix. The fix removes direct local file reads from this path and routes media loading through
  hardened helpers that enforce local-root restrictions.
