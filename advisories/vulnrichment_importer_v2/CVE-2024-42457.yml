aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Veeam Backup & Replication allows users with certain operator roles
  to expose saved credentials by leveraging a combination of methods in a remote management
  interface. This can be achieved using a session object that allows for credential enumeration
  and exploitation, leading to the leak of plaintext credentials to a malicious host. The attack
  is facilitated by improper usage of a method that allows operators to add a new host with
  an attacker-controlled IP, enabling them to retrieve sensitive credentials in plaintext.
