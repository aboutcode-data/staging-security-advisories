aliases: []
summary: Model Context Protocol Servers is a collection of reference implementations for the
  model context protocol (MCP). In mcp-server-git versions prior to 2025.9.25, the git_init
  tool accepted arbitrary filesystem paths and created Git repositories without validating the
  target location. Unlike other tools which required an existing repository, git_init could
  operate on any directory accessible to the server process, making those directories eligible
  for subsequent git operations. The tool was removed entirely, as the server is intended to
  operate on existing repositories only. Users are advised to upgrade to 2025.9.25 or newer
  to remediate this issue.
