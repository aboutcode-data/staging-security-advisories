aliases: []
summary: In version 0.7.8 of danny-avila/librechat, improper authorization controls in the conversation
  sharing feature allow unauthorized access to other users' conversations if the conversation
  ID is known. Although UUIDv4 conversation IDs are generated server-side and are difficult
  to brute force, they can be obtained from less-protected sources such as server-side access
  logs, browser history, or screenshots. The vulnerability permits a logged-in user to gain
  read-only access to another user's conversations by exploiting the `/api/share/conversationID`
  endpoint, which lacks authorization checks. This issue is resolved in version v0.7.9-rc1.
