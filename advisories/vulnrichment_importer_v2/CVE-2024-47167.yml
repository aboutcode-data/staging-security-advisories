aliases: []
summary: Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability
  relates to **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** in the `/queue/join` endpoint. Gradio’s
  `async_save_url_to_cache` function allows attackers to force the Gradio server to send HTTP
  requests to user-controlled URLs. This could enable attackers to target internal servers or
  services within a local network and possibly exfiltrate data or cause unwanted internal requests.
  Additionally, the content from these URLs is stored locally, making it easier for attackers
  to upload potentially malicious files to the server. This impacts users deploying Gradio servers
  that use components like the Video component which involve URL fetching. Users are advised
  to upgrade to `gradio>=5` to address this issue.  As a workaround, users can disable or heavily
  restrict URL-based inputs in their Gradio applications to trusted domains only. Additionally,
  implementing stricter URL validation (such as allowinglist-based validation) and ensuring
  that local or internal network addresses cannot be requested via the `/queue/join` endpoint
  can help mitigate the risk of SSRF attacks.
