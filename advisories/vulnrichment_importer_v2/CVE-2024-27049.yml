  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  wifi: mt76: mt7925e: fix use-after-free in free_irq()

  From commit a304e1b82808 ("[PATCH] Debug shared irqs"), there is a test
  to make sure the shared irq handler should be able to handle the unexpected
  event after deregistration. For this case, let's apply MT76_REMOVED flag to
  indicate the device was removed and do not run into the resource access
  anymore.
