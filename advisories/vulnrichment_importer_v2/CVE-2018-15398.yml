aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the per-user-override feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance
  (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to bypass an access control list (ACL) that is configured for an interface
  of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to errors that could occur when the affected
  software constructs and applies per-user-override rules. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by connecting to a network through an affected device that has a vulnerable configuration.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access resources that are behind the affected
  device and would typically be protected by the interface ACL.
