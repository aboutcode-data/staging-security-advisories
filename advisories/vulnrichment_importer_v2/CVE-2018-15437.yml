datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2018/15xxx/CVE-2018-15437.json
aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the system scanning component of Cisco Immunet and Cisco Advanced
  Malware Protection (AMP) for Endpoints running on Microsoft Windows could allow a local attacker
  to disable the scanning functionality of the product. This could allow executable files to
  be launched on the system without being analyzed for threats. The vulnerability is due to
  improper process resource handling. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by gaining
  local access to a system running Microsoft Windows and protected by Cisco Immunet or Cisco
  AMP for Endpoints and executing a malicious file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to prevent the scanning services from functioning properly and ultimately prevent the system
  from being protected from further intrusion.
