aliases: []
summary: ZF FROST is a Rust implementation of FROST (Flexible Round-Optimised Schnorr Threshold
  signatures). In versions 2.0.0 through 2.1.0, refresh shares with smaller min_signers will
  reduce security of group. The inability to change min_signers (i.e. the threshold) with the
  refresh share functionality (frost_core::keys::refresh module) was not made clear to users.
  Using a smaller value would not decrease the threshold, and attempts to sign using a smaller
  threshold would fail. Additionally, after refreshing the shares with a smaller threshold,
  it would still be possible to sign with the original threshold, potentially causing a security
  loss to the participant's shares. This issue is fixed in version 2.2.0.
