summary: |
  Due to the improper configuration of XML parser, user-supplied XML is parsed without applying sufficient restrictions, enabling XML External Entity (XXE) resolution in multiple WSO2 Products.

  A successful XXE attack could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to:
    *  Read sensitive files from the server’s filesystem.
    *  Perform denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, which can render the affected service unavailable.
