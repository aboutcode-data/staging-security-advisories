aliases: []
summary: When batch jobs are executed by pgAgent, a script is created in a temporary directory
  and then executed. In versions of pgAgent prior to 4.2.3, an insufficiently seeded random
  number generator is used when generating the directory name, leading to the possibility for
  a local attacker to pre-create the directory and thus prevent pgAgent from executing jobs,
  disrupting scheduled tasks.
