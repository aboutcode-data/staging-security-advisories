aliases: []
summary: Atheos is a self-hosted browser-based cloud integrated development environment. Prior
  to version 6.0.4, improper use of `escapeshellcmd()` in `/components/codegit/traits/execute.php`
  allows argument injection, leading to arbitrary command execution. Atheos administrators and
  users of vulnerable versions are at risk of data breaches or server compromise. Version 6.0.4
  introduces a `Common::safe_execute` function that sanitizes all arguments using `escapeshellarg()`
  prior to execution and migrated all components potentially vulnerable to similar exploits
  to use this new templated execution system.
