aliases: []
summary: The FluentSMTP WordPress plugin before 2.2.3 does not sanitize or escape email content,
  making it vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting attacks (XSS) when an administrator views
  the email logs. This exploit requires other plugins to enable users to send emails with unfiltered
  HTML.
