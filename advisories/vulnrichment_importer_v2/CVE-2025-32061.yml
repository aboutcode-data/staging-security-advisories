summary: |
  The specific flaw exists within the Bluetooth stack developed by Alps Alpine of the Infotainment ECU manufactured by Bosch. The issue results from the lack of proper boundary validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a stack-based buffer overflow when receiving a specific packet on the established upper layer L2CAP channel. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to obtain remote code execution on the Infotainment ECU with root privileges.
