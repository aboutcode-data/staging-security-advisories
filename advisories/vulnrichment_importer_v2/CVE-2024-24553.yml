aliases: []
summary: Bludit uses the SHA-1 hashing algorithm to compute password hashes. Thus, attackers
  could determine cleartext passwords with brute-force attacks due to the inherent speed of
  SHA-1. In addition, the salt that is computed by Bludit is generated with a non-cryptographically
  secure function.
