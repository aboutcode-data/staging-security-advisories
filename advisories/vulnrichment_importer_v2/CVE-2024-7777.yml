aliases: []
summary: 'The Contact Form by Bit Form: Multi Step Form, Calculation Contact Form, Payment Contact
  Form & Custom Contact Form builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file read
  and deletion due to insufficient file path validation in multiple functions in versions 2.0
  to 2.13.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access
  and above, to read and delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote
  code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).'
