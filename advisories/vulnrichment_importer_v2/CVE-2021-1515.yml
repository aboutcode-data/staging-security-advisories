summary: A vulnerability in Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent
  attacker to gain access to sensitive information. This vulnerability is due to improper access
  controls on API endpoints when Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software is running in multi-tenant mode.
  An attacker with access to a device that is managed in the multi-tenant environment could
