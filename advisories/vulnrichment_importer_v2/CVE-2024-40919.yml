  bnxt_en: Adjust logging of firmware messages in case of released token in __hwrm_send()

  In case of token is released due to token->state == BNXT_HWRM_DEFERRED,
  released token (set to NULL) is used in log messages. This issue is
  expected to be prevented by HWRM_ERR_CODE_PF_UNAVAILABLE error code. But
  this error code is returned by recent firmware. So some firmware may not
  return it. This may lead to NULL pointer dereference.
  Adjust this issue by adding token pointer check.

  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.
