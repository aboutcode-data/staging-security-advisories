summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/khugepaged:\
  \ fix ->anon_vma race\n\nIf an ->anon_vma is attached to the VMA, collapse_and_free_pmd()\
  \ requires\nit to be locked.\n\nPage table traversal is allowed under any one of the mmap\
  \ lock, the\nanon_vma lock (if the VMA is associated with an anon_vma), and the\nmapping lock\
  \ (if the VMA is associated with a mapping); and so to be\nable to remove page tables, we\
  \ must hold all three of them. \nretract_page_tables() bails out if an ->anon_vma is attached,\
  \ but does\nthis check before holding the mmap lock (as the comment above the check\nexplains).\n\
  \nIf we racily merged an existing ->anon_vma (shared with a child\nprocess) from a neighboring\
  \ VMA, subsequent rmap traversals on pages\nbelonging to the child will be able to see the\
  \ page tables that we are\nconcurrently removing while assuming that nothing else can access\
  \ them.\n\nRepeat the ->anon_vma check once we hold the mmap lock to ensure that\nthere really\
  \ is no concurrent page table access.\n\nHitting this bug causes a lockdep warning in collapse_and_free_pmd(),\n\
  in the line \"lockdep_assert_held_write(&vma->anon_vma->root->rwsem)\". \nIt can also lead\
  \ to use-after-free access."
