aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine
  (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information or conduct
  a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack through an affected device. This vulnerability
  is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML
  files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted XML file that contains
  references to external entities. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve
  files from the local system, resulting in the disclosure of sensitive information, or cause
  the web application to perform arbitrary HTTP requests on behalf of the attacker.
