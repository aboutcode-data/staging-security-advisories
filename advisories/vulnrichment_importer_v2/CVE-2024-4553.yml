summary: The WP Shortcodes Plugin — Shortcodes Ultimate plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'su_members' shortcode in all versions up to,
  and including, 7.1.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied

  accesses an injected page.
