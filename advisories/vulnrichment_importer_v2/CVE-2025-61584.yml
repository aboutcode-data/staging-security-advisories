aliases: []
summary: serverless-dns is a RethinkDNS resolver that deploys to Cloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy,
  Fastly, and Fly.io. Versions through abd including 0.1.30 have a vulnerability where the pr.yml
  GitHub Action interpolates in an unsafe manner untrusted input, specifically the github.event.pull_request.head.repo.clone_url
  and github.head_ref, to a command in the runner. Due to the action using the pull_request_target
  trigger it has permissive permissions by default. An unauthorized attacker can exploit this
  vulnerability to push arbitrary data to the repository. The subsequent impact on the end-user
  is executing the attackers' code when running serverless-dns. This is fixed in commit c5537dd,
  and expected to be released in 0.1.31.
