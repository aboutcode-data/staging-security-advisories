aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the Python interpreter of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated,\
  \ low-privileged, local attacker to escape the Python sandbox and gain unauthorized access\
  \ to the underlying operating system of the device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient\
  \ validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating\
  \ specific functions within the Python interpreter. A successful exploit could allow an attacker\
  \ to escape the Python sandbox and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating\
  \ system with the privileges of the authenticated user.&nbsp;\r\nNote: An attacker must be\
  \ authenticated with Python execution privileges to exploit these vulnerabilities. For more\
  \ information regarding Python execution privileges, see product-specific documentation, such\
  \ as the  section of the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Programmability Guide."
