aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure
  and Evolved Programmable Network (EPN) Manager could allow an authenticated, remote attacker
  to execute arbitrary commands on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  validation of user-supplied input to the web-based management interface. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the interface. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating
  system (OS) with the permissions of a special non-root user. In this way, an attacker could
  take control of the affected system, which would allow them to obtain and alter sensitive
  data. The attacker could also affect the devices that are managed by the affected system by
  pushing arbitrary configuration files, retrieving device credentials and confidential information,
  and ultimately undermining the stability of the devices, causing a denial of service (DoS)
  condition.
