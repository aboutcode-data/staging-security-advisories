aliases: []
summary: LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g. users, groups,
  DHCP settings) stored in an LDAP directory. In versions prior to 8.0 the session files include
  the LDAP user name and password in clear text if the PHP OpenSSL extension is not installed
  or encryption is disabled by configuration. This issue has been fixed in version 8.0. Users
  unable to upgrade should install the PHP OpenSSL extension and make sure session encryption
  is enabled in LAM main configuration.
