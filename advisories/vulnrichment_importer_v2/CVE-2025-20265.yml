aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the RADIUS subsystem implementation of Cisco Secure Firewall Management\
  \ Center (FMC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary\
  \ shell commands that are executed by the device.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to\
  \ a lack of proper handling of user input during the authentication phase. An attacker could\
  \ exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted input when entering credentials that will\
  \ be authenticated at the configured RADIUS server. A successful exploit could allow the attacker\
  \ to execute commands at a high&nbsp;privilege level.\r\nNote: For this vulnerability to be\
  \ exploited, Cisco Secure FMC Software must be configured for RADIUS authentication for the\
  \ web-based management interface, SSH management, or both."
