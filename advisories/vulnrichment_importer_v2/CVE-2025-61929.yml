aliases: []
summary: Cherry Studio is a desktop client that supports for multiple LLM providers. Cherry
  Studio registers a custom protocol called `cherrystudio://`. When handling the MCP installation
  URL, it parses the base64-encoded configuration data and directly executes the command within
  it. In the files `src/main/services/ProtocolClient.ts` and `src/main/services/urlschema/mcp-install.ts`,
  when receiving a URL of the `cherrystudio://mcp` type, the `handleMcpProtocolUrl` function
  is called for processing. If an attacker crafts malicious content and posts it on a website
  or elsewhere (there are many exploitation methods, such as creating a malicious website with
  a button containing this malicious content), when the user clicks it, since the pop-up window
  contains normal content, the direct click is considered a scene action, and the malicious
  command is directly triggered, leading to the user being compromised. As of time of publication,
  no known patched versions exist.
