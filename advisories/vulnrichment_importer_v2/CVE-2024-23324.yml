aliases: []
summary: Envoy is a high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. External authentication can
  be bypassed by downstream connections. Downstream clients can force invalid gRPC requests
  to be sent to ext_authz, circumventing ext_authz checks when failure_mode_allow is set to
  true. This issue has been addressed in released 1.29.1, 1.28.1, 1.27.3, and 1.26.7. Users
  are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
