summary: 'Anyscale Ray 2.6.3 and 2.8.0 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via
  the job submission API. NOTE: the vendor''s position is that this report is irrelevant because
  Ray, as stated in its documentation, is not intended for use outside of a strictly controlled
  network environment. (Also, within that environment, customers at version 2.52.0 and later
  can choose to use token authentication.)'
