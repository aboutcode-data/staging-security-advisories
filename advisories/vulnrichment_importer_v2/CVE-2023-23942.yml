aliases: []
summary: The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from a Nextcloud Server
  with your computer. Versions prior to 3.6.3 are missing sanitisation on qml labels which are
  used for basic HTML elements such as `strong`, `em` and `head` lines in the UI of the desktop
  client. The lack of sanitisation may allow for javascript injection. It is recommended that
  the Nextcloud Desktop Client is upgraded to 3.6.3. There are no known workarounds for this
  issue.
