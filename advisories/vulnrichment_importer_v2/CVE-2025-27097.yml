aliases: []
summary: GraphQL Mesh is a GraphQL Federation framework and gateway for both GraphQL Federation
  and non-GraphQL Federation subgraphs, non-GraphQL services, such as REST and gRPC, and also
  databases such as MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. When a user transforms on the root level
  or single source with transforms, and the client sends the same query with different variables,
  the initial variables are used in all following requests until the cache evicts DocumentNode.
  If a token is sent via variables, the following requests will act like the same token is sent
  even if the following requests have different tokens. This can cause a short memory leak but
  it won't grow per each request but per different operation until the cache evicts DocumentNode
  by LRU mechanism.
