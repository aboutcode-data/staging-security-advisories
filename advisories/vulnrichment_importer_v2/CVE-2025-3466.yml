aliases: []
summary: langgenius/dify versions 1.1.0 to 1.1.2 are vulnerable to unsanitized input in the
  code node, allowing execution of arbitrary code with full root permissions. The vulnerability
  arises from the ability to override global functions in JavaScript, such as parseInt, before
  sandbox security restrictions are imposed. This can lead to unauthorized access to secret
  keys, internal network servers, and lateral movement within dify.ai. The issue is resolved
  in version 1.1.3.
