aliases: []
summary: Translate is a package that allows users to convert text to different languages on
  Node.js and the browser. Prior to version 3.0.0, an attacker controlling the second variable
  of the `translate` function is able to perform a cache poisoning attack. They can change the
  outcome of translation requests made by subsequent users. The `opt.id` parameter allows the
  overwriting of the cache key. If an attacker sets the `id` variable to the cache key that
  would be generated by another user, they can choose the response that user gets served. Version
  3.0.0 fixes this issue.
