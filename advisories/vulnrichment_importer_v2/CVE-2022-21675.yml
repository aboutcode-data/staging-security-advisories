aliases: []
summary: Bytecode Viewer (BCV) is a Java/Android reverse engineering suite. Versions of the
  package prior to 2.11.0 are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (AKA
  "Zip Slip"). The vulnerability is exploited using a specially crafted archive that holds directory
  traversal filenames (e.g. ../../evil.exe). The Zip Slip vulnerability can affect numerous
  archive formats, including zip, jar, tar, war, cpio, apk, rar and 7z. The attacker can then
  overwrite executable files and either invoke them remotely or wait for the system or user
  to call them, thus achieving remote command execution on the victim’s machine. The impact
  of a Zip Slip vulnerability would allow an attacker to create or overwrite existing files
  on the filesystem. In the context of a web application, a web shell could be placed within
  the application directory to achieve code execution. All users should upgrade to BCV v2.11.0
  when possible to receive a patch. There are no recommended workarounds aside from upgrading.
