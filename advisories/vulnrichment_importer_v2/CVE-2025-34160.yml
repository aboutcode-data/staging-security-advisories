aliases: []
summary: AnyShare contains a critical unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in
  the ServiceAgent API exposed on port 10250. The endpoint /api/ServiceAgent/start_service accepts
  user-supplied input via POST and fails to sanitize command-like payloads. An attacker can
  inject shell syntax that is interpreted by the backend, enabling arbitrary command execution.
  The vulnerability is presumed to affect builds released prior to August 2025 and is said to
  be remediated in newer versions of the product, though the exact affected range remains undefined. Exploitation
  evidence was first observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2025-07-11 UTC.
