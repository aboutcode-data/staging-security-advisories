aliases: []
summary: WireGuard, such as WireGuard 0.5.3 on Windows, does not fully account for the possibility
  that an adversary might be able to set a victim's system time to a future value, e.g., because
  unauthenticated NTP is used. This can lead to an outcome in which one static private key becomes
  permanently useless.
