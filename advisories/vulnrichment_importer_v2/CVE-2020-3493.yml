aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points
  (CAPWAP) protocol processing of Cisco IOS XE Software for Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless
  Controllers could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service
  (DoS) condition of an affected device. These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation
  of CAPWAP packets. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malformed
  CAPWAP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause
  the affected device to crash and reload, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected device.
