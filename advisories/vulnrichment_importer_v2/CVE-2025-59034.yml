aliases: []
summary: Indico is an event management system that uses Flask-Multipass, a multi-backend authentication
  system for Flask. Prior to version 3.3.8, a legacy API to retrieve user details could be misused
  to retrieve profile details of other users without having admin permissions due to a broken
  access check. Users should to update to Indico 3.3.8 as soon as possible. As a workaround,
  it is possible to restrict access to the affected API (e.g. in the webserver config).
