  ext4: fix timer use-after-free on failed mount

  Syzbot has found an ODEBUG bug in ext4_fill_super

  The del_timer_sync function cancels the s_err_report timer,
  which reminds about filesystem errors daily. We should
  guarantee the timer is no longer active before kfree(sbi).

  When filesystem mounting fails, the flow goes to failed_mount3,
  where an error occurs when ext4_stop_mmpd is called, causing
  a read I/O failure. This triggers the ext4_handle_error function
  that ultimately re-arms the timer,
  leaving the s_err_report timer active before kfree(sbi) is called.

  Fix the issue by canceling the s_err_report timer after calling ext4_stop_mmpd.
