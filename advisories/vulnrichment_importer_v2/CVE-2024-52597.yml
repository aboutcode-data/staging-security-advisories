aliases: []
summary: 2FAuth is a web app to manage Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) accounts and generate
  their security codes. Versions prior to 5.4.1 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting
  due to improper headers in direct access to uploaded SVGs. The application allows uploading
  images in several places. One of the accepted types of image is SVG, which allows JS scripting.
  Therefore, by uploading a malicious SVG which contains JS code, an attacker which is able
  to drive a victim to the uploaded image could compromise that victim's session and access
  to their tokens. Version 5.4.1 contains a patch for the issue.
