aliases: []
summary: The Pods – Custom Content Types and Fields plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing
  Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.10 (with the exception of 2.7.31.2,
  2.8.23.2, 2.9.19.2). This is due to the fact that the plugin allows the use of a file inclusion
  feature via shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor
  access or higher, to create pods and users (with default role).
