aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS 3.5.x before 3.6.0. When an SSL context was reset
  with the mbedtls_ssl_session_reset() API, the maximum TLS version to be negotiated was not
  restored to the configured one. An attacker was able to prevent an Mbed TLS server from establishing
  any TLS 1.3 connection, potentially resulting in a Denial of Service or forced version downgrade
  from TLS 1.3 to TLS 1.2.
