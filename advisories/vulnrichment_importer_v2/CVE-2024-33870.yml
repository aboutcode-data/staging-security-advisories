aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Artifex Ghostscript before 10.03.1. There is path traversal
  (via a crafted PostScript document) to arbitrary files if the current directory is in the
  permitted paths. For example, there can be a transformation of ../../foo to ./../../foo and
  this will grant access if ./ is permitted.
