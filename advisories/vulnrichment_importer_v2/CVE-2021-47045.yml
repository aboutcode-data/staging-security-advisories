  scsi: lpfc: Fix null pointer dereference in lpfc_prep_els_iocb()

  It is possible to call lpfc_issue_els_plogi() passing a did for which no
  matching ndlp is found. A call is then made to lpfc_prep_els_iocb() with a
  null pointer to a lpfc_nodelist structure resulting in a null pointer
  dereference.

  Fix by returning an error status if no valid ndlp is found. Fix up comments
  regarding ndlp reference counting.
