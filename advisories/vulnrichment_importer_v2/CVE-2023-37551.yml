aliases: []
summary: In multiple Codesys products in multiple versions, after successful authentication
  as a user, specially crafted network communication requests can utilize the CmpApp component
  to download files with any file extensions to the controller. In contrast to the regular file
  download via CmpFileTransfer, no filtering of certain file types is performed here. As a result,
  the integrity of the CODESYS control runtime system may be compromised by the files loaded
  onto the controller.
