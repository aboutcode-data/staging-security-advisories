  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  PCI: switchtec: Fix stdev_release() crash after surprise hot remove

  A PCI device hot removal may occur while stdev->cdev is held open. The call
  to stdev_release() then happens during close or exit, at a point way past
  switchtec_pci_remove(). Otherwise the last ref would vanish with the
  trailing put_device(), just before return.

  At that later point in time, the devm cleanup has already removed the
  stdev->mmio_mrpc mapping. Also, the stdev->pdev reference was not a counted
  one. Therefore, in DMA mode, the iowrite32() in stdev_release() will cause
  a fatal page fault, and the subsequent dma_free_coherent(), if reached,
  would pass a stale &stdev->pdev->dev pointer.

  Fix by moving MRPC DMA shutdown into switchtec_pci_remove(), after
  stdev_kill(). Counting the stdev->pdev ref is now optional, but may prevent
  future accidents.
