aliases: []
summary: The VEDA - MultiPurpose WordPress Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object
  Injection in all versions up to, and including, 4.2 via deserialization of untrusted input
  in the 'veda_backup_and_restore_action' function. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain
  is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless
  another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is
  present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the
  attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute
  code depending on the POP chain present.
