aliases: []
summary: The Google Maps made Simple plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via
  the plugin's shortcode in versions up to, and including, 0.6 due to insufficient escaping
  on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level and above permissions
  to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract
  sensitive information from the database.
