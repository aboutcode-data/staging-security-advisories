datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2023-22461

aliases: []
summary: The `sanitize-svg` package, a small SVG sanitizer to prevent cross-site scripting attacks,
  uses a deny-list-pattern to sanitize SVGs to prevent XSS. In doing so, literal `<script>`-tags
  and on-event handlers were detected in versions prior to 0.4.0. As a result, downstream software
  that relies on `sanitize-svg` and expects resulting SVGs to be safe, may be vulnerable to
  cross-site scripting. This vulnerability was addressed in v0.4.0. There are no known workarounds
