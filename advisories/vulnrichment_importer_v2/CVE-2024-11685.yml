aliases: []
summary: The `Kudos Donations – Easy donations and payments with Mollie` plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of `add_query_arg` without
  appropriate escaping on the URL in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.9. This makes it
  possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute if they
  can successfully trick a user into performing an action, such as clicking on a specially crafted
  link.
