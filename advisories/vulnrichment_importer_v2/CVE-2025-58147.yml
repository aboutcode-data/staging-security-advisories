summary: |
  [This CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the
  text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]

  Some Viridian hypercalls can specify a mask of vCPU IDs as an input, in
  one of three formats.  Xen has boundary checking bugs with all three
  formats, which can cause out-of-bounds reads and writes while processing
  the inputs.

   * CVE-2025-58147.  Hypercalls using the HV_VP_SET Sparse format can
     cause vpmask_set() to write out of bounds when converting the bitmap
     to Xen's format.

   * CVE-2025-58148.  Hypercalls using any input format can cause
     send_ipi() to read d->vcpu[] out-of-bounds, and operate on a wild
     vCPU pointer.
