aliases: []
summary: The Service Finder SMS System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication
  bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.0. This is due to the plugin not verifying
  a user's phone number before logging them in. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to login as arbitrary users.
