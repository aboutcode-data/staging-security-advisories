aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in Cisco Intelligent Node (iNode) Software could allow an unauthenticated,\
  \ remote attacker to hijack the TLS connection between Cisco iNode Manager and associated\
  \ intelligent nodes and send arbitrary traffic to an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability\
  \ is due to the presence of hard-coded cryptographic material. An attacker in a man-in-the-middle\
  \ position between Cisco iNode Manager and associated deployed nodes could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by using the static cryptographic key to generate a trusted certificate and impersonate\
  \ an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read data that is meant\
  \ for a legitimate device, modify the startup configuration of an associated node, and, consequently,\
  \ cause a denial of service (DoS) condition for downstream devices that are connected to the\
  \ affected node."
