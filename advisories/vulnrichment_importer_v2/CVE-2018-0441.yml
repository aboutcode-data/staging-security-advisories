summary: A vulnerability in the 802.11r Fast Transition feature set of Cisco IOS Access Points
  (APs) Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service
  (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a corruption of certain
  timer mechanisms triggered by specific roaming events. This corruption will eventually cause
  a timer crash. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious reassociation
  events multiple times to the same AP in a short period of time, causing a DoS condition on
  the affected AP.
