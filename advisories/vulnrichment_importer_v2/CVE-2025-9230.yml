summary: |
  Issue summary: An application trying to decrypt CMS messages encrypted using
  password based encryption can trigger an out-of-bounds read and write.

  Impact summary: This out-of-bounds read may trigger a crash which leads to
  Denial of Service for an application. The out-of-bounds write can cause
  a memory corruption which can have various consequences including
  a Denial of Service or Execution of attacker-supplied code.

  Although the consequences of a successful exploit of this vulnerability
  could be severe, the probability that the attacker would be able to
  perform it is low. Besides, password based (PWRI) encryption support in CMS
  messages is very rarely used. For that reason the issue was assessed as
  Moderate severity according to our Security Policy.

  The FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this
  issue, as the CMS implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module
  boundary.
