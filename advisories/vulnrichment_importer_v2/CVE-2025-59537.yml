aliases: []
summary: Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Versions
  1.2.0 through 1.8.7, 2.0.0-rc1 through 2.14.19, 3.0.0-rc1 through 3.2.0-rc1, 3.1.7 and 3.0.18
  are vulnerable to malicious API requests which can crash the API server and cause denial of
  service to legitimate clients. With the default configuration, no webhook.gogs.secret set,
  Argo CD’s /api/webhook endpoint will crash the entire argocd-server process when it receives
  a Gogs push event whose JSON field commits[].repo is not set or is null. This issue is fixed
  in versions 2.14.20, 3.2.0-rc2, 3.1.8 and 3.0.19.
