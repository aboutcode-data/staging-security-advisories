summary: The Contact Form Plugin by Fluent Forms for Quiz, Survey, and Drag & Drop WP Form Builder
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘subject’ parameter
  in versions up to, and including, 5.1.16 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
  escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions
  and above, and access granted by an administrator, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
  that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
