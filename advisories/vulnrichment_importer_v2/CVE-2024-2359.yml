aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the parisneo/lollms-webui version 9.3 allows attackers to bypass
  intended access restrictions and execute arbitrary code. The issue arises from the application's
  handling of the `/execute_code` endpoint, which is intended to be blocked from external access
  by default. However, attackers can exploit the `/update_setting` endpoint, which lacks proper
  access control, to modify the `host` configuration at runtime. By changing the `host` setting
  to an attacker-controlled value, the restriction on the `/execute_code` endpoint can be bypassed,
  leading to remote code execution. This vulnerability is due to improper neutralization of
  special elements used in an OS command (`Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used
  in an OS Command`).
