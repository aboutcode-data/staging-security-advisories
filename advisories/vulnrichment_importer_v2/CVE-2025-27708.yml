summary: 'Out-of-bounds read in the firmware for some Intel(R) Converged Security and Management
  Engine (CSME) Firmware (FW) within Ring 0: Kernel may allow an information disclosure. System
  software adversary with a privileged user combined with a low complexity attack may enable
  data exposure. This result may potentially occur via local access when attack requirements
  are present without special internal knowledge and requires no user interaction. The potential
  vulnerability may impact the confidentiality (high), integrity (none) and availability (none)
  of the vulnerable system, resulting in subsequent system confidentiality (none), integrity
  (none) and availability (none) impacts.'
