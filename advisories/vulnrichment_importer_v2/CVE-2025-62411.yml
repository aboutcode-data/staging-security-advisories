aliases: []
summary: LibreNMS  is a community-based GPL-licensed network monitoring system. LibreNMS <=
  25.8.0 contains a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Alert Transports
  management functionality. When an administrator creates a new Alert Transport, the value of
  the Transport name field is stored and later rendered in the Transports column of the Alert
  Rules page without proper input validation or output encoding. This leads to arbitrary JavaScript
  execution in the admin’s browser. This vulnerability is fixed in 25.10.0.
