aliases: []
summary: xml-crypto is an XML digital signature and encryption library for Node.js. An attacker
  may be able to exploit a vulnerability in versions prior to 6.0.1, 3.2.1, and 2.1.6 to bypass
  authentication or authorization mechanisms in systems that rely on xml-crypto for verifying
  signed XML documents. The vulnerability allows an attacker to modify a valid signed XML message
  in a way that still passes signature verification checks. For example, it could be used to
  alter critical identity or access control attributes, enabling an attacker with a valid account
  to escalate privileges or impersonate another user. Users of versions 6.0.0 and prior should
  upgrade to version 6.0.1 to receive a fix. Those who are still using v2.x or v3.x should upgrade
  to patched versions 2.1.6 or 3.2.1, respectively.
