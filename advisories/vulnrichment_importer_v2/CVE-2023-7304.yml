aliases: []
summary: Ruijie RG-UAC Application Management Gateway contains a command injection vulnerability
  via the 'nmc_sync.php' interface. An unauthenticated attacker able to reach the affected endpoint
  can inject shell commands via crafted request data, causing the application to execute arbitrary
  commands on the host. Successful exploitation can yield full control of the application process
  and may lead to system-level access depending on the service privileges. VulnCheck has observed
  this vulnerability being targeted by the RondoDox botnet campaign.
