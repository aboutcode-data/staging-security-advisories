aliases: []
summary: The Reales WP STPT plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account
  takeover in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.2. This is due to the plugin not properly
  validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like password. This makes it
  possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to change arbitrary
  user's passwords and email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to gain
  access to their account. This can be combined with CVE-2025-3609 to achieve remote code execution
  as an originally unauthenticated user with no account.
