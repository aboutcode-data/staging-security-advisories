aliases: []
summary: mintplex-labs/anything-llm is vulnerable to improper input validation, allowing attackers
  to read and delete arbitrary files on the server. By manipulating the 'logo_filename' parameter
  in the 'system-preferences' API endpoint, an attacker can construct requests to read sensitive
  files or the application's '.env' file, and even delete files by setting the 'logo_filename'
  to the path of the target file and invoking the 'remove-logo' API endpoint. This vulnerability
  is due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input.
