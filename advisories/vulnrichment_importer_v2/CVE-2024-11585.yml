aliases: []
summary: The WP Hide & Security Enhancer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
  contents deletion due to a missing authorization and insufficient file path validation in
  the file-process.php in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.1. This makes it possible for
  unauthenticated attackers to delete the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can
  break the site or lead to data loss.
