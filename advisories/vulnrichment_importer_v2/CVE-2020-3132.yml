summary: A vulnerability in the email message scanning feature of Cisco AsyncOS Software for
  Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause
  a temporary denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is
  due to inadequate parsing mechanisms for specific email body components. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious email containing a high number of shortened
  URLs through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to consume
  processing resources, causing a DoS condition on an affected device. To successfully exploit
  this vulnerability, certain conditions beyond the control of the attacker must occur.
