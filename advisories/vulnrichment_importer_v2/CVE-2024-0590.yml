aliases: []
summary: The Microsoft Clarity plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 0.9.3. This is due to missing nonce validation on the
  edit_clarity_project_id() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
  change the project id and add malicious JavaScript via a forged request granted they can trick
  a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
