aliases: []
summary: IPCop versions up to and including 2.1.9 contain an authenticated remote code execution
  vulnerability within the web-based administration interface. The email configuration component
  inserts user-controlled values, including the EMAIL_PW parameter, directly into system-level
  operations without proper input sanitation. By modifying the email password field to include
  shell metacharacters and issuing a save-and-test-mail action, an authenticated attacker can
  execute arbitrary operating system commands with the privileges of the web interface, resulting
  in full system compromise.
