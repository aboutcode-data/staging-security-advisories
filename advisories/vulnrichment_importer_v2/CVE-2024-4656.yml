summary: The Import and export users and customers plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
  Cross-Site Scripting via the user agent header in all versions up to, and including, 1.26.6.1

  attackers, with administrator access and higher, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
  that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
