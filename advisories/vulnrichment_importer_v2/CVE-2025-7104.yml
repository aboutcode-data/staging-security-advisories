aliases: []
summary: A mass assignment vulnerability exists in danny-avila/librechat, affecting all versions.
  This vulnerability allows attackers to manipulate sensitive fields by automatically binding
  user-provided data to internal object properties or database fields without proper filtering.
  As a result, any extra fields in the request body are included in agentData and passed to
  the database layer, allowing overwriting of any field in the schema, such as author, access_level,
  isCollaborative, and projectIds. Additionally, the Object.Prototype can be polluted due to
  the use of Object.assign with spread operators.
