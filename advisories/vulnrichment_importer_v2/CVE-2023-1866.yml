summary: The YourChannel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in
  versions up to, and including, 1.2.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the clearKeys function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset the
  plugin's channel settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
