aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the CLI parser of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated,
  local attacker to execute commands on the underlying Linux shell of an affected device with
  root privileges. The vulnerability exist because the affected software improperly sanitizes
  command arguments, failing to prevent access to certain internal data structures on an affected
  device. An attacker who has privileged EXEC mode (privilege level 15) access to an affected
  device could exploit these vulnerabilities on the device by executing CLI commands that contain
  custom arguments. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands
  with root privileges on the affected device.
