aliases: []
summary: Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool. Zulip supports a configuration where
  account creation is limited solely by being able to authenticate with a single-sign on authentication
  backend, meaning the organization places no restrictions on email address domains or invitations
  being required to join, but has disabled the EmailAuthBackend that is used for email/password
  authentication. A bug in the Zulip server means that it is possible to create an account in
  such organizations, without having an account with the configured SSO authentication backend.
  This issue is patched in version 10.2. A workaround includes requiring invitations to join
  the organization prevents the vulnerability from being accessed.
