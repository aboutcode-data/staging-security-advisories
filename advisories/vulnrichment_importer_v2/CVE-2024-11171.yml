aliases: []
summary: In danny-avila/librechat version git 0c2a583, there is an improper input validation
  vulnerability. The application uses multer middleware for handling multipart file uploads.
  When using in-memory storage (the default setting for multer), there is no limit on the upload
  file size. This can lead to a server crash due to out-of-memory errors when handling large
  files. An attacker without any privileges can exploit this vulnerability to cause a complete
  denial of service. The issue is fixed in version 0.7.6.
