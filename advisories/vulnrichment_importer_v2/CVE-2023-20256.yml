aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the per-user-override feature of Cisco Adaptive Security
  Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an
  unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured access control list (ACL) and allow
  traffic that should be denied to flow through an affected device. These vulnerabilities are
  due to a logic error that could occur when the affected software constructs and applies per-user-override
  rules. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by connecting to a network through
  an affected device that has a vulnerable configuration. A successful exploit could allow the
  attacker to bypass the interface ACL and access resources that would should be protected.
