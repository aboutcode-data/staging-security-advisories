aliases: []
summary: The filename parameter of the Context.FileAttachment function is not properly sanitized.
  A maliciously crafted filename can cause the Content-Disposition header to be sent with an
  unexpected filename value or otherwise modify the Content-Disposition header. For example,
  a filename of "setup.bat&quot;;x=.txt" will be sent as a file named "setup.bat". If the FileAttachment
  function is called with names provided by an untrusted source, this may permit an attacker
  to cause a file to be served with a name different than provided. Maliciously crafted attachment
  file name can modify the Content-Disposition header.
