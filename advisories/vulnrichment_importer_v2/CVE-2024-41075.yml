  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  cachefiles: add consistency check for copen/cread

  This prevents malicious processes from completing random copen/cread
  requests and crashing the system. Added checks are listed below:

    * Generic, copen can only complete open requests, and cread can only
      complete read requests.
    * For copen, ondemand_id must not be 0, because this indicates that the
      request has not been read by the daemon.
    * For cread, the object corresponding to fd and req should be the same.
