summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvhost/vsock:\
  \ always initialize seqpacket_allow\n\nThere are two issues around seqpacket_allow:\n1. seqpacket_allow\
  \ is not initialized when socket is\n   created. Thus if features are never set, it will be\n\
  \   read uninitialized.\n2. if VIRTIO_VSOCK_F_SEQPACKET is set and then cleared,\n   then\
  \ seqpacket_allow will not be cleared appropriately\n   (existing apps I know about don't\
  \ usually do this but\n    it's legal and there's no way to be sure no one relies\n    on\
  \ this).\n\nTo fix:\n\t- initialize seqpacket_allow after allocation\n\t- set it unconditionally\
  \ in set_features"
