summary: An insertion of sensitive information into log file vulnerability was identified in
  the log files for a GitHub Enterprise Server back-end service that could permit an `adversary
  in the middle attack` when combined with other phishing techniques. To exploit this, an attacker
  would need access to the log files for the GitHub Enterprise Server appliance, a backup archive
  created with GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities, or a service which received streamed
  logs. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server since 3.7 and was
  fixed in version 3.7.19, 3.8.12, 3.9.7, 3.10.4, and 3.11.1.
