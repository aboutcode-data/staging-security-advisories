aliases: []
summary: Concrete CMS (formerly concrete5) below 8.5.10 and between 9.0.0 and 9.1.2 is vulnerable
  to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in dashboard/system/express/entities/associations because
  Concrete CMS allows association with an entity name that doesn’t exist or, if it does exist,
  contains XSS since it was not properly sanitized. Remediate by updating to Concrete CMS 9.1.3+
  or 8.5.10+.
