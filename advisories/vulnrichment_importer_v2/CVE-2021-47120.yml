  HID: magicmouse: fix NULL-deref on disconnect

  Commit 9d7b18668956 ("HID: magicmouse: add support for Apple Magic
  Trackpad 2") added a sanity check for an Apple trackpad but returned
  success instead of -ENODEV when the check failed. This means that the
  remove callback will dereference the never-initialised driver data
  pointer when the driver is later unbound (e.g. on USB disconnect).
