aliases: []
summary: Nextcloud server is an open source home cloud implementation. In affected versions
  when a recipient receives 2 shares with the same name, while a memory cache is configured,
  the second share will replace the first one instead of being renamed to `{name} (2)`. It is
  recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 25.0.3 or 24.0.9. Users unable to upgrade
  should avoid sharing 2 folders with the same name to the same user.
