aliases: []
summary: The Flo Forms – Easy Drag & Drop Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Options Change by using the flo_import_forms_options AJAX
  action in versions up to, and including, 1.0.35 due to insufficient input sanitization and
  output escaping along with missing capability checks. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, like subscribers, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
  a user accesses an injected page.
