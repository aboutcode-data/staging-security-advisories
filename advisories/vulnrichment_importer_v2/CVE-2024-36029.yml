  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mmc: sdhci-msm: pervent access to suspended controller

  Generic sdhci code registers LED device and uses host->runtime_suspended
  flag to protect access to it. The sdhci-msm driver doesn't set this flag,
  which causes a crash when LED is accessed while controller is runtime
  suspended. Fix this by setting the flag correctly.
