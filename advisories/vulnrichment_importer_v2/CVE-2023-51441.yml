summary: "** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache\
  \ Axis allowed users with access to the admin service to perform possible SSRF\nThis issue\
  \ affects Apache Axis: through 1.3.\n\nAs Axis 1 has been EOL we recommend you migrate to\
  \ a different SOAP engine, such as Apache Axis 2/Java. Alternatively you could use a build\
  \ of Axis with the patch from  https://github.com/apache/axis-axis1-java/commit/685c309febc64aa393b2d64a05f90e7eb9f73e06\
  \  applied. The Apache Axis project does not expect to create an Axis 1.x release \nfixing\
  \ this problem, though contributors that would like to work towards\n this are welcome."
