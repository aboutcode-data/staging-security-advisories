aliases: []
summary: The WP Sliding Login/Dashboard Panel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.1. This is due to missing or incorrect
  nonce validation on the wp_sliding_panel_user_options() function. This makes it possible for
  unauthenticated attackers to update plugin settings via a forged request granted they can
  trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
