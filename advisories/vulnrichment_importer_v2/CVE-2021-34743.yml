aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the application integration feature of Cisco Webex Software could
  allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to authorize an external application to integrate
  with and access a user's account without that user's express consent. This vulnerability is
  due to improper validation of cross-site request forgery (CSRF) tokens. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by convincing a targeted user who is currently authenticated to
  Cisco Webex Software to follow a link designed to pass malicious input to the Cisco Webex
  Software application authorization interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to cause Cisco Webex Software to authorize an application on the user's behalf without the
  express consent of the user, possibly allowing external applications to read data from that
  user's profile.
