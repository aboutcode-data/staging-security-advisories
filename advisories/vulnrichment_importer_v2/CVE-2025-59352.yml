aliases: []
summary: Dragonfly is an open source P2P-based file distribution and image acceleration system.
  Prior to 2.1.0, the gRPC API and HTTP APIs allow peers to send requests that force the recipient
  peer to create files in arbitrary file system locations, and to read arbitrary files. This
  allows peers to steal other peers’ secret data and to gain remote code execution (RCE) capabilities
  on the peer’s machine.This vulnerability is fixed in 2.1.0.
