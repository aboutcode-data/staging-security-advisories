aliases: []
summary: 'AstrBot is a large language model chatbot and development framework. A path traversal
  vulnerability present in versions 3.4.4 through 3.5.12 may lead to information disclosure,
  such as API keys for LLM providers, account passwords, and other sensitive data. The vulnerability
  has been addressed in Pull Request #1676 and is included in version 3.5.13. As a workaround,
  users can edit the `cmd_config.json` file to disable the dashboard feature as a temporary
  workaround. However, it is strongly recommended to upgrade to version v3.5.13 or later to
  fully resolve this issue.'
