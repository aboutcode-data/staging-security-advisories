aliases: []
summary: A Buffer Overflow vulnerabilityexists in Pev 0.81 via the pe_exports function from
  exports.c.. The array offsets_to_Names is dynamically allocated on the stack using exp->NumberOfFunctions
  as its size. However, the loop uses exp->NumberOfNames to iterate over it and set its components
  value. Therefore, the loop code assumes that exp->NumberOfFunctions is greater than ordinal
  at each iteration. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.
