aliases: []
summary: An out of bounds write exists in FreeType versions 2.13.0 and below (newer versions
  of FreeType are not vulnerable) when attempting to parse font subglyph structures related
  to TrueType GX and variable font files. The vulnerable code assigns a signed short value to
  an unsigned long and then adds a static value causing it to wrap around and allocate too small
  of a heap buffer. The code then writes up to 6 signed long integers out of bounds relative
  to this buffer. This may result in arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability may have been
  exploited in the wild.
