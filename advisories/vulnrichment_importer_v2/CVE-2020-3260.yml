summary: A vulnerability in Cisco Aironet Series Access Points Software could allow an unauthenticated,
  adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The
  vulnerability is due to the improper processing of client packets that are sent to an affected

  of sustained client packets to the affected AP. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to cause the affected AP to crash, resulting in a DoS condition.
