aliases: []
summary: Open Forms is an application for creating and publishing smart forms. Prior to versions
  1.0.9 and 1.1.1, the cookie consent page in Open Forms contains an open redirect by injecting
  a `referer` querystring parameter and failing to validate the value. A malicious actor is
  able to redirect users to a website under their control, opening them up for phishing attacks.
  The redirect is initiated by the open forms backend which is a legimate page, making it less
  obvious to end users they are being redirected to a malicious website. Versions 1.0.9 and
  1.1.1 contain patches for this issue. There are no known workarounds avaialble.
