aliases: []
summary: "The Versa Director SD-WAN orchestration platform implements Two-Factor Authentication\
  \ (2FA) using One-Time Passcodes (OTP) delivered via email or SMS. Versa Director accepts\
  \ untrusted user input when dispatching 2FA codes, allowing an attacker who knows a valid\
  \ username and password to redirect the OTP delivery (SMS/email) to their own device. OTP/TOTP\
  \ codes are not invalidated after use, enabling reuse by an attacker who has previously intercepted\
  \ or obtained a valid code. In addition, the 2FA system does not adequately restrict the number\
  \ or frequency of login attempts. The OTP values are generated from a relatively small keyspace,\
  \ making brute-force attacks more feasible. \r\n\r\nExploitation Status: \r\n\r\nVersa Networks\
  \ is not aware of any reported instance where this vulnerability was exploited. Proof of concept\
  \ for this vulnerability has been disclosed by third party security researchers.  \r\n\r\n\
  Workarounds or Mitigation: \r\n\r\nVersa recommends that Director be upgraded to one of the\
  \ remediated software versions."
