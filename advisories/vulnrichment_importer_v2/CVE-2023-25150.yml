summary: Nextcloud office/richdocuments is an office suit for the nextcloud server platform.
  In affected versions the Collabora integration can be tricked to provide access to any file
  without proper permission validation. As a result any user with access to Collabora can obtain
  the content of other users files. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Office App (Collabora
  Integration) is updated to 7.0.2 (Nextcloud 25), 6.3.2 (Nextcloud 24), 5.0.10 (Nextcloud 23),
  4.2.9 (Nextcloud 21-22), or 3.8.7 (Nextcloud 15-20). There are no known workarounds for this
  issue.
