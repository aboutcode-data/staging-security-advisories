summary: "ACE vulnerability in conditional configuration file processing  by QOS.CH logback-core\
  \ up to and including version 1.5.18 in Java applications, allows an attacker to execute arbitrary\
  \ code by compromising an existing logback configuration file or by injecting an environment\
  \ variable before program execution.\n\n\n\nA successful attack requires the presence of Janino\
  \ library and Spring Framework to be present on the user's class path. In addition, the attacker\
  \ must  have write access to a \nconfiguration file. Alternatively, the attacker could inject\
  \ a malicious \nenvironment variable pointing to a malicious configuration file. In both \n\
  cases, the attack requires existing privilege."
