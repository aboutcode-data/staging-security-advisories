aliases: []
summary: Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Proxy component of Apache Pulsar allows
  an attacker to make TCP/IP connection attempts that originate from the Pulsar Proxy's IP address.
  When the Apache Pulsar Proxy component is used, it is possible to attempt to open TCP/IP connections
  to any IP address and port that the Pulsar Proxy can connect to. An attacker could use this
  as a way for DoS attacks that originate from the Pulsar Proxy's IP address. It hasn’t been
  detected that the Pulsar Proxy authentication can be bypassed. The attacker will have to have
  a valid token to a properly secured Pulsar Proxy. This issue affects Apache Pulsar Proxy versions
  2.7.0 to 2.7.4; 2.8.0 to 2.8.2; 2.9.0 to 2.9.1; 2.6.4 and earlier.
