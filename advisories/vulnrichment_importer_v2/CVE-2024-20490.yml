aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in a logging function of Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller (NDFC)\
  \ and Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator (NDO) could allow an attacker with access to a tech\
  \ support file to view sensitive information.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because HTTP\
  \ proxy credentials could be recorded in an internal log that is stored in the tech support\
  \ file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing a tech support file that\
  \ is generated from an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view\
  \ HTTP proxy server admin credentials in clear text that are configured on Nexus Dashboard\
  \ to reach an external network.\r\nNote: Best practice is to store debug logs and tech support\
  \ files safely and to share them only with trusted parties because they may contain sensitive\
  \ information."
