summary: The Picture Gallery – Frontend Image Uploads, AJAX Photo List plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's videowhisper_picture_upload_guest
  shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.22 due to insufficient input sanitization

  that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
