aliases: []
summary: Apiman 1.5.7 through 2.2.3.Final has insufficient checks for read permissions within
  the Apiman Manager REST API. The root cause of the issue is the Apiman project's accidental
  acceptance of a large contribution that was not fully compatible with the security model of
  Apiman versions before 3.0.0.Final. Because of this, 3.0.0.Final is not affected by the vulnerability.
