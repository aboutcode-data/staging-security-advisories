summary: A vulnerability in the PROFINET handler for Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) messages
  of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker
  to cause a crash on an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
  The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of LLDP messages in the PROFINET LLDP
  message handler. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious LLDP
  message to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the
  affected device to reload.
