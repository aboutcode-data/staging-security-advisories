aliases: []
summary: 'RevelaCode is an AI-powered faith-tech project that decodes biblical verses, prophecies
  and global events into accessible language. In versions below 1.0.1, a valid MongoDB Atlas
  URI with embedded username and password was accidentally committed to the public repository.
  This could allow unauthorized access to production or staging databases, potentially leading
  to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. This is fixed in version 1.0.1. Workarounds
  include: immediately rotating credentials for the exposed database user, using a secret manager
  (like Vault, Doppler, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) instead of storing secrets directly in code,
  or auditing recent access logs for suspicious activity.'
