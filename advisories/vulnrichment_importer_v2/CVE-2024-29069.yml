aliases: []
summary: "In snapd versions prior to 2.62, snapd failed to properly check the\ndestination of\
  \ symbolic links when extracting a snap. The snap format \nis a squashfs file-system image\
  \ and so can contain symbolic links and\nother file types. Various file entries within the\
  \ snap squashfs image\n(such as icons and desktop files etc) are directly read by snapd when\n\
  it is extracted. An attacker who could convince a user to install a\nmalicious snap which\
  \ contained symbolic links at these paths could then \ncause snapd to write out the contents\
  \ of the symbolic link destination\ninto a world-readable directory. This in-turn could allow\
  \ an unprivileged\nuser to gain access to privileged information."
