aliases: []
summary: The wpForo Forum plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Include, Server-Side
  Request Forgery, and PHAR Deserialization in versions up to, and including, 2.1.7. This is
  due to the insecure use of file_get_contents without appropriate verification of the data
  being supplied to the function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal
  permissions such as a subscriber, to retrieve the contents of files like wp-config.php hosted
  on the system, perform a deserialization attack and possibly achieve remote code execution,
  and make requests to internal services.
