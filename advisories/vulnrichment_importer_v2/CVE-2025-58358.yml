aliases: []
summary: Markdownify is a Model Context Protocol server for converting almost anything to Markdown.
  Versions below 0.0.2 contain a command injection vulnerability, caused by the unsanitized
  use of input parameters within a call to child_process.exec, enabling an attacker to inject
  arbitrary system commands. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution under
  the server process's privileges. The server constructs and executes shell commands using unvalidated
  user input directly within command-line strings. This introduces the possibility of shell
  metacharacter injection (|, >, &&, etc.). This issue is fixed in version 0.0.2.
