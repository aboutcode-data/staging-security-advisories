aliases: []
summary: The CMS Commander plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to
  the use of an insufficiently unique cryptographic signature on the 'cmsc_add_site' function
  in versions up to, and including, 2.287. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to the plugin to change the '_cmsc_public_key' in the plugin config, providing access to the
  plugin's remote control functionalities, such as creating an admin access URL, which can be
  used for privilege escalation. This can only be exploited if the plugin has not been configured
  yet, however, if combined with another arbitrary plugin installation and activation vulnerability,
  the impact can be severe.
