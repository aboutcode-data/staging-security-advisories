datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2023/44xxx/CVE-2023-44129.json
aliases: []
summary: The vulnerability is that the Messaging ("com.android.mms") app patched by LG forwards
  attacker-controlled intents back to the attacker in the exported "com.android.mms.ui.QClipIntentReceiverActivity"
  activity. The attacker can abuse this functionality by launching this activity and then sending
  a broadcast with the "com.lge.message.action.QCLIP" action. The attacker can send, e.g., their
  own data/clipdata and set Intent.FLAG_GRANT_* flags. After the attacker received that intent
  in the "onActivityResult()" method, they would have access to arbitrary content providers
  that have the `android:grantUriPermissions="true"` flag set.
