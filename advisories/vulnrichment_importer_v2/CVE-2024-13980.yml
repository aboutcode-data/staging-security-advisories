summary: H3C Intelligent Management Center (IMC) versions up to and including E0632H07 contains
  a remote command execution vulnerability in the /byod/index.xhtml endpoint. Improper handling
  of JSF ViewState allows unauthenticated attackers to craft POST requests with forged javax.faces.ViewState
  parameters, potentially leading to arbitrary command execution. This flaw does not require
  authentication and may be exploited without session cookies. An affected version range is
  undefined. Exploitation evidence was first observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2024-08-28
