aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the API subsystem of Cisco Integrated Management Controller
  (IMC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root
  privileges. The vulnerabilities are due to improper boundary checks for certain user-supplied
  input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted HTTP request to
  the API subsystem of an affected system. When this request is processed, an exploitable buffer
  overflow condition may occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
  code with root privileges on the underlying operating system (OS).
