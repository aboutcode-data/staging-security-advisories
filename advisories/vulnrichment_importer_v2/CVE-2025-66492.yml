aliases: []
summary: Masa CMS is an open source Enterprise Content Management platform. Versions 7.2.8 and
  below, 7.3.1 through 7.3.13, 7.4.0-alpha.1 through 7.4.8 and 7.5.0 through 7.5.1 are vulnerable
  to XSS when an unsanitized value of the ajax URL query parameter is directly included within
  the <head> section of the HTML page. An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the context
  of the user's session, potentially leading to Session Hijacking, Data Theft, Defacement and
  Malware Distribution. This issue is fixed in versions 7.5.2, 7.4.9, 7.3.14, and 7.2.9. To
  work around this issue, configure a Web Application Firewall (WAF) rule (e.g., ModSecurity)
  to block requests containing common XSS payload characters in the ajax query parameter. Alternatively,
  implement server-side sanitization using middleware to strip or escape dangerous characters
  from the ajax parameter before it reaches the vulnerable rendering logic.
