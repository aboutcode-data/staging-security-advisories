aliases: []
summary: 5ire is a cross-platform desktop artificial intelligence assistant and model context
  protocol client. Versions prior to 0.11.1 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting in
  chatbot responses due to insufficient sanitization. This, in turn, can lead to Remote Code
  Execution (RCE) via unsafe Electron protocol handling and exposed Electron APIs. All users
  of 5ire client versions prior to patched releases, particularly those interacting with untrusted
  chatbots or pasting external content, are affected. Version 0.11.1 contains a patch for the
  issue.
