aliases: []
summary: The SP Project & Document Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct
  Object References in versions up to, and including, 4.67. This is due to the plugin providing
  user-controlled access to objects, letting a user bypass authorization and access system resources.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber privileges or above, to
  change user passwords and potentially take over administrator accounts.
