  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  Revert "xsk: Support redirect to any socket bound to the same umem"

  This reverts commit 2863d665ea41282379f108e4da6c8a2366ba66db.

  This patch introduced a potential kernel crash when multiple napi instances
  redirect to the same AF_XDP socket. By removing the queue_index check, it is
  possible for multiple napi instances to access the Rx ring at the same time,
  which will result in a corrupted ring state which can lead to a crash when
  flushing the rings in __xsk_flush(). This can happen when the linked list of
  sockets to flush gets corrupted by concurrent accesses. A quick and small fix
  is not possible, so let us revert this for now.
