aliases: []
summary: The My Sticky Bar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  in mystickymenu-contact-leads.php. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
  trigger the export of a CSV file containing contact leads via a forged request granted they
  can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Because
  the CSV file is exported to a public location, it can be downloaded during a very short window
  of time before it is automatically deleted by the export function.
