aliases: []
summary: Quiet is an alternative to team chat apps like Slack, Discord, and Element that does
  not require trusting a central server or running one's own. In versions 6.1.0-alpha.4 and
  below, Quiet's API for backend/frontend communication was using an insecure, not constant-time
  comparison function for token verification. This allowed for a potential timing attack where
  an attacker would try different token values and observe tiny differences in the response
  time (wrong characters fail faster) to guess the whole token one character at a time. This
  is fixed in version 6.0.1.
