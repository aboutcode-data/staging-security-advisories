aliases: []
summary: pnpm is a package manager. Prior to version 10.28.1, a path traversal vulnerability
  in pnpm's bin linking allows malicious npm packages to create executable shims or symlinks
  outside of `node_modules/.bin`. Bin names starting with `@` bypass validation, and after scope
  normalization, path traversal sequences like `../../` remain intact. This issue affects all
  pnpm users who install npm packages and CI/CD pipelines using pnpm. It can lead to overwriting
  config files, scripts, or other sensitive files. Version 10.28.1 contains a patch.
