aliases: []
summary: LIBPNG is a reference library for use in applications that read, create, and manipulate
  PNG (Portable Network Graphics) raster image files. From 1.6.26 to 1.6.53, there is an integer
  truncation in the libpng simplified write API functions png_write_image_16bit and png_write_image_8bit
  causes heap buffer over-read when the caller provides a negative row stride (for bottom-up
  image layouts) or a stride exceeding 65535 bytes. The bug was introduced in libpng 1.6.26
  (October 2016) by casts added to silence compiler warnings on 16-bit systems. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 1.6.54.
