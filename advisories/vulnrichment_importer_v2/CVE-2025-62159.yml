aliases: []
summary: External Secrets Operator reads information from a third-party service and automatically
  injects the values as Kubernetes Secrets. A vulnerability was discovered in the BeyondTrust
  provider implementation for External Secrets Operator versions 0.10.1 through 0.19.2. The
  provider previously retrieved Kubernetes secrets directly, without validating the namespace
  context or the type of secret store. This allowed unauthorized cross-namespace secret access,
  violating security boundaries and potentially exposing sensitive credentials. In version 0.20.0,
  the provider code was updated to use the `resolvers.SecretKeyRef` utility, which enforces
  namespace validation and only allows cross-namespace access for `ClusterSecretStore` types.
  This ensures secrets are only retrieved from the correct namespace, mitigating the risk of
  unauthorized access. All users should upgrade to the latest version containing this fix. As
  a workaround, use a policy engine such as Kyverno or OPA to prevent using BeyondTrust provider
  and/or validate the `(Cluster)SecretStore` and ensure the namespace may only be set when using
  a `ClusterSecretStore`.
