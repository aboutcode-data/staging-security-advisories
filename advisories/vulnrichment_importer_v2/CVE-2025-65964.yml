aliases: []
summary: n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. Versions 0.123.1 through 1.119.1
  do not have adequate protections to prevent RCE through the project's pre-commit hooks. The
  Add Config operation allows workflows to set arbitrary Git configuration values, including
  core.hooksPath, which can point to a malicious Git hook that executes arbitrary commands on
  the n8n host during subsequent Git operations. Exploitation requires the ability to create
  or modify an n8n workflow using the Git node. This issue is fixed in version 1.119.2. Workarounds
  include excluding the Git Node (Docs) and avoiding cloning or interacting with untrusted repositories
  using the Git Node.
