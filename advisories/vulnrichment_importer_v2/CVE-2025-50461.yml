aliases: []
summary: A deserialization vulnerability exists in Volcengine's verl 3.0.0, specifically in
  the scripts/model_merger.py script when using the "fsdp" backend. The script calls torch.load()
  with weights_only=False on user-supplied .pt files, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary
  code if a maliciously crafted model file is loaded. An attacker can exploit this by convincing
  a victim to download and place a malicious model file in a local directory with a specific
  filename pattern. This vulnerability may lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges
  of the user running the script.
