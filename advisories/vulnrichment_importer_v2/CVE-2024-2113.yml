summary: The Ninja Forms Contact Form – The Drag and Drop Form Builder for WordPress plugin
  for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including,
  3.8.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the nf_download_all_subs AJAX

  submission to a publicly accessible location via a forged request granted they can trick a
  site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
