aliases: []
summary: AOL versions up to and including 9.5 includes an ActiveX control (Phobos.dll) that
  exposes a method called Import() via the Phobos.Playlist COM object. This method is vulnerable
  to a stack-based buffer overflow when provided with an excessively long string argument. Exploitation
  allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user, but only when
  the malicious HTML file is opened locally, due to the control not being marked safe for scripting
  or initialization. AOL remains an active and supported brand offering services like AOL Mail
  and AOL Desktop Gold, but the legacy AOL 9.5 desktop software—specifically the version containing
  the vulnerable Phobos.dll ActiveX control—is long discontinued and no longer maintained.
