aliases: []
summary: Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. Prior to version 2.1.7, Claude Code failed to
  strictly enforce deny rules configured in settings.json when accessing files through symbolic
  links. If a user explicitly denied Claude Code access to a file (such as /etc/passwd) and
  Claude Code had access to a symbolic link pointing to that file, it was possible for Claude
  Code to read the restricted file through the symlink without triggering deny rule enforcement.
  This issue has been patched in version 2.1.7.
