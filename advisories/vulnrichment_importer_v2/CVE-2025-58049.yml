summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications
  built on top of it. In versions from 14.4.2 to before 16.4.8, 16.5.0-rc-1 to before 16.10.7,
  and 17.0.0-rc-1 to before 17.4.0-rc-1, the PDF export jobs store sensitive cookies unencrypted
  in job statuses. XWiki shouldn't store passwords in plain text, and it shouldn't be possible
  to gain access to plain text passwords by gaining access to, e.g., a backup of the data directory.
  This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 16.4.8, 16.10.7, and 17.4.0-rc-1.
