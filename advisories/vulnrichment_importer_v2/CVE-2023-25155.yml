aliases: []
summary: Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. Authenticated users issuing specially
  crafted `SRANDMEMBER`, `ZRANDMEMBER`, and `HRANDFIELD` commands can trigger an integer overflow,
  resulting in a runtime assertion and termination of the Redis server process. This problem
  affects all Redis versions. Patches were released in Redis version(s) 6.0.18, 6.2.11 and 7.0.9.
