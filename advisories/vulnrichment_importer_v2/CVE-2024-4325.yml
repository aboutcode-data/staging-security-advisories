aliases: []
summary: A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the gradio-app/gradio
  version 4.21.0, specifically within the `/queue/join` endpoint and the `save_url_to_cache`
  function. The vulnerability arises when the `path` value, obtained from the user and expected
  to be a URL, is used to make an HTTP request without sufficient validation checks. This flaw
  allows an attacker to send crafted requests that could lead to unauthorized access to the
  local network or the AWS metadata endpoint, thereby compromising the security of internal
  servers.
