aliases: []
summary: CodeIgniter Shield provides authentication and authorization for the CodeIgniter 4
  PHP framework. An improper implementation was found in the password storage process. All hashed
  passwords stored in Shield v1.0.0-beta.3 or earlier are easier to crack than expected due
  to the vulnerability. Therefore, they should be removed as soon as possible. If an attacker
  gets (1) the user's hashed password by Shield, and (2) the hashed password (SHA-384 hash without
  salt) from somewhere, the attacker may easily crack the user's password. Upgrade to Shield
  v1.0.0-beta.4 or later to fix this issue. After upgrading, all users’ hashed passwords should
  be updated (saved to the database). There are no known workarounds.
