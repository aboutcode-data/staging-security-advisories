aliases: []
summary: Delta Industrial Automation DIALink versions prior to v1.5.0.0 Beta 4 uses an external
  input to construct a pathname intended to identify a file or directory located underneath
  a restricted parent directory. However, the software does not properly neutralize special
  elements within the pathname, which can cause the pathname to resolve to a location outside
  of the restricted directory.
