summary: |
  Concrete CMS versions 9.0.0 through 9.3.2 are affected by a stored XSS vulnerability in the generate dashboard board
  instance functionality. The Name input field does not check the input sufficiently letting a rogue administrator have the capability to inject malicious
  JavaScript code. The Concrete CMS security team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v4 score of 4.6 with a vector of CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:A/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N. Concrete versions below 9 are not affected by this vulnerability.Thanks fhAnso for reporting. (CNA updated this risk rank on 17 Jan 2025 by lowering the AC based on CVSS 4.0 documentation that access privileges should not be considered for AC).
