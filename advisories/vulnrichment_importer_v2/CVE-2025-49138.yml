aliases: []
summary: HAX CMS PHP allows users to manage their microsite universe with a PHP backend. Prior
  to version 11.0.0, an authenticated Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in the HAXCMS
  saveOutline endpoint allows a low-privileged user to read arbitrary files on the server by
  manipulating the location field written into site.json. This enables attackers to exfiltrate
  sensitive system files such as /etc/passwd, application secrets, or configuration files accessible
  to the web server (www-data). The vulnerability stems from the way the HAXCMS backend handles
  the location field in the site's outline. When a user sends a POST request to /system/api/saveOutline,
  the backend stores the provided location value directly into the site.json file associated
  with the site, without validating or sanitizing the input. Later the location parameter is
  interpreted by the CMS to resolve and load the content for a given node. If the location field
  contains a relative path like `../../../etc/passwd`, the application will attempt to read
  and render that file. Version 11.0.0 fixes the issue.
