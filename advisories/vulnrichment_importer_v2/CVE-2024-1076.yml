aliases: []
summary: The SSL Zen  WordPress plugin before 4.6.0 does not properly prevent directory listing
  of the private keys folder, as it only relies on the use of .htaccess to prevent visitors
  from accessing the site's generated private keys, which allows an attacker to read them if
  the site runs on a server who doesn't support .htaccess files, like NGINX.
