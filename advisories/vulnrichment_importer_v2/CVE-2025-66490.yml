aliases: []
summary: 'Traefik is an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. For versions prior to 2.11.32
  and 2.11.31 through 3.6.2, requests using PathPrefix, Path or PathRegex matchers can bypass
  path normalization. When Traefik uses path-based routing, requests containing URL-encoded
  restricted characters (/, \, Null, ;, ?, #) can bypass the middleware chain and reach unintended
  backends. For example, a request to http://mydomain.example.com/admin%2F could reach service-a
  without triggering my-security-middleware, bypassing security controls for the /admin/ path.
  This issue is fixed in versions 2.11.32 and 3.6.3.'
