aliases: []
summary: A session management flaw in Nagios Network Analyzer 2024R1.0.3 allows an attacker
  to reuse session tokens even after a user logs out, leading to unauthorized access and account
  takeover. This occurs due to insufficient session expiration, where session tokens remain
  valid beyond logout, allowing an attacker to impersonate users and perform actions on their
  behalf.
