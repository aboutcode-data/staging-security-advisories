aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Service Catalog
  could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
  against a user of the web-based management interface. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  validation of user-supplied input that is processed by the web-based management interface.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click
  a maliciously crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
  script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive browser-based information.
