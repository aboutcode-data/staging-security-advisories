aliases: []
summary: The Stackable – Page Builder Gutenberg Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  CSS Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.13.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to embed untrusted style information into comments resulting in a possibility of
  data exfiltration such as admin nonces with limited impact. These nonces could be used to
  perform CSRF attacks within a limited time window. The presence of other plugins may make
  additional nonces available, which may pose a risk in plugins that don't perform capability
  checks to protect AJAX actions or other actions reachable by lower-privileged users.
