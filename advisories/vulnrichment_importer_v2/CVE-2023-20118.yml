aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business Routers\
  \ RV016, RV042, RV042G, RV082, RV320, and RV325 Routers could allow an authenticated, remote\
  \ attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is\
  \ due to improper validation of user input within incoming HTTP packets. An attacker could\
  \ exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web-based management\
  \ interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain root-level privileges and\
  \ access unauthorized data. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have\
  \ valid administrative credentials on the affected device.\r\n\r Cisco has not and will not\
  \ release software updates that address this vulnerability.   However, administrators may\
  \ disable the affected feature as described in the Workarounds [\"#workarounds\"] section.\r\
  \n\r  {{value}} [\"%7b%7bvalue%7d%7d\"])}]]"
