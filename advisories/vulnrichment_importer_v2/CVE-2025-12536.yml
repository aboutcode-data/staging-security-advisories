aliases: []
summary: The SureForms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.13.1 via the '_srfm_email_notification' post meta
  registration. This is due to setting the 'auth_callback' parameter to '__return_true', which
  allows unauthenticated access to the metadata. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to extract sensitive data including email notification configurations, which frequently
  contain vendor-provided CRM/help desk dropbox addresses, CC/BCC recipients, and notification
  templates that can be abused to inject malicious data into downstream systems.
