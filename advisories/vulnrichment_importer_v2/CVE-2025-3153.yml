aliases: []
summary: "Concrete CMS version 9 below 9.4.0RC2 and versions below 8.5.20 are vulnerable to\
  \ CSRF and XSS in the Concrete CMS Address attribute because addresses are not properly sanitized\
  \ in the output when a country is not specified.  Attackers are limited to individuals whom\
  \ a site administrator has granted the ability to fill in an address attribute. It is possible\
  \ for the attacker to glean limited information from the site but amount and type is restricted\
  \ by mitigating controls and the level of access of the attacker. Limited data modification\
  \ is possible. The dashboard page itself could be rendered unavailable. \nThe fix only sanitizes\
  \ new data uploaded post update to Concrete CMS 9.4.0RC2. Existing database entries added\
  \ before the update will still be “live” if there were successful exploits added under previous\
  \ versions; a database search is recommended. The Concrete CMS security team gave this vulnerability\
  \ CVSS v.4.0 score of 5.1  with vector CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:P/VC:L/VI:L/VA:L/SC:L/SI:L/SA:L Thanks\
  \ Myq Larson for reporting."
