aliases: []
summary: cmark-gfm is GitHub's fork of cmark, a CommonMark parsing and rendering library and
  program in C. In versions prior to 0.29.0.gfm.6 a polynomial time complexity issue in cmark-gfm's
  autolink extension may lead to unbounded resource exhaustion and subsequent denial of service.
  Users may verify the patch by running `python3 -c 'print("![l"* 100000 + "\n")' | ./cmark-gfm
  -e autolink`, which will resource exhaust on unpatched cmark-gfm but render correctly on patched
  cmark-gfm. This vulnerability has been patched in 0.29.0.gfm.6. Users are advised to upgrade.
  Users unable to upgrade should disable the use of the autolink extension.
