aliases: []
summary: Some Sciener-based locks support plaintext message processing over Bluetooth Low Energy,
  allowing unencrypted malicious commands to be passed to the lock. These malicious commands,
  less then 16 bytes in length, will be processed by the lock as if they were encrypted communications.
  This can be further exploited by an attacker to compromise the lock's integrity.
