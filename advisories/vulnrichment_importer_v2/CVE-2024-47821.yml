aliases: []
summary: pyLoad is a free and open-source Download Manager. The folder `/.pyload/scripts` has
  scripts which are run when certain actions are completed, for e.g. a download is finished.
  By downloading a executable file to a folder in /scripts and performing the respective action,
  remote code execution can be achieved in versions prior to 0.5.0b3.dev87. A file can be downloaded
  to such a folder by changing the download folder to a folder in `/scripts` path and using
  the `/flashgot` API to download the file. This vulnerability allows an attacker with access
  to change the settings on a pyload server to execute arbitrary code and completely compromise
  the system. Version 0.5.0b3.dev87 fixes this issue.
