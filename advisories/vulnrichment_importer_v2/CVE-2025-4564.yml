aliases: []
summary: The TicketBAI Facturas para WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
  file deletion due to insufficient file path validation via the 'delpdf' action in all versions
  up to, and including, 3.18. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete
  arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right
  file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
