aliases: []
summary: russh is a Rust SSH client and server library. Starting in version 0.34.0 and prior
  to versions 0.36.2 and 0.37.1, Diffie-Hellman key validation is insufficient, which can lead
  to insecure shared secrets and therefore breaks confidentiality. Connections between a russh
  client and server or those of a russh peer with some other misbehaving peer are most likely
  to be problematic. These may vulnerable to eavesdropping. Most other implementations reject
  such keys, so this is mainly an interoperability issue in such a case. This issue is fixed
  in versions 0.36.2 and 0.37.1
