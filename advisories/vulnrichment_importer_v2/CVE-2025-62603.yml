aliases: []
summary: "Fast DDS is a C++ implementation of the DDS (Data Distribution Service) standard of\
  \ the OMG (Object Management Group\n). ParticipantGenericMessage is the DDS Security control-message\
  \ container that carries not only the handshake but also on\ngoing security-control traffic\
  \ after the handshake, such as crypto-token exchange, rekeying, re-authentication, and token\
  \ \ndelivery for newly appearing endpoints. On receive, the CDR parser is invoked first and\
  \ deserializes the `message_data` (i\n.e., the `DataHolderSeq`) via the `readParticipantGenericMessage\
  \ → readDataHolderSeq` path. The `DataHolderSeq` is parsed \nsequentially: a sequence count\
  \ (`uint32`), and for each DataHolder the `class_id` string (e.g. `DDS:Auth:PKI-DH:1.0+Req`),\n\
  \ string properties (a sequence of key/value pairs), and binary properties (a name plus an\
  \ octet-vector). The parser operat\nes at a stateless level and does not know higher-layer\
  \ state (for example, whether the handshake has already completed), s\no it fully unfolds\
  \ the structure before distinguishing legitimate from malformed traffic. Because RTPS permits\
  \ duplicates,\n delays, and retransmissions, a receiver must perform at least minimal structural\
  \ parsing to check identity and sequence n\numbers before discarding or processing a message;\
  \ the current implementation, however, does not \"peek\" only at a minimal\n header and instead\
  \ parses the entire `DataHolderSeq`. As a result, prior to versions 3.4.1, 3.3.1, and 2.6.11,\
  \ this parsi\nng behavior can trigger an out-of-memory condition and remotely terminate the\
  \ process. Versions 3.4.1, 3.3.1, and 2.6.11 p\natch the issue."
