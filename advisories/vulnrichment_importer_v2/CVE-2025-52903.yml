aliases: []
summary: File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it
  can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit files. In version 2.32.0, the Command
  Execution feature of File Browser only allows the execution of shell command which have been
  predefined on a user-specific allowlist. Many tools allow the execution of arbitrary different
  commands, rendering this limitation void. The concrete impact depends on the commands being
  granted to the attacker, but the large number of standard commands allowing the execution
  of subcommands makes it likely that every user having the `Execute commands` permissions can
  exploit this vulnerability. Everyone who can exploit it will have full code execution rights
  with the uid of the server process. Until this issue is fixed, the maintainers recommend to
  completely disable `Execute commands` for all accounts. Since the command execution is an
  inherently dangerous feature that is not used by all deployments, it should be possible to
  completely disable it in the application's configuration. As a defense-in-depth measure, organizations
  not requiring command execution should operate the Filebrowser from a distroless container
  image. A patch version has been pushed to disable the feature for all existent installations,
  and making it opt-in. A warning has been added to the documentation and is printed on the
  console if the feature is enabled. Due to the project being in maintenance-only mode, the
  bug has not been fixed. The fix is tracked on pull request 5199.
