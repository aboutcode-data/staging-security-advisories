aliases: []
summary: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.4.4 of the `stable`
  branch, version 3.5.0.beta5 of the `beta` branch, and version 3.5.0.beta6-dev of the `tests-passed`
  branch, certain invites via email may result in HTML injection in the email body if the topic
  title includes HTML. This includes inviting someone (without an account) to a PM and inviting
  someone (without an account) to a topic with a custom message. This issue is patched in version
  3.4.4 of the `stable` branch, version 3.5.0.beta5 of the `beta` branch, and version 3.5.0.beta6-dev
  of the `tests-passed` branch. This can be worked around if the relevant templates are overridden
  without `{topic_title}`.
