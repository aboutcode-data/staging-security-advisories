aliases: []
summary: WordPress Core is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via user display names
  in the Avatar block in various versions up to 6.5.2 due to insufficient output escaping on
  the display name. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses an injected page. In addition, it also makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that have the comment block present and display the
  comment author's avatar.
