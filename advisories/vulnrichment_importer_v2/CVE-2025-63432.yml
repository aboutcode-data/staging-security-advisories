summary: Xtooltech Xtool AnyScan Android Application 4.40.40 and prior is Missing SSL Certificate
  Validation. The application fails to properly validate the TLS certificate from its update
  server. An attacker on the same network can exploit this vulnerability by performing a Man-in-the-Middle
  (MITM) attack to intercept, decrypt, and modify traffic between the application and the update
  server. This serves as the basis for further attacks, including Remote Code Execution.
