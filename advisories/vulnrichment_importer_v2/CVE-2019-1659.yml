aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Identity Services Engine (ISE) integration feature of Cisco
  Prime Infrastructure (PI) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle
  attack against the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) tunnel established between ISE and PI. The vulnerability
  is due to improper validation of the server SSL certificate when establishing the SSL tunnel
  with ISE. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a crafted SSL certificate
  and could then intercept communications between the ISE and PI. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to view and alter potentially sensitive information that the ISE maintains
  about clients that are connected to the network. This vulnerability affects Cisco Prime Infrastructure
  Software Releases 2.2 through 3.4.0 when the PI server is integrated with ISE, which is disabled
  by default.
