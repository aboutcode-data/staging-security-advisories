summary: A vulnerability in Veeam Backup & Replication allows low-privileged users to leak all
  saved credentials in plaintext. This is achieved by calling a series of methods over an external
  protocol, ultimately retrieving the credentials using a malicious setup on the attacker's
  side. This exposes sensitive data, which could be used for further attacks, including unauthorized
  access to systems managed by the platform.
