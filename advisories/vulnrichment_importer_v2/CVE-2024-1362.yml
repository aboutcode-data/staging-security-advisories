aliases: []
summary: The Colibri Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.253. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the cp_shortcode_refresh() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to execute arbitrary shortcodes via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
