aliases: []
summary: Chall-Manager is a platform-agnostic system able to start Challenges on Demand of a
  player. When decoding a scenario (i.e. a zip archive), the size of the decoded content is
  not checked, potentially leading to zip bombs decompression. Exploitation does not require
  authentication nor authorization, so anyone can exploit it. It should nonetheless not be exploitable
  as it is highly recommended to bury Chall-Manager deep within the infrastructure due to its
  large capabilities, so no users could reach the system. Patch has been implemented by commit
  14042aa and shipped in v0.1.4.
