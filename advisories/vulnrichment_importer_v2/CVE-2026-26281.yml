aliases: []
summary: InvoicePlane is a self-hosted open source application for managing invoices, clients,
  and payments. A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Sumex invoice view
  allows an authenticated user with client and invoice management privileges to execute arbitrary
  JavaScript in the browser of any user viewing the invoice. This can lead to session hijacking,
  data theft, or other malicious actions on behalf of the victim user. Version 1.7.1 patches
  the issue.
