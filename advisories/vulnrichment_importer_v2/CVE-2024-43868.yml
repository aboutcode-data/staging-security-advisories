aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  riscv/purgatory: align riscv_kernel_entry

  When alignment handling is delegated to the kernel, everything must be
  word-aligned in purgatory, since the trap handler is then set to the
  kexec one. Without the alignment, hitting the exception would
  ultimately crash. On other occasions, the kernel's handler would take
  care of exceptions.
  This has been tested on a JH7110 SoC with oreboot and its SBI delegating
  unaligned access exceptions and the kernel configured to handle them.
