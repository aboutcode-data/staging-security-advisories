aliases: []
summary: OpenEMR is a free and open source electronic health records and medical practice management
  application. Prior to version 8.0.0, a Broken Access Control vulnerability exists in OpenEMR’s
  edih_main.php endpoint, which allows any authenticated user—including low-privilege roles
  like Receptionist—to access EDI log files by manipulating the log_select parameter in a GET
  request. The back-end fails to enforce role-based access control (RBAC), allowing sensitive
  system logs to be accessed outside the GUI-enforced permission boundaries. Version 8.0.0 fixes
  the issue.
