summary: Netskope was notified about a potential gap in its agent (NS Client) on Windows systems.  If
  this gap is successfully exploited, an unprivileged user can trigger a heap overflow in the
  epdlpdrv.sys driver, leading to a Blue-Screen-of-Death (BSOD). Successful exploitation can
  also potentially be performed by an unprivileged user whose NS Client is configured to use
  Endpoint DLP. A successful exploit can result in a denial-of-service for the local machine.
