  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  block: release rq qos structures for queue without disk

  blkcg_init_queue() may add rq qos structures to request queue, previously
  blk_cleanup_queue() calls rq_qos_exit() to release them, but commit
  8e141f9eb803 ("block: drain file system I/O on del_gendisk")
  moves rq_qos_exit() into del_gendisk(), so memory leak is caused
  because queues may not have disk, such as un-present scsi luns, nvme
  admin queue, ...

  Fixes the issue by adding rq_qos_exit() to blk_cleanup_queue() back.

  BTW, v5.18 won't need this patch any more since we move
  blkcg_init_queue()/blkcg_exit_queue() into disk allocation/release
  handler, and patches have been in for-5.18/block.
