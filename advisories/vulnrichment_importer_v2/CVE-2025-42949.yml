aliases: []
summary: Due to a missing authorization check in the ABAP Platform, an authenticated user with
  elevated privileges could bypass authorization restrictions for common transactions by leveraging
  the SQL Console. This could enable an attacker to access and read the contents of database
  tables without proper authorization, leading to a significant compromise of data confidentiality.
  However, the integrity and availability of the system remain unaffected.
