summary: The File Manager Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Limited JavaScript File
  Upload in all versions up to, and including, 8.3.9. This is due to a lack of proper checks
  on allowed file types. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers, with permissions
  granted by an administrator, to upload .css and .js files, which could lead to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting.
