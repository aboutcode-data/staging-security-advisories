aliases: []
summary: libsignal-service-rs is a Rust version of the libsignal-service-java library which
  implements the core functionality to communicate with Signal servers. Prior to commit 82d70f6720e762898f34ae76b0894b0297d9b2f8,
  plaintext content envelopes could be injected by a server or a malicious client, and may have
  been able to bypass the end-to-end encryption and authentication. The vulnerability is fixed
  per 82d70f6720e762898f34ae76b0894b0297d9b2f8. The `Metadata` struct contains an additional
  `was_encrypted` field, which breaks the API, but should be easily resolvable. No known workarounds
  are available.
