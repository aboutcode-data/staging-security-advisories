aliases: []
summary: Calero VeraSMART versions prior to 2022 R1 expose an unauthenticated .NET Remoting
  HTTP service on TCP port 8001. The service publishes default ObjectURIs (including EndeavorServer.rem
  and RemoteFileReceiver.rem) and permits the use of SOAP and binary formatters with TypeFilterLevel
  set to Full. An unauthenticated remote attacker can invoke the exposed remoting endpoints
  to perform arbitrary file read and write operations via the WebClient class. This allows retrieval
  of sensitive files such as WebRoot\\web.config, which may disclose IIS machineKey validation
  and decryption keys. An attacker can use these keys to generate a malicious ASP.NET ViewState
  payload and achieve remote code execution within the IIS application context. Additionally,
  supplying a UNC path can trigger outbound SMB authentication from the service account, potentially
  exposing NTLMv2 hashes for relay or offline cracking.
