aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the boot process of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an authenticated,\
  \ local attacker to bypass Cisco IOS XR image signature verification and load unverified software\
  \ on an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have root-system\
  \ privileges on the affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to incomplete validation\
  \ of files in the boot verification process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by manipulating the system configuration options to bypass some of the integrity checks\
  \ that are performed during the boot process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker\
  \ to control the boot configuration, which could enable them to bypass the requirement to\
  \ run Cisco-signed images or alter the security properties of the running system.\r\nNote:\
  \ Because exploitation of this vulnerability could result in the attacker bypassing Cisco\
  \ image verification, Cisco has raised the Security Impact Rating (SIR) of this advisory from\
  \ Medium to High."
