aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the implementation of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)\
  \ feature of Cisco&nbsp;IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to\
  \ cause the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) process to crash, resulting in a denial of service\
  \ (DoS) condition.\r\nThis vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of a specific RPKI\
  \ to Router (RTR) Protocol packet header. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by\
  \ compromising the RPKI validator server and sending a specifically crafted RTR packet to\
  \ an affected device. Alternatively, the attacker could use man-in-the-middle techniques to\
  \ impersonate the RPKI validator server and send a specifically crafted RTR response packet\
  \ over the established RTR TCP connection to the affected device. A successful exploit could\
  \ allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition because the BGP process could constantly restart\
  \ and BGP routing could become unstable.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address\
  \ this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.This advisory\
  \ is part of the September 2021 release of the Cisco&nbsp;IOS XR Software Security Advisory\
  \ Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see ."
