aliases: []
summary: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. An attacker can craft a TFLite
  model that would allow limited reads and writes outside of arrays in TFLite. This exploits
  missing validation in the conversion from sparse tensors to dense tensors. The fix is included
  in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3,
  and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range. Users are advised
  to upgrade as soon as possible.
