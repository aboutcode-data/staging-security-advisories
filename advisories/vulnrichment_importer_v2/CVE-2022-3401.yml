aliases: []
summary: The Bricks theme for WordPress is vulnerable to remote code execution due to the theme
  allowing site editors to include executable code blocks in website content in versions 1.2
  to 1.5.3. This, combined with the missing authorization vulnerability (CVE-2022-3400), makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber, can
  edit any page, post, or template on the vulnerable WordPress website and inject a code execution
  block that can be used to achieve remote code execution.
