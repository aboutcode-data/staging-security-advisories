  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  openrisc: traps: Don't send signals to kernel mode threads

  OpenRISC exception handling sends signals to user processes on floating
  point exceptions and trap instructions (for debugging) among others.
  There is a bug where the trap handling logic may send signals to kernel
  threads, we should not send these signals to kernel threads, if that
  happens we treat it as an error.

  This patch adds conditions to die if the kernel receives these
  exceptions in kernel mode code.
