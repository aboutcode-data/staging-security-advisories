aliases: []
summary: Omni Secure Files plugin versions prior to 0.1.14 contain an arbitrary file upload
  vulnerability in the bundled plupload example endpoint. The /wp-content/plugins/omni-secure-files/plupload/examples/upload.php
  handler allows unauthenticated uploads without enforcing safe file type restrictions, enabling
  an attacker to place attacker-controlled files under the plugin's uploads directory. This
  can lead to remote code execution if a server-executable file type is uploaded and subsequently
  accessed.
