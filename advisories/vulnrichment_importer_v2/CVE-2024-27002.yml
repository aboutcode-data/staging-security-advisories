  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  clk: mediatek: Do a runtime PM get on controllers during probe

  mt8183-mfgcfg has a mutual dependency with genpd during the probing
  stage, which leads to a deadlock in the following call stack:

  CPU0:  genpd_lock --> clk_prepare_lock
  genpd_power_off_work_fn()
   genpd_lock()
   generic_pm_domain::power_off()
      clk_unprepare()
        clk_prepare_lock()

  CPU1: clk_prepare_lock --> genpd_lock
  clk_register()
    __clk_core_init()
      clk_prepare_lock()
      clk_pm_runtime_get()
        genpd_lock()

  Do a runtime PM get at the probe function to make sure clk_register()
  won't acquire the genpd lock. Instead of only modifying mt8183-mfgcfg,
  do this on all mediatek clock controller probings because we don't
  believe this would cause any regression.

  Verified on MT8183 and MT8192 Chromebooks.
