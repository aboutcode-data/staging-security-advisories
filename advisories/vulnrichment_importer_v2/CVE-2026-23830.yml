aliases: []
summary: SandboxJS is a JavaScript sandboxing library. Versions prior to 0.8.26 have a sandbox
  escape vulnerability due to `AsyncFunction` not being isolated in `SandboxFunction`. The library
  attempts to sandbox code execution by replacing the global `Function` constructor with a safe,
  sandboxed version (`SandboxFunction`). This is handled in `utils.ts` by mapping `Function`
  to `sandboxFunction` within a map used for lookups. However, before version 0.8.26, the library
  did not include mappings for `AsyncFunction`, `GeneratorFunction`, and `AsyncGeneratorFunction`.
  These constructors are not global properties but can be accessed via the `.constructor` property
  of an instance (e.g., `(async () => {}).constructor`). In `executor.ts`, property access is
  handled. When code running inside the sandbox accesses `.constructor` on an async function
  (which the sandbox allows creating), the `executor` retrieves the property value. Since `AsyncFunction`
  was not in the safe-replacement map, the `executor` returns the actual native host `AsyncFunction`
  constructor. Constructors for functions in JavaScript (like `Function`, `AsyncFunction`) create
  functions that execute in the global scope. By obtaining the host `AsyncFunction` constructor,
  an attacker can create a new async function that executes entirely outside the sandbox context,
  bypassing all restrictions and gaining full access to the host environment (Remote Code Execution).
  Version 0.8.26 patches this vulnerability.
