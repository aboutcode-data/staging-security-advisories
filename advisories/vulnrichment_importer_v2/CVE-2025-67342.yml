summary: RuoYi versions 4.8.1 and earlier is affected by a stored XSS vulnerability in the /system/menu/edit
  endpoint. While the endpoint is protected by an XSS filter, the protection can be bypassed.
  Additionally, because the menu is shared across all users, any user with menu modification
  permissions can impact all users by exploiting this stored XSS vulnerability.
