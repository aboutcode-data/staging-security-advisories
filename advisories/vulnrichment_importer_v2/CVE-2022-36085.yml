aliases: []
summary: Open Policy Agent (OPA) is an open source, general-purpose policy engine. The Rego
  compiler provides a (deprecated) `WithUnsafeBuiltins` function, which allows users to provide
  a set of built-in functions that should be deemed unsafe — and as such rejected — by the compiler
  if encountered in the policy compilation stage. A bypass of this protection has been found,
  where the use of the `with` keyword to mock such a built-in function (a feature introduced
  in OPA v0.40.0), isn’t taken into account by `WithUnsafeBuiltins`. Multiple conditions need
  to be met in order to create an adverse effect. Version 0.43.1 contains a patch for this issue.
  As a workaround, avoid using the `WithUnsafeBuiltins` function and use the `capabilities`
  feature instead.
