aliases: []
summary: Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane.
  Prior to versions 1.14.14 and 1.15.8, a race condition in the Cilium agent can cause the agent
  to ignore labels that should be applied to a node. This could in turn cause CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicies
  intended for nodes with the ignored label to not apply, leading to policy bypass. This issue
  has been patched in Cilium v1.14.14 and v1.15.8 As the underlying issue depends on a race
  condition, users unable to upgrade can restart the Cilium agent on affected nodes until the
  affected policies are confirmed to be working as expected.
