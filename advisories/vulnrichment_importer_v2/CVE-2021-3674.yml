aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in rizin. The create_section_from_phdr function allocates space for
  ELF section data by processing the headers. Crafted values in the headers can cause out of
  bounds reads, which can lead to memory corruption and possibly code execution through the
  binary object's callback function.
