aliases: []
summary: A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in
  name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification
  and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to
  continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer.
  An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes
  on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or
  potentially remote code execution. Many platforms implement stack overflow protections which
  would mitigate against the risk of remote code execution. The risk may be further mitigated
  based on stack layout for any given platform/compiler. Pre-announcements of CVE-2022-3602
  described this issue as CRITICAL. Further analysis based on some of the mitigating factors
  described above have led this to be downgraded to HIGH. Users are still encouraged to upgrade
  to a new version as soon as possible. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting
  to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client
  authentication and a malicious client connects. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.7 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.0.3,3.0.4,3.0.5,3.0.6).
