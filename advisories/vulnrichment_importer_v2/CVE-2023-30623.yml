aliases: []
summary: '`embano1/wip` is a GitHub Action written in Bash. Prior to version 2, the  `embano1/wip`
  action uses the `github.event.pull_request.title` parameter in an insecure way. The title
  parameter is used in a run statement - resulting in a command injection vulnerability due
  to string interpolation. This vulnerability can be triggered by any user on GitHub. They just
  need to create a pull request with a commit message containing an exploit. (Note that first-time
  PR requests will not be run - but the attacker can submit a valid PR before submitting an
  invalid PR). The commit can be genuine, but the commit message can be malicious. This can
  be used to execute code on the GitHub runners and can be used to exfiltrate any secrets used
  in the CI pipeline, including repository tokens. Version 2 has a fix for this issue.'
