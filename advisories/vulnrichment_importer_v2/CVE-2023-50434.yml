aliases: []
summary: emdns_resolve_raw in emdns.c in emdns through fbd1eef calls strlen with an input that
  may not be '\0' terminated, leading to a stack-based buffer over-read. This can be triggered
  by a remote adversary that can send DNS requests to the emdns server. The impact could vary
  depending on the system libraries, compiler, and processor architecture. Code before be565c3
  is unaffected.
