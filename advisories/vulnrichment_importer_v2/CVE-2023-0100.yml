aliases: []
summary: In Eclipse BIRT, starting from version 2.6.2, the default configuration allowed to
  retrieve a report from the same host using an absolute HTTP path for the report parameter
  (e.g. __report=http://xyz.com/report.rptdesign). If the host indicated in the __report parameter
  matched the HTTP Host header value, the report would be retrieved. However, the Host header
  can be tampered with on some configurations where no virtual hosts are put in place (e.g.
  in the default configuration of Apache Tomcat) or when the default host points to the BIRT
  server. This vulnerability was patched on Eclipse BIRT 4.13.
