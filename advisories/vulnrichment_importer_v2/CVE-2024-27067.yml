  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  xen/evtchn: avoid WARN() when unbinding an event channel

  When unbinding a user event channel, the related handler might be
  called a last time in case the kernel was built with
  CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ. This might cause a WARN() in the handler.

  Avoid that by adding an "unbinding" flag to struct user_event which
  will short circuit the handler.
