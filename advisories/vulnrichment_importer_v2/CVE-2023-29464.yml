aliases: []
summary: FactoryTalk Linx, in the Rockwell Automation PanelView Plus, allows an unauthenticated
  threat actor to read data from memory via crafted malicious packets. Sending a size larger
  than the buffer size results in leakage of data from memory resulting in an information disclosure.
  If the size is large enough, it causes communications over the common industrial protocol
  to become unresponsive to any type of packet, resulting in a denial-of-service to FactoryTalk
  Linx over the common industrial protocol.
