aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the ROM Monitor (ROMMON) of Cisco IOS XE Software for Cisco Catalyst
  IE3200, IE3300, and IE3400 Rugged Series Switches, Cisco Catalyst IE3400 Heavy Duty Series
  Switches, and Cisco Embedded Services 3300 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated,
  physical attacker to execute unsigned code at system boot time. This vulnerability is due
  to incorrect validations of specific function arguments passed to a boot script when specific
  ROMMON variables are set. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by setting malicious
  values for a specific ROMMON variable. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute
  unsigned code and bypass the image verification check during the secure boot process of an
  affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have unauthenticated,
  physical access to the device or obtain privileged access to the root shell on the device.
