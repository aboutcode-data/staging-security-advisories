aliases: []
summary: A remote command execution vulnerability exists in gogs/gogs versions <=0.12.7 when
  deployed on a Windows server. The vulnerability arises due to improper validation of the `tree_path`
  parameter during file uploads. An attacker can set `tree_path=.git.` to upload a file into
  the .git directory, allowing them to write or rewrite the `.git/config` file. If the `core.sshCommand`
  is set, this can lead to remote command execution.
