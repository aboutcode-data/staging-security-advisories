aliases: []
summary: OpenRefine is a free, open source tool for working with messy data. Prior to version
  3.8.3, lack of cross-site request forgery protection on the `preview-expression` command means
  that visiting a malicious website could cause an attacker-controlled expression to be executed.
  The expression can contain arbitrary Clojure or Python code. The attacker must know a valid
  project ID of a project that contains at least one row, and the attacker must convince the
  victim to open a malicious webpage. Version 3.8.3 fixes the issue.
