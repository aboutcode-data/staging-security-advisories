aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the UDP forwarding code of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an\
  \ unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to bypass configured management plane protection policies\
  \ and access the Simple Network Management Plane (SNMP) server of an affected device.\r\n\r\
  \ This vulnerability is due to incorrect UDP forwarding programming when using SNMP with management\
  \ plane protection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to perform\
  \ an SNMP operation using broadcast as the destination address that could be processed by\
  \ an affected device that is configured with an SNMP server. A successful exploit could allow\
  \ the attacker to communicate to the device on the configured SNMP ports. Although an unauthenticated\
  \ attacker could send UDP datagrams to the configured SNMP port, only an authenticated user\
  \ can retrieve or modify data using SNMP requests."
