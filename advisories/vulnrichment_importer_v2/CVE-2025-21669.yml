aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  vsock/virtio: discard packets if the transport changes

  If the socket has been de-assigned or assigned to another transport,
  we must discard any packets received because they are not expected
  and would cause issues when we access vsk->transport.

  A possible scenario is described by Hyunwoo Kim in the attached link,
  where after a first connect() interrupted by a signal, and a second
  connect() failed, we can find `vsk->transport` at NULL, leading to a
  NULL pointer dereference.
