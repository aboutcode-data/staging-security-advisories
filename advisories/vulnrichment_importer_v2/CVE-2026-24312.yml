aliases: []
summary: An erroneous authorization check in SAP Business Workflow leads to privilege escalation.
  An authenticated administrative user can bypass role restrictions by leveraging permissions
  from a less sensitive function to execute unauthorized, high-privilege actions. This has a
  high impact on data integrity, with low impact on confidentiality and no impact on availability
  of the application.
