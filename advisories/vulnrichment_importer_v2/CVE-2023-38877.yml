aliases: []
summary: A host header injection vulnerability exists in gugoan's Economizzer v.0.9-beta1 and
  commit 3730880 (April 2023). By sending a specially crafted host header in the reset password
  request, it is possible to send password reset links to users which, once clicked, lead to
  an attacker-controlled server and thus leak the password reset token. This allows an attacker
  to reset other users' passwords.
