summary: Hitron CGNF-TWN 3.1.1.43-TWN-pre3 contains a command injection vulnerability in the
  telnet service. The issue arises due to improper input validation within the telnet command
  handling mechanism. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary commands
  through the telnet interface when prompted for inputs or commands. Successful exploitation
  could lead to remote code execution (RCE) under the privileges of the telnet user, potentially
  allowing unauthorized access to system settings and sensitive information.
