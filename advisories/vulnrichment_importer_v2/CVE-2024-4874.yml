aliases: []
summary: The Bricks Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.8 via the postId parameter due to missing validation
  on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level
  access and above, to modify posts and pages created by other users including admins. As a
  requirement for this, an admin would have to enable access to the editor specifically for
  such a user or enable it for all users with a certain user account type.
