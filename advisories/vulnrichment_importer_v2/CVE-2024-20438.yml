aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the REST API endpoints of Cisco NDFC could allow an authenticated,\
  \ low-privileged, remote attacker to read or write files on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis\
  \ vulnerability exists because of missing authorization controls on some REST API endpoints.\
  \ An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted API requests to an affected\
  \ endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform limited network-admin\
  \ functions such as reading device configuration information, uploading files, and modifying\
  \ uploaded files.\r\nNote: This vulnerability only affects a subset of REST API endpoints\
  \ and does not affect the web-based management interface."
