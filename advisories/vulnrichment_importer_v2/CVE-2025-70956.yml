aliases: []
summary: A State Pollution vulnerability was discovered in the TON Virtual Machine (TVM) before
  v2025.04. The issue exists in the RUNVM instruction logic (VmState::run_child_vm), which is
  responsible for initializing child virtual machines. The operation moves critical resources
  (specifically libraries and log) from the parent state to a new child state in a non-atomic
  manner. If an Out-of-Gas (OOG) exception occurs after resources are moved but before the state
  transition is finalized, the parent VM retains a corrupted state where these resources are
  emptied/invalid. Because RUNVM supports gas isolation, the parent VM continues execution with
  this corrupted state, leading to unexpected behavior or denial of service within the contract's
  context.
