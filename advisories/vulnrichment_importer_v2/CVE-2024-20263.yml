aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability with the access control list (ACL) management within a stacked switch
  configuration of Cisco Business 250 Series Smart Switches and Business 350 Series Managed
  Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass protection offered by a
  configured ACL on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of
  ACLs on a stacked configuration when either the primary or backup switches experience a full
  stack reload or power cycle. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted
  traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass
  configured ACLs, causing traffic to be dropped or forwarded in an unexpected manner. The attacker
  does not have control over the conditions that result in the device being in the vulnerable
  state. Note: In the vulnerable state, the ACL would be correctly applied on the primary devices
  but could be incorrectly applied to the backup devices.'
