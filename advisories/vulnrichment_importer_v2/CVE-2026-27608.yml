aliases: []
summary: Parse Dashboard is a standalone dashboard for managing Parse Server apps. In versions
  7.3.0-alpha.42 through 9.0.0-alpha.7, the AI Agent API endpoint (`POST /apps/:appId/agent`)
  does not enforce authorization. Authenticated users scoped to specific apps can access any
  other app's agent endpoint by changing the app ID in the URL. Read-only users are given the
  full master key instead of the read-only master key and can supply write permissions in the
  request body to perform write and delete operations. Only dashboards with `agent` configuration
  enabled are affected. The fix in version 9.0.0-alpha.8 adds per-app authorization checks and
  restricts read-only users to the `readOnlyMasterKey` with write permissions stripped server-side.
  As a workaround, remove the `agent` configuration block from your dashboard configuration.
  Dashboards without an `agent` config are not affected.
