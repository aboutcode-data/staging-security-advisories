aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Cisco Remote PHY Device Software could allow an authenticated, local
  attacker to execute commands on the underlying Linux shell of an affected device with root
  privileges. The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not properly sanitize
  user-supplied input. An attacker who has valid administrator access to an affected device
  could exploit this vulnerability by supplying certain CLI commands with crafted arguments.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands as the root user,
  which could result in a complete system compromise.
