aliases: []
summary: A use-after-free flaw was found in D-Bus Development branch <= 1.13.16, dbus-1.12.x
  stable branch <= 1.12.18, and dbus-1.10.x and older branches <= 1.10.30 when a system has
  multiple usernames sharing the same UID. When a set of policy rules references these usernames,
  D-Bus may free some memory in the heap, which is still used by data structures necessary for
  the other usernames sharing the UID, possibly leading to a crash or other undefined behaviors
