aliases: []
summary: esm.sh is a nobuild content delivery network(CDN) for modern web development. Prior
  to version 136, the esm.sh CDN service is vulnerable to path traversal during NPM package
  tarball extraction. An attacker can craft a malicious NPM package containing specially crafted
  file paths (e.g., package/../../tmp/evil.js). When esm.sh downloads and extracts this package,
  files may be written to arbitrary locations on the server, escaping the intended extraction
  directory. This issue has been patched in version 136.
