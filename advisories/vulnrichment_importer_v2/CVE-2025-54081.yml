aliases: []
summary: Sunshine is a self-hosted game stream host for Moonlight. Prior to version 2025.923.33222,
  the Windows service SunshineService is installed with an unquoted executable path. If Sunshine
  is installed in a directory whose name includes a space, the Service Control Manager (SCM)
  interprets the path incrementally and may execute a malicious binary placed earlier in the
  search string. This issue has been patched in version 2025.923.33222.
