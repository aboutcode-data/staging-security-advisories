aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the ingress packet processing path of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense
  (FTD) Software for interfaces that are configured either as Inline Pair or in Passive mode
  could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.
  The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation when Ethernet frames are processed. An
  attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious Ethernet frames through an
  affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker do either of the following:
  Fill the /ngfw partition on the device: A full /ngfw partition could result in administrators
  being unable to log in to the device (including logging in through the console port) or the
  device being unable to boot up correctly. Note: Manual intervention is required to recover
  from this situation. Customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center
  (TAC) to help recover a device in this condition. Cause a process crash: The process crash
  would cause the device to reload. No manual intervention is necessary to recover the device
  after the reload.'
