aliases: []
summary: eopkg is a Solus package manager implemented in python3. In versions prior to 4.4.0,
  a malicious package could escape the directory set by `--destdir`. This requires the installation
  of a package from a malicious or compromised source. Files in such packages would not be installed
  in the path given by `--destdir`, but on a different location on the host. The issue has been
  fixed in v4.4.0. Users only installing packages from the Solus repositories are not affected.
