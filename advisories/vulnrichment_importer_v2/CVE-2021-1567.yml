aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the DLL loading mechanism of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client
  for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a DLL hijacking attack
  on an affected device if the VPN Posture (HostScan) Module is installed on the AnyConnect
  client. This vulnerability is due to a race condition in the signature verification process
  for DLL files that are loaded on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a series of crafted interprocess communication (IPC) messages to the AnyConnect
  process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected
  device with SYSTEM privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid
  credentials on the Windows system.
