summary: Local Deep Research is an AI-powered research assistant for deep, iterative research.
  Versions 0.2.0 through 0.6.7 stored confidential information, including API keys, in a local
  SQLite database without encryption. This behavior was not clearly documented outside of the
  database architecture page. Users were not given the ability to configure the database location,
  allowing anyone with access to the container or host filesystem to retrieve sensitive data
  in plaintext by accessing the .db file. This is fixed in version 1.0.0.
