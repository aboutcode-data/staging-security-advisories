aliases: []
summary: Ubee EVW3226 cable modem/routers firmware versions up to and including 1.0.20 store
  configuration backup files in the web root after they are generated for download. These backup
  files remain accessible without authentication until the next reboot. A remote attacker on
  the local network can request 'Configuration_file.cfg' directly to obtain the backup archive.
  Because backup files are not encrypted, they expose sensitive information including the plaintext
  admin password, allowing full compromise of the device.
