aliases: []
summary: FastGPT is an AI Agent building platform. Due to the fact that FastGPT's web page acquisition
  nodes, HTTP nodes, etc. need to initiate data acquisition requests from the server, there
  are certain security issues. In addition to implementing internal network isolation in the
  deployment environment, this optimization has added stricter internal network address detection.
  This vulnerability is fixed in 4.14.7.
