aliases: []
summary: The Nexter Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via multiple widgets in all versions up to, and including, 4.5.4 due to insufficient input
  sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
  that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
