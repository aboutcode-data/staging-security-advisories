aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in certain CLI commands of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could
  allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host operating
  system with the privileges of the local user, aka Command Injection. These commands should
  have been restricted from this user. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation
  of CLI command user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating
  to the targeted device and issuing a CLI command with crafted user input. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system that should
  be restricted. The attacker would need to have valid user credentials for the device. Cisco
