aliases: []
summary: Fleet is open source device management software. In versions prior to 4.80.1, a vulnerability
  in Fleet’s configuration API could expose Google Calendar service account credentials to authenticated
  users with low-privilege roles. This may allow unauthorized access to Google Calendar resources
  associated with the service account. Fleet returns configuration data through an API endpoint
  that is accessible to authenticated users, including those with the lowest-privilege “Observer”
  role. In affected versions, Google Calendar service account credentials were not properly
  obfuscated before being returned. As a result, a low-privilege user could retrieve the service
  account’s private key material. Depending on how the Google Calendar integration is configured,
  this could allow unauthorized access to calendar data or other Google Workspace resources
  associated with the service account. This issue does not allow escalation of privileges within
  Fleet or access to device management functionality. Version 4.80.1 patches the issue. If an
  immediate upgrade is not possible, administrators should remove the Google Calendar integration
  from Fleet and rotate the affected Google service account credentials.
