aliases: []
summary: Zitadel is an open source identity management platform. ZITADEL's user account deactivation
  mechanism did not work correctly with service accounts. Deactivated service accounts retained
  the ability to request tokens, which could lead to unauthorized access to applications and
  resources. Versions 2.62.1, 2.61.1, 2.60.2, 2.59.3, 2.58.5, 2.57.5, 2.56.6, 2.55.8, and 2.54.10
  have been released which address this issue. Users are advised t upgrade. Users unable to
  upgrade may instead of deactivating the service account, consider creating new credentials
  and replacing the old ones wherever they are used. This effectively prevents the deactivated
  service account from being utilized. Be sure to revoke all existing authentication keys associated
  with the service account and to rotate the service account's password.
