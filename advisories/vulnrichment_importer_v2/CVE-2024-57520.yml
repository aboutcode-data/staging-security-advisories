summary: 'Insecure Permissions vulnerability in asterisk v22 allows a remote attacker to execute
  arbitrary code via the action_createconfig function. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier
  because the impact is limited to creating empty files outside of the Asterisk product directory
  (aka directory traversal) and the attack can only be performed by a privileged user who has
  the ability to manage the configuration.'
