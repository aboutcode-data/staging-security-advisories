aliases: []
summary: Vision UI is a collection of enterprise-grade, dependency-free modules for modern web
  projects. In versions 1.4.0 and below, the generateSecureId and getSecureRandomInt functions
  in security-kit versions prior to 3.5.0 (packaged in Vision UI 1.4.0 and below) are vulnerable
  to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. The generateSecureId(length) function directly used the
  length parameter to size a Uint8Array buffer, allowing attackers to exhaust server memory
  through repeated requests for large IDs since the previous 1024 limit was insufficient. The
  getSecureRandomInt(min, max) function calculated buffer size based on the range between min
  and max, where large ranges caused excessive memory allocation and CPU-intensive rejection-sampling
  loops that could hang the thread. This issue is fixed in version 1.5.0.
