aliases: []
summary: The HTML filter and csv-file search plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File
  Inclusion in versions up to, and including, 2.7 via the 'src' attribute of the 'csvsearch'
  shortcode. This allows authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above,
  to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code
  in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve
  code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included.
