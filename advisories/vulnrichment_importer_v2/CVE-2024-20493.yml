aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the login authentication functionality of the Remote Access SSL\
  \ VPN feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat\
  \ Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to deny further VPN\
  \ user authentications for several minutes, resulting in a temporary denial of service (DoS)\
  \ condition.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to ineffective handling of memory resources during\
  \ the authentication process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted\
  \ packets, which could cause resource exhaustion of the authentication process. A successful\
  \ exploit could allow the attacker to deny authentication for Remote Access SSL VPN users\
  \ for several minutes, resulting in a temporary DoS condition."
