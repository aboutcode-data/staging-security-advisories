summary: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Starting with version 2.9.0.beta5
  and prior to version 2.9.0.beta10, an incomplete quote can generate a JavaScript error which
  will crash the current page in the browser in some cases. Version 2.9.0.beta10 added a fix
  and tests to ensure incomplete quotes won't break the app. As a workaround, the quote can
  be fixed via the rails console.
