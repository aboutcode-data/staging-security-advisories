aliases: []
summary: The Shared Files – Frontend File Upload Form & Secure File Sharing plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via html File uploads in all versions up to,
  and including, 1.7.48 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the
  sanitize_file() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass the
  plugin’s MIME-only checks and inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
  a user accesses the html file.
