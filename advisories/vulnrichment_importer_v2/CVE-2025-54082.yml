aliases: []
summary: marshmallow-packages/nova-tiptap is a rich text editor for Laravel Nova based on tiptap.
  Prior to 5.7.0, a vulnerability was discovered in the marshmallow-packages/nova-tiptap Laravel
  Nova package that allows unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary files to any Laravel disk
  configured in the application. The vulnerability is due to missing authentication middleware
  (Nova and Nova.Auth) on the /nova-tiptap/api/file upload endpoint, the lack of validation
  on uploaded files (no MIME/type or extension restrictions), and the ability for an attacker
  to choose the disk parameter dynamically. This means an attacker can craft a custom form and
  send a POST request to /nova-tiptap/api/file, supplying a valid CSRF token, and upload executable
  or malicious files (e.g., .php, binaries) to public disks such as local, public, or s3. If
  a publicly accessible storage path is used (e.g. S3 with public access, or Laravel’s public
  disk), the attacker may gain the ability to execute or distribute arbitrary files — amounting
  to a potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) vector in some environments. This vulnerability
  was fixed in 5.7.0.
