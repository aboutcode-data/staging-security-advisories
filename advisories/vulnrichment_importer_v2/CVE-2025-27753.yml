summary: A SQLi vulnerability in RSMediaGallery component 1.7.4 - 2.1.6 for Joomla was discovered.
  The vulnerability is due to the use of unescaped user-supplied parameters in SQL queries within
  the dashboard component. This allows an authenticated attacker to inject malicious SQL code
  through unsanitized input fields, which are used directly in SQL queries. Exploiting this
  flaw can lead to unauthorized database access, data leakage, or modification of records.
