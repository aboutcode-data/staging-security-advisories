aliases: []
summary: The Spin Wheel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to client-side prize manipulation
  in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.0. This is due to the plugin trusting client-supplied
  prize selection data without server-side validation or randomization. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to manipulate which prize they win by modifying the 'prize_index'
  parameter sent to the server, allowing them to always select the most valuable prizes.
