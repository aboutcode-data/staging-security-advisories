aliases: []
summary: ejson2env allows users to decrypt EJSON secrets and export them as environment variables.
  Prior to version 2.0.8, the `ejson2env` tool has a vulnerability related to how it writes
  to `stdout`. Specifically, the tool is intended to write an export statement for environment
  variables and their values. However, due to inadequate output sanitization, there is a potential
  risk where variable names or values may include malicious content, resulting in additional
  unintended commands being output to `stdout`. If this output is improperly utilized in further
  command execution, it could lead to command injection, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary
  commands on the host system. Version 2.0.8 sanitizes output during decryption. Other mitigations
  involve avoiding use of `ejson2env` to decrypt untrusted user secrets and/or avoiding evaluating
  or executing the direct output from `ejson2env` without removing nonprintable characters.
