summary: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `ThreadPoolHandle`
  can be used to trigger a denial of service attack by allocating too much memory. This is because
  the `num_threads` argument is only checked to not be negative, but there is no upper bound
  on its value. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and
  still in supported range.
