aliases: []
summary: The messageformat package, an implementation of the Unicode MessageFormat 2 specification
  for JavaScript, is vulnerable to prototype pollution due to improper handling of message key
  paths in versions prior to 2.3.0. The flaw arises when processing nested message keys containing
  special characters (e.g., __proto__ ), which can lead to unintended modification of the JavaScript
  Object prototype. This vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to inject properties into
  the global object prototype via specially crafted message input, potentially causing denial
  of service or other undefined behaviors in applications using the affected component.
