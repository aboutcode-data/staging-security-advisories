aliases: []
summary: Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Affected versions
  are subject to a cross site request forgery vulnerability which allows attackers to elevate
  their privileges by mounting cross-origin attacks against authenticated high-privilege Grafana
  users (for example, Editors or Admins). An attacker can exploit this vulnerability for privilege
  escalation by tricking an authenticated user into inviting the attacker as a new user with
  high privileges. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds
  for this issue.
