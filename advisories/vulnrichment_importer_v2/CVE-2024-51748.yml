aliases: []
summary: 'Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology. An
  authenticated Kanboard admin can run arbitrary php code on the server in combination with
  a file write possibility. The user interface language is determined and loaded by the setting
  `application_language` in the `settings` table. Thus, an attacker who can upload a modified
  sqlite.db through the dedicated feature, has control over the filepath, which is loaded. Exploiting
  this vulnerability has one constraint: the attacker must be able to place a file (called translations.php)
  on the system. However, this is not impossible, think of anonymous FTP server or another application
  that allows uploading files. Once the attacker has placed its file with the actual php code
  as the payload, the attacker can craft a sqlite db settings, which uses path traversal to
  point to the directory, where the `translations.php` file is stored. Then gaining code execution
  after importing the crafted sqlite.db. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.42 and
  all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.'
