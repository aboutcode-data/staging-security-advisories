aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the Data Collection Agent (DCA) feature of Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN\
  \ Manager could allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain DCA user privileges on an affected\
  \ system. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid&nbsp;vmanage credentials\
  \ on the affected system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to the presence of a credential\
  \ file for the DCA user on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by accessing the filesystem as a low-privileged user and reading the file that contains\
  \ the DCA password from that affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker\
  \ to access another affected system and gain DCA user privileges.\r\nNote: Cisco Catalyst\
  \ SD-WAN Manager releases 20.18 and later are not affected by this vulnerability."
