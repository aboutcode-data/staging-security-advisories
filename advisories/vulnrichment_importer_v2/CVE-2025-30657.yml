aliases: []
summary: |
  An Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output vulnerability in the Sampling Route Record Daemon (SRRD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

  When a device configured for flow-monitoring receives a specific BGP update message, it is correctly processed internally by the routing protocol daemon (rpd), but when it's sent to SRRD it's encoded incorrectly which leads to a crash and momentary interruption of jflow processing until it automatically restarts. This issue does not affect traffic forwarding itself.
  This issue affects Junos OS: 



    *  All versions before 21.2R3-S9,
    *  21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S10,
    *  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S6,
    *  22.4 versions before 22.4R3,
    *  23.2 versions before 23.2R1-S2, 23.2R2.



  This issue does not affected Junos OS Evolved.
