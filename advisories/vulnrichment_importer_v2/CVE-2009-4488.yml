aliases: []
summary: 'Varnish 2.0.6 writes data to a log file without sanitizing non-printable characters,
  which might allow remote attackers to modify a window''s title, or possibly execute arbitrary
  commands or overwrite files, via an HTTP request containing an escape sequence for a terminal
  emulator.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this report, stating that "This is
  not a security problem in Varnish or any other piece of software which writes a logfile. The
  real problem is the mistaken belief that you can cat(1) a random logfile to your terminal
  safely.'
