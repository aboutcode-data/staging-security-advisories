aliases: []
summary: The Ditty plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions
  up to 3.1.38 via deserialization of untrusted input when adding a new ditty. This makes it
  possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject a
  PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present
  via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker
  to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
