aliases: []
summary: DNN (formerly DotNetNuke) is an open-source web content management platform (CMS) in
  the Microsoft ecosystem. Prior to version 10.1.0, the Prompt module allows execution of commands
  that can return raw HTML. Malicious input, even if sanitized for display elsewhere, can be
  executed when processed through certain commands, leading to potential script execution (XSS).
  This issue has been patched in version 10.1.0.
