aliases: []
summary: Flux2 is a tool for keeping Kubernetes clusters in sync with sources of configuration,
  and Flux's helm-controller is a Kubernetes operator that allows one to declaratively manage
  Helm chart releases. Helm controller is tightly integrated with the Helm SDK. A vulnerability
  found in the Helm SDK that affects flux2 v0.0.17 until v0.32.0 and helm-controller v0.0.4
  until v0.23.0 allows for specific data inputs to cause high memory consumption. In some platforms,
  this could cause the controller to panic and stop processing reconciliations. In a shared
  cluster multi-tenancy environment, a tenant could create a HelmRelease that makes the controller
  panic, denying all other tenants from their Helm releases being reconciled. Patches are available
  in flux2 v0.32.0 and helm-controller v0.23.0.
