aliases: []
summary: Bludit version 3.16.1 contains a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in
  the /admin/uninstall-plugin/ and /admin/install-theme/ endpoints. The application does not
  implement anti-CSRF tokens or other request origin validation mechanisms for these administrative
  actions. An attacker can induce an authenticated administrator to visit a malicious page that
  silently submits crafted requests, resulting in unauthorized plugin uninstallation or theme
  installation. This may lead to loss of functionality, execution of untrusted code via malicious
  themes, and compromise of system integrity.
