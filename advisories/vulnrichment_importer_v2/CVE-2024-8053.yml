aliases: []
summary: In version v0.3.10 of open-webui/open-webui, the `api/v1/utils/pdf` endpoint lacks
  authentication mechanisms, allowing unauthenticated attackers to access the PDF generation
  service. This vulnerability can be exploited by sending a POST request with an excessively
  large payload, potentially leading to server resource exhaustion and denial of service (DoS).
  Additionally, unauthorized users can misuse the endpoint to generate PDFs without verification,
  resulting in service misuse and potential operational and financial impacts.
