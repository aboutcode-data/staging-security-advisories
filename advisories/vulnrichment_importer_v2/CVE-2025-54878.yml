summary: CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security
  Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running
  the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists
  in NASA CryptoLib version 1.4.0 and prior in the IV setup logic for telecommand frames. The
  problem arises from missing bounds checks when copying the Initialization Vector (IV) into
  a freshly allocated buffer. An attacker can supply a crafted TC frame that causes the library
  to write one byte past the end of the heap buffer, leading to heap corruption and undefined
  behaviour. An attacker supplying a malformed telecommand frame can corrupt heap memory. This
  leads to undefined behaviour, which could manifest itself as a crash (denial of service) or
  more severe exploitation. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.0.
