summary: |
  Observable Timing Discrepancy vulnerability in Apache Shiro.

  This issue affects Apache Shiro: from 1.*, 2.* before 2.0.7.

  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.0.7 or later, which fixes the issue.

  Prior to Shiro 2.0.7, code paths for non-existent vs. existing users are different enough,
  that a brute-force attack may be able to tell, by timing the requests only, determine if
  the request failed because of a non-existent user vs. wrong password.

  The most likely attack vector is a local attack only.
  Shiro security model  https://shiro.apache.org/security-model.html#username_enumeration  discusses this as well.

  Typically, brute force attack can be mitigated at the infrastructure level.
