aliases: []
summary: spicedb is an Open Source, Google Zanzibar-inspired permissions database to enable
  fine-grained authorization for customer applications. Multiple caveats over the same indirect
  subject type on the same relation can result in no permission being returned when permission
  is expected. If the resource has multiple groups, and each group is caveated, it is possible
  for the returned permission to be "no permission" when permission is expected. Permission
  is returned as NO_PERMISSION when PERMISSION is expected on the CheckPermission API. This
  issue has been addressed in release version 1.35.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable
  to upgrade should not use caveats or avoid the use of caveats on an indirect subject type
  with multiple entries.
