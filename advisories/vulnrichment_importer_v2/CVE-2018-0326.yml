aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco TelePresence Server Software could allow an
  unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-frame scripting (XFS) attack against a
  user of the web UI of the affected software. The vulnerability is due to insufficient protections
  for HTML inline frames (iframes) by the web UI of the affected software. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the affected UI to navigate to an attacker-controlled
  web page that contains a malicious HTML iframe. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to conduct click-jacking or other client-side browser attacks on the affected system. Cisco
