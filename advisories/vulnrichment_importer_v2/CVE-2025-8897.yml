summary: The Beaver Builder – WordPress Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected
  Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘'fl_builder' parameter in all versions up to, and including,

  for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they
  can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
