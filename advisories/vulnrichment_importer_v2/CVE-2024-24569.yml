aliases: []
summary: The Pixee Java Code Security Toolkit is a set of security APIs meant to help secure
  Java code. `ZipSecurity#isBelowCurrentDirectory` is vulnerable to a partial-path traversal
  bypass. To be vulnerable to the bypass, the application must use toolkit version <=1.1.1,
  use ZipSecurity as a guard against path traversal, and have an exploit path. Although the
  control still protects attackers from escaping the application path into higher level directories
  (e.g., /etc/), it will allow "escaping" into sibling paths. For example, if your running path
  is /my/app/path you an attacker could navigate into /my/app/path-something-else. This vulnerability
  is patched in 1.1.2.
