aliases: []
summary: Open WebUI is a self-hosted artificial intelligence platform designed to operate entirely
  offline. Prior to 0.6.37, a Stored XSS vulnerability was discovered in Open-WebUI's Notes
  PDF download functionality. An attacker can import a Markdown file containing malicious SVG
  tags into Notes, allowing them to execute arbitrary JavaScript code and steal session tokens
  when a victim downloads the note as PDF. This vulnerability can be exploited by any authenticated
  user, and unauthenticated external attackers can steal session tokens from users (both admin
  and regular users) by sharing specially crafted markdown files. This vulnerability is fixed
  in 0.6.37.
