aliases: []
summary: Soft Serve is a self-hostable Git server for the command line. In versions prior to
  0.10.0, there are several places where the user can insert data (e.g. names) and ANSI escape
  sequences are not being removed, which can then be used, for example, to show fake alerts.
  In the same token, git messages, when printed, are also not being sanitized. This issue is
  fixed in version 0.10.0.
