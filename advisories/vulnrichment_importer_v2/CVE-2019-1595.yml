aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) protocol implementation in
  Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of
  service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to an incorrect allocation
  of an internal interface index. An adjacent attacker with the ability to submit a crafted
  FCoE packet that crosses affected interfaces could trigger this vulnerability. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to cause a packet loop and high throughput on the affected
  interfaces, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability has been fixed in version 7.3(5)N1(1).
