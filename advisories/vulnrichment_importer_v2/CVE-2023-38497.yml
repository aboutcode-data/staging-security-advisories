aliases: []
summary: Cargo downloads the Rust project’s dependencies and compiles the project. Cargo prior
  to version 0.72.2, bundled with Rust prior to version 1.71.1, did not respect the umask when
  extracting crate archives on UNIX-like systems. If the user downloaded a crate containing
  files writeable by any local user, another local user could exploit this to change the source
  code compiled and executed by the current user. To prevent existing cached extractions from
  being exploitable, the Cargo binary version 0.72.2 included in Rust 1.71.1 or later will purge
  caches generated by older Cargo versions automatically. As a workaround, configure one's system
  to prevent other local users from accessing the Cargo directory, usually located in `~/.cargo`.
