  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  uio_hv_generic: Don't free decrypted memory

  In CoCo VMs it is possible for the untrusted host to cause
  set_memory_encrypted() or set_memory_decrypted() to fail such that an
  error is returned and the resulting memory is shared. Callers need to
  take care to handle these errors to avoid returning decrypted (shared)
  memory to the page allocator, which could lead to functional or security
  issues.

  The VMBus device UIO driver could free decrypted/shared pages if
  set_memory_decrypted() fails. Check the decrypted field in the gpadl
  to decide whether to free the memory.
