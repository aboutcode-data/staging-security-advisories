aliases: []
summary: tarteaucitron.js is a compliant and accessible cookie banner. A vulnerability was identified
  in tarteaucitron.js prior to 1.20.1, where the addOrUpdate function, used for applying custom
  texts, did not properly validate input. This allowed an attacker with direct access to the
  site's source code or a CMS plugin to manipulate JavaScript object prototypes, leading to
  potential security risks such as data corruption or unintended code execution. An attacker
  with high privileges could exploit this vulnerability to modify object prototypes, affecting
  core JavaScript behavior, cause application crashes or unexpected behavior, or potentially
  introduce further security vulnerabilities depending on the application's architecture. This
  vulnerability is fixed in 1.20.1.
