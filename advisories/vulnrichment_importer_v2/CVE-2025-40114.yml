summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  iio: light: Add check for array bounds in veml6075_read_int_time_ms

  The array contains only 5 elements, but the index calculated by
  veml6075_read_int_time_index can range from 0 to 7,
  which could lead to out-of-bounds access. The check prevents this issue.

  Coverity Issue
  CID 1574309: (#1 of 1): Out-of-bounds read (OVERRUN)
  overrun-local: Overrunning array veml6075_it_ms of 5 4-byte
  elements at element index 7 (byte offset 31) using
  index int_index (which evaluates to 7)

  This is hardening against potentially broken hardware. Good to have
  but not necessary to backport.
