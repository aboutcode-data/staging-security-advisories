summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software
  could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and modify the configuration
  of an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checking on
  an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests

  the attacker to gain privileges beyond what would normally be authorized for their configured
  user authorization level. This could allow the attacker to modify the configuration of an
  affected system.
