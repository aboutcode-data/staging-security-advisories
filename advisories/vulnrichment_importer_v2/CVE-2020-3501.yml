aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the user interface of Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App
  could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to obtain restricted information from other
  Webex users. These vulnerabilities are due to improper input validation of parameters returned
  to the application from a web site. An attacker with a valid Webex account could exploit these
  vulnerabilities by persuading a user to follow a URL that is designed to return malicious
  path parameters to the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
  obtain restricted information from other Webex users.
