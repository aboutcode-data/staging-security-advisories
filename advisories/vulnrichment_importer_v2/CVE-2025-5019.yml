aliases: []
summary: The Hive Support | AI-Powered Help Desk, Live Chat & AI Chat Bot Plugin for WordPress
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and
  including, 1.2.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the hs_update_ai_chat_settings()
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reconfigure the plugin’s
  AI/chat settings (including API keys) and to potentially redirect notifications or leak data
  to attacker-controlled endpoints via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
