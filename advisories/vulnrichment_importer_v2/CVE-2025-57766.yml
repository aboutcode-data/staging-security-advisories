aliases: []
summary: Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform. Prior to version 2.69.1, admin
  UI user password changes in Fides do not invalidate active user sessions, creating a vulnerability
  chaining opportunity where attackers who have obtained session tokens through other attack
  vectors (such as XSS) can maintain access even after password reset. This issue is not directly
  exploitable on its own and requires a prerequisite vulnerability to obtain valid session tokens
  in the first place. Version 2.69.1 fixes the issue. No known workarounds are available.
