  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  io_uring/kbuf: fix signedness in this_len calculation

  When importing and using buffers, buf->len is considered unsigned.
  However, buf->len is converted to signed int when committing. This can
  lead to unexpected behavior if the buffer is large enough to be
  interpreted as a negative value. Make min_t calculation unsigned.
