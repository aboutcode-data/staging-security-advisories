summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  libbpf: Prevent null-pointer dereference when prog to load has no BTF

  In bpf_objec_load_prog(), there's no guarantee that obj->btf is non-NULL
  when passing it to btf__fd(), and this function does not perform any
  check before dereferencing its argument (as bpf_object__btf_fd() used to
  do). As a consequence, we get segmentation fault errors in bpftool (for
  example) when trying to load programs that come without BTF information.

  v2: Keep btf__fd() in the fix instead of reverting to bpf_object__btf_fd().
