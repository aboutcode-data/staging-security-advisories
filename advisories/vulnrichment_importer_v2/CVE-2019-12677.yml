aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) VPN feature of Cisco Adaptive Security
  Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of
  service (DoS) condition that prevents the creation of new SSL/Transport Layer Security (TLS)
  connections to an affected device. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of Base64-encoded
  strings. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by opening many SSL VPN sessions to
  an affected device. The attacker would need to have valid user credentials on the affected
  device to exploit this vulnerability. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite
  a special system memory location, which will eventually result in memory allocation errors
  for new SSL/TLS sessions to the device, preventing successful establishment of these sessions.
  A reload of the device is required to recover from this condition. Established SSL/TLS connections
  to the device and SSL/TLS connections through the device are not affected. Note: Although
  this vulnerability is in the SSL VPN feature, successful exploitation of this vulnerability
  would affect all new SSL/TLS sessions to the device, including management sessions.'
