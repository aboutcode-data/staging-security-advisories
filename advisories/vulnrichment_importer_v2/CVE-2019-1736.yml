aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the firmware of the Cisco UCS C-Series Rack Servers could allow
  an authenticated, physical attacker to bypass Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)
  Secure Boot validation checks and load a compromised software image on an affected device.
  The vulnerability is due to improper validation of the server firmware upgrade images. An
  attacker could exploit this vulnerability by installing a server firmware version that would
  allow the attacker to disable UEFI Secure Boot. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to bypass the signature validation checks that are done by UEFI Secure Boot technology and
  load a compromised software image on the affected device. A compromised software image is
  any software image that has not been digitally signed by Cisco.
