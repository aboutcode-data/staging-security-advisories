aliases: []
summary: Polkadot Frontier is an Ethereum and EVM compatibility layer for Polkadot and Substrate.
  There are various account address types in Frontier, e.g. precompiled contracts, smart contracts,
  and externally owned accounts. Some EVM mechanisms should be unreachable by certain types
  of accounts for safety. For precompiles to be callable by smart contracts they must be explicitly
  configured as CallableByContract. If this configuration is absent, then the precompile should
  be unreachable via smart contract accounts. In commits prior to 0822030, the underlying implementation
  of CallableByContract which returned the AddressType was incorrect. It considered the contract
  address running under CREATE or CREATE2 to be AddressType::EOA rather than correctly as AddressType::Contract.
  The issue only affects users who use custom precompile implementations that utilize AddressType::EOA
  and AddressType::Contract. It's not directly exploitable in any of the predefined precompiles
  in Frontier. This is fixed in version 0822030.
