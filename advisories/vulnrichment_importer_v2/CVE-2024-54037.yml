aliases: []
summary: Adobe Connect versions 12.6, 11.4.7 and earlier are affected by a DOM-based Cross-Site
  Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary
  code in the context of the victim's browser session. By manipulating a DOM element through
  a crafted URL or user input, the high-privileged attacker can inject malicious scripts that
  run when the page is rendered. This type of attack requires user interaction, as the victim
  would need to visit a malicious link or input data into a compromised form. A successful attacker
  can abuse this to achieve session takeover, increasing the confidentiality and integrity impact
  as high.
