aliases: []
summary: A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in user/login.php at line
  24 in ZZCMS 2023 and earlier. The application directly inserts the value of the HTTP_REFERER
  header into the HTML response without proper sanitization. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability
  by tricking a user into visiting a specially crafted URL, which includes a malicious Referer
  header. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the
  victim's browser, potentially resulting in session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious
  activities.
