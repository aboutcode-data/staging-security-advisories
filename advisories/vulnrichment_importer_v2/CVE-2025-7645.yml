summary: The Extensions For CF7 (Contact form 7 Database, Conditional Fields and Redirection)
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path
  validation in the 'delete-file' field in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.8. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, when an
  administrator deletes the submission, which can easily lead to remote code execution when
  the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
