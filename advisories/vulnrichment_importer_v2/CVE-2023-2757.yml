aliases: []
summary: 'The Waiting: One-click countdowns plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
  bypass due to a missing capability check on ''saveLang'' functions in versions up to, and
  including, 0.6.2. This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping. This makes it possible for subscriber-level attackers to access functions
  to save plugin data that can potentially lead to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that
  will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.'
