aliases: []
summary: 'An issue was discovered in Heimdal Thor agent versions 3.4.2 and before 3.7.0 on Windows,
  allows attackers to bypass USB access restrictions, execute arbitrary code, and obtain sensitive
  information via Next-Gen Antivirus component. NOTE: Heimdal argues that the limitation described
  here is a Microsoft Windows issue, not a Heimdal specific vulnerability. The USB control solution
  by Heimdal is meant to manage Microsoft Windows native USB restrictions. They maintain that
  their solution functions as a management layer over Windows settings and is not to blame for
  limitations in Windows'' detection capabilities.'
