aliases: []
summary: Next.js is a React framework that can provide building blocks to create web applications.
  Prior to 13.5.1, an inconsistent interpretation of a crafted HTTP request meant that requests
  are treated as both a single request, and two separate requests by Next.js, leading to desynchronized
  responses. This led to a response queue poisoning vulnerability in the affected Next.js versions.
  For a request to be exploitable, the affected route also had to be making use of the [rewrites](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/rewrites)
  feature in Next.js. The vulnerability is resolved in Next.js `13.5.1` and newer.
