aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Finesse could
  allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against
  a user of the interface. These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied
  input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit
  these vulnerabilities by injecting malicious code into the web-based management interface
  and persuading a user to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive,
  browser-based information. An attacker needs valid administrator credentials to inject the
  malicious script code.
