aliases: []
summary: A flaw was discovered in Elasticsearch, affecting document ingestion when an index
  template contains a dynamic field mapping of “passthrough” type. Under certain circumstances,
  ingesting documents in this index would cause a StackOverflow exception to be thrown and ultimately
  lead to a Denial of Service. Note that passthrough fields is an experimental feature.
