aliases: []
summary: Stalwart is a mail and collaboration server. Versions 0.13.3 and below contain an unbounded
  memory allocation vulnerability in the IMAP protocol parser which allows remote attackers
  to exhaust server memory, potentially triggering the system's out-of-memory (OOM) killer and
  causing a denial of service. The CommandParser implementation enforces size limits on its
  dynamic buffer in most parsing states, but several state handlers omit these validation checks.
  This issue is fixed in version 0.13.4. A workaround for this issue is to implement rate limiting
  and connection monitoring at the network level, however this does not provide complete protection.
