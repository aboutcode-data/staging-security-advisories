aliases: []
summary: cjwt is a C JSON Web Token (JWT) Implementation. Algorithm confusion occurs when a
  system improperly verifies the type of signature used, allowing attackers to exploit the lack
  of distinction between signing methods.  If the system doesn't differentiate between an HMAC
  signed token and an RS/EC/PS signed token during verification, it becomes vulnerable to this
  kind of attack. For instance, an attacker could craft a token with the alg field set to "HS256"
  while the server expects an asymmetric algorithm like "RS256". The server might mistakenly
  use the wrong verification method, such as using a public key as the HMAC secret, leading
  to unauthorised access. For RSA, the key can be computed from a few signatures. For Elliptic
  Curve (EC), two potential keys can be recovered from one signature. This can be used to bypass
  the signature mechanism if an application relies on asymmetrically signed tokens. This issue
  has been addressed in version 2.3.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
  workarounds for this vulnerability.
