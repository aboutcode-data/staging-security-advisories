summary: 'A vulnerability in the Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) of the Cisco Policy
  Suite (CPS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive data. The
  attacker could use this information to conduct additional reconnaissance attacks. The attacker
  would also have to have access to the internal VLAN where CPS is deployed. The vulnerability
  is due to incorrect permissions of certain system files and not sufficiently protecting sensitive
  data that is at rest. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by using certain tools available
  on the internal network interface to request and view system files. An exploit could allow
  the attacker to find out sensitive information about the application. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf77666.'
