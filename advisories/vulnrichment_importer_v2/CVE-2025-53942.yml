aliases: []
summary: authentik is an open-source Identity Provider that emphasizes flexibility and versatility,
  with support for a wide set of protocols. In versions 2025.4.4 and earlier, as well as versions
  2025.6.0-rc1 through 2025.6.3, deactivated users who registered through OAuth/SAML or linked
  their accounts to OAuth/SAML providers can still retain partial access to the system despite
  their accounts being deactivated. They end up in a half-authenticated state where they cannot
  access the API but crucially they can authorize applications if they know the URL of the application.
  To workaround this issue, developers can add an expression policy to the user login stage
  on the respective authentication flow with the expression of return request.context["pending_user"].is_active.
  This modification ensures that the return statement only activates the user login stage when
  the user is active. This issue is fixed in versions authentik 2025.4.4 and 2025.6.4.
