aliases: []
summary: Tekton Pipelines project provides k8s-style resources for declaring CI/CD-style pipelines.
  Starting in version 0.35.0, pipelines do not validate child UIDs, which means that a user
  that has access to create TaskRuns can create their own Tasks that the Pipelines controller
  will accept as the child Task. While the software stores and validates the PipelineRun's (api
  version, kind, name, uid) in the child Run's OwnerReference, it only store (api version, kind,
  name) in the ChildStatusReference. This means that if a client had access to create TaskRuns
  on a cluster, they could create a child TaskRun for a pipeline with the same name + owner
  reference, and the Pipeline controller picks it up as if it was the original TaskRun. This
  is problematic since it can let users modify the config of Pipelines at runtime, which violates
  SLSA L2 Service Generated / Non-falsifiable requirements. This issue can be used to trick
  the Pipeline controller into associating unrelated Runs to the Pipeline, feeding its data
  through the rest of the Pipeline. This requires access to create TaskRuns, so impact may vary
  depending on one Tekton setup. If users already have unrestricted access to create any Task/PipelineRun,
  this does not grant any additional capabilities. As of time of publication, there are no known
  patches for this issue.
