aliases: []
summary: A SQL injection in the flutter_downloader component through 1.11.1 for iOS allows remote
  attackers to steal session tokens and overwrite arbitrary files inside the app's container.
  The internal database of the framework is exposed to the local user if an app uses UIFileSharingEnabled
  and LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace properties. As a result, local users can obtain the
  same attack primitives as remote attackers by tampering with the internal database of the
  framework on the device.
