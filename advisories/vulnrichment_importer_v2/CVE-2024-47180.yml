aliases: []
summary: 'Shields.io is a service for concise, consistent, and legible badges in SVG and raster
  format. Shields.io and users self-hosting their own instance of shields using version < `server-2024-09-25`
  are vulnerable to a remote execution vulnerability via the JSONPath library used by the Dynamic
  JSON/Toml/Yaml badges. This vulnerability would allow any user with access to make a request
  to a URL on the instance to the ability to execute code by crafting a malicious JSONPath expression.
  All users who self-host an instance are vulnerable. This problem was fixed in server-2024-09-25.
  Those who follow the tagged releases should update to `server-2024-09-25` or later. Those
  who follow the rolling tag on DockerHub, `docker pull shieldsio/shields:next` to update to
  the latest version. As a workaround, blocking access to the endpoints `/badge/dynamic/json`,
  `/badge/dynamic/toml`, and `/badge/dynamic/yaml` (e.g: via a firewall or reverse proxy in
  front of your instance) would prevent the exploitable endpoints from being accessed.'
