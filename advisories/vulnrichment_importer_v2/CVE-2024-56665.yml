  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  bpf,perf: Fix invalid prog_array access in perf_event_detach_bpf_prog

  Syzbot reported [1] crash that happens for following tracing scenario:

    - create tracepoint perf event with attr.inherit=1, attach it to the
      process and set bpf program to it
    - attached process forks -> chid creates inherited event

      the new child event shares the parent's bpf program and tp_event
      (hence prog_array) which is global for tracepoint

    - exit both process and its child -> release both events
    - first perf_event_detach_bpf_prog call will release tp_event->prog_array
      and second perf_event_detach_bpf_prog will crash, because
      tp_event->prog_array is NULL

  The fix makes sure the perf_event_detach_bpf_prog checks prog_array
  is valid before it tries to remove the bpf program from it.
