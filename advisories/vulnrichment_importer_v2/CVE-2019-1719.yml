aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based guest portal of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE)
  could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
  against a user of the web-based management interface. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  validation of user-supplied input that is processed by the web-based interface. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted
  link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the
  context of the interface or access sensitive browser-based information. Cisco ISE software
  version 2.1 is affected.
