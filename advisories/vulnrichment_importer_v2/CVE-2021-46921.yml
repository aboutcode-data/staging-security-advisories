summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlocking/qrwlock:\
  \ Fix ordering in queued_write_lock_slowpath()\n\nWhile this code is executed with the wait_lock\
  \ held, a reader can\nacquire the lock without holding wait_lock.  The writer side loops\n\
  checking the value with the atomic_cond_read_acquire(), but only truly\nacquires the lock\
  \ when the compare-and-exchange is completed\nsuccessfully which isn’t ordered. This exposes\
  \ the window between the\nacquire and the cmpxchg to an A-B-A problem which allows reads\n\
  following the lock acquisition to observe values speculatively before\nthe write lock is truly\
  \ acquired.\n\nWe've seen a problem in epoll where the reader does a xchg while\nholding the\
  \ read lock, but the writer can see a value change out from\nunder it.\n\n  Writer       \
