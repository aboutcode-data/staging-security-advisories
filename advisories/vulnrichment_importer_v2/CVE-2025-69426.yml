aliases: []
summary: The Ruckus vRIoT IoT Controller firmware versions prior to 3.0.0.0 (GA) contain hardcoded
  credentials for an operating system user account within an initialization script. The SSH
  service is network-accessible without IP-based restrictions. Although the configuration disables
  SCP and pseudo-TTY allocation, an attacker can authenticate using the hardcoded credentials
  and establish SSH local port forwarding to access the Docker socket. By mounting the host
  filesystem via Docker, an attacker can escape the container and execute arbitrary OS commands
  as root on the underlying vRIoT controller, resulting in complete system compromise.
