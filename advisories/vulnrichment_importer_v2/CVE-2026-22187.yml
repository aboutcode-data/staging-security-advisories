aliases: []
summary: Bio-Formats versions up to and including 8.3.0 perform unsafe Java deserialization
  of attacker-controlled memoization cache files (.bfmemo) during image processing. The loci.formats.Memoizer
  class automatically loads and deserializes memo files associated with images without validation,
  integrity checks, or trust enforcement. An attacker who can supply a crafted .bfmemo file
  alongside an image can trigger deserialization of untrusted data, which may result in denial
  of service, logic manipulation, or potentially remote code execution in environments where
  suitable gadget chains are present on the classpath.
