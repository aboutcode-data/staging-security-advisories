aliases: []
summary: imFAQ is an advanced questions and answers management system for ImpressCMS. Prior
  to 1.0.1, if the $_GET['seoOp'] parameter is manipulated to include malicious input (e.g.,
  seoOp=php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=/var/www/html/config.php), the application
  could allow an attacker to read sensitive files on the server (Local File Inclusion, LFI).
  The $_GET['seoOp'] and $_GET['seoArg'] parameters are directly used without sanitization or
  validation. This is partly mitigated by the fact that the ImpressCMS sensitive files are stored
  outside the web root, in a folder with a randomized name. The issue has been resolved in imFaq
  1.0.1.
