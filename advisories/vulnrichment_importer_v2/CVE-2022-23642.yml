aliases: []
summary: Sourcegraph is a code search and navigation engine. Sourcegraph prior to version 3.37
  is vulnerable to remote code execution in the `gitserver` service. The service acts as a git
  exec proxy, and fails to properly restrict calling `git config`. This allows an attacker to
  set the git `core.sshCommand` option, which sets git to use the specified command instead
  of ssh when they need to connect to a remote system. Exploitation of this vulnerability depends
  on how Sourcegraph is deployed. An attacker able to make HTTP requests to internal services
  like gitserver is able to exploit it. This issue is patched in Sourcegraph version 3.37. As
  a workaround, ensure that requests to gitserver are properly protected.
