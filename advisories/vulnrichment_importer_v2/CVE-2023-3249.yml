summary: The Web3 – Crypto wallet Login & NFT token gating plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 2.6.0. This is due to incorrect

  attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have
  access to the username.
