  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  wifi: rtw88: usb: schedule rx work after everything is set up

  Right now it's possible to hit NULL pointer dereference in
  rtw_rx_fill_rx_status on hw object and/or its fields because
  initialization routine can start getting USB replies before
  rtw_dev is fully setup.

  The stack trace looks like this:

  rtw_rx_fill_rx_status
  rtw8821c_query_rx_desc
  rtw_usb_rx_handler
  ...
  queue_work
  rtw_usb_read_port_complete
  ...
  usb_submit_urb
  rtw_usb_rx_resubmit
  rtw_usb_init_rx
  rtw_usb_probe

  So while we do the async stuff rtw_usb_probe continues and calls
  rtw_register_hw, which does all kinds of initialization (e.g.
  via ieee80211_register_hw) that rtw_rx_fill_rx_status relies on.

  Fix this by moving the first usb_submit_urb after everything
  is set up.

  For me, this bug manifested as:
  [    8.893177] rtw_8821cu 1-1:1.2: band wrong, packet dropped
  [    8.910904] rtw_8821cu 1-1:1.2: hw->conf.chandef.chan NULL in rtw_rx_fill_rx_status
  because I'm using Larry's backport of rtw88 driver with the NULL
  checks in rtw_rx_fill_rx_status.
