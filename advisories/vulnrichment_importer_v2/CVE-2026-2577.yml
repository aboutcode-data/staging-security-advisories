aliases: []
summary: The WhatsApp bridge component in Nanobot binds the WebSocket server to all network
  interfaces (0.0.0.0) on port 3001 by default and does not require authentication for incoming
  connections. An unauthenticated remote attacker with network access to the bridge can connect
  to the WebSocket server to hijack the WhatsApp session. This allows the attacker to send messages
  on behalf of the user, intercept all incoming messages and media in real-time, and capture
  authentication QR codes.
