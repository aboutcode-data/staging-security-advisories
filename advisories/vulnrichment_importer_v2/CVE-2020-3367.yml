aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the log subscription subsystem of Cisco AsyncOS for the Cisco Secure
  Web Appliance (formerly Web Security Appliance) could allow an authenticated, local attacker
  to perform command injection and elevate privileges to root. This vulnerability is due to
  insufficient validation of user-supplied input for the web interface and CLI. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the affected device and injecting scripting
  commands in the scope of the log subscription subsystem. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system and elevate
  privileges to root.
