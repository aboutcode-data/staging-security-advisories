aliases: []
summary: AIOHTTP is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. Versions
  3.13.2 and below allow for an infinite loop to occur when assert statements are bypassed,
  resulting in a DoS attack when processing a POST body. If optimizations are enabled (-O or
  PYTHONOPTIMIZE=1), and the application includes a handler that uses the Request.post() method,
  then an attacker may be able to execute a DoS attack with a specially crafted message. This
  issue is fixed in version 3.13.3.
