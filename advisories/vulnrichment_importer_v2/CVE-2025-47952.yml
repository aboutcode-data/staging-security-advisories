aliases: []
summary: Traefik (pronounced traffic) is an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. Prior to versions
  2.11.25 and 3.4.1, there is a potential vulnerability in Traefik managing the requests using
  a PathPrefix, Path or PathRegex matcher. When Traefik is configured to route the requests
  to a backend using a matcher based on the path, if the URL contains a URL encoded string in
  its path, it’s possible to target a backend, exposed using another router, by-passing the
  middlewares chain. This issue has been patched in versions 2.11.25 and 3.4.1.
