aliases: []
summary: The Snowflake Hive metastore connector provides an easy way to query Hive-managed data
  via Snowflake. Snowflake Hive MetaStore Connector has addressed a potential elevation of privilege
  vulnerability in a `helper script` for the Hive MetaStore Connector. A malicious insider without
  admin privileges could, in theory, use the script to download content from a Microsoft domain
  to the local system and replace the valid content with malicious code. If the attacker then
  also had local access to the same system where the maliciously modified script is run, they
  could attempt to manipulate users into executing the attacker-controlled helper script, potentially
  gaining elevated privileges to the local system. The vulnerability in the script was patched
  on February 09, 2024, without a version bump to the Connector. User who use the helper script
  are strongly advised to use the latest version as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade
  should avoid using the helper script.
