aliases: []
summary: django-s3file is a lightweight file upload input for Django and Amazon S3 . In versions
  prior to 5.5.1 it was possible to traverse the entire AWS S3 bucket and in most cases to access
  or delete files. If the `AWS_LOCATION` setting was set, traversal was limited to that location
  only. The issue was discovered by the maintainer. There were no reports of the vulnerability
  being known to or exploited by a third party, prior to the release of the patch. The vulnerability
  has been fixed in version 5.5.1 and above. There is no feasible workaround. We must urge all
  users to immediately updated to a patched version.
