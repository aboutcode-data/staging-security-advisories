summary: The LatePoint Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data
  and modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'start_or_use_session_for_customer'
  function in all versions up to and including 4.9.9. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to view other customer's cabinets, including the ability to view PII such as email
  addresses and to change their LatePoint user password, which may or may not be associated
  with a WordPress account.
