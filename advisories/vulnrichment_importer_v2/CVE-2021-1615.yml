summary: A vulnerability in the packet processing functionality of Cisco Embedded Wireless Controller
  (EWC) Software for Catalyst Access Points (APs) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected AP. This vulnerability is due
  to insufficient buffer allocation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending

  available resources and cause a DoS condition on an affected AP, as well as a DoS condition
  for client traffic traversing the AP.
