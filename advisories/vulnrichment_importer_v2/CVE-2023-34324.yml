summary: |
  Closing of an event channel in the Linux kernel can result in a deadlock.
  This happens when the close is being performed in parallel to an unrelated
  Xen console action and the handling of a Xen console interrupt in an
  unprivileged guest.

  The closing of an event channel is e.g. triggered by removal of a
  paravirtual device on the other side. As this action will cause console
  messages to be issued on the other side quite often, the chance of
  triggering the deadlock is not neglectable.

  Note that 32-bit Arm-guests are not affected, as the 32-bit Linux kernel
  on Arm doesn't use queued-RW-locks, which are required to trigger the
  issue (on Arm32 a waiting writer doesn't block further readers to get
  the lock).
