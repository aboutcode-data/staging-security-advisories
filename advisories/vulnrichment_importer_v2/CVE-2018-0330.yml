summary: 'A vulnerability in the NX-API management application programming interface (API) in
  devices running, or based on, Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker
  to execute commands with elevated privileges. The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly
  validate certain parameters included within an NX-API request. An attacker that can successfully
  authenticate to the NX-API could submit a request designed to bypass NX-OS role assignment.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands with elevated privileges.
  This vulnerability affects the following if configured to use the NX-API feature: MDS 9000
  Series Multilayer Switches, Nexus 2000 Series Switches, Nexus 3000 Series Switches, Nexus
  3500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5600 Platform Switches, Nexus
  6000 Series Switches, Nexus 7000 Series Switches, Nexus 7700 Series Switches, Nexus 9000 Series
  Switches in standalone NX-OS mode. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc73177, CSCve40903, CSCve40911.'
