aliases: []
summary: All versions of the package github.com/greenpau/caddy-security are vulnerable to Insufficient
  Session Expiration due to improper user session invalidation upon clicking the "Sign Out"

  Attackers who gain access to an active but supposedly logged-out session can perform unauthorized
  actions on behalf of the user.
