aliases: []
summary: 'danny-avila/librechat is affected by an authorization bypass vulnerability due to
  improper access control checks. The `checkAccess` function in `api/server/middleware/roles/access.js`
  uses `permissions.some()` to validate permissions, which incorrectly grants access if only
  one of multiple required permissions is present. This allows users with the ''USER'' role
  to create agents despite having `CREATE: false` permission, as the check for `[''USE'', ''CREATE'']`
  passes with just `USE: true`. This vulnerability affects other permission checks as well,
  such as `PROMPTS`. The issue is present in all versions prior to the fix.'
