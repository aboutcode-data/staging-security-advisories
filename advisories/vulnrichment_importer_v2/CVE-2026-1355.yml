aliases: []
summary: A Missing Authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that
  allowed an attacker to upload unauthorized content to another user’s repository migration
  export due to a missing authorization check in the repository migration upload endpoint. By
  supplying the migration identifier, an attacker could overwrite or replace a victim’s migration
  archive, potentially causing victims to download attacker-controlled repository data during
  migration restores or automated imports. An attacker would require authentication to the victim's
  GitHub Enterprise Server instance. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise
  Server prior to 3.20 and was fixed in versions 3.19.2, 3.18.5, 3.17.11, 3.16.14, 3.15.18,
  3.14.23. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.
