  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  smb3: fix temporary data corruption in collapse range

  collapse range doesn't discard the affected cached region
  so can risk temporarily corrupting the file data. This
  fixes xfstest generic/031

  I also decided to merge a minor cleanup to this into the same patch
  (avoiding rereading inode size repeatedly unnecessarily) to make it
  clearer.
