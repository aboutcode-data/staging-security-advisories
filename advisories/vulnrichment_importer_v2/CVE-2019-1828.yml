aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV320
  and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
  access administrative credentials. The vulnerability exists because affected devices use weak
  encryption algorithms for user credentials. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
  conducting a man-in-the-middle attack and decrypting intercepted credentials. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to an affected device with administrator privileges.
  This vulnerability affects Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers
  running firmware releases prior to 1.4.2.22.
