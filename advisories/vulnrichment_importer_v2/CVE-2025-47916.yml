aliases: []
summary: 'Invision Community 5.0.0 before 5.0.7 allows remote code execution via crafted template
  strings to themeeditor.php. The issue lies within the themeeditor controller (file: /applications/core/modules/front/system/themeeditor.php),
  where a protected method named customCss can be invoked by unauthenticated users. This method
  passes the value of the content parameter to the Theme::makeProcessFunction() method; hence
  it is evaluated by the template engine. Accordingly, this can be exploited by unauthenticated
  attackers to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code by providing crafted template strings.'
