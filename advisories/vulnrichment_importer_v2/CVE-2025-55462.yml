aliases: []
summary: 'A CORS misconfiguration in Eramba Community and Enterprise Editions v3.26.0 allows
  an attacker-controlled Origin header to be reflected in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin response
  along with Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true. This permits malicious third-party websites
  to perform authenticated cross-origin requests against the Eramba API, including endpoints
  like /system-api/login and /system-api/user/me. The response includes sensitive user session
  data (ID, name, email, access groups), which is accessible to the attacker''s JavaScript.
  This flaw enables full session hijack and data exfiltration without user interaction. Eramba
  versions 3.23.3 and earlier were tested and appear unaffected. The vulnerability is present
  in default installations, requiring no custom configuration.'
