aliases: []
summary: 'A default installation of RustDesk 1.2.3 on Windows places a WDKTestCert certificate
  under Trusted Root Certification Authorities with Enhanced Key Usage of Code Signing (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3),
  valid from 2023 until 2033. This is potentially unwanted, e.g., because there is no public
  documentation of security measures for the private key, and arbitrary software could be signed
  if the private key were to be compromised. NOTE: the vendor''s position is "we do not have
  EV cert, so we use test cert as a workaround." Insertion into Trusted Root Certification Authorities
  was the originally intended behavior, and the UI ensured that the certificate installation
  step (checked by default) was visible to the user before proceeding with the product installation.'
