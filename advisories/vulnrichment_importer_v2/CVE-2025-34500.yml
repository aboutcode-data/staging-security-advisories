aliases: []
summary: Deck Mate 2's firmware update mechanism accepts packages without cryptographic signature
  verification, encrypts them with a single hard-coded AES key shared across devices, and uses
  a truncated HMAC for integrity validation. Attackers with access to the update interface -
  typically via the unit's USB update port - can craft or modify firmware packages to execute
  arbitrary code as root, allowing persistent compromise of the device's integrity and deck
  randomization process. Physical or on-premises access remains the most likely attack path,
  though network-exposed or telemetry-enabled deployments could theoretically allow remote exploitation
  if misconfigured. The vendor confirmed that firmware updates have been issued to correct these
  update-chain weaknesses and that USB update access has been disabled on affected units.
