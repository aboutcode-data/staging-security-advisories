aliases: []
summary: Russh is a Rust SSH client & server library. In versions 0.54.0 and below, the channel
  window adjust message of the SSH protocol is used to track the free space in the receive buffer
  of the other side of a channel. The current implementation takes the value from the message
  and adds it to an internal state value. This can result in a integer overflow. If the Rust
  code is compiled with overflow checks, it will panic. A malicious client can crash a server.
  This is fixed in version 0.54.1.
