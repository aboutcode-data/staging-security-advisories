aliases: []
summary: Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications,
  and databases. Prior to version 4.0.0-beta.445, parameters coming from docker-compose.yaml
  are not sanitized when used in commands. If a victim user creates an application from an attacker
  repository (using build pack "docker compose"), the attacker can execute commands on the Coolify
  instance as root. Version 4.0.0-beta.445 fixes the issue.
