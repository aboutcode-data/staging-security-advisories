summary: The WPDash Notes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data
  due to a missing capability check on the 'wp_ajax_post_it_list_comment' function in all versions
  up to, and including, 1.3.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
  access and above, to view comments on any post, including private and password protected posts,
  and pending and draft posts if they were previously published. The vulnerability was partially
  patched in version 1.3.5.
