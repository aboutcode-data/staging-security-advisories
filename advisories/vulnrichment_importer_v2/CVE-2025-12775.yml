aliases: []
summary: The WP Dropzone plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authenticated arbitrary file
  upload in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.0 via the `ajax_upload_handle` function.
  This is due to the chunked upload functionality writing files directly to the uploads directory
  before any file type validation occurs. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with subscriber level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server
  which may make remote code execution possible.
