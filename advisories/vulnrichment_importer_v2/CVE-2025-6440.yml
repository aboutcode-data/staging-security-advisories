aliases: []
summary: The WooCommerce Designer Pro plugin for WordPress, used by the Pricom - Printing Company
  & Design Services WordPress theme, is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing
  file type validation in the 'wcdp_save_canvas_design_ajax' function in all versions up to,
  and including, 1.9.26. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary
  files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
