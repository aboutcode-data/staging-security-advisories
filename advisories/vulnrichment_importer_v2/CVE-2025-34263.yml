aliases: []
summary: Advantech WISE-DeviceOn Server versions prior to 5.4 contain a stored cross-site scripting
  (XSS) vulnerability in the /rmm/v1/plugin-config/dashboards/menus endpoint. When an authenticated
  user adds or edits a dashboard entry, the label and path values are stored in plugin configuration
  data and later rendered in the dashboard UI without proper HTML sanitation. An attacker can
  inject malicious script into either field, which is then executed in the browser context of
  users who view or interact with the affected dashboard, potentially enabling session compromise
  and unauthorized actions as the victim.
