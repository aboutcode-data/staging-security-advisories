aliases: []
summary: Sharp is a content management framework built for Laravel as a package. Prior to 9.11.1,
  a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in code16/sharp when rendering content
  using the SharpShowTextField component. In affected versions, expressions wrapped in {{ &
  }} were evaluated by Vue. This allowed attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML that
  executes in the browser when the field is displayed. The issue has been fixed in v9.11.1 .
