aliases: []
summary: "This affects versions of the package opencart/opencart from 4.0.0.0. An Arbitrary\
  \ File Creation issue was identified via the database restoration functionality. By injecting\
  \ PHP code into the database, an attacker with admin privileges can create a backup file with\
  \ an arbitrary filename (including the extension), within /system/storage/backup.\r\r**Note:**\r\
  \rIt is less likely for the created file to be available within the web root, as part of the\
  \ security recommendations for the application suggest moving the storage path outside of\
  \ the web root."
