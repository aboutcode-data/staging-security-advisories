aliases: []
summary: Valinor is a PHP library that helps to map any input into a strongly-typed value object
  structure. Prior to version 0.12.0, Valinor can use `Throwable#getMessage()` when it should
  not have permission to do so. This is a problem with cases such as an SQL exception showing
  an SQL snippet, a database connection exception showing database IP address/username/password,
  or a timeout detail / out of memory detail. Attackers could use this information for potential
  data exfiltration, denial of service attacks, enumeration attacks, etc. Version 0.12.0 contains
  a patch for this vulnerability.
