aliases: []
summary: The Log HTTP Requests plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via logged HTTP requests in versions up to, and including, 1.3.1 due to insufficient input
  sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers who
  can trick a site's administrator into performing an action like clicking on a link, or an
  authenticated user with access to a page that sends a request using user-supplied data via
  the server, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
  an injected page.
