  more to the game. Prior to versions 1.20.1-1.106.0, 1.19.4-1.106.0, 1.19.2-1.101.3, 1.18.2-1.101.3,
  and 1.16.5-1.101.3, if the cc-tweaked plugin is running on a Minecraft server hosted on a
  popular cloud hosting providers, like AWS, GCP, and Azure, those metadata services API endpoints
  are not forbidden (aka "blacklisted") by default. As such, any player can gain access to sensitive

  escalate into the hosting provider. Versions 1.20.1-1.106.0, 1.19.4-1.106.0, 1.19.2-1.101.3,
