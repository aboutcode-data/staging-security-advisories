summary: 'One Identity Password Manager before 5.13.1 allows Kiosk Escape. This product enables
  users to reset their Active Directory passwords on the login screen of a Windows client. It
  launches a Chromium based browser in Kiosk mode to provide the reset functionality. The escape
  sequence is: wait for a session timeout, click on the Help icon, observe that there is a browser
  window for the One Identity website, navigate to any website that offers file upload, navigate
  to cmd.exe from the file explorer window, and launch cmd.exe as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.'
