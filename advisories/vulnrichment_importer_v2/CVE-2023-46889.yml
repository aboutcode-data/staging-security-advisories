aliases: []
summary: Meross MSH30Q 4.5.23 is vulnerable to Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information.
  During the device setup phase, the MSH30Q creates an unprotected Wi-Fi access point. In this
  phase, MSH30Q needs to connect to the Internet through a Wi-Fi router. This is why MSH30Q
  asks for the Wi-Fi network name (SSID) and the Wi-Fi network password. When the user enters
  the password, the transmission of the Wi-Fi password and name between the MSH30Q and mobile
  application is observed in the Wi-Fi network. Although the Wi-Fi password is encrypted, a
  part of the decryption algorithm is public so we complemented the missing parts to decrypt
  it.
