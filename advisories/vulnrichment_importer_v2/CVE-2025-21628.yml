aliases: []
summary: Chatwoot is a customer engagement suite. Prior to 3.16.0, conversation and contact
  filters endpoints did not sanitize the input of query_operator passed from the frontend or
  the API. This provided any actor who is authenticated, an attack vector to run arbitrary SQL
  within the filter query by adding a tautological WHERE clause. This issue is patched with
  v3.16.0.
