aliases: []
summary: The Timetable and Event Schedule by MotoPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  SQL Injection via the 'events' attribute of the 'mp-timetable' shortcode in all versions up
  to, and including, 2.4.11 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and
  lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into
  already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
