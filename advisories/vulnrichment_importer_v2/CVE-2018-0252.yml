summary: 'A vulnerability in the IP Version 4 (IPv4) fragment reassembly function of Cisco 3500,
  5500, and 8500 Series Wireless LAN Controller Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote
  attacker to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service
  (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a corruption of an internal data structure process
  that occurs when the affected software reassembles certain IPv4 packets. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by sending certain malformed IPv4 fragments to an affected device.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in
  a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects all releases of 8.4 until the first fixed release
  for the 5500 and 8500 Series Wireless LAN Controllers and releases 8.5.103.0 and 8.5.105.0
  for the 3500, 5500, and 8500 Series Wireless LAN Controllers. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf89222.'
