aliases: []
summary: Versions of Async HTTP Client prior to 1.13.2 are vulnerable to a form of targeted
  request manipulation called CRLF injection. This vulnerability was the result of insufficient
  validation of HTTP header field values before sending them to the network. Users are vulnerable
  if they pass untrusted data into HTTP header field values without prior sanitisation. Common
  use-cases here might be to place usernames from a database into HTTP header fields. This vulnerability
  allows attackers to inject new HTTP header fields, or entirely new requests, into the data
  stream. This can cause requests to be understood very differently by the remote server than
  was intended. In general, this is unlikely to result in data disclosure, but it can result
  in a number of logical errors and other misbehaviours.
