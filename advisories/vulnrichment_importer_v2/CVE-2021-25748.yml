aliases: []
summary: A security issue was discovered in ingress-nginx where a user that can create or update
  ingress objects can use a newline character to bypass the sanitization of the `spec.rules[].http.paths[].path`
  field of an Ingress object (in the `networking.k8s.io` or `extensions` API group) to obtain
  the credentials of the ingress-nginx controller. In the default configuration, that credential
  has access to all secrets in the cluster.
