aliases: []
summary: The MiCard PLUS Ci and MiCard PLUS BLE reader products developed by rf IDEAS and rebranded
  by NT-ware have a firmware fault that may result in characters randomly being dropped from
  some ID card reads, which would result in the wrong ID card number being assigned during ID
  card self-registration and might result in failed login attempts for end-users. Random characters
  being dropped from ID card numbers compromises the uniqueness of ID cards that can, therefore,
  result in a security issue if the users are using the ‘ID card self-registration’ function.
