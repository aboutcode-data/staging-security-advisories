aliases: []
summary: In the Apache Airflow HDFS Provider, versions prior to 4.1.1, a documentation info
  pointed users to an install incorrect pip package. As this package name was unclaimed, in
  theory, an attacker could claim this package and provide code that would be executed when
  this package was installed. The Airflow team has since taken ownership of the package (neutralizing
  the risk), and fixed the doc strings in version 4.1.1
