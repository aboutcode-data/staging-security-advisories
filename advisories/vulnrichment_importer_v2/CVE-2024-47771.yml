aliases: []
summary: Element Desktop is a Matrix client for desktop platforms. Element Desktop versions
  1.11.70 through 1.11.80 contain a vulnerability which can, under specially crafted conditions,
  lead to the access token becoming exposed to third parties. At least one vector has been identified
  internally, involving malicious widgets, but other vectors may exist. Users are strongly advised
  to upgrade to version 1.11.81 to remediate the issue. As a workaround, avoid granting permissions
  to untrusted widgets.
