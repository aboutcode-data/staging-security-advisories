aliases: []
summary: "Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the Snort 3 HTTP Decoder\
  \ that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the disclosure of possible\
  \ sensitive data or cause the Snort 3 Detection Engine to crash.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability\
  \ is due to an error in the logic of buffer handling when the MIME fields of the HTTP header\
  \ are parsed. This can result in a buffer under-read. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by sending crafted HTTP packets through an established connection that is parsed by Snort\
  \ 3. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to induce one of two possible outcomes:\
  \ the unexpected restarting of the Snort 3 Detection Engine, which could cause a denial of\
  \ service (DoS) condition, or information disclosure of sensitive information in the Snort\
  \ 3 data stream. Due to the under-read condition, it is possible that sensitive information\
  \ that is not valid connection data could be returned."
