aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) implementation of Cisco IOS\
  \ XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to trigger a broadcast storm,\
  \ leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis\
  \ vulnerability is due to how Cisco IOS XR Software processes a high, sustained rate of ARP\
  \ traffic hitting the management interface. Under certain conditions, an attacker could exploit\
  \ this vulnerability by sending an excessive amount of traffic to the management interface\
  \ of an affected device, overwhelming its ARP processing capabilities. A successful exploit\
  \ could result in degraded device performance, loss of management connectivity, and complete\
  \ unresponsiveness of the system, leading to a DoS condition."
