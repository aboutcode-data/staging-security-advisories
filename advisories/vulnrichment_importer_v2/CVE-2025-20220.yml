summary: "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) Software\
  \ and Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, local\
  \ attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system as root.\r\n\r\
  \ This vulnerability is due to improper input validation for specific CLI commands. An attacker\
  \ could exploit this vulnerability by injecting operating system commands into a legitimate\
  \ command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to escape the restricted command\
  \ prompt and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system. To successfully\
  \ exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid Administrator credentials.\r\n\r\
  \ For more information about vulnerable scenarios, see the Details [\"#details\"] section\
  \ of this advisory."
