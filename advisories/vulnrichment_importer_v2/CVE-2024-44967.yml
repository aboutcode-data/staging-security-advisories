  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/mgag200: Bind I2C lifetime to DRM device

  Managed cleanup with devm_add_action_or_reset() will release the I2C
  adapter when the underlying Linux device goes away. But the connector
  still refers to it, so this cleanup leaves behind a stale pointer
  in struct drm_connector.ddc.

  Bind the lifetime of the I2C adapter to the connector's lifetime by
  using DRM's managed release. When the DRM device goes away (after
  the Linux device) DRM will first clean up the connector and then
  clean up the I2C adapter.
