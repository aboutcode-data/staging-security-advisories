aliases: []
summary: OpenEMR is a free and open source electronic health records and medical practice management
  application. Prior to version 8.0.0, the document controller’s `patient_picture` context serves
  the patient’s photo by document ID or patient ID without verifying that the current user is
  authorized to access that patient. An authenticated user with document ACL can supply another
  patient’s ID and retrieve their photo. Version 8.0.0 fixes the issue.
