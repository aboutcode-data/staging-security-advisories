aliases: []
summary: OpenCanary, a multi-protocol network honeypot, directly executed commands taken from
  its config file. Prior to version 0.9.4, where the config file is stored in an unprivileged
  user directory but the daemon is executed by root, it’s possible for the unprivileged user
  to change the config file and escalate permissions when root later runs the daemon. Version
  0.9.4 contains a fix for the issue.
