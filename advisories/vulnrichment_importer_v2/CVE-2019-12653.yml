aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Raw Socket Transport feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could
  allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of an affected device, resulting
  in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper parsing of Raw
  Socket Transport payloads. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing a
  TCP session and then sending a malicious TCP segment via IPv4 to an affected device. This
  cannot be exploited via IPv6, as the Raw Socket Transport feature does not support IPv6 as
  a network layer protocol.
