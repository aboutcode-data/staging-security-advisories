aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco UCS Director could allow an authenticated,
  remote attacker with administrative privileges to obtain confidential information from an
  affected device. The vulnerability exists because confidential information is returned as
  part of an API response. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted
  request to the API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain the API key of
  another user, which would allow the attacker to impersonate the account of that user on the
  affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have administrative privileges
  on the device.
