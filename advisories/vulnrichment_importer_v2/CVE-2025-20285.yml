summary: "A vulnerability in the IP Access Restriction feature of Cisco ISE and Cisco ISE-PIC\
  \ could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass configured IP access restrictions\
  \ and log in to the device from a disallowed IP address.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due\
  \ to improper enforcement of access controls that are configured using the IP Access Restriction\
  \ feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the API from an unauthorized\
  \ source IP address. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to the targeted\
  \ device from an IP address that should have been restricted. To exploit this vulnerability,\
  \ the attacker must have valid administrative credentials."
