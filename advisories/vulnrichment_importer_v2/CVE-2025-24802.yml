aliases: []
summary: Plonky2 is a SNARK implementation based on techniques from PLONK and FRI. Lookup tables,
  whose length is not divisible by 26 = floor(num_routed_wires / 3) always include the 0 ->
  0 input-output pair. Thus a malicious prover can always prove that f(0) = 0 for any lookup
  table f (unless its length happens to be divisible by 26). The cause of problem is that the
  LookupTableGate-s are padded with zeros. A workaround from the user side is to extend the
  table (by repeating some entries) so that its length becomes divisible by 26. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 1.0.1.
