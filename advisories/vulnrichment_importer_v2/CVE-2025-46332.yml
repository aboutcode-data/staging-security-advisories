aliases: []
summary: Flags SDK is an open-source feature flags toolkit for Next.js and SvelteKit. Impacted
  versions include flags from 3.2.0 and prior and @vercel/flags from 3.1.1 and prior as certain
  circumstances allows a bad actor with detailed knowledge of the vulnerability to list all
  flags returned by the flags discovery endpoint (.well-known/vercel/flags). This vulnerability
  allows for information disclosure, where a bad actor could gain access to a list of all feature
  flags exposed through the flags discovery endpoint, including the flag names, flag descriptions,
  available options and their labels (e.g. true, false), and default flag values. This issue
  has been patched in flags@4.0.0, users of flags and @vercel/flags should also migrate to flags@4.0.0.
