aliases: []
summary: go-libp2p is the offical libp2p implementation in the Go programming language. Version
  `0.18.0` and older of go-libp2p are vulnerable to targeted resource exhaustion attacks. These
  attacks target libp2p’s connection, stream, peer, and memory management. An attacker can cause
  the allocation of large amounts of memory, ultimately leading to the process getting killed
  by the host’s operating system. While a connection manager tasked with keeping the number
  of connections within manageable limits has been part of go-libp2p, this component was designed
  to handle the regular churn of peers, not a targeted resource exhaustion attack. Users are
  advised to upgrade their version of go-libp2p to version `0.18.1` or newer. Users unable to
  upgrade may consult the denial of service (dos) mitigation page for more information on how
  to incorporate mitigation strategies, monitor your application, and respond to attacks.
