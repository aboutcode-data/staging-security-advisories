aliases: []
summary: A memory leak in Node.js’s OpenSSL integration occurs when converting `X.509` certificate
  fields to UTF-8 without freeing the allocated buffer. When applications call `socket.getPeerCertificate(true)`,
  each certificate field leaks memory, allowing remote clients to trigger steady memory growth
  through repeated TLS connections. Over time this can lead to resource exhaustion and denial
  of service.
