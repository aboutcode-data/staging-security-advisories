aliases: []
summary: 'Technicolor TG588V V2 devices allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (networking outage) via a flood of random MAC addresses, as demonstrated by macof. NOTE: this
  might overlap CVE-2018-15852 and CVE-2018-15907. NOTE: Technicolor denies that the described
  behavior is a vulnerability and states that Wi-Fi traffic is slowed or stopped only while
  the devices are exposed to a MAC flooding attack. This has been confirmed through testing
  against official up-to-date versions'
