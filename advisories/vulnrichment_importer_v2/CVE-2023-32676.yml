aliases: []
summary: Autolab is a course management service that enables auto-graded programming assignments.
  A Tar slip vulnerability was found in the Install assessment functionality of Autolab. To
  exploit this vulnerability an authenticated attacker with instructor permissions needs to
  upload a specially crafted Tar file. Using the install assessment functionality an attacker
  can feed a Tar file that contain files with paths pointing outside of the target directory
  (e.g.,  `../../../../tmp/tarslipped1.sh`). When the Install assessment form is submitted the
  files inside of the archives are expanded to the attacker-chosen locations. This issue has
  been addressed in version 2.11.0. Users are advised to upgrade.
