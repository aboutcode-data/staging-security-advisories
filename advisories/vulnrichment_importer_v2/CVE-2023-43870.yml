aliases: []
summary: When installing the Net2 software a root certificate is installed into the trusted
  store. A potential hacker could access the installer batch file or reverse engineer the source
  code to gain access to the root certificate password. Using the root certificate and password
  they could then create their own certificates to emulate another site. Then by establishing
  a proxy service to emulate the site they could monitor traffic passed between the end user
  and the site allowing access to the data content.
