aliases: []
summary: The Popup More Popups, Lightboxes, and more popup modules plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Local File Inclusion in version 2.1.6 via the ycfChangeElementData() function. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to include
  and execute arbitrary files ending with "Form.php" on the server , allowing the execution
  of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive
  data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded
  and included.
