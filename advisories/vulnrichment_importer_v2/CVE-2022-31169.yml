aliases: []
summary: Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. There is a bug in Wasmtime's code
  generator, Cranelift, for AArch64 targets where constant divisors can result in incorrect
  division results at runtime. This affects Wasmtime prior to version 0.38.2 and Cranelift prior
  to 0.85.2. This issue only affects the AArch64 platform. Other platforms are not affected.
  The translation rules for constants did not take into account whether sign or zero-extension
  should happen which resulted in an incorrect value being placed into a register when a division
  was encountered. The impact of this bug is that programs executing within the WebAssembly
  sandbox would not behave according to the WebAssembly specification. This means that it is
  hypothetically possible for execution within the sandbox to go awry and WebAssembly programs
  could produce unexpected results. This should not impact hosts executing WebAssembly but does
  affect the correctness of guest programs. This bug has been patched in Wasmtime version 0.38.2
  and cranelift-codegen 0.85.2. There are no known workarounds.
