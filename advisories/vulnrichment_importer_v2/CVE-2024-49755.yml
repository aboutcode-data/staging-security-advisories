aliases: []
summary: Duende IdentityServer is an OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.x framework for ASP.NET Core.
  IdentityServer's local API authentication handler performs insufficient validation of the
  cnf claim in DPoP access tokens. This allows an attacker to use leaked DPoP access tokens
  at local api endpoints even without possessing the private key for signing proof tokens. Note
  that this only impacts custom endpoints within an IdentityServer implementation that have
  explicitly used the LocalApiAuthenticationHandler for authentication. This vulnerability is
  patched in IdentityServer 7.0.8. Version 6.3 and below are unaffected, as they do not support
  DPoP in Local APIs.
