aliases: []
summary: The Infinite-Scroll plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the process_ajax_edit and process_ajax_delete function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to make changes to plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a
  site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
