aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in set_con2fb_map in drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbcon.c in the
  Linux kernel before 6.2.12. Because an assignment occurs only for the first vc, the fbcon_registered_fb
  and fbcon_display arrays can be desynchronized in fbcon_mode_deleted (the con2fb_map points
  at the old fb_info).
