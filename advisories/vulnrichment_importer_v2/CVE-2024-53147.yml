  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  exfat: fix out-of-bounds access of directory entries

  In the case of the directory size is greater than or equal to
  the cluster size, if start_clu becomes an EOF cluster(an invalid
  cluster) due to file system corruption, then the directory entry
  where ei->hint_femp.eidx hint is outside the directory, resulting
  in an out-of-bounds access, which may cause further file system
  corruption.

  This commit adds a check for start_clu, if it is an invalid cluster,
  the file or directory will be treated as empty.
