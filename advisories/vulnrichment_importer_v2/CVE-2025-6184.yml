aliases: []
summary: The Tutor LMS Pro – eLearning and online course solution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to time-based SQL Injection via the ‘order’ parameter used in the get_submitted_assignments()
  function in all versions up to, and including, 3.7.0 due to insufficient escaping on the user
  supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers, with Tutor-level access and above, to append additional
  SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information
  from the database. Only the Pro version is affected.
