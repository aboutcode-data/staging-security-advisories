aliases: []
summary: Rapid7 Metasploit Pro versions 4.21.2 and lower suffer from a stored cross site scripting
  vulnerability, due to a lack of JavaScript request string sanitization.  Using this vulnerability,
  an authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and script code in the target browser
  against another Metasploit Pro user using a specially crafted request. Note that in most deployments,
  all Metasploit Pro users tend to enjoy privileges equivalent to local administrator.
