aliases: []
summary: The bash_completion script for fscrypt allows injection of commands via crafted mountpoint
  paths, allowing privilege escalation under a specific set of circumstances. A local user who
  has control over mountpoint paths could potentially escalate their privileges if they create
  a malicious mountpoint path and if the system administrator happens to be using the fscrypt
  bash completion script to complete mountpoint paths. We recommend upgrading to version 0.3.3
  or above
