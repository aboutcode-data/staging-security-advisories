aliases: []
summary: JumpServer is an open source bastion host and a professional operation and maintenance
  security audit system. Starting in version 3.0.0 and prior to versions 3.5.5 and 3.6.4, session
  replays can download without authentication. Session replays stored in S3, OSS, or other cloud
  storage are not affected. The api `/api/v1/terminal/sessions/` permission control is broken
  and can be accessed anonymously. SessionViewSet permission classes set to `[RBACPermission
  | IsSessionAssignee]`, relation is or, so any permission matched will be allowed. Versions
  3.5.5 and 3.6.4 have a fix. After upgrading, visit the api `$HOST/api/v1/terminal/sessions/?limit=1`.
  The expected http response code is 401 (`not_authenticated`).
