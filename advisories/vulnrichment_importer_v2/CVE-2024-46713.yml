  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  perf/aux: Fix AUX buffer serialization

  Ole reported that event->mmap_mutex is strictly insufficient to
  serialize the AUX buffer, add a per RB mutex to fully serialize it.

  Note that in the lock order comment the perf_event::mmap_mutex order
  was already wrong, that is, it nesting under mmap_lock is not new with
  this patch.
