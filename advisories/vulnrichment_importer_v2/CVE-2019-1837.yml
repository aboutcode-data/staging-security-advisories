aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the User Data Services (UDS) API of Cisco Unified Communications
  Manager (Unified CM) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of
  service (DoS) condition on the management GUI. The vulnerability is due to improper validation
  of input parameters in the UDS API requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a crafted request to the UDS API of an affected device. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to make the A Cisco DB service quit unexpectedly, preventing admin access
  to the Unified CM management GUI. Manual intervention may be required to restore normal operation.
  Software versions 10.5, 11.5, 12.0, 12.5 are affected.
