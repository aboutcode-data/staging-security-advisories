aliases: []
summary: Lara Translate MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server for Lara Translate
  API. Versions 0.0.11 and below contain a command injection vulnerability which exists in the
  @translated/lara-mcp MCP Server. The vulnerability is caused by the unsanitized use of input
  parameters within a call to child_process.exec, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary system
  commands. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution under the server process's
  privileges. The server constructs and executes shell commands using unvalidated user input
  directly within command-line strings. This introduces the possibility of shell metacharacter
  injection (|, >, &&, etc.). This vulnerability is fixed in version 0.0.12.
