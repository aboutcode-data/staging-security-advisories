aliases: []
summary: Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on ActivityPub.  In Mastodon
  before 4.4.6, 4.3.14, and 4.2.27, when an administrator resets a user account's password via
  the command-line interface using `bin/tootctl accounts modify --reset-password`, active sessions
  and access tokens for that account are not revoked. This allows an attacker with access to
  a previously compromised session or token to continue using the account after the password
  has been reset. This issue has been patched in versions 4.2.27, 4.3.14, and 4.4.6. No known
  workarounds exist.
