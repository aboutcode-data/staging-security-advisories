summary: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the CoverManager booking software.
  This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application, which are permanently
  stored on the server. The malicious scripts are executed in the browser of any user visiting
  the affected page without the user having to take any further action. This can allow the attacker
  to steal sensitive information, such as session cookies, login credentials, and perform actions
  on behalf of the affected user.
