aliases: []
summary: RDS Light is a simplified version of the Reflective Dialogue System (RDS), a self-reflecting
  AI framework. Versions prior to 1.1.0 contain a vulnerability that involves a lack of input
  validation within the RDS AI framework, specifically within the user input handling code in
  the main module (`main.py`). This leaves the framework open to injection attacks and potential
  memory tampering. Any user or external actor providing input to the system could exploit this
  vulnerability to inject malicious commands, corrupt stored data, or affect API calls. This
  is particularly critical for users employing RDS AI in production environments where it interacts
  with sensitive systems, performs dynamic memory caching, or retrieves user-specific data for
  analysis. Impacted areas include developers using the RDS AI system as a backend for AI-driven
  applications and systems running RDS AI that may be exposed to untrusted environments or receive
  unverified user inputs. The vulnerability has been patched in version 1.1.0 of the RDS AI
  framework. All user inputs are now sanitized and validated against a set of rules designed
  to mitigate malicious content. Users should upgrade to version 1.1.0 or higher and ensure
  all dependencies are updated to their latest versions. For users unable to upgrade to the
  patched version, a workaround can be implemented. The user implementing the workaround should
  implement custom validation checks for user inputs to filter out unsafe characters and patterns
  (e.g., SQL injection attempts, script injections) and limit or remove features that allow
  user input until the system can be patched.
