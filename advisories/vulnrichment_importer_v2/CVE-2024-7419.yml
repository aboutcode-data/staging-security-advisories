aliases: []
summary: "The WP ALL Export Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution\
  \ in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.1 via the custom export fields. This is due to\
  \ the missing input validation and sanitization of user-supplied data. This makes it possible\
  \ for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary PHP code into form fields that get executed\
  \ on the server during the export, potentially leading to a complete site compromise. \r\n\
  As a prerequisite, the custom export field should include fields containing user-supplied\
  \ data."
