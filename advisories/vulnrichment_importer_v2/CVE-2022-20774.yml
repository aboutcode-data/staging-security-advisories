aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco IP Phone 6800, 7800,
  and 8800 Series with Multiplatform Firmware could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack against a user of the web-based interface
  of an affected system. This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the
  web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by persuading an authenticated user of the interface to follow a crafted link. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to perform configuration changes on the affected device,
  resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
