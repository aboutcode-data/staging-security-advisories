aliases: []
summary: Bluetooth® Low Energy Pairing in Bluetooth Core Specification v4.0 through v5.3 may
  permit an unauthenticated MITM to acquire credentials with two pairing devices via adjacent
  access when the MITM negotiates Legacy Passkey Pairing with the pairing Initiator and Secure
  Connections Passkey Pairing with the pairing Responder and brute forces the Passkey entered
  by the user into the Initiator. The MITM attacker can use the identified Passkey value to
  complete authentication with the Responder via Bluetooth pairing method confusion.
