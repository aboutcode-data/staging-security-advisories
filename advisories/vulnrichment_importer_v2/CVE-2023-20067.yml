aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the HTTP-based client profiling feature of Cisco IOS XE Software
  for Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs) could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause
  a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient
  input validation of received traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
  crafted traffic through a wireless access point. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to cause CPU utilization to increase, which could result in a DoS condition on an affected
  device and could cause new wireless client associations to fail. Once the offending traffic
  stops, the affected system will return to an operational state and new client associations
  will succeed.
