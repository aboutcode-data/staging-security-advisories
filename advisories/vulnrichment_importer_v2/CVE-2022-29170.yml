aliases: []
summary: Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In Grafana Enterprise,
  the Request security feature allows list allows to configure Grafana in a way so that the
  instance doesn’t call or only calls specific hosts. The vulnerability present starting with
  version 7.4.0-beta1 and prior to versions 7.5.16 and 8.5.3 allows someone to bypass these
  security configurations if a malicious datasource (running on an allowed host) returns an
  HTTP redirect to a forbidden host. The vulnerability only impacts Grafana Enterprise when
  the Request security allow list is used and there is a possibility to add a custom datasource
  to Grafana which returns HTTP redirects. In this scenario, Grafana would blindly follow the
  redirects and potentially give secure information to the clients. Grafana Cloud is not impacted
  by this vulnerability. Versions 7.5.16 and 8.5.3 contain a patch for this issue. There are
  currently no known workarounds.
