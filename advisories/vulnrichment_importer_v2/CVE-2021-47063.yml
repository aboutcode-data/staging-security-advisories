  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm: bridge/panel: Cleanup connector on bridge detach

  If we don't call drm_connector_cleanup() manually in
  panel_bridge_detach(), the connector will be cleaned up with the other
  DRM objects in the call to drm_mode_config_cleanup(). However, since our
  drm_connector is devm-allocated, by the time drm_mode_config_cleanup()
  will be called, our connector will be long gone. Therefore, the
  connector must be cleaned up when the bridge is detached to avoid
  use-after-free conditions.

  v2: Cleanup connector only if it was created

  v3: Add FIXME

  v4: (Use connector->dev) directly in if() block
