aliases: []
summary: "After gaining access to the firmware of a charging station, a file at <redacted> can\
  \ be accessed to obtain default credentials that are the same across all Iocharger AC model\
  \ EV chargers.\n\nThis issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC models before firmware version\
  \ 25010801. \n\nThe issue is addressed by requiring a mandatory password change on first login,\
  \ it is still recommended to change the password on older models.\n\nLikelihood: Moderate\
  \ – The attacker will first have to abuse a code execution or file inclusion vulnerability\
  \ (for example by using <redacted>.sh) to gain access to the <redacted>.json file, or obtain\
  \ a firmware dump of the charging station or obtain the firmware via other channels.\n\nImpact:\
  \ Critical – All chargers using Iocharger firmware for AC models started with the same initial\
  \ password. For models with firmware version before 25010801 a password change was not mandatory.\
  \ It is therefore very likely that this firmware password is still active on many chargers.\
  \ These credentials could, once obtained, allow an attacker to log into many Iocharger charging\
  \ station, and allow them to execute arbitrary commands via the System → Custom page.\n\n\
  CVSS clarification: Any network interface serving the web ui is vulnerable (AV:N) and there\
  \ are not additional security measures to circumvent (AC:L), nor does the attack require and\
  \ existing preconditions (AT:N). The attack is authenticated, and requires high privileges\
  \ (PR:H), there is no user interaction required (UI:N). The attack leads to a compromised\
  \ of the confidentialy of the \"super user\" credentials of the device (VC:H/VI:N/VA:N), and\
  \ can subsequently be used to full compromise and other devices (SC:H/SI:H/SA:H). Becuase\
  \ this is an EV charger handing significant power, there is a potential safety impact (S:P).\
  \ This attack can be automated (AU:Y)."
