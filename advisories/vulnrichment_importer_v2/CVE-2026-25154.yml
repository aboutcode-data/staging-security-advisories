summary: LocalSend is a free, open-source app that allows users to share files and messages
  with nearby devices over their local network without needing an internet connection. In versions
  up to and including 1.17.0, when a user initiates a "Share via Link" session, the LocalSend
  application starts a local HTTP server to host the selected files. The client-side logic for
  this web interface is contained in `app/assets/web/main.js`. Note that at [0], the `handleFilesDisplay`
  function constructs the HTML for the file list by iterating over the files received from the
  server. Commit 8f3cec85aa29b2b13fed9b2f8e499e1ac9b0504c contains a patch.
