aliases: []
summary: 'Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and
  modifying the metadata of image files. The assertion failure is triggered when Exiv2 is used
  to modify the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the
  vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2
  on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when modifying the metadata,
  which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For example, to
  trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line
  argument such as `fi`. ### Patches The bug is fixed in version v0.27.5. ### References Regression
  test and bug fix: #1739 ### For more information Please see our [security policy](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/policy)
  for information about Exiv2 security.'
