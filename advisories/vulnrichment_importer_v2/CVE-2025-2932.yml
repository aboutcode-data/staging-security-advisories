aliases: []
summary: The JKDEVKIT plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient
  file path validation in the 'font_upload_handler' function in all versions up to, and including,
  1.9.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and
  above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution
  when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). If WooCommerce is enabled, attackers
  will need Contributor-level access and above.
