  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  exfat: fix the new buffer was not zeroed before writing

  Before writing, if a buffer_head marked as new, its data must
  be zeroed, otherwise uninitialized data in the page cache will
  be written.

  So this commit uses folio_zero_new_buffers() to zero the new
  buffers before ->write_end().
