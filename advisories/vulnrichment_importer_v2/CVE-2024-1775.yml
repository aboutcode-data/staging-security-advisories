aliases: []
summary: 'The Nextend Social Login and Register plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to a self-based
  Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘error_description’ parameter in all versions up to,
  and including, 3.1.12 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers, with access to a subscriber-level account, to inject
  arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing
  an action such as clicking on a link. NOTE: This vulnerability can be successfully exploited
  on a vulnerable WordPress instance against an OAuth pre-authenticated higher-level user (e.g.,
  administrator) by leveraging a cross-site request forgery in conjunction with a certain social
  engineering technique to achieve a critical impact scenario (cross-site scripting to administrator-level
  account creation). However, successful exploitation requires "Debug mode" to be enabled in
  the plugin''s "Global Settings".'
