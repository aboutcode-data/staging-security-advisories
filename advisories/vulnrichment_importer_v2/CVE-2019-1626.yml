summary: A vulnerability in the vManage web-based UI (Web UI) of the Cisco SD-WAN Solution could
  allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain elevated privileges on an affected vManage
  device. The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly authorize certain user actions in
  the device configuration. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the

  attackers to gain elevated privileges and make changes to the configuration that they would
  not normally be authorized to make.
