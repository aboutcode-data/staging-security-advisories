  i2c: stm32f7: fix reference leak when pm_runtime_get_sync fails

  The PM reference count is not expected to be incremented on
  return in these stm32f7_i2c_xx serious functions.

  However, pm_runtime_get_sync will increment the PM reference
  count even failed. Forgetting to putting operation will result
  in a reference leak here.

  Replace it with pm_runtime_resume_and_get to keep usage
  counter balanced.
