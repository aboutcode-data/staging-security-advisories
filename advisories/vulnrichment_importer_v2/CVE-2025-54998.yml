aliases: []
summary: OpenBao exists to provide a software solution to manage, store, and distribute sensitive
  data including secrets, certificates, and keys. In versions 0.1.0 through 2.3.1, attackers
  could bypass the automatic user lockout mechanisms in the OpenBao Userpass or LDAP auth systems.
  This was caused by different aliasing between pre-flight and full login request user entity
  alias attributions. This is fixed in version 2.3.2. To work around this issue, existing users
  may apply rate-limiting quotas on the authentication endpoints:, see https://openbao.org/api-docs/system/rate-limit-quotas/.
