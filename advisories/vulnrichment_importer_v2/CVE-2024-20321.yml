aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the External Border Gateway Protocol (eBGP) implementation of Cisco\
  \ NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service\
  \ (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability exists because eBGP traffic\
  \ is mapped to a shared hardware rate-limiter queue. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by sending large amounts of network traffic with certain characteristics through an affected\
  \ device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause eBGP neighbor sessions to\
  \ be dropped, leading to a DoS condition in the network."
