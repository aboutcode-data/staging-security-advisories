summary: 'A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Web Security Appliance
  (WSA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a reflected or Document Object
  Model based (DOM-based) cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based
  management interface of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation
  of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted
  link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the
  context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.
