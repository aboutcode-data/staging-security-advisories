aliases: []
summary: The openml/openml.org web application version v2.0.20241110 uses incremental user IDs
  and insufficient email ownership verification during email update workflows. An authenticated
  attacker controlling a user account with a lower user ID can update their email address to
  that of another user with a higher user ID without proper verification. This results in the
  victim's email being reassigned to the attacker's account, causing the victim to be locked
  out immediately and unable to log in. The vulnerability leads to denial of service via account
  lockout but does not grant the attacker direct access to the victim's private data.
