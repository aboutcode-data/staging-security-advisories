aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw: Fix NAPI registration sequence

  Registering the interrupts for TX or RX DMA Channels prior to registering
  their respective NAPI callbacks can result in a NULL pointer dereference.
  This is seen in practice as a random occurrence since it depends on the
  randomness associated with the generation of traffic by Linux and the
  reception of traffic from the wire.
