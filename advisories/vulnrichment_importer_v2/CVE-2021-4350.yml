aliases: []
summary: The Frontend File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated HTML
  Injection in versions up to, and including, 18.2. This is due to lacking authentication protections
  on the wpfm_send_file_in_email AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to send emails using the site with a custom subject, recipient email, and body with unsanitized
  HTML content.  This effectively lets the attacker use the site as a spam relay.
