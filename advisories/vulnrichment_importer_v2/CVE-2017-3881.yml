aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Cisco Cluster Management Protocol (CMP) processing code in
  Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause
  a reload of an affected device or remotely execute code with elevated privileges. The Cluster
  Management Protocol utilizes Telnet internally as a signaling and command protocol between
  cluster members. The vulnerability is due to the combination of two factors: (1) the failure
  to restrict the use of CMP-specific Telnet options only to internal, local communications
  between cluster members and instead accept and process such options over any Telnet connection
  to an affected device; and (2) the incorrect processing of malformed CMP-specific Telnet options.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed CMP-specific Telnet options
  while establishing a Telnet session with an affected Cisco device configured to accept Telnet
  connections. An exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full
  control of the device or cause a reload of the affected device. This affects Catalyst switches,
  Embedded Service 2020 switches, Enhanced Layer 2 EtherSwitch Service Module, Enhanced Layer
  2/3 EtherSwitch Service Module, Gigabit Ethernet Switch Module (CGESM) for HP, IE Industrial
  Ethernet switches, ME 4924-10GE switch, RF Gateway 10, and SM-X Layer 2/3 EtherSwitch Service
  Module. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd48893.'
