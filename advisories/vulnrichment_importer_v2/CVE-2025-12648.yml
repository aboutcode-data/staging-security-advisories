aliases: []
summary: The WP-Members Membership Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized file access
  in versions up to, and including, 3.5.4.4. This is due to storing user-uploaded files in predictable
  directories (wp-content/uploads/wpmembers/user_files/<user_id>/) without implementing proper
  access controls beyond basic directory listing protection (.htaccess with Options -Indexes).
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to directly access and download sensitive
  documents uploaded by site users via direct URL access, granted they can guess or enumerate
  user IDs and filenames.
