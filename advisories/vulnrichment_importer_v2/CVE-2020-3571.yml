aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the ICMP ingress packet processing of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense
  (FTD) Software for Cisco Firepower 4110 appliances could allow an unauthenticated, remote
  attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability
  is due to incomplete input validation upon receiving ICMP packets. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by sending a high number of crafted ICMP or ICMPv6 packets to an affected
  device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a memory exhaustion condition
  that may result in an unexpected reload. No manual intervention is needed to recover the device
  after the reload.
