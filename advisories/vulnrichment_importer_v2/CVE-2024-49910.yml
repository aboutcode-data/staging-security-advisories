  drm/amd/display: Add NULL check for function pointer in dcn401_set_output_transfer_func

  This commit adds a null check for the set_output_gamma function pointer
  in the dcn401_set_output_transfer_func function. Previously,
  set_output_gamma was being checked for null, but then it was being
  dereferenced without any null check. This could lead to a null pointer
  dereference if set_output_gamma is null.

  To fix this, we now ensure that set_output_gamma is not null before
  dereferencing it. We do this by adding a null check for set_output_gamma
  before the call to set_output_gamma.
