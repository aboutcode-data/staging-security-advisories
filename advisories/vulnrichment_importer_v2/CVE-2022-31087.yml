aliases: []
summary: LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g. users, groups,
  DHCP settings) stored in an LDAP directory. In versions prior to 8.0 the tmp directory, which
  is accessible by /lam/tmp/, allows interpretation of .php (and .php5/.php4/.phpt/etc) files.
  An attacker capable of writing files under www-data privileges can write a web-shell into
  this directory, and gain a Code Execution on the host. This issue has been fixed in version
  8.0. Users unable to upgrade should disallow executing PHP scripts in (/var/lib/ldap-account-manager/)tmp
  directory.
