  drm/vmwgfx: Prevent unmapping active read buffers

  The kms paths keep a persistent map active to read and compare the cursor
  buffer. These maps can race with each other in simple scenario where:
  a) buffer "a" mapped for update
  b) buffer "a" mapped for compare
  c) do the compare
  d) unmap "a" for compare
  e) update the cursor
  f) unmap "a" for update
  At step "e" the buffer has been unmapped and the read contents is bogus.

  Prevent unmapping of active read buffers by simply keeping a count of
  how many paths have currently active maps and unmap only when the count
  reaches 0.
