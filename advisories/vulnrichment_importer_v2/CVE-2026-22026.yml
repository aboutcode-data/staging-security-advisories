summary: CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security
  Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running
  the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. Prior to version 1.4.3, the libcurl write_callback
  function in the KMC crypto service client allows unbounded memory growth by reallocating response
  buffers without any size limit or overflow check. A malicious KMC server can return arbitrarily
  large HTTP responses, forcing the client to allocate excessive memory until the process is
  terminated by the OS. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.3.
