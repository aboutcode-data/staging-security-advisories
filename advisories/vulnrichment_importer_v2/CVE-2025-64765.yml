aliases: []
summary: Astro is a web framework. Prior to version 5.15.8, a mismatch exists between how Astro
  normalizes request paths for routing/rendering and how the application’s middleware reads
  the path for validation checks. Astro internally applies decodeURI() to determine which route
  to render, while the middleware uses context.url.pathname without applying the same normalization
  (decodeURI). This discrepancy may allow attackers to reach protected routes using encoded
  path variants that pass routing but bypass validation checks. This issue has been patched
  in version 5.15.8.
