aliases: []
summary: The The InPost Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution
  via the inpost_gallery_get_shortcode_template AJAX action in all versions up to, and including,
  2.1.4.2. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly
  validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Subscriber-level access and above, to execute arbitrary shortcodes.
