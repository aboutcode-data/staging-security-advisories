aliases: []
summary: efs-utils is a set of Utilities for Amazon Elastic File System (EFS). A potential race
  condition issue exists within the Amazon EFS mount helper in efs-utils versions v1.34.3 and
  below. When using TLS to mount file systems, the mount helper allocates a local port for stunnel
  to receive NFS connections prior to applying the TLS tunnel. In affected versions, concurrent
  mount operations can allocate the same local port, leading to either failed mount operations
  or an inappropriate mapping from an EFS customer’s local mount points to that customer’s EFS
  file systems. This issue is patched in version v1.34.4. There is no recommended work around.
  We recommend affected users update the installed version of efs-utils to v1.34.4 or later.
