aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the DHCP snooping security feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could\
  \ allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a full interface queue wedge, which could\
  \ result in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper\
  \ handling of DHCP request packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending\
  \ DHCP request packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker\
  \ to cause packets to wedge in the queue, creating a DoS condition for downstream devices\
  \ of the affected system and requiring that the system restart to drain the queue.\r\n\r Note:\
  \ This vulnerability can be exploited with either unicast or broadcast DHCP packets on a VLAN\
  \ that does not have DHCP snooping enabled."
