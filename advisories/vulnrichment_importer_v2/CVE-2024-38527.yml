aliases: []
summary: ZenUML is JavaScript-based diagramming tool that requires no server, using Markdown-inspired
  text definitions and a renderer to create and modify sequence diagrams. Markdown-based comments
  in the ZenUML diagram syntax are susceptible to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). The comment feature
  allows the user to attach small notes for reference. This feature allows the user to enter
  in their comment in markdown comment, allowing them to use common markdown features, such
  as `**` for bolded text. However, the markdown text is currently not sanitized before rendering,
  allowing an attacker to enter a malicious payload for the comment which leads to XSS. This
  puts existing applications that use ZenUML unsandboxed at risk of arbitrary JavaScript execution
  when rendering user-controlled diagrams. This vulnerability was patched in version 3.23.25,
