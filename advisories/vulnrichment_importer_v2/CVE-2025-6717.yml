aliases: []
summary: The B1.lt plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'id' parameter
  in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.56 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied
  parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to append additional
  SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information
  from the database.
