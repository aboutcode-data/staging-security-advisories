aliases: []
summary: |
  The Agentspace service was affected by a vulnerability that exposed sensitive information due to the use of predictable Google Cloud Storage bucket names. These names were utilized for error logs and temporary staging during data imports from GCS and Cloud SQL. This predictability allowed an attacker to engage in "bucket squatting" by establishing these buckets before a victim's initial use.

  All versions after December 12th, 2025 have been updated to protect from this vulnerability. No user action is required for this.
