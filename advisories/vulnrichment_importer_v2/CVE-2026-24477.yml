aliases: []
summary: AnythingLLM is an application that turns pieces of content into context that any LLM
  can use as references during chatting. If AnythingLLM prior to version 1.10.0 is configured
  to use Qdrant as the vector database with an API key, this QdrantApiKey could be exposed in
  plain text to unauthenticated users via the `/api/setup-complete` endpoint. Leakage of QdrantApiKey
  allows an unauthenticated attacker full read/write access to the Qdrant vector database instance
  used by AnythingLLM. Since Qdrant often stores the core knowledge base for RAG in AnythingLLM,
  this can lead to complete compromise of the semantic search / retrieval functionality and
  indirect leakage of confidential uploaded documents. Version 1.10.0 patches the issue.
