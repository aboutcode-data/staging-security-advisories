  platform/x86: asus-wmi: Fix racy registrations

  asus_wmi_register_driver() may be called from multiple drivers
  concurrently, which can lead to the racy list operations, eventually
  corrupting the memory and hitting Oops on some ASUS machines.
  Also, the error handling is missing, and it forgot to unregister ACPI
  lps0 dev ops in the error case.

  This patch covers those issues by introducing a simple mutex at
  acpi_wmi_register_driver() & *_unregister_driver, and adding the
  proper call of asus_s2idle_check_unregister() in the error path.
