aliases: []
summary: kcp is a Kubernetes-like control plane for form-factors and use-cases beyond Kubernetes
  and container workloads. Prior to 0.26.3, the identified vulnerability allows creating or
  deleting an object via the APIExport VirtualWorkspace in any arbitrary target workspace for
  pre-existing resources. By design, this should only be allowed when the workspace owner decides
  to give access to an API provider by creating an APIBinding. With this vulnerability, it is
  possible for an attacker to create and delete objects even if none of these requirements are
  satisfied, i.e. even if there is no APIBinding in that workspace at all or the workspace owner
  has created an APIBinding, but rejected a permission claim. A fix for this issue has been
  identified and has been published with kcp 0.26.3 and 0.27.0.
