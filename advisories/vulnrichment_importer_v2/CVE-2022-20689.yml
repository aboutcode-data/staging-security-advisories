aliases: []
summary: "Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco Discovery Protocol functionality of Cisco ATA\
  \ 190 Series Analog Telephone Adapter firmware could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker\
  \ to cause Cisco Discovery Protocol memory corruption on an affected device.\r\n These vulnerabilities\
  \ are due to missing length validation checks when processing Cisco Discovery Protocol messages.\
  \ An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol\
  \ packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an\
  \ out-of-bounds read of the valid Cisco Discovery Protocol packet data, which could allow\
  \ the attacker to cause corruption in the internal Cisco Discovery Protocol database of the\
  \ affected device."
