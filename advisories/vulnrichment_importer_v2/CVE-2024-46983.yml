aliases: []
summary: sofa-hessian is an internal improved version of Hessian3/4 powered by Ant Group CO.,
  Ltd. The SOFA Hessian protocol uses a blacklist mechanism to restrict deserialization of potentially
  dangerous classes for security protection. But there is a gadget chain that can bypass the
  SOFA Hessian blacklist protection mechanism, and this gadget chain only relies on JDK and
  does not rely on any third-party components. This issue is fixed by an update to the blacklist,
  users can upgrade to sofahessian version 3.5.5 to avoid this issue. Users unable to upgrade
  may maintain a blacklist themselves in the directory `external/serialize.blacklist`.
