  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/mediatek: hdmi: Perform NULL pointer check for mtk_hdmi_conf

  In commit 41ca9caaae0b
  ("drm/mediatek: hdmi: Add check for CEA modes only") a check
  for CEA modes was added to function mtk_hdmi_bridge_mode_valid()
  in order to address possible issues on MT8167;
  moreover, with commit c91026a938c2
  ("drm/mediatek: hdmi: Add optional limit on maximal HDMI mode clock")
  another similar check was introduced.

  Unfortunately though, at the time of writing, MT8173 does not provide
  any mtk_hdmi_conf structure and this is crashing the kernel with NULL
  pointer upon entering mtk_hdmi_bridge_mode_valid(), which happens as
  soon as a HDMI cable gets plugged in.

  To fix this regression, add a NULL pointer check for hdmi->conf in the
  said function, restoring HDMI functionality and avoiding NULL pointer
  kernel panics.
