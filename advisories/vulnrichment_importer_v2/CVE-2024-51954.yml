aliases: []
summary: There is an improper access control issue in ArcGIS Server versions 11.3 and below
  on Windows and Linux which, under unique circumstances, could allow a remote, low‑privileged
  authenticated attacker to access secure services published to a standalone (unfederated) ArcGIS
  Server instance. Successful exploitation results in unauthorized access to protected services
  outside the attacker’s originally assigned authorization boundary, constituting a scope change.
  If exploited, this issue would have a high impact on confidentiality, a low impact on integrity,
  and no impact on the availability of the software.
