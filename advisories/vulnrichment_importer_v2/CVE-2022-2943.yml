summary: The WordPress Infinite Scroll – Ajax Load More plugin for Wordpress is vulnerable to
  arbitrary file reading in versions up to, and including, 5.5.3 due to insufficient file path
  validation on the alm_repeaters_export() function. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with administrative privileges, to download arbitrary files hosted on the server
  that may contain sensitive content, such as the wp-config.php file.
