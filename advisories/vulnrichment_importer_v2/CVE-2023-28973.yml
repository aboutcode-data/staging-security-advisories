summary: 'An Improper Authorization vulnerability in the ''sysmanctl'' shell command of Juniper
  Networks Junos OS Evolved allows a local, authenticated attacker to execute administrative
  commands that could impact the integrity of the system or system availability. Administrative
  functions such as daemon restarting, routing engine (RE) switchover, and node shutdown can
  all be performed through exploitation of the ''sysmanctl'' command. Access to the ''sysmanctl''
  command is only available from the Junos shell. Neither direct nor indirect access to ''sysmanctl''
  is available from the Junos CLI. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved: All
  versions prior to 20.4R3-S5-EVO; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-EVO; 21.3 versions prior to
  21.3R2-EVO; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R1-S2-EVO, 21.4R2-EVO.'
