aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the email message filtering feature of Cisco AsyncOS Software for
  Cisco Email Security Appliances (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause
  the CPU utilization to increase to 100 percent, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition
  on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper filtering of email messages that
  contain references to whitelisted URLs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
  a malicious email message that contains a large number of whitelisted URLs. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to cause a sustained DoS condition that could force the affected
  device to stop scanning and forwarding email messages.
