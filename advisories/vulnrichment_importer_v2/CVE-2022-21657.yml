aliases: []
summary: 'Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications.
  In affected versions Envoy does not restrict the set of certificates it accepts from the peer,
  either as a TLS client or a TLS server, to only those certificates that contain the necessary
  extendedKeyUsage (id-kp-serverAuth and id-kp-clientAuth, respectively). This means that a
  peer may present an e-mail certificate (e.g. id-kp-emailProtection), either as a leaf certificate
  or as a CA in the chain, and it will be accepted for TLS. This is particularly bad when combined
  with the issue described in pull request #630, in that it allows a Web PKI CA that is intended
  only for use with S/MIME, and thus exempted from audit or supervision, to issue TLS certificates
  that will be accepted by Envoy. As a result Envoy will trust upstream certificates that should
  not be trusted. There are no known workarounds to this issue. Users are advised to upgrade.'
