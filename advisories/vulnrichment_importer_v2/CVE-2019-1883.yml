aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the command-line interface of Cisco Integrated Management Controller
  (IMC) could allow an authenticated, local attacker with read-only credentials to inject arbitrary
  commands that could allow them to obtain root privileges. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  validation of user-supplied input on the command-line interface. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by authenticating with read-only privileges via the CLI of an affected
  device and submitting crafted input to the affected commands. A successful exploit could allow
  an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device with root privileges.
