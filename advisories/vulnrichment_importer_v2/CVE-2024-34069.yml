aliases: []
summary: Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. The debugger in affected
  versions of Werkzeug can allow an attacker to execute code on a developer's machine under
  some circumstances. This requires the attacker to get the developer to interact with a domain
  and subdomain they control, and enter the debugger PIN, but if they are successful it allows
  access to the debugger even if it is only running on localhost. This also requires the attacker
  to guess a URL in the developer's application that will trigger the debugger. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 3.0.3.
