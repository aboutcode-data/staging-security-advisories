aliases: []
summary: 'Axios is a promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. When Axios starting
  in version 0.28.0 and prior to versions 0.30.2 and 1.12.0 runs on Node.js and is given a URL
  with the `data:` scheme, it does not perform HTTP. Instead, its Node http adapter decodes
  the entire payload into memory (`Buffer`/`Blob`) and returns a synthetic 200 response. This
  path ignores `maxContentLength` / `maxBodyLength` (which only protect HTTP responses), so
  an attacker can supply a very large `data:` URI and cause the process to allocate unbounded
  memory and crash (DoS), even if the caller requested `responseType: ''stream''`. Versions
  0.30.2 and 1.12.0 contain a patch for the issue.'
