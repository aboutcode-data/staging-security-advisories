aliases: []
summary: |
  An access control vulnerability was discovered in Grafana OSS where an Organization administrator could permanently delete the Server administrator account. This vulnerability exists in the DELETE /api/org/users/ endpoint.

  The vulnerability can be exploited when:

  1. An Organization administrator exists

  2. The Server administrator is either:

     - Not part of any organization, or
     - Part of the same organization as the Organization administrator
  Impact:

  - Organization administrators can permanently delete Server administrator accounts

  - If the only Server administrator is deleted, the Grafana instance becomes unmanageable

  - No super-user permissions remain in the system

  - Affects all users, organizations, and teams managed in the instance

  The vulnerability is particularly serious as it can lead to a complete loss of administrative control over the Grafana instance.
