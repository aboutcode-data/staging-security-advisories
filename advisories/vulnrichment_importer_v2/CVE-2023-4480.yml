aliases: []
summary: Due to an out-of-date dependency in the “Fusion File Manager” component accessible
  through the admin panel, an attacker can send a crafted request that allows them to read the
  contents of files on the system accessible within the privileges of the running process. Additionally,
  they may write files to arbitrary locations, provided the files pass the application’s mime-type
  and file extension validation.
