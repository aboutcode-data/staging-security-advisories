  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  cachefiles: add missing lock protection when polling

  Add missing lock protection in poll routine when iterating xarray,
  otherwise:

  Even with RCU read lock held, only the slot of the radix tree is
  ensured to be pinned there, while the data structure (e.g. struct
  cachefiles_req) stored in the slot has no such guarantee.  The poll
  routine will iterate the radix tree and dereference cachefiles_req
  accordingly.  Thus RCU read lock is not adequate in this case and
  spinlock is needed here.
