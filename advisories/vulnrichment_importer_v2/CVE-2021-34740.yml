aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the WLAN Control Protocol (WCP) implementation for Cisco Aironet
  Access Point (AP) software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a reload
  of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability
  is due to incorrect error handling when an affected device receives an unexpected 802.11 frame.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending certain 802.11 frames over the wireless
  network to an interface on an affected AP. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
  cause a packet buffer leak. This could eventually result in buffer allocation failures, which
  would trigger a reload of the affected device.
