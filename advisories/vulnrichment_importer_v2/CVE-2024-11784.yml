aliases: []
summary: The Sell Tickets Online – TicketSource Ticket Shop for WordPress plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'ticketshop' shortcode in all
  versions up to, and including, 3.0.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping
  on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses an injected page.
