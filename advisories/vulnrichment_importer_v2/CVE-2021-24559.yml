aliases: []
summary: The Qyrr WordPress plugin before 0.7 does not escape the data-uri of the QR Code when
  outputting it in a src attribute, allowing for Cross-Site Scripting attacks. Furthermore,
  the data_uri_to_meta AJAX action, available to all authenticated users, only had a CSRF check
  in place, with the nonce available to users with a role as low as Contributor allowing any
  user with such role (and above) to set a malicious data-uri in arbitrary QR Code posts, leading
  to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue.
