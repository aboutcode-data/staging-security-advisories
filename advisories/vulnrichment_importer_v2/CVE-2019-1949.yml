summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management
  Center could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS)
  attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected system. The vulnerability
  is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface
  of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user
  of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive,
  browser-based information.
