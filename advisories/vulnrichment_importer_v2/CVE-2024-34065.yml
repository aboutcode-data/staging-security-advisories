aliases: []
summary: Strapi is an open-source content management system. By combining two vulnerabilities
  (an `Open Redirect` and `session token sent as URL query parameter`) in @strapi/plugin-users-permissions
  before version 4.24.2, is its possible of an unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication
  mechanisms and retrieve the 3rd party tokens. The attack requires user interaction (one click).
  Unauthenticated attackers can leverage two vulnerabilities to obtain an 3rd party token and
  the bypass authentication of Strapi apps. Users should upgrade @strapi/plugin-users-permissions
  to version 4.24.2 to receive a patch.
