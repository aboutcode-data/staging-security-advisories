aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the local management (local-mgmt) CLI of Cisco UCS Manager Software
  could allow an authenticated, local attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition
  on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of CLI command parameters.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing specific commands on the local-mgmt
  CLI on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause internal
  system processes to fail to terminate properly, which could result in a buildup of stuck processes
  and lead to slowness in accessing the UCS Manager CLI and web UI. A sustained attack may result
  in a restart of internal UCS Manager processes and a temporary loss of access to the UCS Manager
  CLI and web UI.
