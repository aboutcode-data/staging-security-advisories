summary: go-bitfield is a simple bitfield package for the go language aiming to be more performant
  that the standard library. When feeding untrusted user input into the size parameter of `NewBitfield`
  and `FromBytes` functions, an attacker can trigger `panic`s. This happen when the `size` is
  a not a multiple of `8` or is negative. There were already a note in the `NewBitfield` documentation,
  however known users of this package are subject to this issue. Users are advised to upgrade.
