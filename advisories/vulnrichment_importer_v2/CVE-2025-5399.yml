aliases: []
summary: |
  Due to a mistake in libcurl's WebSocket code, a malicious server can send a
  particularly crafted packet which makes libcurl get trapped in an endless
  busy-loop.

  There is no other way for the application to escape or exit this loop other
  than killing the thread/process.

  This might be used to DoS libcurl-using application.
