aliases: []
summary: A Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability exists in the '/reinstall_extension' endpoint
  of the parisneo/lollms-webui application, specifically within the `name` parameter of the
  `@router.post("/reinstall_extension")` route. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject
  a malicious `name` parameter, leading to the server loading and executing arbitrary Python
  files from the upload directory for discussions. This issue arises due to the concatenation
  of `data.name` directly with `lollmsElfServer.lollms_paths.extensions_zoo_path` and its use
  as an argument for `ExtensionBuilder().build_extension()`. The server's handling of the `__init__.py`
  file in arbitrary locations, facilitated by `importlib.machinery.SourceFileLoader`, enables
  the execution of arbitrary code, such as command execution or creating a reverse-shell connection.
  This vulnerability affects the latest version of parisneo/lollms-webui and can lead to Remote
  Code Execution (RCE) when the application is exposed to an external endpoint or the UI, especially
  when bound to `0.0.0.0` or in `headless mode`. No user interaction is required for exploitation.
