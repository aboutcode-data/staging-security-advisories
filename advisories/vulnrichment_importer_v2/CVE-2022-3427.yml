summary: The Corner Ad plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions
  up to, and including, 1.0.56. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on its

  trigger the deletion of ads via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
