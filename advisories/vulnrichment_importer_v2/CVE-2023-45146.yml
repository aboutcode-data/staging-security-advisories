aliases: []
summary: XXL-RPC is a high performance, distributed RPC framework. With it, a TCP server can
  be set up using the Netty framework and the Hessian serialization mechanism. When such a configuration
  is used, attackers may be able to connect to the server and provide malicious serialized objects
  that, once deserialized, force it to execute arbitrary code. This can be abused to take control
  of the machine the server is running by way of remote code execution. This issue has not been
  fixed.
