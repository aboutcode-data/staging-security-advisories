aliases: []
summary: Dokploy is a free, self-hostable Platform as a Service (PaaS). In versions prior to
  0.26.6, a critical command injection vulnerability exists in Dokploy's WebSocket endpoint
  `/docker-container-terminal`. The `containerId` and `activeWay` parameters are directly interpolated
  into shell commands without sanitization, allowing authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary
  commands on the host server. Version 0.26.6 fixes the issue.
