aliases: []
summary: The All in One Time Clock Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access
  due to a missing authorization check in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.3. This is
  due  to the plugin exposing admin-level AJAX actions to unauthenticated users via wp_ajax_nopriv_
  hooks, while relying only on a nonce check without capability checks. This makes it possible
  for  unauthenticated attackers to create published pages, create shift records with integrity
  issues, and download time reports containing PII (employee names and work schedules).
