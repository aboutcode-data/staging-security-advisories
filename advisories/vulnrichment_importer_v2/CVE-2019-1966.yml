aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in a specific CLI command within the local management (local-mgmt)
  context for Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker
  to gain elevated privileges as the root user on an affected device. The vulnerability is due
  to extraneous subcommand options present for a specific CLI command within the local-mgmt
  context. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device,
  entering the local-mgmt context, and issuing a specific CLI command and submitting user input.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands
  as root on an affected device. The attacker would need to have valid user credentials for
  the device.
