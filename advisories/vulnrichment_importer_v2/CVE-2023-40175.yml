aliases: []
summary: Puma is a Ruby/Rack web server built for parallelism. Prior to versions 6.3.1 and 5.6.7,
  puma exhibited incorrect behavior when parsing chunked transfer encoding bodies and zero-length
  Content-Length headers in a way that allowed HTTP request smuggling. Severity of this issue
  is highly dependent on the nature of the web site using puma is. This could be caused by either
  incorrect parsing of trailing fields in chunked transfer encoding bodies or by parsing of
  blank/zero-length Content-Length headers. Both issues have been addressed and this vulnerability
  has been fixed in versions 6.3.1 and 5.6.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
  workarounds for this vulnerability.
