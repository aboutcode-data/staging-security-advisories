  allow an authenticated, adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.
  The vulnerabilities are due to improper validation of user-supplied input to the web-based
  management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by authenticating to
  the web-based management interface and sending crafted requests to an affected device. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. Note:
  The web-based management interface is enabled by default.'
