aliases: []
summary: Angular is a development platform for building mobile and desktop web applications
  using TypeScript/JavaScript and other languages. Prior to versions 19.2.18, 20.3.16, 21.0.7,
  and 21.1.0-rc.0, a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in the Angular
  Template Compiler. The vulnerability exists because Angular’s internal sanitization schema
  fails to recognize the href and xlink:href attributes of SVG <script> elements as a Resource
  URL context. This issue has been patched in versions 19.2.18, 20.3.16, 21.0.7, and 21.1.0-rc.0.
