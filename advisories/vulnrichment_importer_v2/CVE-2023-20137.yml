aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business
  RV016, RV042, RV042G, RV082, RV320, and RV325 Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote
  attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against a user of the interface. These
  vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface.
  An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected
  device and then persuading a user to visit specific web pages that include malicious payloads.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context
  of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. Cisco has not released
  software updates that address these vulnerabilities.
