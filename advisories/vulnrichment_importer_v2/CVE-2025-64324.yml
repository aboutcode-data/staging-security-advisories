aliases: []
summary: KubeVirt is a virtual machine management add-on for Kubernetes. The `hostDisk` feature
  in KubeVirt allows mounting a host file or directory owned by the user with UID 107 into a
  VM. However, prior to version 1.6.1 and 1.7.0, the implementation of this feature and more
  specifically the `DiskOrCreate` option (which creates a file if it doesn't exist) has a logic
  bug that allows an attacker to read and write arbitrary files owned by more privileged users
  on the host system. Versions 1.6.1 and 1.7.0 fix the issue.
