aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the SAML authentication process of Cisco Secure Client could allow\
  \ an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a carriage return line feed (CRLF) injection\
  \ attack against a user. \r\n\r This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied\
  \ input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted\
  \ link while establishing a VPN session. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to\
  \ execute arbitrary script code in the browser or access sensitive, browser-based information,\
  \ including a valid SAML token. The attacker could then use the token to establish a remote\
  \ access VPN session with the privileges of the affected user. Individual hosts and services\
  \ behind the VPN headend would still need additional credentials for successful access."
