datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2024-51737

aliases: []
summary: RediSearch is a Redis module that provides querying, secondary indexing, and full-text
  search for Redis. An authenticated redis user executing FT.SEARCH or FT.AGGREGATE with a specially
  crafted LIMIT command argument, or FT.SEARCH with a specially crafted KNN command argument,
  can trigger an integer overflow, leading to heap overflow and potential remote code execution.
  This vulnerability is fixed in 2.6.24, 2.8.21, and 2.10.10. Avoid setting value of -1 or large
  values for configuration parameters MAXSEARCHRESULTS and MAXAGGREGATERESULTS, to avoid exploiting
  large LIMIT arguments.
