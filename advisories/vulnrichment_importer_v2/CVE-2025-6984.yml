aliases: []
summary: The langchain-ai/langchain project, specifically the EverNoteLoader component, is vulnerable
  to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks due to insecure XML parsing. The affected version is
  0.3.63. The vulnerability arises from the use of etree.iterparse() without disabling external
  entity references, which can lead to sensitive information disclosure. An attacker could exploit
  this by crafting a malicious XML payload that references local files, potentially exposing
  sensitive data such as /etc/passwd.
