  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/amd/display: Fix disable_otg_wa logic

  [Why]
  When switching to another HDMI mode, we are unnecesarilly
  disabling/enabling FIFO causing both HPO and DIG registers to be set at
  the same time when only HPO is supposed to be set.

  This can lead to a system hang the next time we change refresh rates as
  there are cases when we don't disable OTG/FIFO but FIFO is enabled when
  it isn't supposed to be.

  [How]
  Removing the enable/disable FIFO entirely.
