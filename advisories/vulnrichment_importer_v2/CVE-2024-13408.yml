aliases: []
summary: The Post Grid, Slider & Carousel Ultimate – with Shortcode, Gutenberg Block & Elementor
  Widget plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and
  including, 1.6.10 via the 'theme' attribute of the `pgcu` shortcode. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include and execute
  arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This
  can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in
  cases where php files can be uploaded and included.
