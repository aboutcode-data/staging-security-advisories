  wifi: ath12k: fix invalid memory access while processing fragmented packets

  The monitor ring and the reo reinject ring share the same ring mask index.
  When the driver receives an interrupt for the reo reinject ring, the
  monitor ring is also processed, leading to invalid memory access. Since
  monitor support is not yet enabled in ath12k, the ring mask for the monitor
  ring should be removed.
