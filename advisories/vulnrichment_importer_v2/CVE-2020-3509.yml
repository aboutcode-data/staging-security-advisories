summary: 'A vulnerability in the DHCP message handler of Cisco IOS XE Software for Cisco cBR-8
  Converged Broadband Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the supervisor
  to crash, which could result in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is
  due to insufficient error handling when DHCP version 4 (DHCPv4) messages are parsed. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious DHCPv4 message to or through a WAN
  interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a
  reload of the affected device. Note: On Cisco cBR-8 Converged Broadband Routers, all of the
  following are considered WAN interfaces: 10 Gbps Ethernet interfaces 100 Gbps Ethernet interfaces
  Port channel interfaces that include multiple 10 and/or 100 Gbps Ethernet interfaces'
