aliases: []
summary: axios4go is a Go HTTP client library. Prior to version 0.6.4, a race condition vulnerability
  exists in the shared HTTP client configuration. The global `defaultClient` is mutated during
  request execution without synchronization, directly modifying the shared `http.Client`'s `Transport`,
  `Timeout`, and `CheckRedirect` properties. Impacted applications include that that use axios4go
  with concurrent requests (multiple goroutines, `GetAsync`, `PostAsync`, etc.), those where
  different requests use different proxy configurations, and those that handle sensitive data
  (authentication credentials, tokens, API keys). Version 0.6.4 fixes this issue.
