aliases: []
summary: 'TrustTunnel is an open-source VPN protocol with a rule bypass issue in versions prior
  to 0.9.115. In `tls_listener.rs`, `TlsListener::listen()` peeks 1024 bytes and calls `extract_client_random(...)`.
  If `parse_tls_plaintext` fails (for example, a fragmented/partial ClientHello split across
  TCP writes), `extract_client_random` returns `None`. In `rules.rs`, `RulesEngine::evaluate`
  only evaluates `client_random_prefix` when `client_random` is `Some(...)`. As a result, when
  extraction fails (`client_random == None`), any rule that relies on `client_random_prefix`
  matching is skipped and evaluation falls through to later rules. As an important semantics
  note: `client_random_prefix` is a match condition only. It does not mean "block non-matching
  prefixes" by itself. A rule with `client_random_prefix = ...` triggers its `action` only when
  the prefix matches (and the field is available to evaluate). Non-matches (or `None`) simply
  do not match that rule and continue to fall through. The vulnerability is fixed in version
  0.9.115.'
