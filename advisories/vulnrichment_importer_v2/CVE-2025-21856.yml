  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  s390/ism: add release function for struct device

  According to device_release() in /drivers/base/core.c,
  a device without a release function is a broken device
  and must be fixed.

  The current code directly frees the device after calling device_add()
  without waiting for other kernel parts to release their references.
  Thus, a reference could still be held to a struct device,
  e.g., by sysfs, leading to potential use-after-free
  issues if a proper release function is not set.
