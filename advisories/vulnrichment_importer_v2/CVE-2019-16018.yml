aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the implementation of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Ethernet VPN
  (EVPN) functionality in Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing
  of a BGP update message that contains crafted EVPN attributes. An attacker could indirectly
  exploit the vulnerability by sending BGP EVPN update messages with a specific, malformed attribute
  to an affected system and waiting for a user on the device to display the EVPN operational
  routes&rsquo; status. If successful, the attacker could cause the BGP process to restart unexpectedly,
  resulting in a DoS condition. The Cisco implementation of BGP accepts incoming BGP traffic
  only from explicitly defined peers. To exploit this vulnerability, the malicious BGP update
  message would need to come from a configured, valid BGP peer, or would need to be injected
  by the attacker into the victim's BGP network on an existing, valid TCP connection to a BGP
  peer.
