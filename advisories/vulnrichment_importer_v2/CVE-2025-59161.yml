aliases: []
summary: Element Web is a Matrix web client built using the Matrix React SDK. Element Web and
  Element Desktop before version 1.11.112 have insufficient validation of room predecessor links,
  allowing a remote attacker to attempt to impermanently replace a room's entry in the room
  list with an unrelated attacker-supplied room. While the effect of this is temporary, it may
  still confuse users into acting on incorrect assumptions. The issue has been patched and users
  should upgrade to 1.11.112. A reload/refresh will fix the incorrect room list state, removing
  the attacker's room and restoring the original room.
