aliases: []
summary: Craft is a content management system (CMS). The dataUrl function can be exploited if
  an attacker has write permissions on system notification templates. This function accepts
  an absolute file path, reads the file's content, and converts it into a Base64-encoded string.
  By embedding this function within a system notification template, the attacker can exfiltrate
  the Base64-encoded file content through a triggered system email notification. Once the email
  is received, the Base64 payload can be decoded, allowing the attacker to read arbitrary files
  on the server. This is fixed in 5.4.9 and 4.12.8.
