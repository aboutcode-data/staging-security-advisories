  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  um: time-travel: fix time corruption

  In 'basic' time-travel mode (without =inf-cpu or =ext), we
  still get timer interrupts. These can happen at arbitrary
  points in time, i.e. while in timer_read(), which pushes
  time forward just a little bit. Then, if we happen to get
  the interrupt after calculating the new time to push to,
  but before actually finishing that, the interrupt will set
  the time to a value that's incompatible with the forward,
  and we'll crash because time goes backwards when we do the
  forwarding.

  Fix this by reading the time_travel_time, calculating the
  adjustment, and doing the adjustment all with interrupts
  disabled.
