summary: The School Management System for Wordpress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
  file uploads due to missing file type validation in the mj_smgt_user_avatar_image_upload()

  attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code
  execution possible.
