aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC)
  Supervisor and Cisco UCS Director could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a
  denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  restrictions on the size or total amount of resources allowed via the web interface. An attacker
  who has valid credentials for the application could exploit this vulnerability by sending
  a crafted or malformed HTTP request to the web interface. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to cause oversubscription of system resources or cause a component to become
  unresponsive, resulting in a DoS condition.
