  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  sched/fair: Fix potential memory corruption in child_cfs_rq_on_list

  child_cfs_rq_on_list attempts to convert a 'prev' pointer to a cfs_rq.
  This 'prev' pointer can originate from struct rq's leaf_cfs_rq_list,
  making the conversion invalid and potentially leading to memory
  corruption. Depending on the relative positions of leaf_cfs_rq_list and
  the task group (tg) pointer within the struct, this can cause a memory
  fault or access garbage data.

  The issue arises in list_add_leaf_cfs_rq, where both
  cfs_rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list and rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list are added to the same
  leaf list. Also, rq->tmp_alone_branch can be set to rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list.

  This adds a check `if (prev == &rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list)` after the main
  conditional in child_cfs_rq_on_list. This ensures that the container_of
  operation will convert a correct cfs_rq struct.

  This check is sufficient because only cfs_rqs on the same CPU are added
  to the list, so verifying the 'prev' pointer against the current rq's list
  head is enough.

  Fixes a potential memory corruption issue that due to current struct
  layout might not be manifesting as a crash but could lead to unpredictable
  behavior when the layout changes.
