aliases: []
summary: Rubygems.org is the Ruby community's gem hosting service. Rubygems.org users with MFA
  enabled would normally be protected from account takeover in the case of email account takeover.
  However, a workaround on the forgotten password form allows an attacker to bypass the MFA
  requirement and takeover the account. This vulnerability has been patched in commit 0b3272a.
