aliases: []
summary: Kirby is an open-source content management system. A vulnerability in versions prior
  to 3.9.8.3, 3.10.1.2, and 4.7.1 affects all Kirby setups that use PHP's built-in server. Such
  setups are commonly only used during local development. Sites that use other server software
  (such as Apache, nginx or Caddy) are not affected. A missing path traversal check allowed
  attackers to navigate all files on the server that were accessible to the PHP process, including
  files outside of the Kirby installation. The vulnerable implementation delegated all existing
  files to PHP, including existing files outside of the document root. This leads to a different
  response that allows attackers to determine whether the requested file exists. Because Kirby's
  router only delegates such requests to PHP and does not load or execute them, contents of
  the files were not exposed as PHP treats requests to files outside of the document root as
  invalid. The problem has been patched in Kirby 3.9.8.3, Kirby 3.10.1.2, and Kirby 4.7.1. In
  all of the mentioned releases, the maintainers of Kirby have updated the router to check if
  existing static files are within the document root. Requests to files outside the document
  root are treated as page requests of the error page and will no longer allow to determine
  whether the file exists or not.
