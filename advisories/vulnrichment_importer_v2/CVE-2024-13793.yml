aliases: []
summary: The Wolmart | Multi-Vendor Marketplace WooCommerce Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable
  to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.11. This is due
  to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value
  before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute
  arbitrary shortcodes.
