aliases: []
summary: 'your_spotify is an open source, self hosted Spotify tracking dashboard. YourSpotify
  versions < 1.9.0 do not protect the API and login flow against Cross-Site Request Forgery
  (CSRF). Attackers can use this to execute CSRF attacks on victims, allowing them to retrieve,
  modify or delete data on the affected YourSpotify instance. Using repeated CSRF attacks, it
  is also possible to create a new user on the victim instance and promote the new user to instance
  administrator if a legitimate administrator visits a website prepared by an attacker. Note:
  Real-world exploitability of this vulnerability depends on the browser version and browser
  settings in use by the victim. This issue has been addressed in version 1.9.0. Users are advised
  to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.'
