  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  KVM: nSVM: Ignore nCR3[4:0] when loading PDPTEs from memory

  Ignore nCR3[4:0] when loading PDPTEs from memory for nested SVM, as bits
  4:0 of CR3 are ignored when PAE paging is used, and thus VMRUN doesn't
  enforce 32-byte alignment of nCR3.

  In the absolute worst case scenario, failure to ignore bits 4:0 can result
  in an out-of-bounds read, e.g. if the target page is at the end of a
  memslot, and the VMM isn't using guard pages.

  Per the APM:

    The CR3 register points to the base address of the page-directory-pointer
    table. The page-directory-pointer table is aligned on a 32-byte boundary,
    with the low 5 address bits 4:0 assumed to be 0.

  And the SDM's much more explicit:

    4:0    Ignored

  Note, KVM gets this right when loading PDPTRs, it's only the nSVM flow
  that is broken.
