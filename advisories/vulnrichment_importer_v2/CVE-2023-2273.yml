aliases: []
summary: Rapid7 Insight Agent token handler versions 3.2.6 and below, suffer from a Directory
  Traversal vulnerability whereby unsanitized input from a CLI argument flows into io.ioutil.WriteFile,
  where it is used as a path. This can result in a Path Traversal vulnerability and allow an
  attacker to write arbitrary files. This issue is remediated in version 3.3.0 via safe guards
  that reject inputs that attempt to do path traversal.
