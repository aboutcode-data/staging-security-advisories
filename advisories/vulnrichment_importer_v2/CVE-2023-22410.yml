summary: 'A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Juniper
  Networks Junos OS on MX Series platforms with MPC10/MPC11 line cards, allows an unauthenticated
  adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). Devices are only vulnerable when the
  Suspicious Control Flow Detection (scfd) feature is enabled. Upon enabling this specific feature,
  an attacker sending specific traffic is causing memory to be allocated dynamically and it
  is not freed. Memory is not freed even after deactivating this feature. Sustained processing
  of such traffic will eventually lead to an out of memory condition that prevents all services
  from continuing to function, and requires a manual restart to recover. The FPC memory usage
  can be monitored using the CLI command "show chassis fpc". On running the above command, the
  memory of AftDdosScfdFlow can be observed to detect the memory leak. This issue affects Juniper
  Networks Junos OS on MX Series: All versions prior to 20.2R3-S5; 20.3 version 20.3R1 and later
  versions.'
