aliases: []
summary: 'tools/url_handler.pl in TIN 2.4.1 does not validate strings before launching the program
  specified by the BROWSER environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to conduct
  argument-injection attacks via a crafted URL. NOTE: a third party has reported that this is
  intentional behavior, because the documentation states "url_handler.pl was designed to work
  together with tin which only issues shell escaped absolute URLs.'
