aliases: []
summary: Parse Dashboard is a standalone dashboard for managing Parse Server apps. In versions
  7.3.0-alpha.42 through 9.0.0-alpha.7, the `ConfigKeyCache` uses the same cache key for both
  master key and read-only master key when resolving function-typed keys. Under specific timing
  conditions, a read-only user can receive the cached full master key, or a regular user can
  receive the cached read-only master key. The fix in version 9.0.0-alpha.8 uses distinct cache
  keys for master key and read-only master key. As a workaround, avoid using function-typed
  master keys, or remove the `agent` configuration block from your dashboard configuration.
