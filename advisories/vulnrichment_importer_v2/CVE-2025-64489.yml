aliases: []
summary: SuiteCRM is an open-source, enterprise-ready Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
  software application. Versions 7.14.7 and prior, 8.0.0-beta.1 through 8.9.0 contain a privilege
  escalation vulnerability where user sessions are not invalidated upon account deactivation.
  An inactive user with an active session can continue to access the application and, critically,
  can self-reactivate their account. This undermines administrative controls and allows unauthorized
  persistence. This issue is fixed in versions 7.14.8 and 8.9.1.
