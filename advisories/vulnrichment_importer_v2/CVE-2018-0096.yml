summary: 'A vulnerability in the role-based access control (RBAC) functionality of Cisco Prime
  Infrastructure could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a privilege escalation
  in which one virtual domain user can view and modify another virtual domain configuration.
  The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly enforce RBAC for virtual domains. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending an authenticated, crafted HTTP request to a targeted
  application. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass RBAC policies on the targeted system
  to modify a virtual domain and access resources that are not normally accessible. Cisco Bug
  IDs: CSCvg36875.'
