aliases: []
summary: 'The W3C XML Signature Syntax and Processing (XMLDsig) specification, starting with
  1.0, was originally published with a "RetrievalMethod is a URI ... that may be used to obtain
  key and/or certificate information" statement and no accompanying information about SSRF risks,
  and this may have contributed to vulnerable implementations such as those discussed in CVE-2023-36661
  and CVE-2024-21893. NOTE: this was mitigated in 1.1 and 2.0 via a directly referenced Best
  Practices document that calls on implementers to be wary of SSRF.'
