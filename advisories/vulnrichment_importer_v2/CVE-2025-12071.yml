summary: The Frontend User Notes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object
  Reference in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.0 via the 'funp_ajax_modify_notes' AJAX
  endpoint due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to modify arbitrary notes that do not belong
  to them.
