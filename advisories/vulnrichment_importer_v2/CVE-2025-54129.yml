aliases: []
summary: HAXiam is a packaging wrapper for HAXcms which allows anyone to spawn their own microsite
  management platform. In versions 11.0.4 and below, the application returns a 200 response
  when requesting the data of a valid user and a 404 response when requesting the data of an
  invalid user. This can be used to infer the existence of valid user accounts. An authenticated
  attacker can use automated tooling to brute force potential usernames and use the application's
  response to identify valid accounts. This can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities,
  such as the lack of authorization checks, to enumerate and deface another user's sites. This
  is fixed in version 11.0.5.
