aliases: []
summary: Group-Office is an enterprise customer relationship management and groupware tool.
  Prior to versions 6.8.119 and 25.0.20, a DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
  exists in the GroupOffice application, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript
  code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement,
  or redirection to malicious sites. The vulnerability can be triggered by injecting a crafted
  payload into a parameter that is later processed unsafely in the DOM. Versions 6.8.119 and
  25.0.20 contain a fix for the issue.
