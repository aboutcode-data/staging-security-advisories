aliases: []
summary: The AsyncHttpClient (AHC) library allows Java applications to easily execute HTTP requests
  and asynchronously process HTTP responses. When making any HTTP request, the automatically
  enabled and self-managed CookieStore (aka cookie jar) will silently replace explicitly defined
  Cookies with any that have the same name from the cookie jar. For services that operate with
  multiple users, this can result in one user's Cookie being used for another user's requests.
