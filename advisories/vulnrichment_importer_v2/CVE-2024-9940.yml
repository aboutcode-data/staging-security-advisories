aliases: []
summary: The Calculated Fields Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to HTML Injection in
  all versions up to, and including, 5.2.45. This is due to the plugin not properly neutralizing
  HTML elements from submitted forms. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
  inject arbitrary HTML that will render when the administrator views form submissions in their
  email.
