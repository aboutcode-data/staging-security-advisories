aliases: []
summary: The Bricks theme for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing
  capability check on the bricks_save_post AJAX action in versions 1.0 to 1.5.3. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber, to
  edit any page, post, or template on the vulnerable WordPress website.
