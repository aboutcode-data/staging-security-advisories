aliases: []
summary: SOFARPC is a Java RPC framework. SOFARPC defaults to using the SOFA Hessian protocol
  to deserialize received data, while the SOFA Hessian protocol uses a blacklist mechanism to
  restrict deserialization of potentially dangerous classes for security protection. But, prior
  to version 5.12.0, there is a gadget chain that can bypass the SOFA Hessian blacklist protection
  mechanism, and this gadget chain only relies on JDK and does not rely on any third-party components.
  Version 5.12.0 fixed this issue by adding a blacklist. SOFARPC also provides a way to add
  additional blacklists. Users can add a class like `-Drpc_serialize_blacklist_override=org.apache.xpath.`
  to avoid this issue.
