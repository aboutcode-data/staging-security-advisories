aliases: []
summary: Pomerium is an identity and context-aware access proxy. The Pomerium databroker service
  is responsible for managing all persistent Pomerium application state. Requests to the databroker
  service API are authorized by the presence of a JSON Web Token (JWT) signed by a key known
  by all Pomerium services in the same deployment. However, incomplete validation of this JWT
  meant that some service account access tokens would incorrectly be treated as valid for the
  purpose of databroker API authorization. Improper access to the databroker API could allow
  exfiltration of user info, spoofing of user sessions, or tampering with Pomerium routes, policies,
  and other settings. A Pomerium deployment is susceptible to this issue if all of the following
  conditions are met, you have issued a service account access token using Pomerium Zero or
  Pomerium Enterprise, the access token has an explicit expiration date in the future, and the
  core Pomerium databroker gRPC API is not otherwise secured by network access controls. This
  vulnerability is fixed in 0.27.1.
