aliases: []
summary: virtualenv is a tool for creating isolated virtual python environments. Prior to version
  20.36.1, TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) vulnerabilities in virtualenv allow local attackers
  to perform symlink-based attacks on directory creation operations. An attacker with local
  access can exploit a race condition between directory existence checks and creation to redirect
  virtualenv's app_data and lock file operations to attacker-controlled locations. This issue
  has been patched in version 20.36.1.
