aliases: []
summary: An attacker of Secrets Manager, Self-Hosted installations that route traffic from Secrets
  Manager to AWS through a misconfigured network device can reroute authentication requests
  to a malicious server under the attacker’s control. CyberArk believes there to be very few
  installations where this issue can be actively exploited, though Secrets Manager, Self-Hosted
  (formerly Conjur Enterprise) prior to versions 13.5.1 and 13.6.1 and Conjur OSS prior to version
  1.22.1 may be affected. Conjur OSS version 1.22.1 and Secrets Manager, Self-Hosted versions
  13.5.1 and 13.6.1 fix the issue.
