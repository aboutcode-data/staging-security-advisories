summary: The Live updates from Excel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the plugin's 'ipushpull_page' shortcode in versions up to, and including, 2.3.2

  makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above,
  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page.
