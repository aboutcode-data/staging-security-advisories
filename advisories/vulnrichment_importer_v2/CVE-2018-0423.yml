aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of the Cisco RV110W Wireless-N
  VPN Firewall, Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV215W Wireless-N
  VPN Router could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition
  or to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is due to improper boundary restrictions on
  user-supplied input in the Guest user feature of the web-based management interface. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to a targeted device, triggering
  a buffer overflow condition. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device
  to stop responding, resulting in a denial of service condition, or could allow the attacker
  to execute arbitrary code.
