aliases: []
summary: The VikRentCar Car Rental Management System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.2. This is due to missing or incorrect
  nonce validation on the 'save' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to change plugin access privileges via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Successful exploitation allows attackers
  with subscriber-level privileges and above to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's
  server which may make remote code execution possible.
