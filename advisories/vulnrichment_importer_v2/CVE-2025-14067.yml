aliases: []
summary: The Easy Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of
  data due to a missing capability check on multiple AJAX actions in all versions up to, and
  including, 3.9.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
  access and above, to retrieve sensitive form response data, including messages, admin replies,
  and user information due to a logic error in the authorization check that uses AND (&&) instead
  of OR (||).
