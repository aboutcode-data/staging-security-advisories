aliases: []
summary: The Essential Addons for Elementor Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
  Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's Counter widget in all versions up to, and including,
  5.8.11 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes
  such as 'title_html_tag'. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses an injected page.
