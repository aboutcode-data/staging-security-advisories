aliases: []
summary: "Miniflux is a feed reader. Since v2.0.25, Miniflux will automatically proxy images\
  \ served over HTTP to prevent mixed content errors. \n\nWhen an outbound request made by the\
  \ Go HTTP client fails, the `html.ServerError` is returned unescaped without the expected\
  \ Content Security Policy header added to valid responses.\n\nBy creating an RSS feed item\
  \ with the inline description containing an `<img>` tag with a `srcset` attribute pointing\
  \ to an invalid URL like `http:a<script>alert(1)</script>`, we can coerce the proxy handler\
  \ into an error condition where the invalid URL is returned unescaped and in full.\n\nThis\
  \ results in JavaScript execution on the Miniflux instance as soon as the user is convinced\
  \ (e.g. by a message in the alt text) to open the broken image.\n\nAn attacker can execute\
  \ arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a victim Miniflux user when they open a broken image\
  \ in a crafted RSS feed. This can be used to perform actions on the Miniflux instance as that\
  \ user and gain administrative access to the Miniflux instance if it is reachable and the\
  \ victim is an administrator.\n\nA patch is available in version 2.0.43. As a workaround sisable\
  \ image proxy; default value is `http-only`."
