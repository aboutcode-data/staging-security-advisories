aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the installer script of Cisco AppDynamics PHP Agent could allow\
  \ an authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges on an affected device.\r\n\r This\
  \ vulnerability is due to insufficient permissions that are set by the PHP Agent Installer\
  \ on the PHP Agent install directory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying\
  \ objects in the PHP Agent install directory, which would run with the same privileges as\
  \ PHP. A successful exploit could allow a lower-privileged attacker to elevate their privileges\
  \ to root on an affected device."
