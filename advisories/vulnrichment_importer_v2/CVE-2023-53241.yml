summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  nfsd: call op_release, even when op_func returns an error

  For ops with "trivial" replies, nfsd4_encode_operation will shortcut
  most of the encoding work and skip to just marshalling up the status.
  One of the things it skips is calling op_release. This could cause a
  memory leak in the layoutget codepath if there is an error at an
  inopportune time.

  Have the compound processing engine always call op_release, even when
  op_func sets an error in op->status. With this change, we also need
  nfsd4_block_get_device_info_scsi to set the gd_device pointer to NULL
  on error to avoid a double free.
