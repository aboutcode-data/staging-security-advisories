aliases: []
summary: vLLM is an inference and serving engine for large language models (LLMs). From 0.1.0
  to before 0.10.1.1, a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability can be triggered by sending a
  single HTTP GET request with an extremely large header to an HTTP endpoint. This results in
  server memory exhaustion, potentially leading to a crash or unresponsiveness. The attack does
  not require authentication, making it exploitable by any remote user. This vulnerability is
  fixed in 0.10.1.1.
