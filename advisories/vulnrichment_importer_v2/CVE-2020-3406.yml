aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of the Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software
  could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
  against a user of the interface. The vulnerability exists because the web-based management
  interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based
  information.
