summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage
  Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct SQL injection attacks
  on an affected system. These vulnerabilities exist because the web-based management interface
  improperly validates values in SQL queries. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities
  by authenticating to the application and sending malicious SQL queries to an affected system.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify values on or return values from the
  underlying database or the operating system.
