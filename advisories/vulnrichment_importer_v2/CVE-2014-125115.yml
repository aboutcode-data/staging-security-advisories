aliases: []
summary: An unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability exists in Pandora FMS version 5.0 SP2
  and earlier. The mobile/index.php endpoint fails to properly sanitize user input in the loginhash_data
  parameter, allowing attackers to extract administrator credentials or active session tokens
  via crafted requests. This occurs because input is directly concatenated into an SQL query
  without adequate validation, enabling SQL injection. After authentication is bypassed, a second
  vulnerability in the File Manager component permits arbitrary PHP file uploads. The file upload
  functionality does not enforce MIME-type or file extension restrictions, allowing authenticated
  users to upload web shells into a publicly accessible directory and achieve remote code execution.
