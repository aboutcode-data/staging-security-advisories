summary: The Linear plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all
  versions up to, and including, 2.8.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the 'linear-debug'. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset the plugin's
  cache via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
  action such as clicking on a link.
