aliases: []
summary: "Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE and Cisco\
  \ ISE-PIC could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a reflected XSS attack\
  \ against a user of the interface.\r\n\r These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation\
  \ of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected system. An attacker\
  \ could exploit these vulnerabilities by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the\
  \ interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code\
  \ in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.\
  \ To exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker must have at least a low-privileged account\
  \ on the affected device."
