summary: Saltcorn is an extensible, open source, no-code database application builder. A logged-in
  user with any role can delete arbitrary files on the filesystem by calling the `sync/clean_sync_dir`
  endpoint. The `dir_name` POST parameter is not validated/sanitized and is used to construct
  the `syncDir` that is deleted by calling `fs.rm`. This issue has been addressed in release
  version 1.0.0-beta16 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
  for this vulnerability.
