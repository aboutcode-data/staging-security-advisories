aliases: []
summary: In binary-husky/gpt_academic version <= 3.83, the plugin `CodeInterpreter` is vulnerable
  to code injection caused by prompt injection. The root cause is the execution of user-provided
  prompts that generate untrusted code without a sandbox, allowing the execution of parts of
  the LLM-generated code. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to achieve remote
  code execution (RCE) on the application backend server, potentially gaining full control of
  the server.
