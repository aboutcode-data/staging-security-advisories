aliases: []
summary: The Web3 WordPress plugin before 3.0.0 is vulnerable to an authentication bypass due
  to incorrect authentication checking in the login flow in functions 'handle_auth_request'
  and 'hadle_login_request'. This makes it possible for non authenticated attackers to log in
  as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the username.
