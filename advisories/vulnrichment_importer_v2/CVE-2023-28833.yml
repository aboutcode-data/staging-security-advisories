aliases: []
summary: Nextcloud server is an open source home cloud implementation. In affected versions
  admins of a server were able to upload a logo or a favicon and to provided a file name which
  was not restricted and could overwrite files in the appdata directory. Administrators may
  have access to overwrite these files by other means but this method could be exploited by
  tricking an admin into uploading a maliciously named file. It is recommended that the Nextcloud
  Server is upgraded to 24.0.10 or 25.0.4. Users unable to upgrade should avoid ingesting logo
  files from untrusted sources.
