summary: The vulnerability exists in BLUVOYIX due to an improper password storage implementation
  and subsequent exposure via unauthenticated APIs. An unauthenticated remote attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable users
  API to retrieve the plaintext passwords of all user users. Successful exploitation of this
  vulnerability could allow the attacker to gain full access to customers' data and completely
  compromise the targeted platform by logging in using an exposed admin email address and password.
