aliases: []
summary: 'MSS (Mission Support System) is an open source package designed for planning atmospheric
  research flights. In file: `index.py`, there is a method that is vulnerable to path manipulation
  attack. By modifying file paths, an attacker can acquire sensitive information from different
  resources. The `filename` variable is joined with other variables to form a file path in `_file`.
  However, `filename` is a route parameter that can capture path type values i.e. values including
  slashes (\). So it is possible for an attacker to manipulate the file being read by assigning
  a value containing ../ to `filename` and so the attacker may be able to gain access to other
  files on the host filesystem. This issue has been addressed in MSS version 8.3.3. Users are
  advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.'
