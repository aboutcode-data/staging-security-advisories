aliases: []
summary: The Embed PDF for WPForms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
  due to missing file type validation in the ajax_handler_download_pdf_media function in all
  versions up to, and including, 1.1.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server
  which may make remote code execution possible.
