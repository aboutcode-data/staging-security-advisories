aliases: []
summary: RAGFlow is an open-source RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) engine. In versions
  prior to 0.23.0, a low-privileged authenticated user (normal login account) can execute arbitrary
  system commands on the server host process via the frontend Canvas CodeExec component, completely
  bypassing sandbox isolation. This occurs because untrusted data (stdout) is parsed using eval()
  with no filtering or sandboxing. The intended design was to "automatically convert string
  results into Python objects," but this effectively executes attacker-controlled code. Additional
  endpoints lack access control or contain inverted permission logic, significantly expanding
  the attack surface and enabling chained exploitation. Version 0.23.0 contains a patch for
  the issue.
