summary: 'An Access of Uninitialized Pointer vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd)
  of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a locally authenticated attacker
  with low privileges to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). When an MPLS ping is performed on
  BGP LSPs, the RPD might crash. Repeated execution of this operation will lead to a sustained
  DoS. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS: 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S12; 19.1
  versions prior to 19.1R3-S9; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S9, 19.2R3-S5; 19.3 versions prior
  to 19.3R3-S6; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S7, 19.4R3-S8; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3-S4;
