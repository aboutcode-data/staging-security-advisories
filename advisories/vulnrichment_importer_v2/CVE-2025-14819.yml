aliases: []
summary: |
  When doing TLS related transfers with reused easy or multi handles and
  altering the  `CURLSSLOPT_NO_PARTIALCHAIN` option, libcurl could accidentally
  reuse a CA store cached in memory for which the partial chain option was
  reversed. Contrary to the user's wishes and expectations. This could make
  libcurl find and accept a trust chain that it otherwise would not.
