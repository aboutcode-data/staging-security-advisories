aliases: []
summary: Open5GS MME versions <= 2.6.4 contains an assertion that can be remotely triggered
  via a sufficiently large ASN.1 packet over the S1AP interface. An attacker may repeatedly
  send such an oversized packet to cause the `ogs_sctp_recvmsg` routine to reach an unexpected
  network state and crash, leading to denial of service.
