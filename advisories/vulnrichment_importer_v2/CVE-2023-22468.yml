datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2023/22xxx/CVE-2023-22468.json
aliases: []
summary: Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. Versions prior to 2.8.13
  (stable), 3.0.0.beta16 (beta) and 3.0.0beta16 (tests-passed), are vulnerable to cross-site
  Scripting. A maliciously crafted URL can be included in a post to carry out cross-site  scripting
  attacks on sites with disabled or overly permissive CSP (Content Security Policy). Discourse's
  default CSP prevents this vulnerability. This vulnerability is patched in versions 2.8.13
  (stable), 3.0.0.beta16 (beta) and 3.0.0beta16 (tests-passed). As a workaround, enable and/or
  restore your site's CSP to the default one provided with Discourse.
