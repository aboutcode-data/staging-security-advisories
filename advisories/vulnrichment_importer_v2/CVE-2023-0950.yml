aliases: []
summary: 'Improper Validation of Array Index vulnerability in the spreadsheet component of The
  Document Foundation LibreOffice allows an attacker to craft a spreadsheet document that will
  cause an array index underflow when loaded. In the affected versions of LibreOffice certain
  malformed spreadsheet formulas, such as AGGREGATE, could be created with less parameters passed
  to the formula interpreter than it expected, leading to an array index underflow, in which
  case there is a risk that arbitrary code could be executed. This issue affects: The Document
  Foundation LibreOffice 7.4 versions prior to 7.4.6; 7.5 versions prior to 7.5.1.'
