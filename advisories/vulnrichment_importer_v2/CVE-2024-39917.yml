aliases: []
summary: xrdp is an open source RDP server. xrdp versions prior to 0.10.0 have a vulnerability
  that allows attackers to make an infinite number of login attempts. The number of max login
  attempts is supposed to be  limited by a configuration parameter `MaxLoginRetry` in `/etc/xrdp/sesman.ini`.
  However, this mechanism was not effectively working. As a result, xrdp allows an infinite
  number of login attempts.
