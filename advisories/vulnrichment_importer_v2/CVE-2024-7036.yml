aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in open-webui/open-webui v0.3.8 allows an unauthenticated attacker
  to sign up with excessively large text in the 'name' field, causing the Admin panel to become
  unresponsive. This prevents administrators from performing essential user management actions
  such as deleting, editing, or adding users. The vulnerability can also be exploited by authenticated
  users with low privileges, leading to the same unresponsive state in the Admin panel.
