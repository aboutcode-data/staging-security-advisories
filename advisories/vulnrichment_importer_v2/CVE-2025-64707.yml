summary: Frappe Learning is a learning system that helps users structure their content. Starting
  in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 2.41.0, when admins revoked a role from the user, the
  effect was not immediate because of caching. The issue has been fixed in version 2.41.0 by
  ensuring the cache is cleared after roles are updated.
