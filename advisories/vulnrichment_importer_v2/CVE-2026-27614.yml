aliases: []
summary: Bugsink is a self-hosted error tracking tool. In versions prior to 2.0.13, an unauthenticated
  attacker who can submit events to a Bugsink project can store arbitrary JavaScript in an event.
  The payload executes only if a user explicitly views the affected Stacktrace in the web UI.
  When Pygments returns more lines than it was given (a known upstream quirk that triggers with
  Ruby heredoc-style input), `_pygmentize_lines()` in `theme/templatetags/issues.py:75-77` falls
  back to returning the raw input lines. `mark_safe()` at line 111-113 is then applied unconditionally
  - including to those unsanitized raw lines. Since DSN endpoints are public by Sentry protocol,
  no account is needed to inject. The payload sits in the database until an admin looks at the
  event. Successful exploitation requires that the attacker to be able to submit events to the
  project (i.e. knows the DSN or can access a client that uses it), the Bugsink ingest endpoint
  is reachable to the attacker, and an administrator explicitly views the crafted event in the
  UI. Under those conditions, the attacker can execute JavaScript in the administrator’s browser
  and act with that user’s privileges within Bugsink. Version 2.0.13 fixes the vulnerability.
