  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ALSA: hda/cs_dsp_ctl: Use private_free for control cleanup

  Use the control private_free callback to free the associated data
  block. This ensures that the memory won't leak, whatever way the
  control gets destroyed.

  The original implementation didn't actually remove the ALSA
  controls in hda_cs_dsp_control_remove(). It only freed the internal
  tracking structure. This meant it was possible to remove/unload the
  amp driver while leaving its ALSA controls still present in the
  soundcard. Obviously attempting to access them could cause segfaults
  or at least dereferencing stale pointers.
