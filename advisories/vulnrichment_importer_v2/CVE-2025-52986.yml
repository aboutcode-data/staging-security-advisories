summary: |
  A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a local, low privileged user to cause an impact to the availability of the device.

  When RIB sharding is enabled and a user executes one of several routing related 'show' commands, a certain amount of memory is leaked. When all available memory has been consumed rpd will crash and restart.

  The leak can be monitored with the CLI command:



  show task memory detail | match task_shard_mgmt_cookie



  where the allocated memory in bytes can be seen to continuously increase with each exploitation.



  This issue affects:

  Junos OS:

    *  all versions before 21.2R3-S9,
    *  21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S11,

    *  24.2 versions before 24.2R2,
    *  24.4 versions before 24.4R1-S2, 24.4R2;
