aliases: []
summary: Forge (also called `node-forge`) is a native implementation of Transport Layer Security
  in JavaScript. An Uncontrolled Recursion vulnerability in node-forge versions 1.3.1 and below
  enables remote, unauthenticated attackers to craft deep ASN.1 structures that trigger unbounded
  recursive parsing. This leads to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) via stack exhaustion when parsing
  untrusted DER inputs. This issue has been patched in version 1.3.2.
