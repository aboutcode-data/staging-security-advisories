aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the web proxy functionality of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco
  Web Security Appliances could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to exhaust system
  memory and cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system. The vulnerability
  exists because the affected software improperly manages memory resources for TCP connections
  to a targeted device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing a high
  number of TCP connections to the data interface of an affected device via IPv4 or IPv6. A
  successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust system memory, which could cause the
  system to stop processing new connections and result in a DoS condition. System recovery may
  require manual intervention. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf36610.'
