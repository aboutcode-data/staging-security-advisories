aliases: []
summary: The AliExpress Dropshipping with AliNext Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the ajax_save_image function
  in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server
  which may make remote code execution possible.
