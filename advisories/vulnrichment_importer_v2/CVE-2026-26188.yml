aliases: []
summary: Solspace Freeform plugin for Craft CMS 5.x is a super flexible form-building tool.
  An authenticated, low-privilege user (able to create/edit forms) can inject arbitrary HTML/JS
  into the Craft Control Panel (CP) builder and integrations views. User-controlled form labels
  and integration metadata are rendered with dangerouslySetInnerHTML without sanitization, leading
  to stored XSS that executes when any admin views the builder/integration screens. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 5.14.7.
