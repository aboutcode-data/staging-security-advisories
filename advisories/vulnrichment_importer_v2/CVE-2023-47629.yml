aliases: []
summary: DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. In affected versions sign-up through an
  invite link does not properly restrict users from signing up as privileged accounts. If a
  user is given an email sign-up link they can potentially create an admin account given certain
  preconditions. If the default datahub user has been removed, then the user can sign up for
  an account that leverages the default policies giving admin privileges to the datahub user.
  All DataHub instances prior to the patch that have removed the datahub user, but not the default
  policies applying to that user are affected. Users are advised to update to version 0.12.1
  which addresses the issue. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
