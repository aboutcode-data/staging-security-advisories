aliases: []
summary: When switching to other buffers using the :all command and visual mode still being
  active, this may cause a heap-buffer overflow, because Vim does not properly end visual mode
  and therefore may try to access beyond the end of a line in a buffer. In Patch 9.1.1003 Vim
  will correctly reset the visual mode before opening other windows and buffers and therefore
  fix this bug. In addition it does verify that it won't try to access a position if the position
  is greater than the corresponding buffer line. Impact is medium since the user must have switched
  on visual mode when executing the :all ex command. The Vim project would like to thank github
  user gandalf4a for reporting this issue. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.1003
