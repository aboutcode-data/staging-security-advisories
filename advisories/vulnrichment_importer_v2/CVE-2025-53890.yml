summary: pyload is an open-source Download Manager written in pure Python. An unsafe JavaScript
  evaluation vulnerability in pyLoad’s CAPTCHA processing code allows unauthenticated remote
  attackers to execute arbitrary code in the client browser and potentially the backend server.
  Exploitation requires no user interaction or authentication and can result in session hijacking,
  credential theft, and full system remote code execution. Commit 909e5c97885237530d1264cfceb5555870eb9546,
  the patch for the issue, is included in version 0.5.0b3.dev89.
