aliases: []
summary: Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. An
  unauthenticated user can access credentials of last authenticated user via OpenID or OAuth2
  where the authentication URL did not include redirect query string. This happens because on
  that endpoint for both OpenId and Oauth2 Directus is using the respond middleware, which by
  default will try to cache GET requests that met some conditions. Although, those conditions
  do not include this scenario, when an unauthenticated request returns user credentials. This
  vulnerability is fixed in 10.13.3 and 11.1.0.
