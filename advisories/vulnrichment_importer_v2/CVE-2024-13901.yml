summary: 'The Counter Box: Add Engaging Countdowns, Timers & Counters to Your WordPress Site
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to DOM-Based Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘content’
  parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.6 due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level
  access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
  an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
  has been disabled.'
