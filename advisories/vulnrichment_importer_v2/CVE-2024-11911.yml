aliases: []
summary: The WP Crowdfunding plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized plugin installation
  due to a missing capability check on the install_woocommerce_plugin() function action in all
  versions up to, and including, 2.1.12. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Subscriber-level access and above, to install WooCommerce. This has a limited impact
  on most sites because WooCommerce is a requirement.
