aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  netfilter: nf_tables: avoid skb access on nf_stolen

  When verdict is NF_STOLEN, the skb might have been freed.

  When tracing is enabled, this can result in a use-after-free:
  1. access to skb->nf_trace
  2. access to skb->mark
  3. computation of trace id
  4. dump of packet payload

  To avoid 1, keep a cached copy of skb->nf_trace in the
  trace state struct.
  Refresh this copy whenever verdict is != STOLEN.

  Avoid 2 by skipping skb->mark access if verdict is STOLEN.

  3 is avoided by precomputing the trace id.

  Only dump the packet when verdict is not "STOLEN".
