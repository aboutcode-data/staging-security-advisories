datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2025/7xxx/CVE-2025-7204.json
aliases: []
summary: |
  In ConnectWise PSA versions older than 2025.9, a
  vulnerability exists where authenticated users could gain access to sensitive
  user information. Specific API requests were found to return an overly verbose
  user object, which included encrypted password hashes for other users.
  Authenticated users could then retrieve these hashes. 



  An
  attacker or privileged user could then use these exposed hashes to conduct
  offline brute-force or dictionary attacks. Such attacks could lead to
  credential compromise, allowing unauthorized access to accounts, and
  potentially privilege escalation within the system.
