aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in CommScope Ruckus Unleashed prior to 200.15.6.212.27 and
  200.18.7.1.323, and in Ruckus ZoneDirector prior to 10.5.1.0.282, where an authenticated request
  to the management endpoint `/admin/_cmdstat.jsp` discloses the administrator password in a
  trivially reversible obfuscated form. The same obfuscation method persists in configuration
  prior to 200.18.7.1.302, allowing anyone who obtains the system configuration to recover the
  plaintext credentials.
