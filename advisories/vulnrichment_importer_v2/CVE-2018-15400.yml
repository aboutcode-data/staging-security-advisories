summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Cloud Services Platform
  2100 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS)
  attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device. The vulnerability
  is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click
  a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script
  code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive, browser-based
  information.
