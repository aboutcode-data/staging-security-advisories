aliases: []
summary: Due to an uncontrolled resource consumption (Denial of Service) vulnerability, an authenticated
  attacker with regular user privileges and network access can repeatedly invoke a remote-enabled
  function module with an excessively large loop-control parameter. This triggers prolonged
  loop execution that consumes excessive system resources, potentially rendering the system
  unavailable. Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service condition that impacts
  availability, while confidentiality and integrity remain unaffected.
