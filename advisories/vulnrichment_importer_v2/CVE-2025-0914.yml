aliases: []
summary: An improper access control issue in the VQL shell feature in Velociraptor Versions
  < 0.73.4 allowed authenticated users to execute the execve() plugin in deployments where this
  was explicitly forbidden by configuring the prevent_execve flag in the configuration file.
  This setting is not usually recommended and is uncommonly used, so this issue will only affect
  users who do set it. This issue is fixed in release 0.73.4.
