aliases: []
summary: The Assistant for NextGEN Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary directory
  deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the /wp-json/nextgenassistant/v1.0.0/control
  REST endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.9. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to delete arbitrary directories on the server, which can cause a complete loss of
  availability.
