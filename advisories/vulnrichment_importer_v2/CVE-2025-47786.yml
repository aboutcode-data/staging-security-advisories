aliases: []
summary: Emlog is an open source website building system. Version 2.5.13 has a stored cross-site
  scripting vulnerability that allows any registered user to construct malicious JavaScript,
  inducing all website users to click. In `/admin/comment.php`, the parameter `perpage_num`
  is not validated and is directly stored in the `admin_commend_perpage_num` field of the `emlog_options`
  table in the database. Moreover, the output is not filtered, resulting in the direct output
  of malicious code. As of time of publication, it is unclear if a patch exists.
