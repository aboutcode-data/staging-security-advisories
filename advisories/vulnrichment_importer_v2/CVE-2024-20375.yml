summary: "A vulnerability in the SIP call processing function of Cisco Unified Communications\
  \ Manager (Unified CM) and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition\
  \ (Unified CM SME) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service\
  \ (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper parsing\
  \ of SIP messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SIP message\
  \ to an affected Cisco Unified CM or Cisco Unified CM SME device. A successful exploit could\
  \ allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition that interrupts\
  \ the communications of reliant voice and video devices."
