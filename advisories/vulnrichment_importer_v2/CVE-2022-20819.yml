aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine
  (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to obtain sensitive information from an
  affected device. This vulnerability exists because administrative privilege levels for sensitive
  data are not properly enforced. An attacker with read-only privileges for the web-based management
  interface on an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by browsing to a page that
  contains sensitive data. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to collect sensitive
  information about the system configuration.
