  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  btrfs: do not BUG_ON() when freeing tree block after error

  When freeing a tree block, at btrfs_free_tree_block(), if we fail to
  create a delayed reference we don't deal with the error and just do a
  BUG_ON(). The error most likely to happen is -ENOMEM, and we have a
  comment mentioning that only -ENOMEM can happen, but that is not true,
  because in case qgroups are enabled any error returned from
  btrfs_qgroup_trace_extent_post() (can be -EUCLEAN or anything returned
  from btrfs_search_slot() for example) can be propagated back to
  btrfs_free_tree_block().

  So stop doing a BUG_ON() and return the error to the callers and make
  them abort the transaction to prevent leaking space. Syzbot was
  triggering this, likely due to memory allocation failure injection.
