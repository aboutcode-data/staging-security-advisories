aliases: []
summary: WWBN AVideo is an open source video platform. Prior to version 22.0, the `aVideoEncoder.json.php`
  API endpoint accepts a `downloadURL` parameter and fetches the referenced resource server-side
  without proper validation or an allow-list. This allows authenticated users to trigger server-side
  requests to arbitrary URLs (including internal network endpoints). An authenticated attacker
  can leverage SSRF to interact with internal services and retrieve sensitive data (e.g., internal
  APIs, metadata services), potentially leading to further compromise depending on the deployment
  environment. This issue has been fixed in AVideo version 22.0.
