aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, local
  attacker to inject a command to the underlying operating system that will execute with root
  privileges upon the next reboot of the device. The authenticated user must have privileged
  EXEC permissions on the device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient protection of values
  passed to a script that executes during device startup. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by writing values to a specific file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute
  commands with root privileges each time the affected device is restarted.
