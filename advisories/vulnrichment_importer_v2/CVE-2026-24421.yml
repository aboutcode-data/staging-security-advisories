summary: phpMyFAQ is an open source FAQ web application. Versions 4.0.16 and below have flawed
  authorization logic which exposes the /api/setup/backup endpoint to any authenticated user
  despite their permissions. SetupController.php uses userIsAuthenticated() but does not verify
  that the requester has configuration/admin permissions. Non-admin users can trigger a configuration
  backup and retrieve its path. The endpoint only checks authentication, not authorization,
  and returns a link to the generated ZIP. This issue is fixed in version 4.0.17.
