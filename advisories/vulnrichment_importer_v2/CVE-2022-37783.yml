aliases: []
summary: All Craft CMS versions between 3.0.0 and 3.7.32 disclose password hashes of users who
  authenticate using their E-Mail address or username in Anti-CSRF-Tokens. Craft CMS uses a
  cookie called CRAFT_CSRF_TOKEN and a HTML hidden field called CRAFT_CSRF_TOKEN to avoid Cross
  Site Request Forgery attacks. The CRAFT_CSRF_TOKEN cookie discloses the password hash in without
  encoding it whereas the corresponding HTML hidden field discloses the users' password hash
  in a masked manner, which can be decoded by using public functions of the YII framework.
