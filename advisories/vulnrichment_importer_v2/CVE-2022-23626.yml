summary: m1k1o/blog is a lightweight self-hosted facebook-styled PHP blog. Errors from functions
  `imagecreatefrom*` and `image*` have not been checked properly. Although PHP issued warnings
  and the upload function returned `false`, the original file (that could contain a malicious
  payload) was kept on the disk. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There are
  no known workarounds for this issue.
