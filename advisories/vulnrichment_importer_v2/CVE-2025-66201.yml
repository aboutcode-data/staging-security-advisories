aliases: []
summary: LibreChat is a ChatGPT clone with additional features. Prior to version 0.8.1-rc2,
  LibreChat is vulnerable to Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF), by passing specially crafted
  OpenAPI specs to its "Actions" feature and making the LLM use those actions. It could be used
  by an authenticated user with access to this feature to access URLs only accessible to the
  LibreChat server (such as cloud metadata services, through which impersonation of the server
  might be possible). This issue has been patched in version 0.8.1-rc2.
