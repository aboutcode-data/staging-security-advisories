aliases: []
summary: Git for Windows, the Windows port of Git, ships with an executable called `connect.exe`,
  which implements a SOCKS5 proxy that can be used to connect e.g. to SSH servers via proxies
  when certain ports are blocked for outgoing connections. The location of `connect.exe`'s config
  file is hard-coded as `/etc/connectrc` which will typically be interpreted as `C:\etc\connectrc`.
  Since `C:\etc` can be created by any authenticated user, this makes `connect.exe` susceptible
  to malicious files being placed there by other users on the same multi-user machine. The problem
  has been patched in Git for Windows v2.40.1. As a workaround, create the folder `etc` on all
  drives where Git commands are run, and remove read/write access from those folders. Alternatively,
  watch out for malicious `<drive>:\etc\connectrc` files on multi-user machines.
