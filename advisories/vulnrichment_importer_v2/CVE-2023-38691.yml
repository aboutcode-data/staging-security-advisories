aliases: []
summary: matrix-appservice-bridge provides an API for setting up bridges. Starting in version
  4.0.0 and prior to versions 8.1.2 and 9.0.1, a malicious Matrix server can use a foreign user's
  MXID in an OpenID exchange, allowing a bad actor to impersonate users when using the provisioning
  API. The library does not check that the servername part of the `sub` parameter (containing
  the user's *claimed* MXID) is the the same as the servername we are talking to. A malicious
  actor could spin up a server on any given domain, respond with a `sub` parameter according
  to the user they want to act as and use the resulting token to perform provisioning requests.
  Versions 8.1.2 and 9.0.1 contain a patch. As a workaround, disable the provisioning API.
