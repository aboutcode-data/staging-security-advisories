aliases: []
summary: TitanSystems Zender v3.9.7 contains an account takeover vulnerability in its password
  reset functionality. A temporary password or reset token issued to one user can be used to
  log in as another user, due to improper validation of token-user linkage. This allows remote
  attackers to gain unauthorized access to any user account by exploiting the password reset
  mechanism. The vulnerability occurs because the reset token is not correctly bound to the
  requesting account and is accepted for other user emails during login, enabling privilege
  escalation and information disclosure.
