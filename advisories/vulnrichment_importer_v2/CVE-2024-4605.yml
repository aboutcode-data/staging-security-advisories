aliases: []
summary: The Breakdance plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions
  up to, and including, 1.7.1 via post meta data. This is due to the plugin storing custom data
  in metadata without an underscore prefix. This makes it possible for lower privileged users,
  such as contributors, to edit this data via UI. As a result they can escalate their privileges
  or execute arbitrary code.
