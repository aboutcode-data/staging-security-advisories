aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM)
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-frame scripting (XFS) attack
  against the user of the web UI of an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  protections for HTML inline frames (iframes) by the web UI of the affected software. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the affected UI to navigate to an
  attacker-controlled web page that contains a malicious HTML iframe. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to conduct click-jacking or other client-side browser attacks on the affected
  system. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg19761.'
