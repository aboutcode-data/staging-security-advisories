aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) subsystem of Cisco Nexus
  9000 Series Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) Mode Switch Software could allow an adjacent,
  unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition or execute arbitrary
  code with root privileges. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of certain
  type, length, value (TLV) fields of the LLDP frame header. An attacker could exploit this
  vulnerability by sending a crafted LLDP packet to the targeted device. A successful exploit
  may lead to a buffer overflow condition that could either cause a DoS condition or allow the
  attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges. Note: This vulnerability cannot be
  exploited by transit traffic through the device; the crafted packet must be targeted to a
  directly connected interface. This vulnerability affects Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches
  in ACI mode if they are running a Cisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI Mode Switch Software release
  prior to 13.2(7f) or any 14.x release.'
