aliases: []
summary: wlc is a Weblate command-line client using Weblate's REST API. Prior to 1.17.0, wlc
  supported providing unscoped API keys in the setting. This practice was discouraged for years,
  but the code was never removed. This might cause the API key to be leaked to different servers.
