aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine
  (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS)
  attack against a user of the web-based interface. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  input validation of some parameters passed to the web-based management interface. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user of the interface to click a specific
  link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the
  context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.
  For information about fixed software releases, consult the Cisco bug ID at https://quickview.cloudapps.cisco.com/quickview/bug/CSCvn64652.
  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories
  for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page,
  to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.
