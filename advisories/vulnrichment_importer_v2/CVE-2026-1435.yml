aliases: []
summary: Not properly invalidated session vulnerability in Graylog Web Interface, version 2.2.3,
  due to incorrect management of session invalidation after new logins. The application generates
  a new 'sessionId' each time a user authenticates, but does not invalidate previously issued
  session identifiers, which remain valid even after multiple consecutive logins by the same
  user. As a result, a stolen or leaked 'sessionId' can continue to be used to authenticate
  valid requests. Exploiting this vulnerability would allow an attacker with access to the web
  service/API network (port 9000 or HTTP/S endpoint of the server) to reuse an old session token
  to gain unauthorized access to the application, interact with the API/web, and compromise
  the integrity of the affected account.
