aliases: []
summary: Arduino IDE 2.x is an IDE based on the Theia IDE framework and built with Electron.
  A Self Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified within the Arduino-IDE
  prior to version v2.3.5. The vulnerability occurs in the Additional Board Manager URLs field,
  which can be found in the Preferences -> Settings section of the Arduino IDE interface. In
  the vulnerable versions, any values entered in this field are directly displayed to the user
  through a notification tooltip object, without a proper output encoding routine, due to the
  underlying ElectronJS engine interpretation. This vulnerability exposes the input parameter
  to Self-XSS attacks, which may lead to security risks depending on where the malicious payload
  is injected. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.3.5.
