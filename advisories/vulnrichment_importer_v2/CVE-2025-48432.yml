aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Django 5.2 before 5.2.3, 5.1 before 5.1.11, and 4.2 before
  4.2.23. Internal HTTP response logging does not escape request.path, which allows remote attackers
  to potentially manipulate log output via crafted URLs. This may lead to log injection or forgery
  when logs are viewed in terminals or processed by external systems.
