aliases: []
summary: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Under certain conditions, a logged
  in user can redeem an invite with an email that either doesn't match the invite's email or
  does not adhere to the email domain restriction of an invite link. The impact of this flaw
  is aggravated when the invite has been configured to add the user that accepts the invite
  into restricted groups. Once a user has been incorrectly added to a restricted group, the
  user may then be able to view content which that are restricted to the respective group. Users
  are advised to upgrade to the current stable releases. There are no known workarounds to this
  issue.
