aliases: []
summary: Ghost is an open source content management system. In Ghost versions 5.43.0 through
  5.12.04 and 6.0.0 through 6.14.0, an attacker was able to craft a malicious link that, when
  accessed by an authenticated staff user or member, would execute JavaScript with the victim's
  permissions, potentially leading to account takeover. Ghost Portal versions 2.29.1 through
  2.51.4 and 2.52.0 through 2.57.0 were vulnerable to this issue. Ghost automatically loads
  the latest patch of the members Portal component via CDN. For Ghost 5.x users, upgrading to
  v5.121.0 or later fixes the vulnerability. v5.121.0 loads Portal v2.51.5, which contains the
  patch. For Ghost 6.x users, upgrading to v6.15.0 or later fixes the vulnerability. v6.15.0
  loads Portal v2.57.1, which contains the patch. For Ghost installations using a customized
  or self-hosted version of Portal, it will be necessary to manually rebuild from or update
  to the latest patch version.
