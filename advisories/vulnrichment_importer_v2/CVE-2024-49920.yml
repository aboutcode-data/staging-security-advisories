  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/amd/display: Check null pointers before multiple uses

  [WHAT & HOW]
  Poniters, such as stream_enc and dc->bw_vbios, are null checked previously
  in the same function, so Coverity warns "implies that stream_enc and
  dc->bw_vbios might be null". They are used multiple times in the
  subsequent code and need to be checked.

  This fixes 10 FORWARD_NULL issues reported by Coverity.
