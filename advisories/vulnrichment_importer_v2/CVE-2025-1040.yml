aliases: []
summary: AutoGPT versions 0.3.4 and earlier are vulnerable to a Server-Side Template Injection
  (SSTI) that could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE). The vulnerability arises from the improper
  handling of user-supplied format strings in the `AgentOutputBlock` implementation, where malicious
  input is passed to the Jinja2 templating engine without adequate security measures. Attackers
  can exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary commands on the host system. The issue is fixed
  in version 0.4.0.
