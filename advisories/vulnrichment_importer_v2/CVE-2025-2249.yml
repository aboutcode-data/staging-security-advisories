aliases: []
summary: The SoJ SoundSlides plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due
  to missing file type validation in the soj_soundslides_options_subpanel() function in all
  versions up to, and including, 1.2.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Contributor-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's
  server which may make remote code execution possible.
