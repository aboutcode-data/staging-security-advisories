summary: The Administrative Shortcodes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the 'login' and 'logout' shortcode attributes in all versions up to, and including,

  authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web
  scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
