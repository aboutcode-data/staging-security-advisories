aliases: []
summary: A path traversal vulnerability in the get-project-files functionality of stitionai/devika
  allows attackers to read arbitrary files from the filesystem and cause a Denial of Service
  (DoS). This issue is present in all versions of the application. The vulnerability arises
  due to insufficient path sanitization for the 'project-name' parameter, enabling attackers
  to specify paths that traverse the filesystem. By setting 'project-name' to the root directory,
  an attacker can cause the application to attempt to read the entire filesystem, leading to
  a DoS condition.
