aliases: []
summary: Backstage is an open framework for building developer portals. Configuration supplied
  through APP_CONFIG_* environment variables, for example APP_CONFIG_backend_listen_port=7007,
  where unexpectedly ignoring the visibility defined in configuration schema. This occurred
  even if the configuration schema specified that they should have backend or secret visibility.
  This was an intended feature of the APP_CONFIG_* way of supplying configuration, but now clearly
  goes against the expected behavior of the configuration system. This behavior leads to a risk
  of potentially exposing sensitive configuration details intended to remain private or restricted
  to backend processes. The issue has been resolved in version 0.3.75 of the @backstage/plugin-app-backend
  package. As a temporary measure, avoid supplying secrets using the APP_CONFIG_ configuration
  pattern. Consider alternative methods for setting secrets, such as the environment substitution
  available for Backstage configuration.
