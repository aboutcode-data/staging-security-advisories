aliases: []
summary: Dendrite is a Matrix homeserver written in Go. In affected versions events retrieved
  from a remote homeserver using the `/get_missing_events` path did not have their signatures
  verified correctly. This could potentially allow a remote homeserver to provide invalid/modified
  events to Dendrite via this endpoint. Note that this does not apply to events retrieved through
  other endpoints (e.g. `/event`, `/state`) as they have been correctly verified. Homeservers
  that have federation disabled are not vulnerable. The problem has been fixed in Dendrite 0.9.8.
  Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
