aliases: []
summary: calibre is a cross-platform e-book manager for viewing, converting, editing, and cataloging
  e-books. Versions 9.2.1 and below contain a Path Traversal vulnerability that allows arbitrary
  file writes anywhere the user has write permissions. On Windows, this leads to Remote Code
  Execution by writing a payload to the Startup folder, which executes on next login. Function
  extract_pictures only checks startswith('Pictures'), and does not sanitize '..' sequences.
  calibre's own ZipFile.extractall() in utils/zipfile.py does sanitize '..' via _get_targetpath(),
  but extract_pictures() bypasses this by using manual zf.read() + open(). This issue has been
  fixed in version 9.3.0.
