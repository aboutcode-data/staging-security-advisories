summary: The WP Booking System – Booking Calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected
  Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg & remove_query_arg without appropriate
  escaping on the URL in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.19.8. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they
  can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
