aliases: []
summary: Markdownify version 1.4.1 allows an external attacker to remotely obtain arbitrary
  local files on any client that attempts to view a malicious markdown file through Markdownify.
  This is possible because the application does not have a CSP policy (or at least not strict
  enough) and/or does not properly validate the contents of markdown files before rendering
  them.
