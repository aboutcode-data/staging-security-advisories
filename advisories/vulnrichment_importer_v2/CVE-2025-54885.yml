summary: Thinbus Javascript Secure Remote Password is a browser SRP6a implementation for zero-knowledge
  password authentication. In versions 2.0.0 and below, a protocol compliance bug causes the
  client to generate a fixed 252 bits of entropy instead of the intended bit length of the safe
  prime (defaulted to 2048 bits). The client public value is being generated from a private
  value that is 4 bits below the specification. This reduces the protocol's designed security
  margin it is now practically exploitable. The servers full sized 2048 bit random number is
  used to create the shared session key and password proof. This is fixed in version 2.0.1.
