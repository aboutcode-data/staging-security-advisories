aliases: []
summary: 1Panel versions 1.10.33 through 2.0.15 contain a cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
  vulnerability in the panel name management functionality. The affected endpoint does not implement
  CSRF defenses such as anti-CSRF tokens or Origin/Referer validation. An attacker can craft
  a malicious webpage that submits a panel-name change request; if a victim visits the page
  while authenticated, the browser includes valid session cookies and the request succeeds.
  This allows a remote attacker to change the victim’s panel name to an arbitrary value without
  consent.
