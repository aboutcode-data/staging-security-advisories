aliases: []
summary: SillyTavern is a locally installed user interface that allows users to interact with
  text generation large language models, image generation engines, and text-to-speech voice
  models. In versions prior to 1.16.0, a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in
  the asset download endpoint allows authenticated users to make arbitrary HTTP requests from
  the server and read the full response body, enabling access to internal services, cloud metadata,
  and private network resources. The vulnerability has been patched in the version 1.16.0 by
  introducing a whitelist domain check for asset download requests. It can be reviewed and customized
  by editing the `whitelistImportDomains` array in the `config.yaml` file.
