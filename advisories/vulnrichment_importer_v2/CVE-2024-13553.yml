aliases: []
summary: The SMS Alert Order Notifications – WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 3.7.9.
  This is due to the plugin using the Host header to determine if the plugin is in a playground
  environment. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to spoof the Host header
  to make the OTP code "1234" and authenticate as any user, including administrators.
