aliases: []
summary: Chall-Manager is a platform-agnostic system able to start Challenges on Demand of a
  player. The HTTP Gateway processes headers, but with no timeout set. With a slow loris attack,
  an attacker could cause Denial of Service (DoS). Exploitation does not require authentication
  nor authorization, so anyone can exploit it. It should nonetheless not be exploitable as it
  is highly recommended to bury Chall-Manager deep within the infrastructure due to its large
  capabilities, so no users could reach the system. Patch has been implemented by commit 1385bd8
  and shipped in v0.1.4.
