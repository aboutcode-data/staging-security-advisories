aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Contiki-NG tinyDTLS through master branch 53a0d97. An infinite
  loop bug exists during the handling of a ClientHello handshake message. This bug allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service by sending a malformed ClientHello handshake message
  with an odd length of cipher suites, which triggers an infinite loop (consuming all resources)
  and a buffer over-read that can disclose sensitive information.
