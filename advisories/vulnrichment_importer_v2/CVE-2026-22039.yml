aliases: []
summary: Kyverno is a policy engine designed for cloud native platform engineering teams. Versions
  prior to 1.16.3 and 1.15.3 have a critical authorization boundary bypass in namespaced Kyverno
  Policy apiCall. The resolved `urlPath` is executed using the Kyverno admission controller
  ServiceAccount, with no enforcement that the request is limited to the policy’s namespace.
  As a result, any authenticated user with permission to create a namespaced Policy can cause
  Kyverno to perform Kubernetes API requests using Kyverno’s admission controller identity,
  targeting any API path allowed by that ServiceAccount’s RBAC. This breaks namespace isolation
  by enabling cross-namespace reads (for example, ConfigMaps and, where permitted, Secrets)
  and allows cluster-scoped or cross-namespace writes (for example, creating ClusterPolicies)
  by controlling the urlPath through context variable substitution. Versions 1.16.3 and 1.15.3
  contain a patch for the vulnerability.
