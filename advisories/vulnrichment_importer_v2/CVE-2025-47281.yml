aliases: []
summary: Kyverno is a policy engine designed for cloud native platform engineering teams. In
  versions 1.14.1 and below, a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists due to improper
  handling of JMESPath variable substitutions. Attackers with permissions to create or update
  Kyverno policies can craft expressions using the {{@}} variable combined with a pipe and an
  invalid JMESPath function (e.g., {{@ | non_existent_function }}). This leads to a nil value
  being substituted into the policy structure. Subsequent processing by internal functions,
  specifically getValueAsStringMap, which expect string values, results in a panic due to a
  type assertion failure (interface {} is nil, not string). This crashes Kyverno worker threads
  in the admission controller and causes continuous crashes of the reports controller pod. This
  is fixed in version 1.14.2.
