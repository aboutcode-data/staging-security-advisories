aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Chamillo LMS 1.11.2. The Social Network /personal_data endpoint
  exposes full sensitive user information even after logout because proper cache-control is
  missing. Using the browser back button restores all personal data, allowing unauthorized users
  on the same device to view confidential information. This leads to profiling, impersonation,
  targeted attacks, and significant privacy risks.
