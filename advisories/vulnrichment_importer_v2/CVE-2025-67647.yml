aliases: []
summary: SvelteKit is a framework for rapidly developing robust, performant web applications
  using Svelte. Prior to 2.49.5, SvelteKit is vulnerable to a server side request forgery (SSRF)
  and denial of service (DoS) under certain conditions. From 2.44.0 through 2.49.4, the vulnerability
  results in a DoS when your app has at least one prerendered route (export const prerender
  = true). From 2.19.0 through 2.49.4, the vulnerability results in a DoS when your app has
  at least one prerendered route and you are using adapter-node without a configured ORIGIN
  environment variable, and you are not using a reverse proxy that implements Host header validation.
  This vulnerability is fixed in 2.49.5.
