aliases: []
summary: Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool with unique topic-based threading.
  Zulip administrators can configure Zulip to limit who can add users to streams, and separately
  to limit who can invite users to the organization. In Zulip Server 6.1 and below, the UI which
  allows a user to invite a new user also allows them to set the streams that the new user is
  invited to -- even if the inviting user would not have permissions to add an existing user
  to streams. While such a configuration is likely rare in practice, the behavior does violate
  security-related controls. This does not let a user invite new users to streams they cannot
  see, or would not be able to add users to if they had that general permission. This issue
  has been addressed in version 6.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may
  limit sending of invitations down to users who also have the permission to add users to streams.
