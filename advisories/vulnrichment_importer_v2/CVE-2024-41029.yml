aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  nvmem: core: limit cell sysfs permissions to main attribute ones

  The cell sysfs attribute should not provide more access to the nvmem
  data than the main attribute itself.
  For example if nvme_config::root_only was set, the cell attribute
  would still provide read access to everybody.

  Mask out permissions not available on the main attribute.
