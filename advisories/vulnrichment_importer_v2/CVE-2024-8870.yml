summary: The Forms for Mailchimp by Optin Cat – Grow Your MailChimp List plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg without appropriate

  unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can
  successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
