aliases: []
summary: wolfSSL prior to 5.6.6 did not check that messages in one (D)TLS record do not span
  key boundaries. As a result, it was possible to combine (D)TLS messages using different keys
  into one (D)TLS record. The most extreme edge case is that, in (D)TLS 1.3, it was possible
  that an unencrypted (D)TLS 1.3 record from the server containing first a ServerHello message
  and then the rest of the first server flight would be accepted by a wolfSSL client. In (D)TLS
  1.3 the handshake is encrypted after the ServerHello but a wolfSSL client would accept an
  unencrypted flight from the server. This does not compromise key negotiation and authentication
  so it is assigned a low severity rating.
