datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2020-3205
datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2020/3xxx/CVE-2020-3205.json
aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the implementation of the inter-VM channel of Cisco IOS Software
  for Cisco 809 and 829 Industrial Integrated Services Routers (Industrial ISRs) and Cisco 1000
  Series Connected Grid Routers (CGR1000) could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker
  to execute arbitrary shell commands on the Virtual Device Server (VDS) of an affected device.
  The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of signaling packets that are destined
  to VDS. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets to an affected
  device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands in the
  context of the Linux shell of VDS with the privileges of the root user. Because the device
  is designed on a hypervisor architecture, exploitation of a vulnerability that affects the
  inter-VM channel may lead to a complete system compromise. For more information about this
  vulnerability, see the Details section of this advisory.
