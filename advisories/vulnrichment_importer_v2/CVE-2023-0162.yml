aliases: []
summary: The CPO Companion plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via several of its content type settings parameters in versions up to, and including, 1.0.4
  due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts
  in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
