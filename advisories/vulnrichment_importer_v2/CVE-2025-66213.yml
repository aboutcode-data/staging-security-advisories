aliases: []
summary: Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications,
  and databases. Prior to version 4.0.0-beta.451, an authenticated command injection vulnerability
  in the File Storage Directory Mount Path functionality allows users with application/service
  management permissions to execute arbitrary commands as root on managed servers. The file_storage_directory_source
  parameter is passed directly to shell commands without proper sanitization, enabling full
  remote code execution on the host system. Version 4.0.0-beta.451 fixes the issue.
