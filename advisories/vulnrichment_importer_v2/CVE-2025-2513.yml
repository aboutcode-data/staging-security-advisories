summary: The Smart Icons For WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.4 due to insufficient

  with Editor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute
  whenever a user accesses the SVG file.
