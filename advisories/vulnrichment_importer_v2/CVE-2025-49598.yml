datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2025-49598
datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2025/49xxx/CVE-2025-49598.json
aliases: []
summary: conda-forge-ci-setup is a package installed by conda-forge each time a build is run
  on CI. The conda-forge-ci-setup-feedstock setup script is vulnerable due to the unsafe use
  of the eval function when parsing version information from a custom-formatted meta.yaml file.
  An attacker controlling meta.yaml can inject malicious code into the version assignment, which
  is executed during file processing, leading to arbitrary code execution. Exploitation requires
  an attacker to modify the recipe file by manipulating the RECIPE_DIR variable and introducing
  a malicious meta.yaml file. While this is more feasible in CI/CD pipelines, it is uncommon
  in typical environments, reducing overall risk. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.15.0.
