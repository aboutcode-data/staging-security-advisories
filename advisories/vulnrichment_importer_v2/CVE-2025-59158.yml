aliases: []
summary: Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications,
  and databases. Coolify versions prior to and including v4.0.0-beta.420.6 are vulnerable to
  a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack in the project creation workflow. An authenticated
  user with low privileges (e.g., member role) can create a project with a maliciously crafted
  name containing embedded JavaScript. When an administrator later attempts to delete the project
  or its associated resource, the payload automatically executes in the admin’s browser context.
  Version 4.0.0-beta.420.7 contains a patch for the issue.
