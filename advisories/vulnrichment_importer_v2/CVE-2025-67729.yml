aliases: []
summary: LMDeploy is a toolkit for compressing, deploying, and serving LLMs. Prior to version
  0.11.1, an insecure deserialization vulnerability exists in lmdeploy where torch.load() is
  called without the weights_only=True parameter when loading model checkpoint files. This allows
  an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine when they load a malicious .bin
  or .pt model file. This issue has been patched in version 0.11.1.
