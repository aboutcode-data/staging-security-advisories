aliases: []
summary: rulex is a new, portable, regular expression language. When parsing untrusted rulex
  expressions, rulex may crash, possibly enabling a Denial of Service attack. This happens when
  the expression contains a multi-byte UTF-8 code point in a string literal or after a backslash,
  because rulex tries to slice into the code point and panics as a result. This is a security
  concern for you, if your service parses untrusted rulex expressions (expressions provided
  by an untrusted user), and your service becomes unavailable when the thread running rulex
  panics. The crashes are fixed in version **0.4.3**. Affected users are advised to update to
  this version. The only known workaround for this issue is to assume that regular expression
  parsing will panic and to add logic to catch panics.
