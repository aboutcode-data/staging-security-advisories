  drm/amd/display: Disable DMCUB timeout for DCN35

  [Why]
  DMCUB can intermittently take longer than expected to process commands.

  Old ASIC policy was to continue while logging a diagnostic error - which
  works fine for ASIC without IPS, but with IPS this could lead to a race
  condition where we attempt to access DCN state while it's inaccessible,
  leading to a system hang when the NIU port is not disabled or register
  accesses that timeout and the display configuration in an undefined
  state.

  [How]
  We need to investigate why these accesses take longer than expected, but
  for now we should disable the timeout on DCN35 to avoid this race
  condition. Since the waits happen only at lower interrupt levels the
  risk of taking too long at higher IRQ and causing a system watchdog
  timeout are minimal.
