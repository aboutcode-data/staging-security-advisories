aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management
  Center (FMC) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands
  on the underlying operating system. To exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker must have
  valid device credentials, but does not need Administrator privileges. These vulnerabilities
  are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input for certain configuration options.
  An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by using crafted input within the device configuration
  GUI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device,
  including on the underlying operating system, which could also affect the availability of
  the device.
