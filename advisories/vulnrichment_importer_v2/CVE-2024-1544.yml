summary: "Generating the ECDSA nonce k samples a random number r and then \ntruncates this randomness\
  \ with a modular reduction mod n where n is the \norder of the elliptic curve. Meaning k =\
  \ r mod n. The division used \nduring the reduction estimates a factor q_e by dividing the\
  \ upper two \ndigits (a digit having e.g. a size of 8 byte) of r by the upper digit of \n\
  n and then decrements q_e in a loop until it has the correct size. \nObserving the number\
  \ of times q_e is decremented through a control-flow \nrevealing side-channel reveals a bias\
  \ in the most significant bits of \nk. Depending on the curve this is either a negligible\
  \ bias or a \nsignificant bias large enough to reconstruct k with lattice reduction \nmethods.\
  \ For SECP160R1, e.g., we find a bias of 15 bits."
