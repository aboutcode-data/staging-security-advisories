datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2025/20xxx/CVE-2025-20320.json
aliases: []
summary: In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.4.3, 9.3.5, 9.2.7 and 9.1.10, and Splunk Cloud
  Platform versions below 9.3.2411.107, 9.3.2408.117, and 9.2.2406.121, a low-privileged user
  that does not hold the "admin" or "power" Splunk roles could craft a malicious payload through
  the `User Interface - Views` configuration page that could potentially lead to a denial of
  service (DoS).The user could cause the DoS by exploiting a path traversal vulnerability that
  allows for deletion of arbitrary files within a Splunk directory. The vulnerability requires
  the low-privileged user to phish the administrator-level victim by tricking them into initiating
  a request within their browser. The low-privileged user should not be able to exploit the
  vulnerability at will.
