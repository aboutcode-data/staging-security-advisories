aliases: []
summary: CVAT is an open source interactive video and image annotation tool for computer vision.
  In versions 1.0.0 through 2.54.0, users that have the staff status may freely change their
  permissions, including giving themselves superuser status and joining the admin group, which
  gives them full access to the data in the CVAT instance. Version 2.55.0 fixes the issue. As
  a workaround, review the list of users with staff status and revoke it from any users that
  are not expected to have superuser privileges.
