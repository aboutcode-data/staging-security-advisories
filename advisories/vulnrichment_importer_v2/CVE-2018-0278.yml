summary: 'A vulnerability in the management console of Cisco Firepower System Software could
  allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive data about the system. The vulnerability
  is due to improper cross-origin domain protections for the WebSocket protocol. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to visit a malicious website designed
  to send requests to the affected application while the user is logged into the application
  with an active session cookie. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve policy
  or configuration information from the affected software and to perform another attack against
  the management console. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvh68311.'
