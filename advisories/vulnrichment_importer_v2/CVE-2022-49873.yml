  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  bpf: Fix wrong reg type conversion in release_reference()

  Some helper functions will allocate memory. To avoid memory leaks, the
  verifier requires the eBPF program to release these memories by calling
  the corresponding helper functions.

  When a resource is released, all pointer registers corresponding to the
  resource should be invalidated. The verifier use release_references() to
  do this job, by apply  __mark_reg_unknown() to each relevant register.

  It will give these registers the type of SCALAR_VALUE. A register that
  will contain a pointer value at runtime, but of type SCALAR_VALUE, which
  may allow the unprivileged user to get a kernel pointer by storing this
  register into a map.

  Using __mark_reg_not_init() while NOT allow_ptr_leaks can mitigate this
  problem.
