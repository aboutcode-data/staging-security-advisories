aliases: []
summary: The RegistrationMagic – Custom Registration Forms, User Registration, Payment, and
  User Login plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection in all versions up to, and
  including, 6.0.6.2 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of
  sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with administrator access or higher, to append additional SQL queries into already
  existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. An unauthenticated
  attacker could utilize an injected Cross-Site Scripting via user-agent on form submission
  to leverage this to achieve Reflected Cross-Site Scripting.
