aliases: []
summary: jupyter-lsp is a coding assistance tool for JupyterLab (code navigation + hover suggestions
  + linters + autocompletion + rename) using Language Server Protocol. Installations of jupyter-lsp
  running in environments without configured file system access control (on the operating system
  level), and with jupyter-server instances exposed to non-trusted network are vulnerable to
  unauthorised access and modification of file system beyond the jupyter root directory. This
  issue has been patched in version 2.2.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. Users unable
  to upgrade should uninstall jupyter-lsp.
