aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) VPN packet processing
  functionality in Cisco Aironet Access Points (APs) could allow an unauthenticated, remote
  attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
  The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)
  frames that pass through the data plane of an affected AP. An attacker could exploit this
  vulnerability by associating to a vulnerable AP, initiating a PPTP VPN connection to an arbitrary
  PPTP VPN server, and sending a malicious GRE frame through the data plane of the AP. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to cause an internal process of the targeted AP to crash,
  which in turn would cause the AP to reload. The AP reload would cause a DoS condition for
  clients that are associated with the AP.
