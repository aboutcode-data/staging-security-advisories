aliases: []
summary: An Use of Hard-coded Credentials vulnerability has been identified in Moxa’s network
  security appliances and routers. The system employs a hard-coded secret key to sign JSON Web
  Tokens (JWT) used for authentication. This insecure implementation allows an unauthenticated
  attacker to forge valid tokens, thereby bypassing authentication controls and impersonating
  any user. Exploitation of this vulnerability can result in complete system compromise, enabling
  unauthorized access, data theft, and full administrative control over the affected device.
  While successful exploitation can severely impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability
  of the affected device itself, there is no loss of confidentiality or integrity within any
  subsequent systems.
