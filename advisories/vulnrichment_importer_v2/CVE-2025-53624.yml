aliases: []
summary: The Docusaurus gists plugin adds a page to your Docusaurus instance, displaying all
  public gists of a GitHub user. docusaurus-plugin-content-gists versions prior to 4.0.0 are
  vulnerable to exposing GitHub Personal Access Tokens in production build artifacts when passed
  through plugin configuration options. The token, intended for build-time API access only,
  is inadvertently included in client-side JavaScript bundles, making it accessible to anyone
  who can view the website's source code. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.0.0.
