aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the checkpoint manager implementation of Cisco Redundancy Configuration
  Manager (RCM) for Cisco StarOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
  cause the checkpoint manager process to restart upon receipt of malformed TCP data. This vulnerability
  is due to improper input validation of an ingress TCP packet. An attacker could exploit this
  vulnerability by sending crafted TCP data to the affected application. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition due to the checkpoint
  manager process restarting.
