aliases: []
summary: Certifi is a curated collection of Root Certificates for validating the trustworthiness
  of SSL certificates while verifying the identity of TLS hosts. Certifi 2022.12.07 removes
  root certificates from "TrustCor" from the root store. These are in the process of being removed
  from Mozilla's trust store. TrustCor's root certificates are being removed pursuant to an
  investigation prompted by media reporting that TrustCor's ownership also operated a business
  that produced spyware. Conclusions of Mozilla's investigation can be found in the linked google
  group discussion.
