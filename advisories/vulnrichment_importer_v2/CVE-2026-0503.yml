aliases: []
summary: Due to missing authorization check in the SAP ERP Central Component (SAP ECC) and SAP
  S/4HANA (SAP EHS Management), an attacker could extract hardcoded clear-text credentials and
  bypass the password authentication check by manipulating user parameters. Upon successful
  exploitation, the attacker can access, modify or delete certain change pointer information
  within EHS objects in the application which might further affect the subsequent systems. This
  vulnerability leads to a low impact on confidentiality and integrity of the application with
  no affect on the availability.
