summary: A vulnerability in the identity-based firewall (IDFW) rule processing feature of Cisco
  Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass security protections. This vulnerability
  is due to improper handling of network requests by affected devices configured to use object

  network request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass
  access control list (ACL) rules on the device, bypass security protections, and send network
  traffic to unauthorized hosts.
