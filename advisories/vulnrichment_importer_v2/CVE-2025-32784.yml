aliases: []
summary: conda-forge-webservices is the web app deployed to run conda-forge admin commands and
  linting. In versions prior to 2025.4.10, a race condition vulnerability has been identified
  in the conda-forge-webservices component used within the shared build infrastructure. This
  vulnerability, categorized as a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) issue, can be exploited
  to introduce unauthorized modifications to build artifacts stored in the cf-staging Anaconda
  channel. Exploitation may result in the unauthorized publication of malicious artifacts to
  the production conda-forge channel. The core vulnerability results from the absence of atomicity
  between the hash validation and the artifact copy operation. This gap allows an attacker,
  with access to the cf-staging token, to overwrite the validated artifact with a malicious
  version immediately after hash verification, but before the copy action is executed. As the
  cf-staging channel permits artifact overwrites, such an operation can be carried out using
  the anaconda upload --force command. This vulnerability is fixed in 2025.4.10.
