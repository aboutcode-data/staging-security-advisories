aliases: []
summary: Gogs is an open source self-hosted Git service. In versions 0.13.4 and below, the DeleteComment
  API does not verify that the comment belongs to the repository specified in the URL. This
  allows a repository administrator to delete comments from any other repository by supplying
  arbitrary comment IDs, bypassing authorization controls. The DeleteComment function retrieves
  a comment by ID without verifying repository ownership and the Database function DeleteCommentByID
  performs no repository validation. This issue has been fixed in version 0.14.0.
