aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the access control logic of the Secure Shell (SSH) server of Cisco
  IOS and IOS XE Software may allow connections sourced from a virtual routing and forwarding
  (VRF) instance despite the absence of the vrf-also keyword in the access-class configuration.
  The vulnerability is due to a missing check in the SSH server. An attacker could use this
  vulnerability to open an SSH connection to an affected Cisco IOS or IOS XE device with a source
  address belonging to a VRF instance. Once connected, the attacker would still need to provide
  valid credentials to access the device.
