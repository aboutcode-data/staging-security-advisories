aliases: []
summary: cups-filters contains backends, filters, and other software required to get the cups
  printing service working on operating systems other than macos. In versions 2.0.1 and prior,
  a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in the rastertopclx filter causes the program to crash
  with a segmentation fault when processing maliciously crafted input data. This issue can be
  exploited to trigger memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. This
  issue has been patched via commit 956283c.
