aliases: []
summary: AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create, deploy, and manage continuous artificial
  intelligence agents that automate complex workflows. Prior to autogpt-platform-beta-v0.6.32,
  there is a DoS vulnerability in ReadRSSFeedBlock. In RSSBlock, feedparser.parser is called
  to obtain the XML file according to the URL input by the user, parse the XML, and finally
  obtain the parsed result. However, during the parsing process, there is no limit on the parsing
  time and the resources that can be allocated for parsing. When a malicious user lets RSSBlock
  parse a carefully constructed, deep XML, it will cause memory resources to be exhausted, eventually
  causing DoS. This issue has been patched in autogpt-platform-beta-v0.6.32.
