aliases: []
summary: Pay is a payments engine for Ruby on Rails 6.0 and higher. In versions prior to 6.3.2
  a payments info page of Pay is susceptible to reflected Cross-site scripting. An attacker
  could create a working URL that renders a javascript link to a user on a Rails application
  that integrates Pay. This URL could be distributed via email to specifically target certain
  individuals. If the targeted application contains a functionality to submit user-generated
  content (such as comments) the attacker could even distribute the URL using that functionality.
  This has been patched in version 6.3.2 and above. Users are advised to upgrade. There are
  no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
