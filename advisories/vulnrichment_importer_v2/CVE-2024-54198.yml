aliases: []
summary: In certain conditions, SAP NetWeaver Application Server ABAP allows an authenticated
  attacker to craft a Remote Function Call (RFC) request to restricted destinations, which can
  be used to expose credentials for a remote service. These credentials can then be further
  exploited to completely compromise the remote service, potentially resulting in a significant
  impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application.
