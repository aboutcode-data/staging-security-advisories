aliases: []
summary: The JobBoardWP WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to
  insufficient input validation and sanitization via several parameters found in the ~/includes/admin/class-metabox.php
  file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts,
  in versions up to and including 1.0.7. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html
  is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled.
