aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in IP ingress packet processing of the Cisco Embedded Wireless Controller
  with Catalyst Access Points Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause
  the device to reload unexpectedly, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition. The device
  may experience a performance degradation in traffic processing or high CPU usage prior to
  the unexpected reload. This vulnerability is due to improper rate limiting of IP packets to
  the management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a steady
  stream of IP traffic at a high rate to the management interface of the affected device. A
  successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload.
