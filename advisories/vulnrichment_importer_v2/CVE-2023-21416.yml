summary: Sandro Poppi, member of the AXIS OS Bug Bounty Program, has found that the VAPIX API
  dynamicoverlay.cgi was vulnerable to a Denial-of-Service attack allowing for an attacker to
  block access to the overlay configuration page in the web interface of the Axis device. This
  flaw can only be exploited after authenticating with an operator- or administrator-privileged
  service account however the impact is equal. Axis has released patched AXIS OS versions for
  the highlighted flaw. Please refer to the Axis security advisory for more information and
