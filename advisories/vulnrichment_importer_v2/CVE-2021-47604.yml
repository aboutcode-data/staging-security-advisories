summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  vduse: check that offset is within bounds in get_config()

  This condition checks "len" but it does not check "offset" and that
  could result in an out of bounds read if "offset > dev->config_size".
  The problem is that since both variables are unsigned the
  "dev->config_size - offset" subtraction would result in a very high
  unsigned value.

  I think these checks might not be necessary because "len" and "offset"
  are supposed to already have been validated using the
  vhost_vdpa_config_validate() function.  But I do not know the code
  perfectly, and I like to be safe.
