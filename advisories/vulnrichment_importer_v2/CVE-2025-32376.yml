summary: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to versions 3.4.3 on the stable
  branch and 3.5.0.beta3 on the beta branch, the users limit for a DM can be bypassed, thus
  giving the ability to potentially create a DM with every user from a site in it. This issue
  has been patched in stable version 3.4.3 and beta version 3.5.0.beta3.
