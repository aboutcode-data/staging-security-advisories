aliases: []
summary: The TheGem theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing
  file type validation in the thegem_get_logo_url() function in all versions up to, and including,

  above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code
  execution possible.
