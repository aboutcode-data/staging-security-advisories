  net: mediatek: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in dummy net_device handling

  Move the freeing of the dummy net_device from mtk_free_dev() to
  mtk_remove().

  Previously, if alloc_netdev_dummy() failed in mtk_probe(),
  eth->dummy_dev would be NULL. The error path would then call
  mtk_free_dev(), which in turn called free_netdev() assuming dummy_dev
  was allocated (but it was not), potentially causing a NULL pointer
  dereference.

  By moving free_netdev() to mtk_remove(), we ensure it's only called when
  mtk_probe() has succeeded and dummy_dev is fully allocated. This
  addresses a potential NULL pointer dereference detected by Smatch[1].
