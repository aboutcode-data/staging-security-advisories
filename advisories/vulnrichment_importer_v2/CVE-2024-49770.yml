aliases: []
summary: '`oak` is a middleware framework for Deno''s native HTTP server, Deno Deploy, Node.js
  16.5 and later, Cloudflare Workers and Bun. By default `oak` does not allow transferring of
  hidden files with `Context.send` API. However, prior to version 17.1.3, this can be bypassed
  by encoding `/` as its URL encoded form `%2F`. For an attacker this has potential to read
  sensitive user data or to gain access to server secrets. Version 17.1.3 fixes the issue.'
