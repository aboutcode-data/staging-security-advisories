summary: "A vulnerability has been identified in Node.js, specifically affecting the handling\
  \ of drive names in the Windows environment. Certain Node.js functions do not treat drive\
  \ names as special on Windows. As a result, although Node.js assumes a relative path, it actually\
  \ refers to the root directory.\r\n\r\nOn Windows, a path that does not start with the file\
  \ separator is treated as relative to the current directory. \r\n\r\nThis vulnerability affects\
  \ Windows users of `path.join` API."
