aliases: []
summary: Omni-notes is an open source note-taking application for Android. The Omni-notes Android
  app had an insufficient path validation vulnerability when displaying the details of a note
  received through an externally-provided intent. The paths of the note's attachments were not
  properly validated, allowing malicious or compromised applications in the same device to force
  Omni-notes to copy files from its internal storage to its external storage directory, where
  they would have become accessible to any component with permission to read the external storage.
  Updating to the newest version (6.2.7) of Omni-notes Android fixes this vulnerability.
