aliases: []
summary: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Chaindesk thru 2025-05-26 in its
  agent chat component. An attacker can achieve arbitrary client-side script execution by crafting
  an AI agent whose system prompt instructs the underlying Large Language Model (LLM) to embed
  malicious script payloads (e.g., SVG-based XSS) into its chat responses. When a user interacts
  with such a malicious agent or accesses a direct link to a conversation containing an XSS
  payload, the script executes in the user's browser. Successful exploitation can lead to the
  theft of sensitive information, such as JWT session tokens, potentially resulting in account
  hijacking.
