summary: SysmonElixir is a system monitor HTTP service in Elixir. Prior to version 1.0.1, the
  /read endpoint reads any file from the server's /etc/passwd by default. In v1.0.1, a whitelist
  was added that limits reading to only files under priv/data. This issue has been patched in
  version 1.0.1.
