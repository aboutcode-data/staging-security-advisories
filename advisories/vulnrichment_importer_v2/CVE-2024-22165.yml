summary: In Splunk Enterprise Security (ES) versions lower than 7.1.2, an attacker can create
  a malformed Investigation to perform a denial of service (DoS). The malformed investigation
  prevents the generation and rendering of the Investigations manager until it is deleted.<br>The
  vulnerability requires an authenticated session and access to create an Investigation. It
  only affects the availability of the Investigations manager, but without the manager, the
  Investigations functionality becomes unusable for most users.
