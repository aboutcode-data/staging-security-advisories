aliases: []
summary: |
  In Docker Desktop before v4.29.0, an attacker who has gained access to the Docker Desktop VM through a container breakout can further escape to the host by passing extensions and dashboard related IPC messages.

  Docker Desktop  v4.29.0 https://docs.docker.com/desktop/release-notes/#4290  fixes the issue on MacOS, Linux and Windows with Hyper-V backend.

  As exploitation requires "Allow only extensions distributed through the Docker Marketplace" to be disabled, Docker Desktop  v4.31.0 https://docs.docker.com/desktop/release-notes/#4310  additionally changes the default configuration to enable this setting by default.
