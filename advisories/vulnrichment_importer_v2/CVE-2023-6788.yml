aliases: []
summary: The Metform Elementor Contact Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.1. This is due to missing or incorrect
  nonce validation on the contents function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to update the options "mf_hubsopt_token", "mf_hubsopt_refresh_token", "mf_hubsopt_token_type",
  and "mf_hubsopt_expires_in" via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This would allow an attacker to connect
  their own Hubspot account to a victim site's metform to obtain leads and contacts.
