aliases: []
summary: Action Pack is a framework for handling and responding to web requests. Starting in
  version 3.1.0 and prior to versions 6.1.7.9, 7.0.8.5, 7.1.4.1, and 7.2.1.1, there is a possible
  ReDoS vulnerability in the query parameter filtering routines of Action Dispatch. Carefully
  crafted query parameters can cause query parameter filtering to take an unexpected amount
  of time, possibly resulting in a DoS vulnerability. All users running an affected release
  should either upgrade to version 6.1.7.9, 7.0.8.5, 7.1.4.1, or 7.2.1.1 or apply the relevant
  patch immediately. One may use Ruby 3.2 as a workaround. Ruby 3.2 has mitigations for this
  problem, so Rails applications using Ruby 3.2 or newer are unaffected. Rails 8.0.0.beta1 depends
  on Ruby 3.2 or greater so is unaffected.
