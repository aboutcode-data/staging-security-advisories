aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) subsystem of Cisco IOS Software
  and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to corrupt the
  internal VTP database on an affected device and cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.
  The vulnerability is due to a logic error in how the affected software handles a subset of
  VTP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending VTP packets in a sequence
  that triggers a timeout in the VTP message processing code of the affected software. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to impact the ability to create, modify, or delete VLANs
  and cause a DoS condition. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability. This vulnerability
  affects Cisco devices that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS Software or Cisco
  IOS XE Software, are operating in VTP client mode or VTP server mode, and do not have a VTP
  domain name configured. The default configuration for Cisco devices that are running Cisco
  IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software and support VTP is to operate in VTP server mode with
  no domain name configured.
