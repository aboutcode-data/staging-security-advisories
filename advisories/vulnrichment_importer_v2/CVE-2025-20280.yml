aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Evolved Programmable\
  \ Network Manager (EPNM) and Cisco Prime Infrastructure could allow an authenticated, remote\
  \ attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against users of the interface\
  \ of an affected system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the web-based management\
  \ interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this\
  \ vulnerability by inserting malicious code into specific data fields in the interface. A\
  \ successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context\
  \ of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this\
  \ vulnerability, an attacker must have valid administrative credentials."
