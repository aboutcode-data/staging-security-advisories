summary: The Read More & Accordion plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce
  validation on the addNewButtons() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to include and execute arbitrary PHP files via a forged request granted they can trick a site
  administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
