aliases: []
summary: Electron is an open source framework for writing cross-platform desktop applications
  using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. From versions 30.0.0-alpha.1 to before 30.0.5 and 31.0.0-alpha.1
  to before 31.0.0-beta.1, Electron is vulnerable to an ASAR Integrity bypass. This only impacts
  apps that have the embeddedAsarIntegrityValidation and onlyLoadAppFromAsar fuses enabled.
  Apps without these fuses enabled are not impacted. This issue is specific to Windows, apps
  using these fuses on macOS are not impacted. Specifically this issue can only be exploited
  if the app is launched from a filesystem the attacker has write access too. i.e. the ability
  to edit files inside the .app bundle on macOS which these fuses are supposed to protect against.
  This issue has been patched in versions 30.0.5 and 31.0.0-beta.1. There are no workarounds
  for this issue.
