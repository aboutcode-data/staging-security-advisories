aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for Windows and Cisco
  Webex Player for Windows could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected
  system. The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of certain elements of a Webex
  recording that is stored in the Advanced Recording Format (ARF) or Webex Recording Format
  (WRF). An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a user a malicious ARF or
  WRF file through a link or email attachment and persuading the user to open the file with
  the affected software on the local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
  execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the targeted user.
