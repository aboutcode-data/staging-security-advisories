aliases: []
summary: The tagDiv Composer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  via the ‘envato_code[]’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 5.0 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping within the on_ajax_register_forum_user function. This
  makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that
  execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on
  a link.
