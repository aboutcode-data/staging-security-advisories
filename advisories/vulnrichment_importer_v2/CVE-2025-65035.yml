aliases: []
summary: pluginsGLPI's Database Inventory Plugin "manages" the Teclib' inventory agents in order
  to perform an inventory of the databases present on the workstation. Prior to version 1.1.2,
  in certain conditions (database write access must first be obtained through another vulnerability
  or misconfiguration), user-controlled data is stored insecurely in the database via computergroup,
  and is later unserialized on every page load, allowing arbitrary PHP object instantiation.
  Version 1.1.2 fixes the issue.
