  drivers: staging: rtl8192eu: Fix deadlock in rtw_joinbss_event_prehandle

  There is a deadlock in rtw_joinbss_event_prehandle(), which is shown below:

     (Thread 1)                |      (Thread 2)
                               | _set_timer()
  rtw_joinbss_event_prehandle()|  mod_timer()
   spin_lock_bh() //(1)        |  (wait a time)
   ...                         | rtw_join_timeout_handler()
                               |  _rtw_join_timeout_handler()
   del_timer_sync()            |   spin_lock_bh() //(2)
   (wait timer to stop)        |   ...

  We hold pmlmepriv->lock in position (1) of thread 1 and
  use del_timer_sync() to wait timer to stop, but timer handler
  also need pmlmepriv->lock in position (2) of thread 2.
  As a result, rtw_joinbss_event_prehandle() will block forever.

  This patch extracts del_timer_sync() from the protection of
  spin_lock_bh(), which could let timer handler to obtain
  the needed lock. What`s more, we change spin_lock_bh() to
  spin_lock_irq() in _rtw_join_timeout_handler() in order to
  prevent deadlock.
