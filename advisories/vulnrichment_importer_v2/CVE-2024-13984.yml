aliases: []
summary: QiAnXin TianQing Management Center versions up to and including 6.7.0.4130 contain
  a path traversal vulnerability in the rptsvr component that allows unauthenticated attackers
  to upload files to arbitrary locations on the server. The /rptsvr/upload endpoint fails to
  sanitize the filename parameter in multipart form-data requests, enabling path traversal.
  This allows attackers to place executable files in web-accessible directories, potentially
  leading to remote code execution. Exploitation evidence was first observed by the Shadowserver
  Foundation on 2024-08-23 UTC.
