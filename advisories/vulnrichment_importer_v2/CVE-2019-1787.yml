aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Portable Document Format (PDF) scanning functionality of Clam
  AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.101.1 and prior could allow an unauthenticated, remote
  attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability
  is due to a lack of proper data handling mechanisms within the device buffer while indexing
  remaining file data on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
  sending crafted PDF files to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to cause a heap buffer out-of-bounds read condition, resulting in a crash that could result
  in a denial of service condition on an affected device.
