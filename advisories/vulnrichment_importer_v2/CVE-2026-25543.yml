aliases: []
summary: HtmlSanitizer is a .NET library for cleaning HTML fragments and documents from constructs
  that can lead to XSS attacks. Prior to versions 9.0.892 and 9.1.893-beta, if the template
  tag is allowed, its contents are not sanitized. The template tag is a special tag that does
  not usually render its contents, unless the shadowrootmode attribute is set to open or closed.
  This issue has been patched in versions 9.0.892 and 9.1.893-beta.
