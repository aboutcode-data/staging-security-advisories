aliases: []
summary: Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of
  data privacy requests in a runtime environment, and the enforcement of privacy regulations
  in code. The Fides webserver API allows users to retrieve its configuration using the `GET
  api/v1/config` endpoint. The configuration data is filtered to suppress most sensitive configuration
  information before it is returned to the user, but even the filtered data contains information
  about the internals and the backend infrastructure, such as various settings, servers’ addresses
  and ports and database username. This information is useful for administrative users as well
  as attackers, thus it should not be revealed to low-privileged users. This vulnerability allows
  Admin UI users with roles lower than the owner role e.g. the viewer role to retrieve the config
  information using the API. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.22.1`.
