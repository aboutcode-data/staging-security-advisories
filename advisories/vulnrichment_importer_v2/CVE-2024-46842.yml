  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  scsi: lpfc: Handle mailbox timeouts in lpfc_get_sfp_info

  The MBX_TIMEOUT return code is not handled in lpfc_get_sfp_info and the
  routine unconditionally frees submitted mailbox commands regardless of
  return status.  The issue is that for MBX_TIMEOUT cases, when firmware
  returns SFP information at a later time, that same mailbox memory region
  references previously freed memory in its cmpl routine.

  Fix by adding checks for the MBX_TIMEOUT return code.  During mailbox
  resource cleanup, check the mbox flag to make sure that the wait did not
  timeout.  If the MBOX_WAKE flag is not set, then do not free the resources
  because it will be freed when firmware completes the mailbox at a later
  time in its cmpl routine.

  Also, increase the timeout from 30 to 60 seconds to accommodate boot
  scripts requiring longer timeouts.
