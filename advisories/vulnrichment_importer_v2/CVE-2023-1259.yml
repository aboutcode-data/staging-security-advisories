aliases: []
summary: The Hotjar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the
  hotjar_site_id in versions up to, and including, 1.0.15 due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level
  permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
  a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations
  where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
