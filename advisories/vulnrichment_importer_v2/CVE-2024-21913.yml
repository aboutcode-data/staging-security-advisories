summary: A heap-based memory buffer overflow vulnerability in Rockwell Automation Arena Simulation
  software could potentially allow a malicious user to insert unauthorized code into the software
  by overstepping the memory boundaries, which triggers an access violation.  Once inside, the

  and availability of the product. To trigger this, the user would unwittingly need to open
  a malicious file shared by the threat actor.
