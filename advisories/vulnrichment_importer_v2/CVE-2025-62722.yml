aliases: []
summary: LinkAce is a self-hosted archive to collect website links. In versions 2.3.1 and below,
  the social media sharing functionality contains a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
  that allows any authenticated user to inject arbitrary JavaScript by creating a link with
  malicious HTML in the title field. When a user views the link details page and the shareable
  links are rendered, the malicious JavaScript executes in their browser. This vulnerability
  affects multiple sharing services and can be exploited to steal session cookies, perform actions
  on behalf of users, or deliver malware. This issue is fixed in version 2.4.0.
