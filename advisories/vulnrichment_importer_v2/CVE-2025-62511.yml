aliases: []
summary: yt-grabber-tui is a C++ terminal user interface application for downloading YouTube
  content. yt-grabber-tui version 1.0 contains a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race
  condition (CWE-367) in the creation of the default configuration file config.json. In version
  1.0, load_json_settings in Settings.hpp checks for the existence of config.json using boost::filesystem::exists
  and, if the file is missing, calls create_json_settings which writes the JSON configuration
  with boost::property_tree::write_json. A local attacker with write access to the application’s
  configuration directory (~/.config/yt-grabber-tui on Linux or the current working directory
  on Windows) can create a symbolic link between the existence check and the subsequent write
  so that the write operation follows the symlink and overwrites an attacker-chosen file accessible
  to the running process. This enables arbitrary file overwrite within the privileges of the
  application process, which can corrupt files and cause loss of application or user data. If
  the application is executed with elevated privileges, this could extend to system file corruption.
  The issue is fixed in version 1.0.1.
