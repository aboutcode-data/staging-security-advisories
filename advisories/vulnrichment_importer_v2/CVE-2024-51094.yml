aliases: []
summary: An issue in Snipe-IT v.7.0.13 build 15514 allows a low-privileged attacker to modify
  their profile name and inject a malicious payload into the "Name" field. When an administrator
  later accesses the People Management page, exports the data as a CSV file, and opens it, the
  injected payload will be executed, allowing the attacker to exfiltrate internal system data
  from the CSV file to a remote server.
