aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services
  Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative credentials
  to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface. These vulnerabilities
  are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input that is processed by the web-based
  management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by injecting malicious
  code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
  execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based
  information. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need valid administrative
  credentials.
