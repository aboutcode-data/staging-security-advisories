aliases: []
summary: crossplane-runtime is a set of go libraries used to build Kubernetes controllers in
  Crossplane and its related stacks. An out of memory panic vulnerability has been discovered
  in affected versions. Applications that use the `Paved` type's `SetValue` method with user
  provided input without proper validation might use excessive amounts of memory and cause an
  out of memory panic. In the fieldpath package, the Paved.SetValue method sets a value on the
  Paved object according to the provided path, without any validation. This allows setting values
  in slices at any provided index, which grows the target array up to the requested index, the
  index is currently capped at max uint32 (4294967295) given how indexes are parsed,  but that
  is still an unnecessarily large value. If callers are not validating paths' indexes on their
  own, which most probably are not going to do, given that the input is parsed directly in the
  SetValue method, this could allow users to consume arbitrary amounts of memory. Applications
  that do not use the `Paved` type's `SetValue` method are not affected. This issue has been
  addressed in versions 0.16.1 and 0.19.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade
  can parse and validate the path before passing it to the `SetValue` method of the `Paved`
  type, constraining the index size as deemed appropriate.
