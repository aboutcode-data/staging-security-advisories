summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  bluetooth/hci: disallow setting handle bigger than HCI_CONN_HANDLE_MAX

  Syzbot hit warning in hci_conn_del() caused by freeing handle that was
  not allocated using ida allocator.

  This is caused by handle bigger than HCI_CONN_HANDLE_MAX passed by
  hci_le_big_sync_established_evt(), which makes code think it's unset
  connection.

  Add same check for handle upper bound as in hci_conn_set_handle() to
  prevent warning.
