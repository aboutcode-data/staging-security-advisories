  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drivers/perf: hisi: hns3: Fix out-of-bound access when valid event group

  The perf tool allows users to create event groups through following
  cmd [1], but the driver does not check whether the array index is out
  of bounds when writing data to the event_group array. If the number of
  events in an event_group is greater than HNS3_PMU_MAX_HW_EVENTS, the
  memory write overflow of event_group array occurs.

  Add array index check to fix the possible array out of bounds violation,
  and return directly when write new events are written to array bounds.

  There are 9 different events in an event_group.
  [1] perf stat -e '{pmu/event1/, ... ,pmu/event9/}
