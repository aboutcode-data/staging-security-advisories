aliases: []
summary: The Online Examination System Project 1.0 version is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery (CSRF) attacks. An attacker can craft a malicious link that, when clicked by an admin
  user, will delete a user account from the database without the admin's consent. The email
  of the user to be deleted is passed as a parameter in the URL, which can be manipulated by
  the attacker. This could result in a loss of data.
