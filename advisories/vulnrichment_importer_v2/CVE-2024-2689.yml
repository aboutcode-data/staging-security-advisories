aliases: []
summary: Denial of Service in Temporal Server prior to version 1.20.5, 1.21.6, and 1.22.7 allows
  an authenticated user who has permissions to interact with workflows and has crafted an invalid
  UTF-8 string for submission to potentially cause a crashloop. If left unchecked, the task
  containing the invalid UTF-8 will become stuck in the queue, causing an increase in queue
  lag. Eventually, all processes handling these queues will become stuck and the system will
  run out of resources. The workflow ID of the failing task will be visible in the logs, and
  can be used to remove that workflow as a mitigation. Version 1.23 is not impacted. In this
  context, a user is an operator of Temporal Server.
