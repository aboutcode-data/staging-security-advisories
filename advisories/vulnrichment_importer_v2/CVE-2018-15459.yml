summary: A vulnerability in the administrative web interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine
  (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain additional privileges on an affected
  device. The vulnerability is due to improper controls on certain pages in the web interface.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device with an administrator
  account and sending a crafted HTTP request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to create additional Admin accounts with different user roles. An attacker could then use
  these accounts to perform actions within their scope. The attacker would need valid Admin
  credentials for the device. This vulnerability cannot be exploited to add a Super Admin account.
