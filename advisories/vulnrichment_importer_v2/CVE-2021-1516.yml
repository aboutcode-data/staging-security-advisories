aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco AsyncOS Software for
  Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA), Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA), and
  Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access
  sensitive information on an affected device. The vulnerability exists because confidential
  information is included in HTTP requests that are exchanged between the user and the device.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by looking at the raw HTTP requests that are
  sent to the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain some of the
  passwords that are configured throughout the interface.
