summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV320
  and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with
  administrative privileges on an affected device to execute arbitrary commands. The vulnerability
  is due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
