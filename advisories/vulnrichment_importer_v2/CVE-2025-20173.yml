summary: "A vulnerability in the SNMP subsystem of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software\
  \ could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition on an affected device.\r\
  \n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper error handling when parsing SNMP requests. An\
  \ attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP request to an affected\
  \ device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload unexpectedly,\
  \ resulting in a DoS condition.&nbsp;\r\nThis vulnerability affects SNMP versions 1, 2c, and\
  \ 3. To exploit this vulnerability through SNMP v2c or earlier, the attacker must know a valid\
  \ read-write or read-only SNMP community string for the affected system. To exploit this vulnerability\
  \ through SNMP v3, the attacker must have valid SNMP user credentials for the affected system."
