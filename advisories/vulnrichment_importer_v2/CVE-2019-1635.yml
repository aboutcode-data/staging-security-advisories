summary: A vulnerability in the call-handling functionality of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
  Software for Cisco IP Phone 7800 Series and 8800 Series could allow an unauthenticated, remote
  attacker to cause an affected phone to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a temporary denial
  of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incomplete error handling when XML
  data within a SIP packet is parsed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
  a SIP packet that contains a malicious XML payload to an affected phone. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to cause the affected phone to reload unexpectedly, resulting in
  a temporary DoS condition.
