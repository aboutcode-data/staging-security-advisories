aliases: []
summary: OpenSearch Data Prepper is a component of the OpenSearch project that accepts, filters,
  transforms, enriches, and routes data at scale. A vulnerability exists in the OpenTelemetry
  Logs source in Data Prepper starting inversion 2.1.0 and prior to version 2.10.2 where some
  custom authentication plugins will not perform authentication. This allows unauthorized users
  to ingest OpenTelemetry Logs data under certain conditions. This vulnerability does not affect
  the built-in `http_basic` authentication provider in Data Prepper. Pipelines which use the
  `http_basic` authentication provider continue to require authentication. The vulnerability
  exists only for custom implementations of Data Prepper’s `GrpcAuthenticationProvider` authentication
  plugin which implement the `getHttpAuthenticationService()` method instead of `getAuthenticationInterceptor()`.
  Data Prepper 2.10.2 contains a fix for this issue. For those unable to upgrade, one may use
  the built-in `http_basic` authentication provider in Data Prepper and/or add an authentication
  proxy in front of one's Data Prepper instances running the OpenTelemetry Logs source.
