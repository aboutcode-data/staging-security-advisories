summary: The Import any XML or CSV File to WordPress plugin before 3.7.3 accepts all zip files
  and automatically extracts the zip file into a publicly accessible directory without sufficiently
  validating the extracted file type. This may allows high privilege users such as administrator
  to upload an executable file type leading to remote code execution.
