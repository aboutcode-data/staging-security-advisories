aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate validation functionality
  of Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) Mode Switch Software could
  allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform insecure TLS client authentication on
  an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient TLS client certificate validations
  for certificates sent between the various components of an ACI fabric. An attacker who has
  possession of a certificate that is trusted by the Cisco Manufacturing CA and the corresponding
  private key could exploit this vulnerability by presenting a valid certificate while attempting
  to connect to the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain full control
  of all other components within the ACI fabric of an affected device.
