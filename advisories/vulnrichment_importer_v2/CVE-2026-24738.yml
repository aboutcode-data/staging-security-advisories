aliases: []
summary: gmrtd is a Go library for reading Machine Readable Travel Documents (MRTDs). Prior
  to version 0.17.2, ReadFile accepts TLVs with lengths that can range up to 4GB, which can
  cause unconstrained resource consumption in both memory and cpu cycles. ReadFile can consume
  an extended TLV with lengths well outside what would be available in ICs. It can accept something
  all the way up to 4GB which would take too many iterations in 256 byte chunks, and would also
  try to allocate memory that might not be available in constrained environments like phones.
  Or if an API sends data  to ReadFile, the same problem applies. The very small chunked read
  also locks the goroutine in  accepting data for a very large number of iterations.  projects
  using the gmrtd library to read files from NFCs can experience extreme slowdowns or memory
  consumption. A malicious NFC can just behave like the mock transceiver described above and
  by just sending dummy bytes as each chunk to be read, can make the receiving thread unresponsive
  and fill up memory on the host system. Version 0.17.2 patches the issue.
