aliases: []
summary: A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in the lightning-ai/pytorch-lightning
  library version 2.2.1 due to improper handling of deserialized user input and mismanagement
  of dunder attributes by the `deepdiff` library. The library uses `deepdiff.Delta` objects
  to modify application state based on frontend actions. However, it is possible to bypass the
  intended restrictions on modifying dunder attributes, allowing an attacker to construct a
  serialized delta that passes the deserializer whitelist and contains dunder attributes. When
  processed, this can be exploited to access other modules, classes, and instances, leading
  to arbitrary attribute write and total RCE on any self-hosted pytorch-lightning application
  in its default configuration, as the delta endpoint is enabled by default.
