summary: The PostGallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to
  incorrect file type validation in the 'PostGalleryUploader' class functions in all versions

  and above permissions, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make
  remote code execution possible.
