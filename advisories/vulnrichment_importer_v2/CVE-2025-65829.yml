aliases: []
summary: The ESP32 system on a chip (SoC) that powers the Meatmeet basestation device was found
  to lack Secure Boot. The Secure Boot feature ensures that only authenticated software can
  execute on the device. The Secure Boot process forms a chain of trust by verifying all mutable
  software entities involved in the Application Startup Flow. As a result, an attacker with
  physical access to the device can flash modified firmware to the device, resulting in the
  execution of malicious code upon startup.
