aliases: []
summary: Aircompressor is a library with ports of the Snappy, LZO, LZ4, and Zstandard compression
  algorithms to Java. In versions 3.3 and below, incorrect handling of malformed data in Java-based
  decompressor implementations for Snappy and LZ4 allow remote attackers to read previous buffer
  contents via crafted compressed input. With certain crafted compressed inputs, elements from
  the output buffer can end up in the uncompressed output, potentially leaking sensitive data.
  This is relevant for applications that reuse the same output buffer to uncompress multiple
  inputs. This can be the case of a web server that allocates a fix-sized buffer for performance
  purposes. There is similar vulnerability in GHSA-cmp6-m4wj-q63q. This issue is fixed in version
  3.4.
