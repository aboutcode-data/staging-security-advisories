aliases: []
summary: Flag Forge is a Capture The Flag (CTF) platform. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior
  to version 2.3.2, the `/api/admin/badge-templates` (GET) and `/api/admin/badge-templates/create`
  (POST) endpoints previously allowed access without authentication or authorization. This could
  have enabled unauthorized users to retrieve all badge templates and sensitive metadata (createdBy,
  createdAt, updatedAt) and/or create arbitrary badge templates in the database. This could
  lead to data exposure, database pollution, or abuse of the badge system. The issue has been
  fixed in FlagForge v2.3.2. GET, POST, UPDATE, and DELETE endpoints now require authentication.
  Authorization checks ensure only admins can access and modify badge templates. No reliable
  workarounds are available.
