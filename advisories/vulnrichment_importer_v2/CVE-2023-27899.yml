aliases: []
summary: Jenkins 2.393 and earlier, LTS 2.375.3 and earlier creates a temporary file in the
  default temporary directory with the default permissions for newly created files when uploading
  a plugin for installation, potentially allowing attackers with access to the Jenkins controller
  file system to read and write the file before it is used, potentially resulting in arbitrary
  code execution.
