  selinux: fix NULL-pointer dereference when hashtab allocation fails

  When the hash table slot array allocation fails in hashtab_init(),
  h->size is left initialized with a non-zero value, but the h->htable
  pointer is NULL. This may then cause a NULL pointer dereference, since
  the policydb code relies on the assumption that even after a failed
  hashtab_init(), hashtab_map() and hashtab_destroy() can be safely called
  on it. Yet, these detect an empty hashtab only by looking at the size.

  Fix this by making sure that hashtab_init() always leaves behind a valid
  empty hashtab when the allocation fails.
