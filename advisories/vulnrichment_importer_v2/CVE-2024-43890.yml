  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  tracing: Fix overflow in get_free_elt()

  "tracing_map->next_elt" in get_free_elt() is at risk of overflowing.

  Once it overflows, new elements can still be inserted into the tracing_map
  even though the maximum number of elements (`max_elts`) has been reached.
  Continuing to insert elements after the overflow could result in the
  tracing_map containing "tracing_map->max_size" elements, leaving no empty
  entries.
  If any attempt is made to insert an element into a full tracing_map using
  `__tracing_map_insert()`, it will cause an infinite loop with preemption
  disabled, leading to a CPU hang problem.

  Fix this by preventing any further increments to "tracing_map->next_elt"
  once it reaches "tracing_map->max_elt".
