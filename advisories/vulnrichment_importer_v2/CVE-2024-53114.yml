  x86/CPU/AMD: Clear virtualized VMLOAD/VMSAVE on Zen4 client

  A number of Zen4 client SoCs advertise the ability to use virtualized
  VMLOAD/VMSAVE, but using these instructions is reported to be a cause
  of a random host reboot.

  These instructions aren't intended to be advertised on Zen4 client
  so clear the capability.
