aliases: []
summary: OpenSift is an AI study tool that sifts through large datasets using semantic search
  and generative AI. Versions 1.1.2-alpha and below render untrusted user/model content in chat
  tool UI surfaces using unsafe HTML interpolation patterns, leading to XSS. Stored content
  can execute JavaScript when later viewed in authenticated sessions. An attacker who can influence
  stored study/quiz/flashcard content could trigger script execution in a victim’s browser,
  potentially performing actions as that user in the local app session. This issue has been
  fixed in version 1.1.3-alpha.
