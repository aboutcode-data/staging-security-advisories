summary: "** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Improper Neutralization of Expression/Command Delimiters\
  \ vulnerability in Apache Commons OGNL.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Commons OGNL: all versions.\n\
  \n\n\nWhen using the API Ognl.getValue​, the OGNL engine parses and evaluates the provided\
  \ expression with powerful capabilities, including accessing and invoking related methods,\n\
  \ etc. Although OgnlRuntime attempts to restrict certain dangerous classes and methods (such\
  \ as java.lang.Runtime) through a blocklist, these restrictions are not comprehensive. \n\
  Attackers may be able to bypass the restrictions by leveraging class objects that are not\
  \ covered by the blocklist and potentially achieve arbitrary code execution.\n\nAs this project\
  \ is retired, we do not plan to release a version that fixes this issue. Users are recommended\
  \ to find an alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users.\n\n\nNOTE: This\
  \ vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer."
