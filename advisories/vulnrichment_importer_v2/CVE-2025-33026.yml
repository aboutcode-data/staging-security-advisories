aliases: []
summary: 'In PeaZip through 10.4.0, there is a Mark-of-the-Web Bypass Vulnerability. This vulnerability
  allows attackers to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web protection mechanism on affected installations
  of PeaZip. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must
  visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling
  of archived files. When extracting files from a crafted archive that bears the Mark-of-the-Web,
  PeaZip does not propagate the Mark-of-the-Web to the extracted files. An attacker can leverage
  this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. NOTE: this
  is disputed because Mark-of-the-Web propagation can increase risk via security-warning habituation,
  and because the intended control sphere for file-origin metadata (e.g., HostUrl in Zone.Identifier)
  may be narrower than that for reading the file''s content.'
