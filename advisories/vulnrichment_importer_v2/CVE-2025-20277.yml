summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified CCX could allow\
  \ an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device. To exploit\
  \ this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials.\r\n\r\nThis\
  \ vulnerability is due to improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory (path\
  \ traversal). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted web request\
  \ to an affected device, followed by a specific command through an SSH session. A successful\
  \ exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system\
  \ of an affected device as a low-privilege user. A successful exploit could also allow the\
  \ attacker to undertake further actions to elevate their privileges to root."
