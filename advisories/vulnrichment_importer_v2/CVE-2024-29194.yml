aliases: []
summary: OneUptime is a solution for monitoring and managing online services. The vulnerability
  lies in the improper validation of client-side stored data within the web application. Specifically,
  the is_master_admin key, stored in the local storage of the browser, can be manipulated by
  an attacker. By changing this key from false to true, the application grants administrative
  privileges to the user, without proper server-side validation.  This has been patched in 7.0.1815.
