aliases: []
summary: The GitHub Actions ToolKit provides a set of packages to make creating actions easier.
  The `core.exportVariable` function uses a well known delimiter that attackers can use to break
  out of that specific variable and assign values to other arbitrary variables. Workflows that
  write untrusted values to the `GITHUB_ENV` file may cause the path or other environment variables
  to be modified without the intention of the workflow or action author. Users should upgrade
  to `@actions/core v1.9.1`. If you are unable to upgrade the `@actions/core` package, you can
  modify your action to ensure that any user input does not contain the delimiter `_GitHubActionsFileCommandDelimeter_`
  before calling `core.exportVariable`.
