summary: 'According to the researcher: "The TLS connections are encrypted against tampering
  or eavesdropping. However, the application does not validate the server certificate properly
  while initializing the TLS connection. This allows for a network attacker to intercept the
  connection and read the data. The attacker could the either send the client a malicious response,
  or forward the (possibly modified) data to the real server."'
