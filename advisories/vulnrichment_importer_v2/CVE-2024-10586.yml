aliases: []
summary: The Debug Tool plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file creation due to
  a missing capability check on the dbt_pull_image() function and missing file type validation

  to to create arbitrary files such as .php files that can be leveraged for remote code execution.
