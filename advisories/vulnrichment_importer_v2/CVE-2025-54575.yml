aliases: []
summary: ImageSharp is a 2D graphics library. In versions below 2.1.11 and 3.0.0 through 3.1.10,
  a specially crafted GIF file containing a malformed comment extension block (with a missing
  block terminator) can cause the ImageSharp GIF decoder to enter an infinite loop while attempting
  to skip the block. This leads to a denial of service. Applications processing untrusted GIF
  input should upgrade to a patched version. This issue is fixed in versions 2.1.11 and 3.1.11.
