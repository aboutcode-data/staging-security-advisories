aliases: []
summary: The Beaver Builder Plugin (Starter Version) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
  file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'save_enabled_icons' function in all
  versions up to, and including, 2.9.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's
  server which may make remote code execution possible. The vulnerability was partially patched
  in version 2.9.1.
