  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ALSA: hda: cs35l56: Fix lifetime of cs_dsp instance

  The cs_dsp instance is initialized in the driver probe() so it
  should be freed in the driver remove(). Also fix a missing call
  to cs_dsp_remove() in the error path of cs35l56_hda_common_probe().

  The call to cs_dsp_remove() was being done in the component unbind
  callback cs35l56_hda_unbind(). This meant that if the driver was
  unbound and then re-bound it would be using an uninitialized cs_dsp
  instance.

  It is best to initialize the cs_dsp instance in probe() so that it
  can return an error if it fails. The component binding API doesn't
  have any error handling so there's no way to handle a failure if
  cs_dsp was initialized in the bind.
