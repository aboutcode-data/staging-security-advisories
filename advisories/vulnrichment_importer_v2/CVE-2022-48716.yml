  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ASoC: codecs: wcd938x: fix incorrect used of portid

  Mixer controls have the channel id in mixer->reg, which is not same
  as port id. port id should be derived from chan_info array.
  So fix this. Without this, its possible that we could corrupt
  struct wcd938x_sdw_priv by accessing port_map array out of range
  with channel id instead of port id.
