summary: melange allows users to build apk packages using declarative pipelines. From version
  0.3.0 to before 0.40.3, an attacker who can provide build input values, but not modify pipeline
  definitions, could execute arbitrary shell commands if the pipeline uses ${{vars.*}} or ${{inputs.*}}
  substitutions in working-directory. The field is embedded into shell scripts without proper
  quote escaping. This issue has been patched in version 0.40.3.
