aliases: []
summary: The FileOrganizer – Manage WordPress and Website Files plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via svg file upload in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.6
  due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
  an injected page. For the free version, this is limited to administrators. The pro version
  is also vulnerable and exploitable by administrators, but also offers the functionality to
  lower level users (as low as subscribers) if enabled.
