aliases: []
summary: LibreNMS is an open-source, PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network monitoring system. A Reflected
  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "section" parameter of the "logs" tab of a
  device allows attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript. This vulnerability results in the
  execution of malicious code when a user accesses the page with a malicious "section" parameter,
  potentially compromising their session and enabling unauthorized actions. The issue arises
  from a lack of sanitization in the "report_this()" function. This vulnerability is fixed in
  24.10.0.
