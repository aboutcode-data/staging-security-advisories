aliases: []
summary: Hugging Face Transformers versions up to 4.49.0 are affected by an improper input validation
  vulnerability in the `image_utils.py` file. The vulnerability arises from insecure URL validation
  using the `startswith()` method, which can be bypassed through URL username injection. This
  allows attackers to craft URLs that appear to be from YouTube but resolve to malicious domains,
  potentially leading to phishing attacks, malware distribution, or data exfiltration. The issue
  is fixed in version 4.52.1.
