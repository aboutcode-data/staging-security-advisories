summary: The MapPress Maps for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the plugin's Map block in all versions up to, and including, 2.94.1 due to insufficient

  for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary
  web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
