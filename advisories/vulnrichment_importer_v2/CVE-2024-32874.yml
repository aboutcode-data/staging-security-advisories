aliases: []
summary: Frigate is a network video recorder (NVR) with realtime local object detection for
  IP cameras. Below 0.13.2 Release, when uploading a file or retrieving the filename, a user
  may intentionally use a large Unicode filename which would lead to a application-level denial
  of service. This is due to no limitation set on the length of the filename and the costy use
  of the Unicode normalization with the form NFKD under the hood of `secure_filename()`.
