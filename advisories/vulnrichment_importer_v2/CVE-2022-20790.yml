aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications
  Manager (Unified CM) and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified
  CM SME) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read arbitrary files from the underlying
  operating system. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does
  not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
  sending a crafted HTTP request that contains directory traversal character sequences to an
  affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive files on
  the underlying operating system.
