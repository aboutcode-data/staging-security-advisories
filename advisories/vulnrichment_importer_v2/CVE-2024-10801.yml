aliases: []
summary: The WordPress User Extra Fields plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
  uploads due to missing file type validation in the ajax_manage_file_chunk_upload() function
  in all versions up to, and including, 16.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution
  possible. User registration must be enabled for this to be exploited.
