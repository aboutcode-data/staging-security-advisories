aliases: []
summary: A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was discovered in the
  Hugging Face Transformers library, specifically in the `get_imports()` function within `dynamic_module_utils.py`.
  This vulnerability affects versions 4.49.0 and is fixed in version 4.51.0. The issue arises
  from a regular expression pattern `\s*try\s*:.*?except.*?:` used to filter out try/except
  blocks from Python code, which can be exploited to cause excessive CPU consumption through
  crafted input strings due to catastrophic backtracking. This vulnerability can lead to remote
  code loading disruption, resource exhaustion in model serving, supply chain attack vectors,
  and development pipeline disruption.
