aliases: []
summary: Opencast is a free, open-source platform to support the management of educational audio
  and video content. Prior to Opencast 17.8 and 18.2, the paella would include and render some
  user inputs (metadata like title, description, etc.) unfiltered and unmodified. The vulnerability
  allows attackers to inject and malicious HTML and JavaScript in the player, which would then
  be executed in the browsers of users watching the prepared media. This can then be used to
  modify the site or to execute actions in the name of logged-in users. To inject malicious
  metadata, an attacker needs write access to the system. For example, the ability to upload
  media and modify metadata. This cannot be exploited by unauthenticated users. This issue is
  fixed in Opencast 17.8 and 18.2.
