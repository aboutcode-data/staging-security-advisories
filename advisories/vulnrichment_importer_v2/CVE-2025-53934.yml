summary: WeGIA is an open source web manager with a focus on the Portuguese language and charitable
  institutions. A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `control.php` endpoint
  of the WeGIA application prior to version 3.4.5. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject
  malicious scripts into the `descricao_emergencia` parameter. The injected scripts are stored
  on the server and executed automatically whenever the affected page is accessed by users,
  posing a significant security risk. Version 3.4.5 fixes the issue.
