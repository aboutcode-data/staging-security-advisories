aliases: []
summary: In uClibc and uClibc-ng before 1.0.39, incorrect handling of special characters in
  domain names returned by DNS servers via gethostbyname, getaddrinfo, gethostbyaddr, and getnameinfo
  can lead to output of wrong hostnames (leading to domain hijacking) or injection into applications
  (leading to remote code execution, XSS, applications crashes, etc.). In other words, a validation
  step, which is expected in any stub resolver, does not occur.
