aliases: []
summary: The JAY Login & Register plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation
  in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.03. This is due to the plugin allowing a user to
  update arbitrary user meta through the 'jay_panel_ajax_update_profile' function. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to elevate
  their privileges to that of an administrator.
