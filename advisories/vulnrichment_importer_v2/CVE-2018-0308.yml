aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Cisco Fabric Services component of Cisco FXOS Software and
  Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary
  code or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability exists because the affected
  software insufficiently validates header values in Cisco Fabric Services packets. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Cisco Fabric Services packet to an affected
  device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow that could
  allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a DoS condition. This vulnerability
  affects the following if configured to use Cisco Fabric Services: Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation
  Firewalls, Firepower 9300 Security Appliance, MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches, Nexus 2000
  Series Fabric Extenders, Nexus 3000 Series Switches, Nexus 3500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5500
  Platform Switches, Nexus 5600 Platform Switches, Nexus 6000 Series Switches, Nexus 7000 Series
  Switches, Nexus 7700 Series Switches, Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode,
  Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules, UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnects, UCS
  6200 Series Fabric Interconnects, UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd69954,
