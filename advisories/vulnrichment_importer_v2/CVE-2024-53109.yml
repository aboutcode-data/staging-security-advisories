  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  nommu: pass NULL argument to vma_iter_prealloc()

  When deleting a vma entry from a maple tree, it has to pass NULL to
  vma_iter_prealloc() in order to calculate internal state of the tree, but
  it passed a wrong argument.  As a result, nommu kernels crashed upon
  accessing a vma iterator, such as acct_collect() reading the size of vma
  entries after do_munmap().

  This commit fixes this issue by passing a right argument to the
  preallocation call.
