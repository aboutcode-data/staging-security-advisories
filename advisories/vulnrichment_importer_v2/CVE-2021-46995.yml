aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  can: mcp251xfd: mcp251xfd_probe(): fix an error pointer dereference in probe

  When we converted this code to use dev_err_probe() we accidentally
  removed a return. It means that if devm_clk_get() it will lead to an
  Oops when we call clk_get_rate() on the next line.
