summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  io_uring/futex: ensure io_futex_wait() cleans up properly on failure

  The io_futex_data is allocated upfront and assigned to the io_kiocb
  async_data field, but the request isn't marked with REQ_F_ASYNC_DATA
  at that point. Those two should always go together, as the flag tells
  io_uring whether the field is valid or not.

  Additionally, on failure cleanup, the futex handler frees the data but
  does not clear ->async_data. Clear the data and the flag in the error
  path as well.

  Thanks to Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative and particularly ReDress for
  reporting this.
