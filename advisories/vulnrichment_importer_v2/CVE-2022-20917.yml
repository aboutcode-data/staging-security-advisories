aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) message processing\
  \ feature of Cisco Jabber could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to manipulate the\
  \ content of XMPP messages that are used by the affected application.\r\n This vulnerability\
  \ is due to the improper handling of nested XMPP messages within requests that are sent to\
  \ the Cisco Jabber client software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting\
  \ to an XMPP messaging server and sending crafted XMPP messages to an affected Jabber client.\
  \ A successful exploit could allow the attacker to manipulate the content of XMPP messages,\
  \ possibly allowing the attacker to cause the Jabber client application to perform unsafe\
  \ actions."
