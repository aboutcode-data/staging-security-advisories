aliases: []
summary: Langflow versions up to and including 1.6.9 contain a chained vulnerability that enables
  account takeover and remote code execution. An overly permissive CORS configuration (allow_origins='*'
  with allow_credentials=True) combined with a refresh token cookie configured as SameSite=None
  allows a malicious webpage to perform cross-origin requests that include credentials and successfully
  call the refresh endpoint. An attacker-controlled origin can therefore obtain fresh access_token
  / refresh_token pairs for a victim session. Obtained tokens permit access to authenticated
  endpoints — including built-in code-execution functionality — allowing the attacker to execute
  arbitrary code and achieve full system compromise.
