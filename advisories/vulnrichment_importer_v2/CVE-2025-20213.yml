aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager, formerly Cisco SD-WAN\
  \ vManage, could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the\
  \ local file system of an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must\
  \ have valid read-only credentials with CLI access on the affected system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability\
  \ is due to improper access controls on files that are on the local file system. An attacker\
  \ could exploit this vulnerability by running a series of crafted commands on the local file\
  \ system of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite\
  \ arbitrary files on the affected device and gain privileges of the root user. To exploit\
  \ this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have CLI access as a low-privilege user."
