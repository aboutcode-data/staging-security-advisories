aliases: []
summary: 'The WireGuard client 0.5.3 on Windows insecurely configures the operating system and
  firewall such that traffic to a local network that uses non-RFC1918 IP addresses is blocked.
  This allows an adversary to trick the victim into blocking IP traffic to selected IP addresses
  and services even while the VPN is enabled. NOTE: the tunnelcrack.mathyvanhoef.com website
  uses this CVE ID to refer more generally to "LocalNet attack resulting in the blocking of
  traffic" rather than to only WireGuard.'
