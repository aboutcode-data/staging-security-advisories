aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) Software
  could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker with physical access to obtain sensitive information
  from an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insecure removal of cleartext encryption
  keys stored on local partitions in the hard drive of an affected device. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by retrieving data from the physical disk on the affected partition(s).
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve encryption keys, possibly allowing
  the attacker to further decrypt other data and sensitive information on the device, which
  could lead to the disclosure of confidential information.
