aliases: []
summary: 'An Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in packet processing
  on the network interfaces of Juniper Networks Junos OS on JRR200 route reflector appliances
  allows an adjacent, network-based attacker sending a specific packet to the device to cause
  a kernel crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipt and processing of
  this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue can only
  be triggered by an attacker on the local broadcast domain. Packets routed to the device are
  unable to trigger this crash. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on JRR200: All
  versions prior to 21.2R3-S4; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S4; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S3;
  22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-S1; 22.2 versions prior to 22.2R2-S2, 22.2R3; 22.3 versions
  prior to 22.3R1-S2, 22.3R2; 22.4 versions prior to 22.4R1-S1, 22.4R2.'
