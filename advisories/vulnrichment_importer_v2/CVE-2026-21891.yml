aliases: []
summary: ZimaOS is a fork of CasaOS, an operating system for Zima devices and x86-64 systems
  with UEFI. In versions up to and including 1.5.0, the application checks the validity of the
  username but appears to skip, misinterpret, or incorrectly validate the password when the
  provided username matches a known system service account. The application's login function
  fails to properly handle the password validation result for these users, effectively granting
  authenticated access to anyone who knows one of these common usernames and provides any password.
  As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available.
