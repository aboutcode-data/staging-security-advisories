summary: LLama Factory enables fine-tuning of large language models. A critical remote OS command
  injection vulnerability has been identified in the LLama Factory training process. This vulnerability
  arises from improper handling of user input, allowing malicious actors to execute arbitrary
  OS commands on the host system. The issue is caused by insecure usage of the `Popen` function
  with `shell=True`, coupled with unsanitized user input. Immediate remediation is required
  to mitigate the risk. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.9.1.
