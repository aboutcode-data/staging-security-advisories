aliases: []
summary: YesWiki is a wiki system written in PHP. Prior to version 4.5.4, a stored cross-site
  scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the application’s comments feature. This issue
  allows a malicious actor to inject JavaScript payloads that are stored and later executed
  in the browser of any user viewing the affected comment. The XSS occurs because the application
  fails to properly sanitize or encode user input submitted to the comments. Notably, the application
  sanitizes or does not allow execution of `<script>` tags, but does not account for payloads
  obfuscated using JavaScript block comments like `/* JavaScriptPayload */`. This issue has
  been patched in version 4.5.4.
