aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Cyber Vision Center\
  \ could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks\
  \ against a user of the interface.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation\
  \ of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected system. An attacker\
  \ could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the\
  \ interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code\
  \ in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.\r\
  \nTo exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials that\
  \ allow access to the Reports page. By default, all pre-defined users have this access, as\
  \ do any custom users that are configured to allow access to the Reports page."
