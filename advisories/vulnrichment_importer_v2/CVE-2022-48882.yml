  net/mlx5e: Fix macsec possible null dereference when updating MAC security entity (SecY)

  Upon updating MAC security entity (SecY) in hw offload path, the macsec
  security association (SA) initialization routine is called. In case of
  extended packet number (epn) is enabled the salt and ssci attributes are
  retrieved using the MACsec driver rx_sa context which is unavailable when
  updating a SecY property such as encoding-sa hence the null dereference.
  Fix by using the provided SA to set those attributes.
