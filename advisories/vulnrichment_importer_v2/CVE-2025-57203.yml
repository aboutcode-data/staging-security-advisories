aliases: []
summary: MagicProject AI version 9.1 is affected by a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
  within the chatbot generation feature available to authenticated admin users. The vulnerability
  resides in the prompt parameter submitted to the /dashboard/user/generator/generate-stream
  endpoint via a multipart/form-data POST request. Due to insufficient input sanitization, attackers
  can inject HTML-based JavaScript payloads. This payload is stored and rendered unsanitized
  in subsequent views, leading to execution in other users' browsers when they access affected
  content. This issue allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the
  context of another user, potentially leading to session hijacking, privilege escalation, data
  exfiltration, or administrative account takeover. The application does not implement a Content
  Security Policy (CSP) or adequate input filtering to prevent such attacks. A fix should include
  proper sanitization, output encoding, and strong CSP enforcement to mitigate exploitation.
