aliases: []
summary: In Spring Security, versions 5.7.x prior to 5.7.8, versions 5.8.x prior to 5.8.3, and
  versions 6.0.x prior to 6.0.3, the logout support does not properly clean the security context
  if using serialized versions. Additionally, it is not possible to explicitly save an empty
  security context to the HttpSessionSecurityContextRepository. This vulnerability can keep
  users authenticated even after they performed logout. Users of affected versions should apply
  the following mitigation. 5.7.x users should upgrade to 5.7.8. 5.8.x users should upgrade
  to 5.8.3. 6.0.x users should upgrade to 6.0.3.
