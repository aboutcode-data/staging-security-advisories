datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2025-6921
datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2025/6xxx/CVE-2025-6921.json
aliases: []
summary: The huggingface/transformers library, versions prior to 4.53.0, is vulnerable to Regular
  Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the AdamWeightDecay optimizer. The vulnerability arises
  from the _do_use_weight_decay method, which processes user-controlled regular expressions
  in the include_in_weight_decay and exclude_from_weight_decay lists. Malicious regular expressions
  can cause catastrophic backtracking during the re.search call, leading to 100% CPU utilization
  and a denial of service. This issue can be exploited by attackers who can control the patterns
  in these lists, potentially causing the machine learning task to hang and rendering services
  unresponsive.
