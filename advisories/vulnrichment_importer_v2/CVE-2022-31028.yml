aliases: []
summary: MinIO is a multi-cloud object storage solution. Starting with version RELEASE.2019-09-25T18-25-51Z
  and ending with version RELEASE.2022-06-02T02-11-04Z, MinIO is vulnerable to an unending go-routine
  buildup while keeping connections established due to HTTP clients not closing the connections.
  Public-facing MinIO deployments are most affected. Users should upgrade to RELEASE.2022-06-02T02-11-04Z
  to receive a patch. One possible workaround is to use a reverse proxy to limit the number
  of connections being attempted in front of MinIO, and actively rejecting connections from
  such malicious clients.
