aliases: []
summary: "The CS5000 Fire Panel is vulnerable due to a hard-coded password that \nruns on a\
  \ VNC server and is visible as a string in the binary \nresponsible for running VNC. This\
  \ password cannot be altered, allowing \nanyone with knowledge of it to gain remote access\
  \ to the panel. Such \naccess could enable an attacker to operate the panel remotely, \npotentially\
  \ putting the fire panel into a non-functional state and \ncausing serious safety issues."
