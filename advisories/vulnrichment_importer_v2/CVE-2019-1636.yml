aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Cisco Webex Teams client, formerly Cisco Spark, could allow
  an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a targeted system. This vulnerability is due
  to unsafe search paths used by the application URI that is defined in Windows operating systems.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a targeted user to follow a malicious
  link. Successful exploitation could cause the application to load libraries from the directory
  targeted by the URI link. The attacker could use this behavior to execute arbitrary commands
  on the system with the privileges of the targeted user if the attacker can place a crafted
  library in a directory that is accessible to the vulnerable system.
