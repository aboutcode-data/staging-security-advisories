summary: 'An issue was discovered in ReadyTalk Avian 1.2.0. The vm::arrayCopy method defined
  in classpath-common.h contains multiple boundary checks that are performed to prevent out-of-bounds
  memory read/write. However, two of these boundary checks contain an integer overflow that
  leads to a bypass of these checks, and out-of-bounds read/write. NOTE: This vulnerability
  only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer'
