aliases: []
summary: Dell OS10 Networking Switches running 10.5.2.x and above contain a vulnerability with
  zeroMQ when VLT is configured. A remote unauthenticated attacker could potentially exploit
  this vulnerability leading to information disclosure and a possible Denial of Service when
  a huge number of requests are sent to the switch. This is a high severity vulnerability as
  it allows an attacker to view sensitive data. Dell recommends customers to upgrade at the
  earliest opportunity.
