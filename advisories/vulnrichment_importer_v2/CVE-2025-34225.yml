aliases: []
summary: Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host prior to version 25.1.102 and
  Application prior to version 25.1.1413 (VA/SaaS deployments) contain a server-side request
  forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. The `console_release` directory is reachable from the internet
  without any authentication.  Inside that directory are dozens of PHP scripts that build URLs
  from user‑controlled values and then invoke either 'curl_exec()` or `file_get_contents()`
  without proper validation. Although many files attempt to mitigate SSRF by calling `filter_var',
  the checks are incomplete. Because the endpoint is unauthenticated, any remote attacker can
  supply a hostname and cause the server to issue requests to internal resources. This enables
  internal network reconnaissance, potential pivoting, or data exfiltration. This vulnerability
  has been confirmed to be remediated, but it is unclear as to when the patch was introduced.
