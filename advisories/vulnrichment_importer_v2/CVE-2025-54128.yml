aliases: []
summary: HAX CMS NodeJs allows users to manage their microsite universe with a NodeJs backend.
  In versions 11.0.7 and below, the NodeJS version of HAX CMS has a disabled Content Security
  Policy (CSP). This configuration is insecure for a production application because it does
  not protect against cross-site-scripting attacks. The contentSecurityPolicy value is explicitly
  disabled in the application's Helmet configuration in app.js. This is fixed in version 11.0.8.
