aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) trap generation for wireless
  clients of Cisco IOS XE Wireless Controller Software for the Catalyst 9000 Family could allow
  an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause an affected device to unexpectedly reload,
  resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on the device. This vulnerability is due
  to a lack of input validation of the information used to generate an SNMP trap related to
  a wireless client connection event. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
  an 802.1x packet with crafted parameters during the wireless authentication setup phase of
  a connection. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload,
  resulting in a DoS condition.
