datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2023-4346
datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2023/4xxx/CVE-2023-4346.json
aliases: []
summary: KNX devices that use KNX Connection Authorization and support Option 1 are, depending
  on the implementation, vulnerable to being locked and users being unable to reset them to
  gain access to the device. The BCU key feature on the devices can be used to create a password
  for the device, but this password can often not be reset without entering the current password.
  If the device is configured to interface with a network, an attacker with access to that network
  could interface with the KNX installation, purge all devices without additional security options
  enabled, and set a BCU key, locking the device. Even if a device is not connected to a network,
  an attacker with physical access to the device could also exploit this vulnerability in the
  same way.
