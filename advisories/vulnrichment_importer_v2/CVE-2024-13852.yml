aliases: []
summary: The Option Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in version 1.0. This is due to missing nonce validation on the plugin_page() function. This
  makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary options on the WordPress
  site via a forged request, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
  action such as clicking on a link. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration
  to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access
  to a vulnerable site.
