aliases: []
summary: Xibo is an open source digital signage platform with a web content management system
  (CMS). Prior to version 4.1.0, a cross-site scripting vulnerability in Xibo CMS allows authorized
  users to execute JavaScript via the DataSet functionality. Users can design a DataSet with
  a HTML column which contains JavaScript, which is intended functionality. The JavaScript gets
  executed on the Data Entry page and in any Layouts which reference it. This behavior has been
  changed in 4.1.0 to show HTML/CSS/JS as code on the Data Entry page. There are no workarounds
  for this issue.
