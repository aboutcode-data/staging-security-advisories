aliases: []
summary: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that
  can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server
  Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially
  be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing
  the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this
  by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth
  adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication
  certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of
  the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can
  change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate
  URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known
  workarounds for this issue.
