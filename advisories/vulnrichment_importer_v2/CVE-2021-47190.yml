  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  perf bpf: Avoid memory leak from perf_env__insert_btf()

  perf_env__insert_btf() doesn't insert if a duplicate BTF id is
  encountered and this causes a memory leak. Modify the function to return
  a success/error value and then free the memory if insertion didn't
  happen.

  v2. Adds a return -1 when the insertion error occurs in
      perf_env__fetch_btf. This doesn't affect anything as the result is
      never checked.
