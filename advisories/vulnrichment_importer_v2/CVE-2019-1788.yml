aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Object Linking & Embedding (OLE2) file scanning functionality
  of Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.101.1 and prior could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability
  is due to a lack of proper input and validation checking mechanisms for OLE2 files sent an
  affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed OLE2 files
  to the device running an affected version ClamAV Software. An exploit could allow the attacker
  to cause an out-of-bounds write condition, resulting in a crash that could result in a denial
  of service condition on an affected device.
