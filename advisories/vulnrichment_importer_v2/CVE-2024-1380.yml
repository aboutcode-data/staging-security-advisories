aliases: []
summary: The Relevanssi – A Better Search plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
  access of data due to a missing capability check on the relevanssi_export_log_check() function
  in all versions up to, and including, 4.22.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to export the query log data. The vendor has indicated that they may look into adding a capability
  check for proper authorization control, however, this vulnerability is theoretically patched
  as is.
