aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in GNU Emacs through 28.2. In ruby-mode.el, the ruby-find-library-file
  function has a local command injection vulnerability. The ruby-find-library-file function
  is an interactive function, and bound to C-c C-f. Inside the function, the external command
  gem is called through shell-command-to-string, but the feature-name parameters are not escaped.
  Thus, malicious Ruby source files may cause commands to be executed.
