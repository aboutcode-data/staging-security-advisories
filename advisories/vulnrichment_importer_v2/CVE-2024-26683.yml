  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  wifi: cfg80211: detect stuck ECSA element in probe resp

  We recently added some validation that we don't try to
  connect to an AP that is currently in a channel switch
  process, since that might want the channel to be quiet
  or we might not be able to connect in time to hear the
  switching in a beacon. This was in commit c09c4f31998b
  ("wifi: mac80211: don't connect to an AP while it's in
  a CSA process").

  However, we promptly got a report that this caused new
  connection failures, and it turns out that the AP that
  we now cannot connect to is permanently advertising an
  extended channel switch announcement, even with quiet.
  The AP in question was an Asus RT-AC53, with firmware
  3.0.0.4.380_10760-g21a5898.

  As a first step, attempt to detect that we're dealing
  with such a situation, so mac80211 can use this later.
