aliases: []
summary: The WP Foodbakery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  in versions up to, and including, 4.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping
  on the 'search_type' parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject
  arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing
  an action such as clicking on a link.
