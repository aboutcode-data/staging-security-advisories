aliases: []
summary: 'Multiple vulnerabilities in the web UI of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated,
  remote attacker with read-only privileges to cause the web UI software to become unresponsive
  and consume vty line instances, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. These vulnerabilities
  are due to insufficient error handling in the web UI. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities
  by sending crafted HTTP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the
  attacker to cause the web UI software to become unresponsive and consume all available vty
  lines, preventing new session establishment and resulting in a DoS condition. Manual intervention
  would be required to regain web UI and vty session functionality. Note: These vulnerabilities
  do not affect the console connection.'
