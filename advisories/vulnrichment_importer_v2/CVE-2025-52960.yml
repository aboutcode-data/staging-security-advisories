aliases: []
summary: "A Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input vulnerability in the \n\nSession Initialization\
  \ Protocol (SIP) ALG of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series and SRX Series allows an unauthenticated,\
  \ network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nWhen memory utilization is\
  \ high, and specific SIP packets are received, flowd/mspmand crashes. While the system recovers\
  \ automatically, the disruption can significantly impact service stability. Continuous receipt\
  \ of these specific SIP packets, while high utilization is present, will cause a sustained\
  \ DoS condition. The utilization is outside the attackers control, so they would not be able\
  \ to deterministically exploit this.\nThis issue affects Junos OS on SRX Series and MX Series: \n\
  \n\n  *  All versions before 22.4R3-S7,\n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S4, \n  *  from 23.4\
  \ before 23.4R2-S5, \n  *  from 24.2 before 24.2R2."
