aliases: []
summary: 'Misskey is an open source, decentralized social media platform with ActivityPub support.
  Prior to version 2024.2.0, when fetching remote Activity Streams objects, Misskey doesn''t
  check that the response from the remote server has a `Content-Type` header value of the Activity
  Streams media type, which allows a threat actor to upload a crafted Activity Streams document
  to a remote server and make a Misskey instance fetch it, if the remote server accepts arbitrary
  user uploads. The vulnerability allows a threat actor to impersonate and take over an account
  on a remote server that satisfies all of the following properties: allows the threat actor
  to register an account; accepts arbitrary user-uploaded documents and places them on the same
  domain as legitimate Activity Streams actors; and serves user-uploaded document in response
  to requests with an `Accept` header value of the Activity Streams media type. Version 2024.2.0
  contains a patch for the issue.'
