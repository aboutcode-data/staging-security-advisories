summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Secure Firewall Management\
  \ Center (FMC) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct SQL injection\
  \ attacks on an affected system.\r\n\r This vulnerability exists because the web-based management\
  \ interface does not validate user input adequately. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by authenticating to the application as an Administrator and sending crafted SQL queries\
  \ to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain unauthorized\
  \ data from the database and make changes to the system. To exploit this vulnerability, an\
  \ attacker would need Administrator-level privileges."
