aliases: []
summary: Jenkins 2.423 and earlier, LTS 2.414.1 and earlier creates a temporary file in the
  system temporary directory with the default permissions for newly created files when installing
  a plugin from a URL, potentially allowing attackers with access to the system temporary directory
  to replace the file before it is installed in Jenkins, potentially resulting in arbitrary
  code execution.
