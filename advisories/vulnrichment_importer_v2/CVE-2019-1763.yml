  (SIP) Software for Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to bypass authorization, access critical services, and cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.
  The vulnerability exists because the software fails to sanitize URLs before it handles requests.

  could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to critical services and cause a DoS
  condition. This vulnerability affects Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series products running a SIP Software
  release prior to 11.0(5) for Wireless IP Phone 8821 and 8821-EX; and 12.5(1)SR1 for the IP
