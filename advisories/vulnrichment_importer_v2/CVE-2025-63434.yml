aliases: []
summary: The update mechanism in Xtooltech Xtool AnyScan Android Application 4.40.40 and prior
  is insecure. The application downloads and extracts update packages containing executable
  code without performing a cryptographic integrity or authenticity check on their contents.
  An attacker who can control the update metadata can serve a malicious package, which the application
  will accept, extract, and later execute, leading to arbitrary code execution.
