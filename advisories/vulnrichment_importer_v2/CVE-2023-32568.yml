summary: An issue was discovered in Veritas InfoScale Operations Manager (VIOM) before 7.4.2.800
  and 8.x before 8.0.410. The VIOM web application does not validate user-supplied data and
  appends it to OS commands and internal binaries used by the application. An attacker with
  root/administrator level privileges can leverage this to read sensitive data stored on the
  servers, modify data or server configuration, and delete data or application configuration.
