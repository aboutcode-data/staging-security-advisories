aliases: []
summary: The LA-Studio Element Kit for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information
  Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.4 via the 'elementor-template' shortcode
  due to insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for
  authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract data from private
  and draft posts created by Elementor that they should not have access to.
