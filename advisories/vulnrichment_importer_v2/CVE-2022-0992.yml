aliases: []
summary: The SiteGround Security plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass
  that allows unauthenticated users to log in as administrative users due to missing identity
  verification on initial 2FA set-up that allows unauthenticated and unauthorized users to configure
  2FA for pending accounts. Upon successful configuration, the attacker is logged in as that
  user without access to a username/password pair which is the expected first form of authentication.
  This affects versions up to, and including, 1.2.5.
