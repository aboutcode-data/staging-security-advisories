aliases: []
summary: Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver. Synapse versions before 1.106 are vulnerable
  to a disk fill attack, where an unauthenticated adversary can induce Synapse to download and
  cache large amounts of remote media. The default rate limit strategy is insufficient to mitigate
  this. This can lead to a denial of service, ranging from further media uploads/downloads failing
  to completely unavailability of the Synapse process, depending on how Synapse was deployed.
  Synapse 1.106 introduces a new "leaky bucket" rate limit on remote media downloads to reduce
  the amount of data a user can request at a time. This does not fully address the issue, but
  does limit an unauthenticated user's ability to request large amounts of data to be cached.
