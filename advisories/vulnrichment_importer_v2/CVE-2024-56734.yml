aliases: []
summary: Better Auth is an authentication library for TypeScript. An open redirect vulnerability
  has been identified in the verify email endpoint of all versions of Better Auth prior to v1.1.6,
  potentially allowing attackers to redirect users to malicious websites. This issue affects
  users relying on email verification links generated by the library. The verify email callback
  endpoint accepts a `callbackURL` parameter. Unlike other verification methods, email verification
  only uses JWT to verify and redirect without proper validation of the target domain. The origin
  checker is bypassed in this scenario because it only checks for `POST` requests. An attacker
  can manipulate this parameter to redirect users to arbitrary URLs controlled by the attacker.
  Version 1.1.6 contains a patch for the issue.
