aliases: []
summary: Saleor is an e-commerce platform. Starting in version 3.21.0 and prior to version 3.21.16,
  requesting certain fields in the response of `accountRegister` may result in errors that could
  unintentionally reveal whether a user with the provided email already exists in Saleor. Version
  3.21.16 fixes the issue. As a workaround, rate-limit the mutation to reduce the impact.
