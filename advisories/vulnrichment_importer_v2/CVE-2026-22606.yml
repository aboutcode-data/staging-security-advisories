aliases: []
summary: Fickling is a Python pickling decompiler and static analyzer. Fickling versions up
  to and including 0.1.6 do not treat Python’s runpy module as unsafe. Because of this, a malicious
  pickle that uses runpy.run_path() or runpy.run_module() is classified as SUSPICIOUS instead
  of OVERTLY_MALICIOUS. If a user relies on Fickling’s output to decide whether a pickle is
  safe to deserialize, this misclassification can lead them to execute attacker-controlled code
  on their system. This affects any workflow or product that uses Fickling as a security gate
  for pickle deserialization. This issue has been patched in version 0.1.7.
