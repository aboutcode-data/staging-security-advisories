aliases: []
summary: |
  The 1E-Exchange-CommandLinePing instruction that is part of the Network product pack available on the 1E Exchange does not properly validate the input parameter, which allows for a specially crafted input to perform arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM permissions. This instruction only runs on Windows clients.

  To remediate this issue download the updated Network product pack from the 1E Exchange and update the 1E-Exchange-CommandLinePing instruction to v18.1 by uploading it through the 1E Platform instruction upload UI
