aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the OLE2 file format parser of ClamAV could allow an unauthenticated,\
  \ remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r\
  \ This vulnerability is due to an incorrect check for end-of-string values during scanning,\
  \ which may result in a heap buffer over-read. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by submitting a crafted file containing OLE2 content to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected\
  \ device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process\
  \ to terminate, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected software and consuming available\
  \ system resources.\r\n\r For a description of this vulnerability, see the ClamAV blog ."
