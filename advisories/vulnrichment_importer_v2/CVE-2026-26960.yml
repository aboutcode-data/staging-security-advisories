aliases: []
summary: node-tar is a full-featured Tar for Node.js. When using default options in versions
  7.5.7 and below, an attacker-controlled archive can create a hardlink inside the extraction
  directory that points to a file outside the extraction root, enabling arbitrary file read
  and write as the extracting user. Severity is high because the primitive bypasses path protections
  and turns archive extraction into a direct filesystem access primitive. This issue has been
  fixed in version 7.5.8.
