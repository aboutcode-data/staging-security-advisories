aliases: []
summary: A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the exists in the network-facing
  input handling routines of Arcserve Unified Data Protection (UDP). This flaw is reachable
  without authentication and results from improper bounds checking when processing attacker-controlled
  input. By sending specially crafted data, a remote attacker can corrupt heap memory, potentially
  causing a denial of service or enabling arbitrary code execution depending on the memory layout
  and exploitation techniques used. This vulnerability is similar in nature to CVE-2025-34522
  but affects a separate code path or component. No user interaction is required, and exploitation
  occurs in the context of the vulnerable process. This vulnerability affects all UDP versions
  prior to 10.2. UDP 10.2 includes the necessary patches and requires no action. Versions 8.0
  through 10.1 are supported and require either patch application or upgrade to 10.2. Versions
  7.x and earlier are unsupported or out of maintenance and must be upgraded to 10.2 to remediate
  the issue.
