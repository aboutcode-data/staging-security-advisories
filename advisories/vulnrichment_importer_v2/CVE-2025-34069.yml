aliases: []
summary: An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in GFI Kerio Control 9.4.5 due to insecure
  default proxy configuration and weak access control in the GFIAgent service. The non-transparent
  proxy on TCP port 3128 can be used to forward unauthenticated requests to internal services
  such as GFIAgent, bypassing firewall restrictions and exposing internal management endpoints.
  This enables unauthenticated attackers to access the GFIAgent service on ports 7995 and 7996,
  retrieve the appliance UUID, and issue administrative requests via the proxy. Exploitation
  results in full administrative access to the Kerio Control appliance.
