aliases: []
summary: SuiteCRM is an open-source, enterprise-ready Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
  software application. In versions and below, the InboundEmail module allows the arbitrary
  execution of queries in the backend database, leading to SQL injection. This can have wide-reaching
  implications on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, as database data can be retrieved,
  modified, or removed entirely. This issue is fixed in version 7.14.7.
