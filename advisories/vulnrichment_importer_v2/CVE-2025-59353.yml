aliases: []
summary: Dragonfly is an open source P2P-based file distribution and image acceleration system.
  Prior to 2.1.0, a peer can obtain a valid TLS certificate for arbitrary IP addresses, effectively
  rendering the mTLS authentication useless. The issue is that the Manager’s Certificate gRPC
  service does not validate if the requested IP addresses “belong to” the peer requesting the
  certificate—that is, if the peer connects from the same IP address as the one provided in
  the certificate request. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.1.0.
