aliases: []
summary: Italtel NetMatch-S CI 5.2.0-20211008 allows Absolute Path Traversal under NMSCI-WebGui/SaveFileUploader.
  An unauthenticated user can upload files to an arbitrary path. An attacker can change the
  uploadDir parameter in a POST request (not possible using the GUI) to an arbitrary directory.
  Because the application does not check in which directory a file will be uploaded, an attacker
  can perform a variety of attacks that can result in unauthorized access to the server.
