  USB: gadgetfs: Fix race between mounting and unmounting

  The syzbot fuzzer and Gerald Lee have identified a use-after-free bug
  in the gadgetfs driver, involving processes concurrently mounting and
  unmounting the gadgetfs filesystem.  In particular, gadgetfs_fill_super()
  can race with gadgetfs_kill_sb(), causing the latter to deallocate
  the_device while the former is using it.  The output from KASAN says,
  in part:

  BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in instrument_atomic_read_write include/linux/instrumented.h:102 [inline]

  The simplest solution is to ensure that gadgetfs_fill_super() and
  gadgetfs_kill_sb() are serialized by making them both acquire a new
  mutex.
