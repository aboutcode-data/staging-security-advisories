aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the interprocess communication (IPC) channel of Cisco AnyConnect
  Secure Mobility Client Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to cause a targeted
  AnyConnect user to execute a malicious script. The vulnerability is due to a lack of authentication
  to the IPC listener. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IPC messages
  to the AnyConnect client IPC listener. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause
  the targeted AnyConnect user to execute a script. This script would execute with the privileges
  of the targeted AnyConnect user. In order to successfully exploit this vulnerability, there
  must be an ongoing AnyConnect session by the targeted user at the time of the attack. To exploit
  this vulnerability, the attacker would also need valid user credentials on the system upon
  which the AnyConnect client is being run. Cisco has not released software updates that address
  this vulnerability.
