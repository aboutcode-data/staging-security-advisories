aliases: []
summary: Servify Express is a Node.js package to start an Express server and log the port it's
  running on. Prior to 1.2, the Express server used express.json() without a size limit, which
  could allow attackers to send extremely large request bodies. This can cause excessive memory
  usage, degraded performance, or process crashes, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Any
  application using the JSON parser without limits and exposed to untrusted clients is affected.
  The issue is not a flaw in Express itself, but in configuration. This issue is fixed in version
  1.2. To work around, consider adding a limit option to the JSON parser, rate limiting at the
  application or reverse-proxy level, rejecting unusually large requests before parsing, or
  using a reverse proxy (such as NGINX) to enforce maximum request body sizes.
