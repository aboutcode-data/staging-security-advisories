summary: "A vulnerability in an internal API of Cisco ISE and Cisco ISE-PIC could allow an unauthenticated,\
  \ remote attacker to upload arbitrary files to an affected device and then execute those files\
  \ on the underlying operating system as root.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due a lack of file\
  \ validation checks that would prevent uploaded files from being placed in privileged directories\
  \ on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted\
  \ file to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to store malicious\
  \ files on the affected system and then execute arbitrary code or obtain root privileges on\
  \ the system."
