aliases: []
summary: 'mailcow: dockerized is an open source groupware/email suite based on docker. Prior
  to version 2025-01a, a vulnerability in mailcow''s password reset functionality allows an
  attacker to manipulate the `Host HTTP` header to generate a password reset link pointing to
  an attacker-controlled domain. This can lead to account takeover if a user clicks the poisoned
  link. Version 2025-01a contains a patch. As a workaround, deactivate the password reset functionality
  by clearing `Notification email sender` and `Notification email subject` under System -> Configuration
  -> Options -> Password Settings.'
