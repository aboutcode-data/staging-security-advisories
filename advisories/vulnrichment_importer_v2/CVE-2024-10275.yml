aliases: []
summary: In version 1.5.5 of lunary-ai/lunary, a vulnerability exists where admins, who do not
  have direct permissions to access billing resources, can change the permissions of existing
  users to include billing permissions. This can lead to a privilege escalation scenario where
  an administrator can manage billing, effectively bypassing the intended role-based access
  control. Only users with the 'owner' role should be allowed to invite members with billing
  permissions. This flaw allows admins to circumvent those restrictions, gaining unauthorized
  access and control over billing information, posing a risk to the organization’s financial
  resources.
