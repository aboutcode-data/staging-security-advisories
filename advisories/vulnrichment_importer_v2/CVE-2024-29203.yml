aliases: []
summary: TinyMCE is an open source rich text editor. A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
  was discovered in TinyMCE’s content insertion code.  This allowed `iframe` elements containing
  malicious code to execute when inserted into the editor.  These `iframe` elements are restricted
  in their permissions by same-origin browser protections, but could still trigger operations
  such as downloading of malicious assets. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.8.1.
