aliases: []
summary: Soft Serve is a self-hostable Git server for the command line. Versions 0.11.2 and
  below have a critical authentication bypass vulnerability that allows an attacker to impersonate
  any user (including admin) by "offering" the victim's public key during the SSH handshake
  before authenticating with their own valid key. This occurs because the user identity is stored
  in the session context during the "offer" phase and is not cleared if that specific authentication
  attempt fails. This issue has been fixed in version 0.11.3.
