aliases: []
summary: Vodafone H500s devices running firmware v3.5.10 (hardware model Sercomm VFH500) expose
  the WiFi access point password via an unauthenticated HTTP endpoint. By sending a crafted
  GET request to /data/activation.json with specific headers and cookies, a remote attacker
  can retrieve a JSON document that contains the wifi_password field. This allows an unauthenticated
  attacker to obtain the WiFi credentials and gain unauthorized access to the wireless network,
  compromising confidentiality of network traffic and attached systems.
