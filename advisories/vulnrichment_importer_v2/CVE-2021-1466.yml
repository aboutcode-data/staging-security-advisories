summary: "A vulnerability in the vDaemon service of Cisco&nbsp;SD-WAN vManage Software could\
  \ allow an authenticated, local attacker to cause a buffer overflow on an affected system,\
  \ resulting in a&nbsp;denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incomplete\
  \ bounds checks for data that is provided to the vDaemon service of an affected system. An\
  \ attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious data to the vDaemon listening\
  \ service on the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a\
  \ buffer overflow condition on the affected system, which could allow the attacker to cause\
  \ the vDaemon listening service to reload and result in a DoS condition.Cisco&nbsp;has released\
  \ software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address\
  \ this vulnerability."
