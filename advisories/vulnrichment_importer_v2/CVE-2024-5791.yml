aliases: []
summary: The Online Booking & Scheduling Calendar for WordPress by vcita plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'wp_id' parameter in all versions up
  to, and including, 4.4.2 due to missing authorization checks on processAction function, as
  well as insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that will execute whenever a user accesses a wp-admin
  dashboard.
