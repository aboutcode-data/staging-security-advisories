aliases: []
summary: The `Embed Privacy` plugin for WordPress that prevents the loading of embedded external
  content is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via `embed_privacy_opt_out` shortcode
  in versions up to, and including, 1.8.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
  escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with
  contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
  execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. Version 1.8.1 contains a patch for this
  issue.
