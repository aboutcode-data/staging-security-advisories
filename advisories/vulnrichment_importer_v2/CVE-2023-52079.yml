aliases: []
summary: "msgpackr is a fast MessagePack NodeJS/JavaScript implementation. Prior to 1.10.1,\
  \ when decoding user supplied MessagePack messages, users can trigger stuck threads by crafting\
  \ messages that keep the decoder stuck in a loop. The fix is available in v1.10.1.  \nExploits\
  \ seem to require structured cloning, replacing the 0x70 extension with your own (that throws\
  \ an error or does something other than recursive referencing) should mitigate the issue."
