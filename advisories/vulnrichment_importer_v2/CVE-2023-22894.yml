aliases: []
summary: Strapi through 4.5.5 allows attackers (with access to the admin panel) to discover
  sensitive user details by exploiting the query filter. The attacker can filter users by columns
  that contain sensitive information and infer a value from API responses. If the attacker has
  super admin access, then this can be exploited to discover the password hash and password
  reset token of all users. If the attacker has admin panel access to an account with permission
  to access the username and email of API users with a lower privileged role (e.g., Editor or
  Author), then this can be exploited to discover sensitive information for all API users but
  not other admin accounts.
