aliases: []
summary: 'An issue was discovered in the Clario VPN client through 5.9.1.1662 for macOS. The
  VPN client insecurely configures the operating system such that traffic to the local network
  is sent in plaintext outside the VPN tunnel even if the local network is using a non-RFC1918
  IP subnet. This allows an adversary to trick the victim into sending arbitrary IP traffic
  in plaintext outside the VPN tunnel. NOTE: the tunnelcrack.mathyvanhoef.com website uses this
  CVE ID to refer more generally to "LocalNet attack resulting in leakage of traffic in plaintext"
  rather than to only Clario.'
