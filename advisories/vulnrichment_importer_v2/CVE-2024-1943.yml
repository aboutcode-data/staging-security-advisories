aliases: []
summary: The Yuki theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions
  up to, and including 1.3.14. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the reset_customizer_options()
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset the themes settings
  via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
  such as clicking on a link.
