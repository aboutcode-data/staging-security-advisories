aliases: []
summary: The OZI action is a GitHub Action that publishes releases to PyPI and mirror releases,
  signature bundles, and provenance in a tagged release. In versions 1.13.2 through 1.13.5,
  potentially untrusted data flows into PR creation logic. A malicious actor could construct
  a branch name that injects arbitrary code. This is patched in 1.13.6. As a workaround, one
  may downgrade to a version prior to 1.13.2.
