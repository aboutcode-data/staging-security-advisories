aliases: []
summary: 'Dmidecode before 3.5 allows -dump-bin to overwrite a local file. This has security
  relevance because, for example, execution of Dmidecode via Sudo is plausible. NOTE: Some third
  parties have indicated the fix in 3.5 does not adequately address the vulnerability. The argument
  is that the proposed patch prevents dmidecode from writing to an existing file. However, there
  are multiple attack vectors that would not require overwriting an existing file that would
  provide the same level of unauthorized privilege escalation (e.g. creating a new file in /etc/cron.hourly).'
