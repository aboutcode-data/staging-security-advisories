summary: The AutomatorWP – Automator plugin for no-code automations, webhooks & custom integrations
  in WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the
  ‘a-0-o-search_field_value’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 5.0.9 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
