  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  filelock: Remove locks reliably when fcntl/close race is detected

  When fcntl_setlk() races with close(), it removes the created lock with
  do_lock_file_wait().
  However, LSMs can allow the first do_lock_file_wait() that created the lock
  while denying the second do_lock_file_wait() that tries to remove the lock.
  Separately, posix_lock_file() could also fail to
  remove a lock due to GFP_KERNEL allocation failure (when splitting a range
  in the middle).

  After the bug has been triggered, use-after-free reads will occur in
  lock_get_status() when userspace reads /proc/locks. This can likely be used
  to read arbitrary kernel memory, but can't corrupt kernel memory.

  Fix it by calling locks_remove_posix() instead, which is designed to
  reliably get rid of POSIX locks associated with the given file and
  files_struct and is also used by filp_flush().
