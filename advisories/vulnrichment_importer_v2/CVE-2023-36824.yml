aliases: []
summary: Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. In Redit 7.0 prior to 7.0.12,
  extracting key names from a command and a list of arguments may, in some cases, trigger a
  heap overflow and result in reading random heap memory, heap corruption and potentially remote
  code execution. Several scenarios that may lead to authenticated users executing a specially
  crafted `COMMAND GETKEYS` or `COMMAND GETKEYSANDFLAGS`and authenticated users who were set
  with ACL rules that match key names, executing a specially crafted command that refers to
  a variadic list of key names. The vulnerability is patched in Redis 7.0.12.
