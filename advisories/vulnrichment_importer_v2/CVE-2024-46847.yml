  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mm: vmalloc: ensure vmap_block is initialised before adding to queue

  Commit 8c61291fd850 ("mm: fix incorrect vbq reference in
  purge_fragmented_block") extended the 'vmap_block' structure to contain a
  'cpu' field which is set at allocation time to the id of the initialising
  CPU.

  When a new 'vmap_block' is being instantiated by new_vmap_block(), the
  partially initialised structure is added to the local 'vmap_block_queue'
  xarray before the 'cpu' field has been initialised.  If another CPU is
  concurrently walking the xarray (e.g.  via vm_unmap_aliases()), then it
  may perform an out-of-bounds access to the remote queue thanks to an
  uninitialised index.

  This has been observed as UBSAN errors in Android:

   | Internal error: UBSAN: array index out of bounds: 00000000f2005512 [#1] PREEMPT SMP

  Move the initialisation of 'vb->cpu' in new_vmap_block() ahead of the
  addition to the xarray.
