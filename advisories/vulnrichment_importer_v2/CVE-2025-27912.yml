aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Datalust Seq before 2024.3.13545. Missing Content-Type validation
  can lead to CSRF when (1) Entra ID or OpenID Connect authentication is in use and a user visits
  a compromised/malicious site, or (2) when username/password or Active Directory authentication
  is in use and a user visits a compromised/malicious site under the same effective top-level
  domain as the Seq server. Exploitation of the vulnerability allows the attacker to conduct
  impersonation attacks and perform actions in Seq on behalf of the targeted user.
