  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mptcp: fix data stream corruption

  Maxim reported several issues when forcing a TCP transparent proxy
  to use the MPTCP protocol for the inbound connections. He also
  provided a clean reproducer.

  The problem boils down to 'mptcp_frag_can_collapse_to()' assuming
  that only MPTCP will use the given page_frag.

  If others - e.g. the plain TCP protocol - allocate page fragments,
  we can end-up re-using already allocated memory for mptcp_data_frag.

  Fix the issue ensuring that the to-be-expanded data fragment is
  located at the current page frag end.

  v1 -> v2:
   - added missing fixes tag (Mat)
