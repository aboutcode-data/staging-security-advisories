summary: The Pi-hole is a DNS sinkhole that protects your devices from unwanted content without
  installing any client-side software. A vulnerability has been discovered in Pihole that allows
  an authenticated user on the platform to read internal server files arbitrarily, and because
  the application runs from behind, reading files is done as a privileged user.If the URL that
  is in the list of "Adslists" begins with "file*" it is understood that it is updating from
  a local file, on the other hand if it does not begin with "file*" depending on the state of
  the response it does one thing or another. The problem resides in the update through local
  files. When updating from a file which contains non-domain lines, 5 of the non-domain lines
  are printed on the screen, so if you provide it with any file on the server which contains
  non-domain lines it will print them on the screen. This vulnerability is fixed by 5.18.
