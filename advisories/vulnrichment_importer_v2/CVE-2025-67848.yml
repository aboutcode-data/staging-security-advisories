aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in Moodle. This authentication bypass vulnerability allows suspended
  users to authenticate through the Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) Provider. The issue
  arises from the LTI authentication handlers failing to enforce the user's suspension status,
  enabling unauthorized access to the system. This can lead to information disclosure or other
  unauthorized actions by users who should be restricted.
