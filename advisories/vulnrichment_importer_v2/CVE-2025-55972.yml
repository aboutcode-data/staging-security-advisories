aliases: []
summary: A TCL Smart TV running a vulnerable UPnP/DLNA MediaRenderer implementation is affected
  by a remote, unauthenticated Denial of Service (DoS) condition. By sending a flood of malformed
  or oversized SetAVTransportURI SOAP requests to the UPnP control endpoint, an attacker can
  cause the device to become unresponsive. This denial persists as long as the attack continues
  and affects all forms of TV operation. Manual user control and even reboots do not restore
  functionality unless the flood stops.
