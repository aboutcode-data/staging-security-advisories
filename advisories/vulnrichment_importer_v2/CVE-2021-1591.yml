aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the EtherChannel port subscription logic of Cisco Nexus 9500 Series
  Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass access control list (ACL)
  rules that are configured on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to oversubscription
  of resources that occurs when applying ACLs to port channel interfaces. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by attempting to access network resources that are protected by
  the ACL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access network resources that would
  be protected by the ACL that was applied on the port channel interface.
