summary: 'A Java insecure deserialization vulnerability in Adobe LiveCycle ES4 version 11.0
  and earlier allows unauthenticated remote attackers to gain operating system code execution
  by submitting specially crafted Java serialized objects to a specific URL. Adobe LiveCycle
  ES4 version 11.0.1 and later may be vulnerable if the application is installed with Java environment
  7u21 and earlier. Exploitation of the vulnerability depends on two factors: insecure deserialization
  methods used in the Adobe LiveCycle application, and the use of Java environments 7u21 and
  earlier. The code execution is performed in the context of the account that is running the
  Adobe LiveCycle application. If the account is privileged, exploitation provides privileged
  access to the operating system. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no
  longer supported by the maintainer.'
