aliases: []
summary: 'Apache DB DdlUtils 1.0 included a BinaryObjectsHelper that was intended for use when
  migrating database data with a SQL data type of BINARY, VARBINARY, LONGVARBINARY, or BLOB
  between databases using the ddlutils features. The BinaryObjectsHelper class was insecure
  and used ObjectInputStream.readObject without validating that the input data was safe to deserialize.
  Please note that DdlUtils is no longer being actively developed. To address the insecurity
  of the BinaryObjectHelper class, the following changes to DdlUtils have been made: (1) BinaryObjectsHelper.java
  has been deleted from the DdlUtils source repository and the DdlUtils feature of propagating
  data of SQL binary types is therefore no longer present in DdlUtils; (2) The ddlutils-1.0
  release has been removed from the Apache Release Distribution Infrastructure; (3) The DdlUtils
  web site has been updated to indicate that DdlUtils is now available only as source code,
  not as a packaged release.'
