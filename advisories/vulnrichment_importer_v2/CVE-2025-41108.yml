aliases: []
summary: 'The communication protocol implemented in Ghost Robotics Vision 60 v0.27.2 could allow
  an attacker to send commands to the robot from an external attack station, impersonating the
  control station (tablet) and gaining unauthorised full control of the robot. The absence of
  encryption and authentication mechanisms in the communication protocol allows an attacker
  to capture legitimate traffic between the robot and the controller, replicate it, and send
  any valid command to the robot from any attacking computer or device. The communication protocol
  used in this interface is based on MAVLink, a widely documented protocol, which increases
  the likelihood of attack. There are two methods for connecting to the robot remotely: Wi-Fi
  and 4G/LTE.'
