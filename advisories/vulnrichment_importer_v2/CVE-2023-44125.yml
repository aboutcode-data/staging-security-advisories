summary: The vulnerability is the use of implicit PendingIntents without the PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE
  set that leads to theft and/or (over-)write of arbitrary files with system privilege in the
  Personalized service ("com.lge.abba") app. The attacker's app, if it had access to app notifications,
  could intercept them and redirect them to its activity, before making it grant access permissions
  to content providers with the `android:grantUriPermissions="true"` flag.
