aliases: []
summary: Rallly is an open-source scheduling and collaboration tool. Prior to version 4.5.4,
  an improper authorization flaw in the comment creation endpoint allows authenticated users
  to impersonate any other user by altering the authorName field in the API request. This enables
  attackers to post comments under arbitrary usernames, including privileged ones such as administrators,
  potentially misleading other users and enabling phishing or social engineering attacks. This
  issue has been patched in version 4.5.4.
