aliases: []
summary: The Civi - Job Board & Freelance Marketplace WordPress Theme plugin for WordPress is
  vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.4. This is due
  to a lack of user validation before changing a password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to change the password of arbitrary users, including administrators, if the attacker
  knows the username of the victim.
