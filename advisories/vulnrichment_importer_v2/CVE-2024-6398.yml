summary: An information disclosure vulnerability in SWG in versions 12.x prior to 12.2.10 and
  11.x prior to 11.2.24 allows information stored in a customizable block page to be disclosed
  to third-party websites due to Same Origin Policy Bypass of browsers in certain scenarios.

  and GTI are in place in most policies to block access to uncategorized/high risk websites.
  Any information disclosed depends on how the customers have customized the block pages.
