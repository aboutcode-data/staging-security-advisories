aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in OpenSatKit 2.2.1. The EventErrStr buffer has a fixed size
  of 256 bytes. The code uses sprintf to format two filenames (Source1Filename and the string
  returned by FileUtil_FileStateStr) into this buffer without any length checking and without
  using bounded format specifiers such as %.*s. If the filename length approaches OS_MAX_PATH_LEN
  (commonly 64-256 bytes), the combined formatted string together with constant text can exceed
  256 bytes, resulting in a stack buffer overflow. Such unsafe sprintf calls are scattered across
  multiple functions in file.c, including FILE_ConcatenateCmd() and ConcatenateFiles(), all
  of which fail to validate the output length.
