  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  arm64: topology: fix possible overflow in amu_fie_setup()

  cpufreq_get_hw_max_freq() returns max frequency in kHz as *unsigned int*,
  while freq_inv_set_max_ratio() gets passed this frequency in Hz as 'u64'.
  Multiplying max frequency by 1000 can potentially result in overflow --
  multiplying by 1000ULL instead should avoid that...

  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with the SVACE static
  analysis tool.
