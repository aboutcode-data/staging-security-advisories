aliases: []
summary: 'A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the experimental policy mechanism in
  all active release lines: 16.x, 18.x and, 20.x. The use of the deprecated API `process.binding()`
  can bypass the policy mechanism by requiring internal modules and eventually take advantage
  of `process.binding(''spawn_sync'')` run arbitrary code, outside of the limits defined in
  a `policy.json` file. Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the policy is an experimental
  feature of Node.js.'
