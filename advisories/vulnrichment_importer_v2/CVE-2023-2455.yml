aliases: []
summary: Row security policies disregard user ID changes after inlining; PostgreSQL could permit
  incorrect policies to be applied in certain cases where role-specific policies are used and
  a given query is planned under one role and then executed under other roles. This scenario
  can happen under security definer functions or when a common user and query is planned initially
  and then re-used across multiple SET ROLEs. Applying an incorrect policy may permit a user
  to complete otherwise-forbidden reads and modifications. This affects only databases that
  have used CREATE POLICY to define a row security policy.
