aliases: []
summary: The WP Import – Ultimate CSV XML Importer for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 7.35. This is due to
  inadequate validation of the resolved URL after following Bitly shortlink redirects in the
  `upload_function()` method. While the initial URL is validated using `wp_http_validate_url()`,
  when a Bitly shortlink is detected, the `unshorten_bitly_url()` function follows redirects
  to the final destination URL without re-validating it. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers with Contributor-level access or higher to make the server perform HTTP requests
  to arbitrary internal endpoints, including localhost, private IP ranges, and cloud metadata
  services (e.g., 169.254.169.254), potentially exposing sensitive internal data.
