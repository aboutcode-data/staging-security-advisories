summary: "A vulnerability in the Broadband Network Gateway PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) feature\
  \ of Cisco&nbsp;IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause\
  \ the PPPoE process to continually crash.\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the PPPoE feature\
  \ does not properly handle an error condition within a specific crafted packet sequence. An\
  \ attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a sequence of specific PPPoE packets\
  \ from controlled customer premises equipment (CPE). A successful exploit could allow the\
  \ attacker to cause the PPPoE process to continually restart, resulting in a denial of service\
  \ condition (DoS).Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability.\
  \ There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.This advisory is part of the September\
  \ 2022 release of the Cisco&nbsp;IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For\
  \ a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see ."
