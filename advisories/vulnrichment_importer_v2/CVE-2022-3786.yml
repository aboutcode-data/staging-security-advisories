aliases: []
summary: A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in
  name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification
  and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for an application to continue
  certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker
  can craft a malicious email address in a certificate to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes
  containing the `.' character (decimal 46) on the stack. This buffer overflow could result
  in a crash (causing a denial of service). In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting
  to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client
  authentication and a malicious client connects.
