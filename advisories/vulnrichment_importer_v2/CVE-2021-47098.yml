  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  hwmon: (lm90) Prevent integer overflow/underflow in hysteresis calculations

  Commit b50aa49638c7 ("hwmon: (lm90) Prevent integer underflows of
  temperature calculations") addressed a number of underflow situations
  when writing temperature limits. However, it missed one situation, seen
  when an attempt is made to set the hysteresis value to MAX_LONG and the
  critical temperature limit is negative.

  Use clamp_val() when setting the hysteresis temperature to ensure that
  the provided value can never overflow or underflow.
