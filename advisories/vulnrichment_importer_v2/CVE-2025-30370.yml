aliases: []
summary: jupyterlab-git is a JupyterLab extension for version control using Git. On many platforms,
  a third party can create a Git repository under a name that includes a shell command substitution
  string in the syntax $(<command>). These directory names are allowed in macOS and a majority
  of Linux distributions. If a user starts jupyter-lab in a parent directory of this inappropriately-named
  Git repository, opens it, and clicks "Git > Open Git Repository in Terminal" from the menu
  bar, then the injected command <command> is run in the user's shell without the user's permission.
  This issue is occurring because when that menu entry is clicked, jupyterlab-git opens the
  terminal and runs cd <git-repo-path> through the shell to set the current directory. Doing
  so runs any command substitution strings present in the directory name, which leads to the
  command injection issue described here. A previous patch provided an incomplete fix. This
  vulnerability is fixed in 0.51.1.
