aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based Local Manager interface of the Cisco IOx Application
  Framework could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based Local Manager interface of an affected device.
  The attacker must have valid Local Manager credentials. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  validation of user-supplied input by the web-based Local Manager interface of the affected
  software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into a
  system settings tab. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script
  code in the context of the affected web interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive
  browser-based information.
