aliases: []
summary: "The Firefox updater created a directory writable by non-privileged users. When uninstalling\
  \ Firefox, any files in that directory would be recursively deleted with the permissions of\
  \ the uninstalling user account. This could be combined with creation of a junction (a form\
  \ of symbolic link) to allow arbitrary file deletion controlled by the non-privileged user.\
  \ \n*This bug only affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.* This\
  \ vulnerability affects Firefox < 116, Firefox ESR < 115.1, and Thunderbird < 115.1."
