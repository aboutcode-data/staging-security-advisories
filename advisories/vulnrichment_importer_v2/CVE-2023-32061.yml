summary: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.0.4 of the `stable`
  branch and version 3.1.0.beta5 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, the lack of restrictions
  on the iFrame tag makes it easy for an attacker to exploit the vulnerability and hide subsequent
  comments from other users. This issue is patched in version 3.0.4 of the `stable` branch and
  version 3.1.0.beta5 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. There are no known workarounds.
