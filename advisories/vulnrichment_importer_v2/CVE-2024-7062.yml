aliases: []
summary: Nimble Commander suffers from a privilege escalation vulnerability due to the server
  (info.filesmanager.Files.PrivilegedIOHelperV2) performing improper/insufficient validation
  of a client’s authorization before executing an operation. Consequently, it is possible to
  execute system-level commands as the root user, such as changing permissions and ownership,
  obtaining a handle (file descriptor) of an arbitrary file, and terminating processes, among
  other operations.
