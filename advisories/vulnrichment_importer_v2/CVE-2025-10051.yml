aliases: []
summary: The Demo Import Kit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due
  to missing file type validation in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.0 via the import
  functionality. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level
  access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote
  code execution possible.
