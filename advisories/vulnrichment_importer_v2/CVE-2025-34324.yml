aliases: []
summary: GoSign Desktop versions 2.4.0 and earlier use an unsigned update manifest for distributing
  application updates. The manifest contains package URLs and SHA-256 hashes but is not digitally
  signed, so its authenticity relies solely on the underlying TLS channel. In affected versions,
  TLS certificate validation can be disabled when a proxy is configured, allowing an attacker
  who can intercept network traffic to supply a malicious update manifest and corresponding
  package with a matching hash. This can cause the client to download and install a tampered
  update, resulting in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the GoSign Desktop user
  on Windows and macOS, or with elevated privileges on some Linux deployments. A local attacker
  who can modify proxy settings may also abuse this behavior to escalate privileges by forcing
  installation of a crafted update.
