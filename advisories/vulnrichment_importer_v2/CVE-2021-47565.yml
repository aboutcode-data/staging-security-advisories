  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  scsi: mpt3sas: Fix kernel panic during drive powercycle test

  While looping over shost's sdev list it is possible that one
  of the drives is getting removed and its sas_target object is
  freed but its sdev object remains intact.

  Consequently, a kernel panic can occur while the driver is trying to access
  the sas_address field of sas_target object without also checking the
  sas_target object for NULL.
