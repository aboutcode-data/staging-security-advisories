aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the IPv6 subsystem of Cisco IOS XR Software Release 5.3.4 for the
  Cisco Aggregation Services Router (ASR) 9000 Series could allow an unauthenticated, remote
  attacker to trigger a reload of one or more Trident-based line cards, resulting in a denial
  of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of IPv6 packets
  with a fragment header extension. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
  IPv6 packets designed to trigger the issue either to or through the Trident-based line card.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a reload of Trident-based line cards,
  resulting in a DoS during the period of time the line card takes to restart. This vulnerability
  affects Cisco Aggregation Services Router (ASR) 9000 Series when the following conditions
  are met: The router is running Cisco IOS XR Software Release 5.3.4, and the router has installed
  Trident-based line cards that have IPv6 configured. A software maintenance upgrade (SMU) has
  been made available that addresses this vulnerability. The fix has also been incorporated
  into service pack 7 for Cisco IOS XR Software Release 5.3.4. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg46800.'
