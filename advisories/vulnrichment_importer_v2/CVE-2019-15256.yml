aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) feature of Cisco Adaptive
  Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could
  allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of an affected device, resulting
  in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper management of
  system memory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious IKEv1 traffic
  to an affected device. The attacker does not need valid credentials to authenticate the VPN
  session, nor does the attacker's source address need to match a peer statement in the crypto
  map applied to the ingress interface of the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker
  to exhaust system memory resources, leading to a reload of an affected device.
