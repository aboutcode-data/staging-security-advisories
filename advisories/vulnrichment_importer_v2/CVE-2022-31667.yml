summary: |
  Harbor fails to validate the user permissions when updating a robot account that belongs to a project that the authenticated user doesn’t have access to. 

  By sending a request that attempts to update a robot account, and specifying a robot account id and robot account name that belongs to a different project that the user doesn’t have access to, it was possible to revoke the robot account permissions.
