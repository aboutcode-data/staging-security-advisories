summary: The wpbakery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via
  the Custom Heading tag attribute in all versions up to, and including, 7.5 due to insufficient

  with contributor access or higher, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute
  whenever a user accesses an injected page.
