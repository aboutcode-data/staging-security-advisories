aliases: []
summary: Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by the Matrix.org
  Foundation. The Matrix Federation API allows remote homeservers to request the authorization
  events in a room. This is necessary so that a homeserver receiving some events can validate
  that those events are legitimate and permitted in their room. However, in versions of Synapse
  up to and including 1.68.0, a Synapse homeserver answering a query for authorization events
  does not sufficiently check that the requesting server should be able to access them. The
  issue was patched in Synapse 1.69.0. Homeserver administrators are advised to upgrade.
