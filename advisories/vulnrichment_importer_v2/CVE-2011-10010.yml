aliases: []
summary: QuickShare File Server 1.2.1 contains a path traversal vulnerability in its FTP service
  due to improper sanitation of user-supplied file paths. Authenticated users can exploit this
  flaw by submitting crafted sequences to access or write files outside the intended virtual
  directory. When the "Writable" option is enabled (default during account creation), this allows
  attackers to upload arbitrary files to privileged locations such as system32, enabling remote
  code execution via MOF injection or executable placement.
