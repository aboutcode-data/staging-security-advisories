aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the ingress packet processing function of Cisco IOS Software for
  Cisco Catalyst 4000 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause
  a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper
  resource allocation when processing TCP packets directed to the device on specific Cisco Catalyst
  4000 Series Switches. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TCP
  streams to an affected device. A successful exploit could cause the affected device to run
  out of buffer resources, impairing operations of control plane and management plane protocols,
  resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability can be triggered only by traffic that is
  destined to an affected device and cannot be exploited using traffic that transits an affected
  device.
