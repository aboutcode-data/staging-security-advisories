aliases: []
summary: 'Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Due to the
  improper URL protocols filtering of links specified in the `link.argocd.argoproj.io` annotations
  in the application summary component, an attacker can achieve cross-site scripting with elevated
  permissions. All unpatched versions of Argo CD starting with v1.0.0 are vulnerable to a cross-site
  scripting (XSS) bug allowing a malicious user to inject a javascript: link in the UI. When
  clicked by a victim user, the script will execute with the victim''s permissions (up to and
  including admin). This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform arbitrary actions on behalf
  of the victim via the API, such as creating, modifying, and deleting Kubernetes resources.
  A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions v2.10.3 v2.9.8, and v2.8.12.
  There are no completely-safe workarounds besides upgrading. The safest alternative, if upgrading
  is not possible, would be to create a Kubernetes admission controller to reject any resources
  with an annotation starting with link.argocd.argoproj.io or reject the resource if the value
  use an improper URL protocol. This validation will need to be applied in all clusters managed
  by ArgoCD.'
