aliases: []
summary: 'Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in Snort rules that could
  allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on
  an affected device.The vulnerability is due to improper handling of the Block with Reset or
  Interactive Block with Reset actions if a rule is configured without proper constraints. An
  attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IP packet to the affected device.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause through traffic to be dropped. Note:
  Only products with Snort3 configured and either a rule with Block with Reset or Interactive
  Block with Reset actions configured are vulnerable. Products configured with Snort2 are not
  vulnerable.'
