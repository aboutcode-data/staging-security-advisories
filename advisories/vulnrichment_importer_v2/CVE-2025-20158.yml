  \ 9800 Series could allow an authenticated, local attacker to access sensitive information\
  \ on an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative\
  \ credentials with SSH access on the affected device. SSH access is disabled by default.\r\
  \n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the debug\
