aliases: []
summary: Products.ATContentTypes are the core content types for Plone 2.1 - 4.3. Versions of
  Plone that are dependent on Products.ATContentTypes prior to version 3.0.6 are vulnerable
  to reflected cross site scripting and open redirect when an attacker can get a compromised
  version of the image_view_fullscreen page in a cache, for example in Varnish. The technique
  is known as cache poisoning. Any later visitor can get redirected when clicking on a link
  on this page. Usually only anonymous users are affected, but this depends on the user's cache
  settings. Version 3.0.6 of Products.ATContentTypes has been released with a fix. This version
  works on Plone 5.2, Python 2 only. As a workaround, make sure the image_view_fullscreen page
  is not stored in the cache. More information about the vulnerability and cvmitigation measures
  is available in the GitHub Security Advisory.
