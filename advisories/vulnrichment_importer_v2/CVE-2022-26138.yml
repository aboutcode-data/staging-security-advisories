aliases: []
summary: The Atlassian Questions For Confluence app for Confluence Server and Data Center creates
  a Confluence user account in the confluence-users group with the username disabledsystemuser
  and a hardcoded password. A remote, unauthenticated attacker with knowledge of the hardcoded
  password could exploit this to log into Confluence and access all content accessible to users
  in the confluence-users group. This user account is created when installing versions 2.7.34,
  2.7.35, and 3.0.2 of the app.
