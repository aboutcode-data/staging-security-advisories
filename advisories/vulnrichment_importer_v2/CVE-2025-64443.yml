aliases: []
summary: MCP Gateway allows easy and secure running and deployment of MCP servers. In versions
  0.27.0 and earlier, when MCP Gateway runs in sse or streaming transport mode, it is vulnerable
  to DNS rebinding. An attacker who can get a victim to visit a malicious website or be served
  a malicious advertisement can perform browser-based exploitation of MCP servers executing
  behind the gateway, including manipulating tools or other features exposed by those MCP servers.
  MCP Gateway is not affected when running in the default stdio mode, which does not listen
  on network ports. Version 0.28.0 fixes this issue.
