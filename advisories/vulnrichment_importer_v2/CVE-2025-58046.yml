aliases: []
summary: Dataease is an open-source data visualization and analysis platform. In versions up
  to and including 2.10.12, the Impala data source is vulnerable to remote code execution due
  to insufficient filtering in the getJdbc method of the io.dataease.datasource.type.Impala
  class. Attackers can construct malicious JDBC connection strings that exploit JNDI injection
  and trigger RMI deserialization, ultimately enabling remote command execution. The vulnerability
  can be exploited by editing the data source and providing a crafted JDBC connection string
  that references a remote configuration file, leading to RMI-based deserialization attacks.
  This issue has been patched in version 2.10.13. It is recommended to upgrade to the latest
  version. No known workarounds exist for affected versions.
