aliases: []
summary: A buffer over-read was discovered in libntlmauth in Squid 2.5 through 5.6. Due to incorrect
  integer-overflow protection, the SSPI and SMB authentication helpers are vulnerable to reading
  unintended memory locations. In some configurations, cleartext credentials from these locations
  are sent to a client. This is fixed in 5.7.
