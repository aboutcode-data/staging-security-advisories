aliases: []
summary: find-exec is a utility to discover available shell commands. Versions prior to 1.0.3
  did not properly escape user input and are vulnerable to Command Injection via an attacker
  controlled parameter. As a result, attackers may run malicious shell commands in the context
  of the running process. This issue has been addressed in version 1.0.3. users are advised
  to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that all input passed to find-exec comes
  from a trusted source.
