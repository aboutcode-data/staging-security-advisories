summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine
  (ISE) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device. The
  vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface of the affected device does
  not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
  persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
  execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive,
  browser-based information.
