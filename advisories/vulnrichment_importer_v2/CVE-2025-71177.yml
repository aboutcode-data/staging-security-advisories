aliases: []
summary: LavaLite CMS versions up to and including 10.1.0 contain a stored cross-site scripting
  vulnerability in the package creation and search functionality. Authenticated users can supply
  crafted HTML or JavaScript in the package Name or Description fields that is stored and later
  rendered without proper output encoding in package search results. When other users view search
  results that include the malicious package, the injected script executes in their browsers,
  potentially enabling session hijacking, credential theft, and unauthorized actions in the
  context of the victim.
