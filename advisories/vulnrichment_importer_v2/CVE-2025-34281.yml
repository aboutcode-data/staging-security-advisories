aliases: []
summary: ThingsBoard in versions prior to v4.2.1 allows an authenticated user to upload malicious
  SVG images via the "Image Gallery", leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
  The exploit can be triggered when any user accesses the public API endpoint of the malicious
  SVG images, or if the malicious images are embedded in an `iframe` element, during a widget
  creation, deployed to any page of the platform (e.g., dashboards), and accessed during normal
  operations. The vulnerability resides in the `ImageController`, which fails to restrict the
  execution of JavaScript code when an image is loaded by the user's browser. This vulnerability
  can lead to the execution of malicious code in the context of other users' sessions, potentially
  compromising their accounts and allowing unauthorized actions.
