aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  thermal/debugfs: Free all thermal zone debug memory on zone removal

  Because thermal_debug_tz_remove() does not free all memory allocated for
  thermal zone diagnostics, some of that memory becomes unreachable after
  freeing the thermal zone's struct thermal_debugfs object.

  Address this by making thermal_debug_tz_remove() free all of the memory
  in question.
