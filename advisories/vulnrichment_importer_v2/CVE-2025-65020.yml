aliases: []
summary: Rallly is an open-source scheduling and collaboration tool. Prior to version 4.5.4,
  an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in the poll duplication endpoint
  (/api/trpc/polls.duplicate) allows any authenticated user to duplicate polls they do not own
  by modifying the pollId parameter. This effectively bypasses access control and lets unauthorized
  users clone private or administrative polls. This issue has been patched in version 4.5.4.
