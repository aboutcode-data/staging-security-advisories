summary: A vulnerability in the web-based guest portal of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE)
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
  against a user of the web-based management interface. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  validation of user-supplied input that is processed by the web-based management interface.
