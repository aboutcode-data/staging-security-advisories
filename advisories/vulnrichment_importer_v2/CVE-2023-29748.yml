summary: Story Saver for Instragram - Video Downloader 1.0.6 for Android has an exposed component
  that provides a method to modify the SharedPreference file. An attacker can leverage this

  into memory when the application is opened. When an attacker injects too much data, the application
  will trigger an OOM error and crash at startup, resulting in a persistent denial of service.
