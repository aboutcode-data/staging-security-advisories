aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the remote access VPN feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance\
  \ (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated,\
  \ remote attacker to conduct a brute force attack in an attempt to identify valid username\
  \ and password combinations or an authenticated, remote attacker to establish a clientless\
  \ SSL VPN session with an unauthorized user.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper separation\
  \ of authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) between the remote access VPN feature\
  \ and the HTTPS management and site-to-site VPN features. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by specifying a default connection profile/tunnel group while conducting a brute force attack\
  \ or while establishing a clientless SSL VPN session using valid credentials. A successful\
  \ exploit could allow the attacker to achieve one or both of the following:\r\n\r \r Identify\
  \ valid credentials that could then be used to establish an unauthorized remote access VPN\
  \ session.\r Establish a clientless SSL VPN session (only when running Cisco ASA Software\
  \ Release 9.16 or earlier).\r \r Notes:\r\n\r \r Establishing a client-based remote access\
  \ VPN tunnel is not possible as these default connection profiles/tunnel groups do not and\
  \ cannot have an IP address pool configured.\r This vulnerability does not allow an attacker\
  \ to bypass authentication. To successfully establish a remote access VPN session, valid credentials\
  \ are required, including a valid second factor if multi-factor authentication (MFA) is configured.\r\
  \ \r Cisco will release software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds\
  \ that address this vulnerability."
