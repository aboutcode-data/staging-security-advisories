summary: A DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the SelfBest platform 2023.3
  allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a logged-in user's session

  application's client-side code being susceptible to direct DOM manipulation without adequate
  sanitization or a Content Security Policy (CSP), potentially leading to account takeover and
  data theft.
