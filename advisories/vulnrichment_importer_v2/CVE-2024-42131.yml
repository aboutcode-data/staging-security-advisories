  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mm: avoid overflows in dirty throttling logic

  The dirty throttling logic is interspersed with assumptions that dirty
  limits in PAGE_SIZE units fit into 32-bit (so that various multiplications
  fit into 64-bits).  If limits end up being larger, we will hit overflows,
  possible divisions by 0 etc.  Fix these problems by never allowing so
  large dirty limits as they have dubious practical value anyway.  For
  dirty_bytes / dirty_background_bytes interfaces we can just refuse to set
  so large limits.  For dirty_ratio / dirty_background_ratio it isn't so
  simple as the dirty limit is computed from the amount of available memory
  which can change due to memory hotplug etc.  So when converting dirty
  limits from ratios to numbers of pages, we just don't allow the result to
  exceed UINT_MAX.

  This is root-only triggerable problem which occurs when the operator
  sets dirty limits to >16 TB.
