summary: Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. Prior to version 3.1.3
  of the `stable` branch and version 3.2.0.beta3 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches,
  if a user has been quoted and uses a `|` in their full name, they might be able to trigger
  a bug that generates a lot of duplicate content in all the posts they've been quoted by updating
  their full name again. Version 3.1.3 of the `stable` branch and version 3.2.0.beta3 of the
  `beta` and `tests-passed` branches contain a patch for this issue. No known workaround exists,
  although one can stop the "bleeding" by ensuring users only use alphanumeric characters in
  their full name field.
