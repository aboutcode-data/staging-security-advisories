  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  tpm: Clean up TPM space after command failure

  tpm_dev_transmit prepares the TPM space before attempting command
  transmission. However if the command fails no rollback of this
  preparation is done. This can result in transient handles being leaked
  if the device is subsequently closed with no further commands performed.

  Fix this by flushing the space in the event of command transmission
  failure.
