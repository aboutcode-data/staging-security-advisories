aliases: []
summary: XWiki Platform Filter UI provides a generic user interface to convert from a XWiki
  Filter input stream to an output stream with settings for each stream. Starting with versions
  6.0-milestone-2 and 5.4.4 and prior to versions 12.10.11, 14.0-rc-1, 13.4.7, and 13.10.3,
  XWiki Platform Filter UI contains a possible cross-site scripting vector in the `Filter.FilterStreamDescriptorForm`
  wiki page related to pretty much all the form fields printed in the home page of the application.
  The issue is patched in versions 12.10.11, 14.0-rc-1, 13.4.7, and 13.10.3. The easiest workaround
  is to edit the wiki page `Filter.FilterStreamDescriptorForm` (with wiki editor) according
  to the instructions in the GitHub Security Advisory.
