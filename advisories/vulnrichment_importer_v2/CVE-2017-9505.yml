aliases: []
summary: Atlassian Confluence starting with 4.3.0 before 6.2.1 did not check if a user had permission
  to view a page when creating a workbox notification about new comments. An attacker who can
  login to Confluence could receive workbox notifications, which contain the content of comments,
  for comments added to a page after they started watching it even if they do not have permission
  to view the page itself.
