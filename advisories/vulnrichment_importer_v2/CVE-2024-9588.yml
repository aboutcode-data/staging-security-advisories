aliases: []
summary: The Category and Taxonomy Meta Fields plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to missing or incorrect
  nonce validation on the 'wpaft_option_page' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to add and delete taxonomy meta, granted they can trick a site administrator into
  performing an action such as clicking on a link.
