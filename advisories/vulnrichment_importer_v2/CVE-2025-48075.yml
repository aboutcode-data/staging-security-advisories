aliases: []
summary: Fiber is an Express-inspired web framework written in Go. Starting in version 2.52.6
  and prior to version 2.52.7, `fiber.Ctx.BodyParser` can map flat data to nested slices using
  `key[idx]value` syntax, but when idx is negative, it causes a panic instead of returning an
  error stating it cannot process the data. Since this data is user-provided, this could lead
  to denial of service for anyone relying on this `fiber.Ctx.BodyParser`  functionality. Version
  2.52.7 fixes the issue.
