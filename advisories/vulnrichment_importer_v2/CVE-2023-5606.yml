summary: 'The ChatBot for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the FAQ
  Builder in versions 4.8.6 through 4.9.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
  escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions
  and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
  an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
  has been disabled. NOTE: This vulnerability is a re-introduction of CVE-2023-4253.'
