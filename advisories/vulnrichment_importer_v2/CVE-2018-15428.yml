aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the implementation of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) functionality
  in Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial
  of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of certain BGP
  update messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending BGP update messages
  that include a specific, malformed attribute to be processed by an affected system. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to cause the BGP process to restart unexpectedly, resulting
  in a DoS condition. The Cisco implementation of BGP accepts incoming BGP traffic only from
  explicitly defined peers. To exploit this vulnerability, the malicious BGP update message
  would need to come from a configured, valid BGP peer, or would need to be injected by the
  attacker into the victim's BGP network on an existing, valid TCP connection to a BGP peer.
