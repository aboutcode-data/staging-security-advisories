aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the implementation of the cluster feature of Cisco IOS Software
  and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to trigger a denial
  of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper input
  validation when handling Cluster Management Protocol (CMP) messages. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by sending a malicious CMP message to an affected device. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to cause the switch to crash and reload or to hang, resulting
  in a DoS condition. If the switch hangs it will not reboot automatically, and it will need
  to be power cycled manually to recover.
