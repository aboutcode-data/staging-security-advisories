aliases: []
summary: The WordPress Survey & Poll – Quiz, Survey and Poll Plugin for WordPress plugin for
  WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'id' attribute of the 'survey' shortcode
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.5 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied
  parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to append additional
  SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information
  from the database.
