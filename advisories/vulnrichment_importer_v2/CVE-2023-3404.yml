aliases: []
summary: The ProfileGrid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized decryption of private
  information in versions up to, and including, 5.5.0. This is due to the passphrase and iv
  being hardcoded in the 'pm_encrypt_decrypt_pass' function and used across all sites running
  the plugin. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions
  or above to decrypt and view users' passwords. If combined with another vulnerability, this
  can potentially grant lower-privileged users access to users' passwords.
