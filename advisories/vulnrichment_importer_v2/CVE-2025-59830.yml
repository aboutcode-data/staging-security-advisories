aliases: []
summary: Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Prior to version 2.2.18, Rack::QueryParser
  enforces its params_limit only for parameters separated by &, while still splitting on both
  & and ;. As a result, attackers could use ; separators to bypass the parameter count limit
  and submit more parameters than intended. Applications or middleware that directly invoke
  Rack::QueryParser with its default configuration (no explicit delimiter) could be exposed
  to increased CPU and memory consumption. This can be abused as a limited denial-of-service
  vector. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.18.
