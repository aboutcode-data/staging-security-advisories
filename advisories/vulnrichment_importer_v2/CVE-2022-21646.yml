aliases: []
summary: SpiceDB is a database system for managing security-critical application permissions.
  Any user making use of a wildcard relationship under the right hand branch of an `exclusion`
  or within an `intersection` operation will see `Lookup`/`LookupResources` return a resource
  as "accessible" if it is *not* accessible by virtue of the inclusion of the wildcard in the
  intersection or the right side of the exclusion. In `v1.3.0`, the wildcard is ignored entirely
  in lookup's dispatch, resulting in the `banned` wildcard being ignored in the exclusion. Version
  1.4.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, don't make use of wildcards on the
  right side of intersections or within exclusions.
