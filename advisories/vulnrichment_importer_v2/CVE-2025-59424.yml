aliases: []
summary: LinkAce is a self-hosted archive to collect website links. Prior to 2.3.1, a Stored
  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified on the /system/audit page. The
  application fails to properly sanitize the username field before it is rendered in the audit
  log. An authenticated attacker can set a malicious JavaScript payload as their username. When
  an action performed by this user is recorded (e.g., generate or revoke an API token), the
  payload is stored in the database. The script is then executed in the browser of any user,
  particularly administrators, who views the /system/audit page. This vulnerability is fixed
  in 2.3.1.
