aliases: []
summary: SiYuan is a personal knowledge management system. Prior to version 3.5.5, the /api/file/copyFile
  endpoint does not validate the dest parameter, allowing authenticated users to write files
  to arbitrary locations on the filesystem. This can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) by
  writing to sensitive locations such as cron jobs, SSH authorized_keys, or shell configuration
  files. This issue has been patched in version 3.5.5.
