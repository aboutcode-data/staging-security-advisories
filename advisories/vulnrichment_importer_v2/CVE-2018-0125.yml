aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the web interface of the Cisco RV132W ADSL2+ Wireless-N VPN and
  RV134W VDSL2 Wireless-AC VPN Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute
  arbitrary code and gain full control of an affected system, including issuing commands with
  root privileges. The attacker could also cause an affected system to reload, resulting in
  a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to an incomplete input validation
  on user-controlled input in an HTTP request to the targeted device. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected system. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user and gain full control
  of the affected system or cause it to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability
  is fixed in firmware version 1.0.1.11 for the following Cisco products: RV132W ADSL2+ Wireless-N
  VPN Router and RV134W VDSL2 Wireless-AC VPN Router. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg92737, CSCvh60170.'
