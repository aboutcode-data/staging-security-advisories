summary: The Appsero Helper plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation

  settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site
  administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
