summary: Signal Handler Race Condition vulnerability in Mitsubishi Electric India GC-ENET-COM
  whose first 2 digits of 11-digit serial number of unit are "16" allows a remote unauthenticated
  attacker to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition in Ethernet communication by sending
  a large number of specially crafted packets to any UDP port when GC-ENET-COM is configured
  as a Modbus TCP Server. The communication resumes only when the power of the main unit is
  turned off and on or when the GC-ENET-COM is hot-swapped from the main unit.
