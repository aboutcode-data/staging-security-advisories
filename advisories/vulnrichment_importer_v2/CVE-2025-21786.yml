  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  workqueue: Put the pwq after detaching the rescuer from the pool

  The commit 68f83057b913("workqueue: Reap workers via kthread_stop() and
  remove detach_completion") adds code to reap the normal workers but
  mistakenly does not handle the rescuer and also removes the code waiting
  for the rescuer in put_unbound_pool(), which caused a use-after-free bug
  reported by Cheung Wall.

  To avoid the use-after-free bug, the pool’s reference must be held until
  the detachment is complete. Therefore, move the code that puts the pwq
  after detaching the rescuer from the pool.
