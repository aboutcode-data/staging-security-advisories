aliases: []
summary: In danny-avila/librechat version 0.7.9, there is an insecure API design issue in the
  2-Factor Authentication (2FA) flow. The system allows users to disable 2FA without requiring
  a valid OTP or backup code, bypassing the intended verification process. This vulnerability
  occurs because the backend does not properly validate the OTP or backup code when the API
  endpoint '/api/auth/2fa/disable' is directly accessed. This flaw can be exploited by authenticated
  users to weaken the security of their own accounts, although it does not lead to full account
  compromise.
