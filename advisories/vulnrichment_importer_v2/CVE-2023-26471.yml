aliases: []
summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 11.6-rc-1, comments
  are supposed to be executed with the right of superadmin but in restricted mode (anything
  dangerous is disabled), but the async macro does not take into account the restricted mode.
  This means that any user with comment right can use the async macro to make it execute any
  wiki content with the right of superadmin. This has been patched in XWiki 14.9, 14.4.6, and
  13.10.10. The only known workaround consists of applying a patch and rebuilding and redeploying
  `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-rendering-async-macro`.
