  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/amd/display: Handle dml allocation failure to avoid crash

  [Why]
  In the case where a dml allocation fails for any reason, the
  current state's dml contexts would no longer be valid. Then
  subsequent calls dc_state_copy_internal would shallow copy
  invalid memory and if the new state was released, a double
  free would occur.

  [How]
  Reset dml pointers in new_state to NULL and avoid invalid
  pointer

  (cherry picked from commit bcafdc61529a48f6f06355d78eb41b3aeda5296c)
