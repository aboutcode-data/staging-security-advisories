aliases: []
summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications
  built on top of it. By creating a conflict when another user with more rights is currently
  editing a page, it is possible to execute JavaScript snippets on the side of the other user,
  which compromises the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation.
  This has been patched in XWiki 15.10.8 and 16.3.0RC1.
