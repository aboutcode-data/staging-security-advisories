summary: The Login/Signup Popup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due
  to missing capability checks on several functions in versions up to, and including, 1.4. This
  makes it possible for authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts into the plugin
  settings that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such
  as clicking on a link.
