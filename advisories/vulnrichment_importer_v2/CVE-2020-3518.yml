aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Data Center Network
  Manager (DCNM) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface of the affected software. The vulnerability
  exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied
  input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface
  to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
  script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
