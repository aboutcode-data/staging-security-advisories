summary: 'Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in search.php in Google Custom Search Engine
  allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the q parameter.  NOTE:
  this issue is disputed by the Google Security Team, who states that "Google does not provide
  the ''search.php'' script referenced.  When a user creates a custom search engine, we provide
  them with a block of javascript to include on their site.  Some users write additional code
  around this block of javascript to further customize their website.'
