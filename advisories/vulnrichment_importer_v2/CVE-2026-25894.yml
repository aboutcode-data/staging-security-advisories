aliases: []
summary: FUXA is a web-based Process Visualization (SCADA/HMI/Dashboard) software. An insecure
  default configuration in FUXA allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain administrative
  access and execute arbitrary code on the server. This affects FUXA through version 1.2.9 when
  authentication is enabled, but the administrator JWT secret is not configured. This issue
  has been patched in FUXA version 1.2.10.
