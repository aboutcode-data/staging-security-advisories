aliases: []
summary: Starting from 2.53.6, 2.54.3, and 2.55.0, Zitadel only required multi factor authentication
  in case the login policy has either enabled requireMFA or requireMFAForLocalUsers. If a user
  has set up MFA without this requirement, Zitadel would consider single factor auhtenticated
  sessions as valid as well and not require multiple factors. Bypassing second authentication
  factors weakens multifactor authentication and enables attackers to bypass the more secure
  factor. An attacker can target the TOTP code alone, only six digits, bypassing password verification
  entirely and potentially compromising accounts with 2FA enabled. This vulnerability is fixed
  in 4.6.0, 3.4.3, and 2.71.18.
