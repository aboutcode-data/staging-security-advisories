aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the software image verification functionality of Cisco IOS XE Software
  for Cisco Catalyst 9200 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, physical attacker
  to execute unsigned code at system boot time. This vulnerability is due to an improper check
  in the code function that manages the verification of the digital signatures of system image
  files during the initial boot process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by loading
  unsigned software on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
  boot a malicious software image or execute unsigned code and bypass the image verification
  check part of the boot process of the affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the
  attacker needs either unauthenticated physical access to the device or privileged access to
  the root shell on the device. Note: In Cisco IOS XE Software releases 16.11.1 and later, root
  shell access is protected by the Consent Token mechanism. However, an attacker with level-15
  privileges could easily downgrade the Cisco IOS XE Software running on a device to a release
  where root shell access is more readily available.'
