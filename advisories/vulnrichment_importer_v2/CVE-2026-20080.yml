summary: "A vulnerability in the SSH service of Cisco IEC6400 Wireless Backhaul Edge Compute\
  \ Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the SSH service to stop\
  \ responding.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the SSH service lacks effective flood\
  \ protection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by initiating a denial of service\
  \ (DoS) attack against the SSH port. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause\
  \ the SSH service to be unresponsive during the period of the DoS attack. All other operations\
  \ remain stable during the attack."
