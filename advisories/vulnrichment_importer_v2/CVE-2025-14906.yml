summary: The WP Youtube Video Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to missing nonce verification

  attackers to modify plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
