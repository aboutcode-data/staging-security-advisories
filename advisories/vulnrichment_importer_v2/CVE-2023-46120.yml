aliases: []
summary: The RabbitMQ Java client library allows Java and JVM-based applications to connect
  to and interact with RabbitMQ nodes. `maxBodyLebgth` was not used when receiving Message objects.  Attackers
  could send a very large Message causing a memory overflow and triggering an OOM Error. Users
  of RabbitMQ may suffer from  DoS attacks from RabbitMQ Java client which will ultimately exhaust
  the memory of the consumer. This vulnerability was patched in version 5.18.0.
