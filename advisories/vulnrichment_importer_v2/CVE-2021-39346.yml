aliases: []
summary: The Google Maps Easy WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  due to insufficient input validation and sanitization via several parameters found in the
  ~/modules/marker_groups/views/tpl/mgrEditMarkerGroup.php file which allowed attackers with
  administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including
  1.9.33. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators,
  and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled.
