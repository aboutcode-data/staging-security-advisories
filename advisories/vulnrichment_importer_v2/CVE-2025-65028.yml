aliases: []
summary: Rallly is an open-source scheduling and collaboration tool. Prior to version 4.5.4,
  an insecure direct object reference (IDOR) vulnerability allows any authenticated user to
  modify other participants’ votes in polls without authorization. The backend relies solely
  on the participantId parameter to identify which votes to update, without verifying ownership
  or poll permissions. This allows an attacker to alter poll results in their favor, directly
  compromising data integrity. This issue has been patched in version 4.5.4.
