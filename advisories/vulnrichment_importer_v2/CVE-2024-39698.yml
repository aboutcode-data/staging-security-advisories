aliases: []
summary: electron-updater allows for automatic updates for Electron apps. The file `packages/electron-updater/src/windowsExecutableCodeSignatureVerifier.ts`
  implements the signature validation routine for Electron applications on Windows. Because
  of the surrounding shell, a first pass by `cmd.exe` expands any environment variable found
  in command-line above. This creates a situation where `verifySignature()` can be tricked into
  validating the certificate of a different file than the one that was just downloaded. If the
  step is successful, the malicious update will be executed even if its signature is invalid.
  This attack assumes a compromised update manifest (server compromise, Man-in-the-Middle attack
  if fetched over HTTP, Cross-Site Scripting to point the application to a malicious updater
  server, etc.). The patch is available starting from 6.3.0-alpha.6.
