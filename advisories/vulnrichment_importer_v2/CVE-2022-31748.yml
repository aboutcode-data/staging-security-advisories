aliases: []
summary: Mozilla developers Gabriele Svelto, Timothy Nikkel, Randell Jesup, Jon Coppeard, and
  the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 100. Some of these
  bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these
  could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 101.
