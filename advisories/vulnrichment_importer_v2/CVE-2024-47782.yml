aliases: []
summary: WikiDiscover is an extension designed for use with a CreateWiki managed farm to display
  wikis. Special:WikiDiscover is a special page that lists all wikis on the wiki farm. However,
  the special page does not make any effort to escape the wiki name or description. Therefore,
  if a wiki sets its name and/or description to an XSS payload, the XSS will execute whenever
  the wiki is shown on Special:WikiDiscover. This issue has been patched with commit `2ce846dd93`
  and all users are advised to apply that patch. User unable to upgrade should block access
  to `Special:WikiDiscover`.
