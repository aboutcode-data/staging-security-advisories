aliases: []
summary: gnark is a zero-knowledge proof system framework. In versions prior to 0.14.0, the
  Verify function in eddsa.go and ecdsa.go used the S value from a signature without asserting
  that 0 ≤ S < order, leading to a signature malleability vulnerability. Because gnark’s native
  EdDSA and ECDSA circuits lack essential constraints, multiple distinct witnesses can satisfy
  the same public inputs. In protocols where nullifiers or anti-replay checks are derived from
  R and S, this enables signature malleability and may allow double spending. This issue has
  been addressed in version 0.14.0.
