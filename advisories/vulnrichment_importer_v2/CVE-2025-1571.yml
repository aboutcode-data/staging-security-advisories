aliases: []
summary: The Exclusive Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the plugin's Animated Text and Image Comparison Widgets in all versions up to,
  and including, 2.7.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied
  attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access
  and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
  an injected page.
