  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  leds: an30259a: Use devm_mutex_init() for mutex initialization

  In this driver LEDs are registered using devm_led_classdev_register()
  so they are automatically unregistered after module's remove() is done.
  led_classdev_unregister() calls module's led_set_brightness() to turn off
  the LEDs and that callback uses mutex which was destroyed already
  in module's remove() so use devm API instead.
