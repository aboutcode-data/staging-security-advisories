aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the data acquisition (DAQ) component of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense
  (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass configured access
  control policies or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability exists because
  the affected software improperly manages system memory resources when inspecting traffic.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by generating specific traffic patterns for the
  software to inspect. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust system memory
  resources used for traffic inspection. Depending on the configuration, the FTD Software could
  fail open and cease to inspect traffic or fail closed and result in a DoS condition. This
  vulnerability may require manual intervention to restore the software.
