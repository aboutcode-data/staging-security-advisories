summary: 'A vulnerability in the 802.11 frame validation functionality of the Cisco Wireless
  LAN Controller (WLC) could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause an affected
  device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability
  is due to incomplete input validation of certain 802.11 management information element frames
  that an affected device receives from wireless clients. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a malformed 802.11 management frame to an affected device. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in
  a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects only Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers that are running
  Cisco Mobility Express Release 8.5.103.0. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg07024.'
