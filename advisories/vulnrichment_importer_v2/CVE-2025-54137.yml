aliases: []
summary: HAX CMS NodeJS allows users to manage their microsite universe with a NodeJS backend.
  Versions 11.0.9 and below were distributed with hardcoded default credentials for the user
  and superuser accounts. Additionally, the application has default private keys for JWTs. Users
  aren't prompted to change credentials or secrets during installation, and there is no way
  to change them through the UI. An unauthenticated attacker can read the default user credentials
  and JWT private keys from the public haxtheweb GitHub repositories. These credentials and
  keys can be used to access unconfigured self-hosted instances of the application, modify sites,
  and perform further attacks. This is fixed in version 11.0.10.
