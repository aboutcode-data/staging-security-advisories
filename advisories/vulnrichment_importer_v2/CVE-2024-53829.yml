aliases: []
summary: "CodeChecker is an analyzer tooling, defect database and viewer extension for the Clang\
  \ Static Analyzer and Clang Tidy. \nCross-site request forgery allows an unauthenticated attacker\
  \ to hijack the authentication of a logged in user, and use the web API with the same permissions, including\
  \ but not limited to adding, removing or editing products. The attacker needs to know the\
  \ ID of the available products to modify or delete them. The attacker cannot directly exfiltrate\
  \ data (view) from CodeChecker, due to being limited to form-based CSRF.\n\nThis issue affects\
  \ CodeChecker: through 6.24.4."
