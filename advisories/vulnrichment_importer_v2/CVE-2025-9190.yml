aliases: []
summary: "The configuration of Cursor on macOS, specifically the \"RunAsNode\" fuse enabled,\
  \ allows a local attacker with unprivileged access to execute arbitrary code that inherits\
  \ Cursor TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) permissions. \nAcquired resource access\
  \ is limited to previously granted permissions by the user. Accessing other resources beyond\
  \ previously granted TCC permissions will prompt the user for approval in the name of Cursor,\
  \ potentially disguising attacker's malicious intent. \n\nThis issue was detected in 15.4.1\
  \ version of Cursor. Project maintainers decided not to fix this issue, because a scenario\
  \ including a local attacker falls outside their defined threat model."
