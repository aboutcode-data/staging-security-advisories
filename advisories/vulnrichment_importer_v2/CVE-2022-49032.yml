  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  iio: health: afe4404: Fix oob read in afe4404_[read|write]_raw

  KASAN report out-of-bounds read as follows:

  BUG: KASAN: global-out-of-bounds in afe4404_read_raw+0x2ce/0x380
  Read of size 4 at addr ffffffffc00e4658 by task cat/278

  Call Trace:
   afe4404_read_raw
   iio_read_channel_info
   dev_attr_show

  The buggy address belongs to the variable:
   afe4404_channel_leds+0x18/0xffffffffffffe9c0

  This issue can be reproduce by singe command:

   $ cat /sys/bus/i2c/devices/0-0058/iio\:device0/in_intensity6_raw

  The array size of afe4404_channel_leds and afe4404_channel_offdacs
  are less than channels, so access with chan->address cause OOB read
  in afe4404_[read|write]_raw. Fix it by moving access before use them.
