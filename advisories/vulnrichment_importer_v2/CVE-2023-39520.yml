aliases: []
summary: Cryptomator encrypts data being stored on cloud infrastructure. The MSI installer provided
  on the homepage for Cryptomator version 1.9.2 allows local privilege escalation for low privileged
  users, via the `repair` function. The problem occurs as the repair function of the MSI is
  spawning an SYSTEM Powershell without the `-NoProfile` parameter. Therefore the profile of
  the user starting the repair will be loaded. Version 1.9.3 contains a fix for this issue.
  Adding a `-NoProfile` to the powershell is a possible workaround.
