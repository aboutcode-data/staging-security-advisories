aliases: []
summary: 'The cryptocurrency wallet entropy seeding mechanism used in Libbitcoin Explorer 3.0.0
  through 3.6.0 is weak, aka the Milk Sad issue. The use of an mt19937 Mersenne Twister PRNG
  restricts the internal entropy to 32 bits regardless of settings. This allows remote attackers
  to recover any wallet private keys generated from "bx seed" entropy output and steal funds.
  (Affected users need to move funds to a secure new cryptocurrency wallet.) NOTE: the vendor''s
  position is that there was sufficient documentation advising against "bx seed" but others
  disagree. NOTE: this was exploited in the wild in June and July 2023.'
