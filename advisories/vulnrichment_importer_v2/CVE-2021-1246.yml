summary: "Cisco Finesse, Cisco Virtualized Voice Browser, and Cisco Unified CVP OpenSocial Gadget\
  \ Editor Unauthenticated Access Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web management\
  \ interface of Cisco Finesse, Cisco Virtualized Voice Browser, and Cisco Unified CVP could\
  \ allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access the OpenSocial Gadget Editor without\
  \ providing valid user credentials.\r\nThe vulnerability is due to missing authentication\
  \ for a specific section of the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit\
  \ this vulnerability by accessing a crafted URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker\
  \ to obtain access to a section of the interface, which they could use to obtain potentially\
  \ confidential information and create arbitrary XML files.\r\nCisco&nbsp;has released software\
  \ updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
