aliases: []
summary: 'Bouncy Castle for Java before 1.73 contains a potential Denial of Service (DoS) issue
  within the Bouncy Castle org.bouncycastle.openssl.PEMParser class. This class parses OpenSSL
  PEM encoded streams containing X.509 certificates, PKCS8 encoded keys, and PKCS7 objects.
  Parsing a file that has crafted ASN.1 data through the PEMParser causes an OutOfMemoryError,
  which can enable a denial of service attack. (For users of the FIPS Java API: BC-FJA 1.0.2.3
  and earlier are affected; BC-FJA 1.0.2.4 is fixed.)'
