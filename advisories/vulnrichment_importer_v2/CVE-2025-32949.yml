aliases: []
summary: "This vulnerability allows any authenticated user to cause the server to consume very\
  \ large amounts of disk space when extracting a Zip Bomb. \n\nIf user import is enabled (which\
  \ is the default setting), any registered user can upload an archive for importing. The code\
  \ uses the yauzl library for reading the archive. The yauzl library does not contain any mechanism\
  \ to detect or prevent extraction of a  Zip Bomb https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb .\
  \ Therefore, when using the User Import functionality with a Zip Bomb, PeerTube will try extracting\
  \ the archive which will cause a disk space resource exhaustion."
