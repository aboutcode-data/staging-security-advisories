  libfs: fix get_stashed_dentry()

  get_stashed_dentry() tries to optimistically retrieve a stashed dentry
  from a provided location.  It needs to ensure to hold rcu lock before it
  dereference the stashed location to prevent UAF issues.  Use
  rcu_dereference() instead of READ_ONCE() it's effectively equivalent
  with some lockdep bells and whistles and it communicates clearly that
  this expects rcu protection.
