aliases: []
summary: Socket.IO is an open source, real-time, bidirectional, event-based, communication framework.
  A specially crafted Socket.IO packet can trigger an uncaught exception on the Socket.IO server,
  thus killing the Node.js process. This issue is fixed by commit `15af22fc22` which has been
  included in `socket.io@4.6.2` (released in May 2023). The fix was backported in the 2.x branch
  as well with commit `d30630ba10`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may
  attach a listener for the "error" event to catch these errors.
