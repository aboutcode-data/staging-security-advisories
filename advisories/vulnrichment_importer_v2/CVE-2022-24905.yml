summary: Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. A vulnerability
  was found in Argo CD prior to versions 2.3.4, 2.2.9, and 2.1.15 that allows an attacker to
  spoof error messages on the login screen when single sign on (SSO) is enabled. In order to
  exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to trick the victim to visit a specially
  crafted URL which contains the message to be displayed. As far as the research of the Argo
  CD team concluded, it is not possible to specify any active content (e.g. Javascript) or other
  HTML fragments (e.g. clickable links) in the spoofed message. A patch for this vulnerability
  has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.4, 2.2.9, and 2.1.15. There are currently no known
  workarounds.
