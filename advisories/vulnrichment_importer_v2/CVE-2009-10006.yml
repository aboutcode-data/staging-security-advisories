aliases: []
summary: 'UFO: Alien Invasion versions up to and including 2.2.1 contain a buffer overflow vulnerability
  in its built-in IRC client component. When the client connects to an IRC server and receives
  a crafted numeric reply (specifically a 001 message), the application fails to properly validate
  the length of the response string. This results in a stack-based buffer overflow, which may
  corrupt control flow structures and allow arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability is triggered
  during automatic IRC connection handling and does not require user interaction beyond launching
  the game.'
