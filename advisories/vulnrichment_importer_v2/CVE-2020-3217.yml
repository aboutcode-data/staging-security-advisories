aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Topology Discovery Service of Cisco One Platform Kit (onePK)
  in Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, and Cisco NX-OS Software
  could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial
  of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  length restrictions when the onePK Topology Discovery Service parses Cisco Discovery Protocol
  messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery
  Protocol message to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a stack
  overflow, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges,
  or to cause a process crash, which could result in a reload of the device and cause a DoS
  condition.
