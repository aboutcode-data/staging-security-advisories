datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2026-3179

aliases: []
summary: |
  The FTP Backup on the ADM does not properly sanitize filenames received from the FTP server when parsing directory listings. A malicious server or MITM attacker can craft filenames containing path traversal sequences, causing the client to write files outside the intended backup directory. A path traversal vulnerability may allow an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the system and potentially achieve privilege escalation or remote code execution.
  Affected products and versions include: from ADM 4.1.0 through ADM 4.3.3.ROF1 as well as from ADM 5.0.0 through ADM 5.1.2.RE51.
