aliases: []
summary: The Blog-in-Blog plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the 'blog_in_blog' shortcode in versions up to, and including, 1.1.1 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers with editor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web
  scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
