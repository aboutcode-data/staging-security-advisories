aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in a CLI command related to the virtualization manager (VMAN) in Cisco
  NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands
  on the underlying Linux operating system with root privileges. The vulnerability is due to
  insufficient validation of arguments passed to a specific VMAN CLI command on an affected
  device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including malicious input as the argument
  of an affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
  commands on the underlying Linux operating system with root privileges, which may lead to
  complete system compromise. An attacker would need valid administrator credentials to exploit
  this vulnerability.
