aliases: []
summary: Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. Prior to version 2.0.72, due to an error in
  command parsing, it was possible to bypass the Claude Code confirmation prompt to trigger
  execution of untrusted commands through the find command. Reliably exploiting this required
  the ability to add untrusted content into a Claude Code context window. This issue has been
  patched in version 2.0.72.
