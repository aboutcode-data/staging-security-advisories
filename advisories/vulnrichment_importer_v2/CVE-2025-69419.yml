  Issue summary: Calling PKCS12_get_friendlyname() function on a maliciously
  crafted PKCS#12 file with a BMPString (UTF-16BE) friendly name containing
  non-ASCII BMP code point can trigger a one byte write before the allocated
  buffer.

  Impact summary: The out-of-bounds write can cause a memory corruption
  which can have various consequences including a Denial of Service.

  The OPENSSL_uni2utf8() function performs a two-pass conversion of a PKCS#12
  BMPString (UTF-16BE) to UTF-8. In the second pass, when emitting UTF-8 bytes,
  the helper function bmp_to_utf8() incorrectly forwards the remaining UTF-16
  source byte count as the destination buffer capacity to UTF8_putc(). For BMP
  code points above U+07FF, UTF-8 requires three bytes, but the forwarded
  capacity can be just two bytes. UTF8_putc() then returns -1, and this negative
  value is added to the output length without validation, causing the
  length to become negative. The subsequent trailing NUL byte is then written
  at a negative offset, causing write outside of heap allocated buffer.

  The vulnerability is reachable via the public PKCS12_get_friendlyname() API
  when parsing attacker-controlled PKCS#12 files. While PKCS12_parse() uses a
  different code path that avoids this issue, PKCS12_get_friendlyname() directly
  invokes the vulnerable function. Exploitation requires an attacker to provide
  a malicious PKCS#12 file to be parsed by the application and the attacker
  can just trigger a one zero byte write before the allocated buffer.
  For that reason the issue was assessed as Low severity according to our
  Security Policy.

  The FIPS modules in 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue,
  as the PKCS#12 implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary.

  OpenSSL 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.0 and 1.1.1 are vulnerable to this issue.

  OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not affected by this issue.
