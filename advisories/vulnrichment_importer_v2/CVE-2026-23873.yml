aliases: []
summary: hustoj is an open source online judge based on PHP/C++/MySQL/Linux for ACM/ICPC and
  NOIP training. All versions are vulnerable to CSV Injection (Formula Injection) through the
  contest rank export functionality (contestrank.xls.php and admin/ranklist_export.php). The
  application fails to sanitize user-supplied input (specifically the "Nickname" field) before
  exporting it to an .xls file (which renders as an HTML table but is opened by Excel). If a
  malicious user sets their nickname to an Excel formula when an administrator exports and opens
  the rank list in Microsoft Excel, the formula will be executed. This can lead to arbitrary
  command execution (RCE) on the administrator's machine or data exfiltration. A fix was not
  available at the time of publication.
