aliases: []
summary: The AdForest theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account
  takeover in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.6. This is due to the plugin not properly
  validating a user's identity prior to updating their password through the adforest_reset_password()
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's
  passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.
