aliases: []
summary: An OS command injection vulnerability exists in sar2html version 3.2.2 and prior via
  the plot parameter in index.php. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before
  using it in a system-level context. Remote, unauthenticated attackers can inject shell commands
  by appending them to the plot parameter (e.g., ?plot=;id) in a crafted GET request. The output
  of the command is displayed in the application's interface after interacting with the host
  selection UI. Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary command execution on the underlying
  system. Exploitation evidence was observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2025-02-04 UTC.
