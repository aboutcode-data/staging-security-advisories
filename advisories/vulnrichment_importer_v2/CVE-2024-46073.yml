aliases: []
summary: A reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the login page of IceHRM
  v32.4.0.OS. The vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of the "next" parameter, which
  is included in the application's response without adequate escaping. An attacker can exploit
  this flaw by tricking a user into visiting a specially crafted URL, causing the execution
  of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. The issue occurs even
  though the application has sanitization mechanisms in place.
