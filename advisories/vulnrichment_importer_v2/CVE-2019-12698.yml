aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the WebVPN feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software
  and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to cause increased CPU utilization on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to excessive
  processing load for a specific WebVPN HTTP page request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending multiple WebVPN HTTP page load requests for a specific URL. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to increase CPU load on the device, resulting in a denial of service
  (DoS) condition, which could cause traffic to be delayed through the device.
