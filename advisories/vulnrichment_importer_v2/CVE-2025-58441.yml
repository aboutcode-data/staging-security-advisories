summary: Knowage is an open source analytics and business intelligence suite. Prior to version
  8.1.37, there is a blind server-side request forgery vulnerability. The vulnerability allows
  attackers to send requests to arbitrary hosts/paths. Since the attacker is not able to read
  the response, the impact of this vulnerability is limited. However, an attacker should be
  able to leverage this vulnerability to scan the internal network. This issue has been patched
  in version 8.1.37.
