aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in Kroxylicious. When establishing the connection with the upstream
  Kafka server using a TLS secured connection, Kroxylicious fails to properly verify the server's
  hostname, resulting in an insecure connection. For a successful attack to be performed, the
  attacker needs to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack or compromise any external systems, such
  as DNS or network routing configuration. This issue is considered a high complexity attack,
  with additional high privileges required, as the attack would need access to the Kroxylicious
  configuration or a peer system. The result of a successful attack impacts both data integrity
  and confidentiality.
