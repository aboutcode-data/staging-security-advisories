aliases: []
summary: n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. Prior to versions 2.10.1, 2.9.3,
  and 1.123.22, a second-order expression injection vulnerability existed in n8n's Form nodes
  that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to inject and evaluate arbitrary n8n expressions
  by submitting crafted form data. When chained with an expression sandbox escape, this could
  escalate to remote code execution on the n8n host. The vulnerability requires a specific workflow
  configuration to be exploitable. First, a form node with a field interpolating a value provided
  by an unauthenticated user, e.g. a form submitted value. Second, the field value must begin
  with an `=` character, which caused n8n to treat it as an expression and triggered a double-evaluation
  of the field content. There is no practical reason for a workflow designer to prefix a field
  with `=` intentionally — the character is not rendered in the output, so the result would
  not match the designer's expectations. If added accidentally, it would be noticeable and very
  unlikely to persist. An unauthenticated attacker would need to either know about this specific
  circumstance on a target instance or discover a matching form by chance. Even when the preconditions
  are met, the expression injection alone is limited to data accessible within the n8n expression
  context. Escalation to remote code execution requires chaining with a separate sandbox escape
  vulnerability. The issue has been fixed in n8n versions 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and 1.123.22. Users
  should upgrade to one of these versions or later to remediate the vulnerability. If upgrading
  is not immediately possible, administrators should consider the following temporary mitigations.
  Review usage of form nodes manually for above mentioned preconditions, disable the Form node
  by adding `n8n-nodes-base.form` to the `NODES_EXCLUDE` environment variable, and/or disable
  the Form Trigger node by adding `n8n-nodes-base.formTrigger` to the `NODES_EXCLUDE` environment
  variable. These workarounds do not fully remediate the risk and should only be used as short-term
  mitigation measures.
