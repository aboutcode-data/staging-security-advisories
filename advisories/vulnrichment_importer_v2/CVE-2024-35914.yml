  nfsd: Fix error cleanup path in nfsd_rename()

  Commit a8b0026847b8 ("rename(): avoid a deadlock in the case of parents
  having no common ancestor") added an error bail out path. However this
  path does not drop the remount protection that has been acquired. Fix
  the cleanup path to properly drop the remount protection.
