aliases: []
summary: A path traversal vulnerability exists in mlflow/mlflow version 2.15.1. When users configure
  and use the dbfs service, concatenating the URL directly into the file protocol results in
  an arbitrary file read vulnerability. This issue occurs because only the path part of the
  URL is checked, while parts such as query and parameters are not handled. The vulnerability
  is triggered if the user has configured the dbfs service, and during usage, the service is
  mounted to a local directory.
