aliases: []
summary: The Simple Pricing Tables For WPBakery Page Builder(Formerly Visual Composer) plugin
  for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'wdo_simple_pricing_table_free'
  shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.0 due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
  that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
