aliases: []
summary: Yet Another UserAgent Analyzer (Yauaa) is a java library that tries to parse and analyze
  the useragent string and extract as many relevant attributes as possible. Applications using
  the Client Hints analysis feature introduced with 7.0.0 can crash because the Yauaa library
  throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. If uncaught the exception will result in a program
  crash. Applications that do not use this feature are not affected. Users are advised to upgrade
  to version 7.9.0. Users unable to upgrade may catch and discard any ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
  thrown by the Yauaa library.
