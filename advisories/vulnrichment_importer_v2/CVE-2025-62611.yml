aliases: []
summary: aiomysql is a library for accessing a MySQL database from the asyncio. Prior to version
  0.3.0, the client-side settings are not checked before sending local files to MySQL server,
  which allows obtaining arbitrary files from the client using a rogue server. It is possible
  to create a rogue MySQL server that emulates authorization, ignores client flags and requests
  arbitrary files from the client by sending a LOAD_LOCAL instruction packet. This issue has
  been patched in version 0.3.0.
