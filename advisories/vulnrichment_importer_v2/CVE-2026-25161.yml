aliases: []
summary: Alist is a file list program that supports multiple storages, powered by Gin and Solidjs.
  Prior to version 3.57.0, the application contains path traversal vulnerability in multiple
  file operation handlers. An authenticated attacker can bypass directory-level authorisation
  by injecting traversal sequences into filename components, enabling unauthorised file removal,
  movement and copying across user boundaries within the same storage mount. This issue has
  been patched in version 3.57.0.
