aliases: []
summary: "Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability\
  \ in Apache Tomcat. When processing an HTTP/2 stream, Tomcat did not handle some cases of\
  \ excessive HTTP headers correctly. This led to a miscounting of active HTTP/2 streams which\
  \ in turn led to the use of an incorrect infinite timeout which allowed connections to remain\
  \ open which should have been closed.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1\
  \ through 11.0.0-M20, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.24, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.89.\n\nThe\
  \ following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are \nknown to be affected:\
  \ 8.5.0 though 8.5.100. Other EOL versions may also be affected.\n\n\nUsers are recommended\
  \ to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M21, 10.1.25 or 9.0.90, which fixes the issue."
