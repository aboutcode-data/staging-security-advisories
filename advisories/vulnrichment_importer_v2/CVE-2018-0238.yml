aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the role-based resource checking functionality of the Cisco Unified
  Computing System (UCS) Director could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view unauthorized
  information for any virtual machine in the UCS Director end-user portal and perform any permitted
  operations on any virtual machine. The permitted operations can be configured for the end
  user on the virtual machines with either of the following settings: The virtual machine is
  associated to a Virtual Data Center (VDC) that has an end user self-service policy attached
  to the VDC. The end user role has VM Management Actions settings configured under User Permissions.
  This is a global configuration, so all the virtual machines visible in the end-user portal
  will have the VM management actions available. The vulnerability is due to improper user authentication
  checks. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the UCS Director with
  a modified username and valid password. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain
  visibility into and perform actions against all virtual machines in the UCS Director end-user
  portal of the affected system. This vulnerability affects Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS)
  Director releases 6.0 and 6.5 prior to patch 3 that are in a default configuration. Cisco
