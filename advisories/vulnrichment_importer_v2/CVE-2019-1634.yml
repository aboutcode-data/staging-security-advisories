aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) of Cisco Integrated
  Management Controller (IMC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary
  commands that are executed with root privileges on the underlying operating system (OS). The
  vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of user-supplied commands. An attacker
  who has administrator privileges and access to the network where the IPMI resides could exploit
  this vulnerability by submitting crafted input to the affected commands. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to gain root privileges on the affected device.
