aliases: []
summary: A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the omec-project UPF (pfcpiface component)
  in version upf-epc-pfcpiface:2.1.3-dev. After PFCP association, a specially crafted PFCP Session
  Establishment Request with a CreatePDR that contains a malformed Flow-Description is not robustly
  validated. The Flow-Description parser (parseFlowDesc) can read beyond the bounds of the provided
  buffer, causing a panic and terminating the UPF process. An attacker who can send PFCP Session
  Establishment Request messages to the UPF's N4/PFCP endpoint can exploit this issue to repeatedly
  crash the UPF.
