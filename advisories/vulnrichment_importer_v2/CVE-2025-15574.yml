aliases: []
summary: When connecting to the Solax Cloud MQTT server the username is the "registration number",
  which is the 10 character string printed on the SolaX Power Pocket device / the QR code on
  the device. The password is derived from the "registration number" using a proprietary XOR/transposition
  algorithm. Attackers with the knowledge of the registration numbers can connect to the MQTT
  server and impersonate the dongle / inverters.
