aliases: []
summary: OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. The ERC721Consecutive
  contract designed for minting NFTs in batches does not update balances when a batch has size
  1 and consists of a single token. Subsequent transfers from the receiver of that token may
  overflow the balance as reported by `balanceOf`. The issue exclusively presents with batches
  of size 1. The issue has been patched in 4.8.2.
