summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ASoC: Intel: soc-acpi-intel-mtl-match: add missing empty item

  There is no links_num in struct snd_soc_acpi_mach {}, and we test
  !link->num_adr as a condition to end the loop in hda_sdw_machine_select().
  So an empty item in struct snd_soc_acpi_link_adr array is required.
