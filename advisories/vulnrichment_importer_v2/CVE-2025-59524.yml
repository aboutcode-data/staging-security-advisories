aliases: []
summary: Horilla is a free and open source Human Resource Management System (HRMS). Prior to
  version 1.4.0, the file upload flow performs validation only in the browser and does not enforce
  server-side checks. An attacker can bypass the client-side validation (for example, with an
  intercepting proxy or by submitting a crafted request) to store an executable HTML document
  on the server. When an administrator or other privileged user views the uploaded file, the
  embedded script runs in their context and sends session cookies (or other credentials) to
  an attacker-controlled endpoint. The attacker then reuses those credentials to impersonate
  the admin. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.0.
