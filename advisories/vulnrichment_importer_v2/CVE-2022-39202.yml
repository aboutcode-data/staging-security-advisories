aliases: []
summary: matrix-appservice-irc is an open source Node.js IRC bridge for Matrix. The Internet
  Relay Chat (IRC) protocol allows you to specify multiple modes in a single mode command. Due
  to a bug in the underlying matrix-org/node-irc library, affected versions of matrix-appservice-irc
  perform parsing of such modes incorrectly, potentially resulting in the wrong user being given
  permissions. Mode commands can only be executed by privileged users, so this can only be abused
  if an operator is tricked into running the command on behalf of an attacker. The vulnerability
  has been patched in matrix-appservice-irc 0.35.0. As a workaround users should refrain from
  entering mode commands suggested by untrusted users. Avoid using multiple modes in a single
  command.
