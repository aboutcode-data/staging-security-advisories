summary: A path traversal vulnerability exists in the api open_personality_folder endpoint of
  parisneo/lollms-webui. This vulnerability allows an attacker to read any folder in the personality_folder

  sanitization of the personality_folder parameter, which can be exploited to traverse directories
  and access arbitrary files.
