summary: dedupe is a python library that uses machine learning to perform fuzzy matching, deduplication
  and entity resolution quickly on structured data. Before commit 3f61e79, a critical severity
  vulnerability has been identified within the .github/workflows/benchmark-bot.yml workflow,
  where a issue_comment can be triggered using the @benchmark body. This workflow is susceptible
  to exploitation as it checkout the ${{ github.event.issue.number }}, which correspond to the
  branch of the PR manipulated by potentially malicious actors, and where untrusted code may
  be executed. Running untrusted code may lead to the exfiltration of GITHUB_TOKEN, which in
  this workflow has write permissions on most of the scopes - in particular the contents one
  - and could lead to potential repository takeover. This is fixed by commit 3f61e79.
