summary: Discourse is a platform for community discussion. Users who receive an invitation link
  that is not scoped to a single email address can enter any non-admin user's email and gain
  access to their account when accepting the invitation. All users should upgrade to the latest
  version. A workaround is temporarily disabling invitations with `SiteSetting.max_invites_per_day
  = 0` or scope them to individual email addresses.
