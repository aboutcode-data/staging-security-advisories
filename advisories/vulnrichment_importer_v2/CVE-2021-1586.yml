aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Multi-Pod or Multi-Site network configurations for Cisco Nexus
  9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode could allow an
  unauthenticated, remote attacker to unexpectedly restart the device, resulting in a denial
  of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability exists because TCP traffic sent to a specific
  port on an affected device is not properly sanitized. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending crafted TCP data to a specific port that is listening on a public-facing IP address
  for the Multi-Pod or Multi-Site configuration. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to cause the device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition.
