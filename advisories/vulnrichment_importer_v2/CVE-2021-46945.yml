summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ext4: always panic when errors=panic is specified

  Before commit 014c9caa29d3 ("ext4: make ext4_abort() use
  __ext4_error()"), the following series of commands would trigger a
  panic:

  1. mount /dev/sda -o ro,errors=panic test
  2. mount /dev/sda -o remount,abort test

  After commit 014c9caa29d3, remounting a file system using the test
  mount option "abort" will no longer trigger a panic.  This commit will
  restore the behaviour immediately before commit 014c9caa29d3.
  (However, note that the Linux kernel's behavior has not been
  consistent; some previous kernel versions, including 5.4 and 4.19
  similarly did not panic after using the mount option "abort".)

  This also makes a change to long-standing behaviour; namely, the
  following series commands will now cause a panic, when previously it
  did not:

  1. mount /dev/sda -o ro,errors=panic test
  2. echo test > /sys/fs/ext4/sda/trigger_fs_error

  However, this makes ext4's behaviour much more consistent, so this is
  a good thing.
