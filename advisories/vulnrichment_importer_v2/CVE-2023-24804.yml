aliases: []
summary: The ownCloud Android app allows ownCloud users to access, share, and edit files and
  folders. Prior to version 3.0, the app has an incomplete fix for a path traversal issue and
  is vulnerable to two bypass methods. The bypasses may lead to information disclosure when
  uploading the app’s internal files, and to arbitrary file write when uploading plain text
  files (although limited by the .txt extension). Version 3.0 fixes the reported bypasses.
