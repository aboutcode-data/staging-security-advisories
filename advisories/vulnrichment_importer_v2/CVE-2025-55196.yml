aliases: []
summary: External Secrets Operator is a Kubernetes operator that integrates external secret
  management systems. From version 0.15.0 to before 0.19.2, a vulnerability was discovered where
  the List() calls for Kubernetes Secret and SecretStore resources performed by the PushSecret
  controller did not apply a namespace selector. This flaw allowed an attacker to use label
  selectors to list and read secrets/secret-stores across the cluster, bypassing intended namespace
  restrictions. An attacker with the ability to create or update PushSecret resources and control
  SecretStore configurations could exploit this vulnerability to exfiltrate sensitive data from
  arbitrary namespaces. This could lead to full disclosure of Kubernetes secrets, including
  credentials, tokens, and other sensitive information stored in the cluster. This vulnerability
  has been patched in version 0.19.2. A workaround for this issue includes auditing and restricting
  RBAC permissions so that only trusted service accounts can create or update PushSecret and
  SecretStore resources.
