aliases: []
summary: The Simple:Press plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the 'postitem' parameter manipulated during the profile-save action when modifying a profile
  signature in versions up to, and including, 6.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and
  output escaping that makes injecting object and embed tags possible. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber to inject arbitrary
  web scripts in pages when modifying a profile signature that will execute whenever a user
  accesses an injected page.
