aliases: []
summary: SudoBot, a Discord moderation bot, is vulnerable to privilege escalation and exploit
  of the `-config` command in versions prior to 9.26.7. Anyone is theoretically able to update
  any configuration of the bot and potentially gain control over the bot's settings. Every version
  of v9 before v9.26.7 is affected. Other versions (e.g. v8) are not affected. Users should
  upgrade to version 9.26.7 to receive a patch. A workaround would be to create a command permission
  overwrite in the Database. A SQL statement provided in the GitHub Security Advisor can be
  executed to create a overwrite that disallows users without `ManageGuild` permission to run
  the `-config` command. Run the SQL statement for every server the bot is in, and replace `<guild_id>`
  with the appropriate Guild ID each time.
