aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in session management for the web-based interface of Cisco Small Business
  Smart and Managed Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to defeat authentication
  protections and gain unauthorized access to the management interface. The attacker could obtain
  the privileges of the highjacked session account, which could include administrator privileges
  on the device. The vulnerability is due to the use of weak entropy generation for session
  identifier values. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to determine a current session
  identifier through brute force and reuse that session identifier to take over an ongoing session.
  In this way, an attacker could take actions within the management interface with privileges
  up to the level of the administrative user.
