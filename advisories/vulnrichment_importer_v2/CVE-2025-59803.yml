aliases: []
summary: Foxit PDF Editor and Reader before 2025.2.1 allow signature spoofing via triggers.
  An attacker can embed triggers (e.g., JavaScript) in a PDF document that execute during the
  signing process. When a signer reviews the document, the content appears normal. However,
  once the signature is applied, the triggers modify content on other pages or optional content
  layers without explicit warning. This can cause the signed PDF to differ from what the signer
  saw, undermining the trustworthiness of the digital signature. The fixed versions are 2025.2.1,
  14.0.1, and 13.2.1.
