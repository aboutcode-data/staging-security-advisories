aliases: []
summary: "nFPM is an alternative to fpm. The file permissions on the checked-in files were not\
  \ maintained. Hence, when nfpm packaged \nthe files (without extra config for enforcing it’s\
  \ own permissions) files could go out with bad permissions (chmod 666 or 777). Anyone using\
  \ nfpm for creating packages without checking/setting file permissions before packaging could\
  \ result in bad permissions for files/folders."
