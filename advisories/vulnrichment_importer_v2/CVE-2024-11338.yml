aliases: []
summary: The PIXNET Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the 'gtm' and 'venue' parameters in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.10 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
  execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
