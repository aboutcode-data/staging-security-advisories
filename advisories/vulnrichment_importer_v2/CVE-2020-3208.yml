aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the image verification feature of Cisco IOS Software for Cisco 809
  and 829 Industrial Integrated Services Routers (Industrial ISRs) could allow an authenticated,
  local attacker to boot a malicious software image on an affected device. The vulnerability
  is due to insufficient access restrictions on the area of code that manages the image verification
  feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by first authenticating to the targeted
  device and then logging in to the Virtual Device Server (VDS) of an affected device. The attacker
  could then, from the VDS shell, disable Cisco IOS Software integrity (image) verification.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to boot a malicious Cisco IOS Software image
  on the targeted device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid user credentials
  at privilege level 15.
