summary: Rundeck is an open source automation service with a web console, command line tools
  and a WebAPI. In versions prior to 3.4.5, authenticated users could craft a request to modify
  or delete System or Project level Calendars, without appropriate authorization. Modifying
  or removing calendars could cause Scheduled Jobs to execute, or not execute on desired calendar
  days. Severity depends on trust level of authenticated users and impact of running or not
  running scheduled jobs on days governed by calendar definitions. Version 3.4.5 contains a
  patch for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds.
