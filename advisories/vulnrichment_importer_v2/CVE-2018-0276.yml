summary: 'A vulnerability in Cisco WebEx Connect IM could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of an affected system. The vulnerability
  is due to insufficient input validation of some parameters that are passed to the web server
  of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user
  to follow a malicious link or by intercepting a user request and injecting malicious code
  into the request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script
  code in the context of the affected web interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive
  browser-based information. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvi07812.'
