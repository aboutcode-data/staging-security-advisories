aliases: []
summary: Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum virtual machine. Prior
  to version 0.3.0, default functions don't respect nonreentrancy keys and the lock isn't emitted.
  No vulnerable production contracts were found. Additionally, using a lock on a `default` function
  is a very sparsely used pattern. As such, the impact is low. Version 0.3.0 contains a patch
  for the issue.
