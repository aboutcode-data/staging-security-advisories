  sched: Fix out-of-bound access in uclamp

  Util-clamp places tasks in different buckets based on their clamp values
  for performance reasons. However, the size of buckets is currently
  computed using a rounding division, which can lead to an off-by-one
  error in some configurations.

  For instance, with 20 buckets, the bucket size will be 1024/20=51. A
  task with a clamp of 1024 will be mapped to bucket id 1024/51=20. Sadly,
  correct indexes are in range [0,19], hence leading to an out of bound
  memory access.

  Clamp the bucket id to fix the issue.
