  mm/secretmem: fix GUP-fast succeeding on secretmem folios

  folio_is_secretmem() currently relies on secretmem folios being LRU
  folios, to save some cycles.

  However, folios might reside in a folio batch without the LRU flag set, or
  temporarily have their LRU flag cleared.  Consequently, the LRU flag is
  unreliable for this purpose.

  In particular, this is the case when secretmem_fault() allocates a fresh
  page and calls filemap_add_folio()->folio_add_lru().  The folio might be
  added to the per-cpu folio batch and won't get the LRU flag set until the
  batch was drained using e.g., lru_add_drain().

  Consequently, folio_is_secretmem() might not detect secretmem folios and
  GUP-fast can succeed in grabbing a secretmem folio, crashing the kernel
  when we would later try reading/writing to the folio, because the folio
  has been unmapped from the directmap.

  Fix it by removing that unreliable check.
