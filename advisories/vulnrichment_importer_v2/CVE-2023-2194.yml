aliases: []
summary: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's SLIMpro I2C device
  driver. The userspace "data->block[0]" variable was not capped to a number between 0-255 and
  was used as the size of a memcpy, possibly writing beyond the end of dma_buffer. This flaw
  could allow a local privileged user to crash the system or potentially achieve code execution.
