summary: Weblate is a web based localization tool. Prior to version 5.11, when creating a new
  component from an existing component that has a source code repository URL specified in settings,
  this URL is included in the client's URL parameters during the creation process. If, for example,
  the source code repository URL contains GitHub credentials, the confidential PAT and username
  are shown in plaintext and get saved into browser history. Moreover, if the request URL is
  logged, the credentials are written to logs in plaintext. If using Weblate official Docker
  image, nginx logs the URL and the token in plaintext. This issue is patched in version 5.11.
