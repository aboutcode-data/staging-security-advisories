summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  bpf: Zero former ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT} args in case of error

  For all non-tracing helpers which formerly had ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT} as input
  arguments, zero the value for the case of an error as otherwise it could leak
  memory. For tracing, it is not needed given CAP_PERFMON can already read all
  kernel memory anyway hence bpf_get_func_arg() and bpf_get_func_ret() is skipped
  in here.

  Also, the MTU helpers mtu_len pointer value is being written but also read.
  Technically, the MEM_UNINIT should not be there in order to always force init.
  Removing MEM_UNINIT needs more verifier rework though: MEM_UNINIT right now
  implies two things actually: i) write into memory, ii) memory does not have
  to be initialized. If we lift MEM_UNINIT, it then becomes: i) read into memory,
  ii) memory must be initialized. This means that for bpf_*_check_mtu() we're
  readding the issue we're trying to fix, that is, it would then be able to
  write back into things like .rodata BPF maps. Follow-up work will rework the
  MEM_UNINIT semantics such that the intent can be better expressed. For now
  just clear the *mtu_len on error path which can be lifted later again.
