summary: Dlink Dir-3040us A1 1.20b03a hotfix is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow. Any user having
  read/write access to ftp server can write directly to ram causing buffer overflow if file
  or files uploaded are greater than available ram. Ftp server allows change of directory to

  filled and causing system resource exhaustion (no free memory) which causes system to crash
  and reboot.
