aliases: []
summary: The Audio Merchant plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 5.0.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the audio_merchant_save_settings function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to modify the plugin's settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted
  they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
