summary: 'CodiMD through 2.5.4 has a CSP-based protection mechanism against XSS through uploaded
  SVG documents containing JavaScript, but it can be bypassed in certain cases of different-origin
  file storage, such as AWS S3. NOTE: it can be considered a user error if AWS is employed for
  hosting untrusted JavaScript content, but the selected architecture within AWS does not have
  components that are able to insert Content-Security-Policy headers.'
