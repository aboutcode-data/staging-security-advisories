aliases: []
summary: OpenBao is an open source identity-based secrets management system. Prior to version
  2.4.2, OpenBao's audit log did not appropriately redact fields when relevant subsystems sent
  []byte response parameters rather than strings. This includes, but is not limited to sys/raw
  with use of encoding=base64, all data would be emitted unredacted to the audit log, and Transit,
  when performing a signing operation with a derived Ed25519 key, would emit public keys to
  the audit log. This issue has been patched in OpenBao 2.4.2.
