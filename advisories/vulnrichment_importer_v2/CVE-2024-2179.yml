aliases: []
summary: Concrete CMS version 9 before 9.2.7 is vulnerable to Stored XSS via the Name field
  of a Group type since there is insufficient validation of administrator provided data for
  that field. A rogue administrator could inject malicious code into the Name field which might
  be executed when users visit the affected page. The Concrete CMS security team gave this vulnerability
  a CVSS v3.1 score of 2.2 with a vector of AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N  Concrete versions
  below 9 do not include group types so they are not affected by this vulnerability. Thanks
  Luca Fuda for reporting.
