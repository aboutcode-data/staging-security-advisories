aliases: []
summary: The WP Travel Engine – Tour Booking Plugin – Tour Operator Software plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion (via renaming) due to insufficient file path validation
  in the set_user_profile_image function in all versions up to, and including, 6.6.7. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can
  easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
