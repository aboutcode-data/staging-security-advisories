aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered on NOKIA Airscale ASIKA Single RAN devices before 21B. Nokia
  Single RAN commissioning procedures do not change (factory-time installed) default SSH public/private
  key values that are specific to a network operator. As a result, the CSP internal BTS network
  SSH server (disabled by default) continues to apply the default SSH public/private key values.
  These keys don't give access to BTS, because service user authentication is username/password-based
  on top of SSH. Nokia factory installed default SSH keys are meant to be changed from operator-specific
  values during the BTS deployment commissioning phase. However, before the 21B release, BTS
  commissioning manuals did not provide instructions to change default SSH keys (to BTS operator-specific
  values). This leads to a possibility for malicious operations staff (inside a CSP network)
  to attempt MITM exploitation of BTS service user access, during the moments that SSH is enabled
  for Nokia service personnel to perform troubleshooting activities.
