aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol implementation for Cisco Video Surveillance
  8000 Series IP Cameras could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary
  code on an affected device or cause the device to reload. This vulnerability is due to missing
  checks when an IP camera processes a Cisco Discovery Protocol packet. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to an affected device.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute code on the affected IP camera or
  cause it to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Note: Cisco
  Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must
  be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).'
