aliases: []
summary: 'svm_predict_values in svm.cpp in Libsvm v324, as used in scikit-learn 0.23.2 and other
  products, allows attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via a crafted
  model SVM (introduced via pickle, json, or any other model permanence standard) with a large
  value in the _n_support array. NOTE: the scikit-learn vendor''s position is that the behavior
  can only occur if the library''s API is violated by an application that changes a private
  attribute.'
