aliases: []
summary: Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications.
  The envoy common router will segfault if an internal redirect selects a route configured with
  direct response or redirect actions. This will result in a denial of service. As a workaround
  turn off internal redirects if direct response entries are configured on the same listener.
