summary: The WooCommerce - Social Login plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection
  in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.2 via deserialization of untrusted input from the
  'woo_slg_verify' vulnerable parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP
  chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could
  allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
