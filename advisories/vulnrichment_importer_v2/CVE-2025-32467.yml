summary: 'Use of uninitialized variable for some TDX Module before version tdx1.5 within Ring
  0: Hypervisor may allow an information disclosure. Authorized adversary with a privileged
  user combined with a high complexity attack may enable data exposure. This result may potentially
  occur via local access when attack requirements are present without special internal knowledge
  and requires no user interaction. The potential vulnerability may impact the confidentiality
  (high), integrity (none) and availability (none) of the vulnerable system, resulting in subsequent
  system confidentiality (none), integrity (none) and availability (none) impacts.'
