summary: 'Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: JavaFX). Supported
  versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u161, 8u152 and 9.0.1. Easily exploitable vulnerability
  allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java
  SE. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and
  while the vulnerability is in Java SE, attacks may significantly impact additional products.
  Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset
  of Java SE accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically
  in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load
  and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox
  for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers,
  that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base
  Score 4.7 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N).'
