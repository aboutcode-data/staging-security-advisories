  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  perf: Fix perf_pending_task() UaF

  Per syzbot it is possible for perf_pending_task() to run after the
  event is free()'d. There are two related but distinct cases:

   - the task_work was already queued before destroying the event;
   - destroying the event itself queues the task_work.

  The first cannot be solved using task_work_cancel() since
  perf_release() itself might be called from a task_work (____fput),
  which means the current->task_works list is already empty and
  task_work_cancel() won't be able to find the perf_pending_task()
  entry.

  The simplest alternative is extending the perf_event lifetime to cover
  the task_work.

  The second is just silly, queueing a task_work while you know the
  event is going away makes no sense and is easily avoided by
  re-arranging how the event is marked STATE_DEAD and ensuring it goes
  through STATE_OFF on the way down.
