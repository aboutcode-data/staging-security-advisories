summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
  attack on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for
  the web-based management interface on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability

  allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user.
  These actions could include modifying the system configuration and deleting accounts.
