summary: In the "bestinformed Web" application, some user input was not properly sanitized.
  This leads to multiple unauthenticated stored cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. An unauthenticated
  attacker is able to compromise the sessions of users on the server by injecting JavaScript
  code into their session using an "Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting". The attacker
  is then able to ride the session of those users and can abuse their privileges on the "bestinformed
  Web" application.
