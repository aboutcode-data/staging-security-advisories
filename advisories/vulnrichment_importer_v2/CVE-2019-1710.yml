aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the sysadmin virtual machine (VM) on Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation
  Services Routers running Cisco IOS XR 64-bit Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote
  attacker to access internal applications running on the sysadmin VM. The vulnerability is
  due to incorrect isolation of the secondary management interface from internal sysadmin applications.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to one of the listening internal
  applications. A successful exploit could result in unstable conditions, including both a denial
  of service and remote unauthenticated access to the device. This vulnerability has been fixed
  in Cisco IOS XR 64-bit Software Release 6.5.3 and 7.0.1, which will edit the calvados_boostrap.cfg
  file and reload the device.
