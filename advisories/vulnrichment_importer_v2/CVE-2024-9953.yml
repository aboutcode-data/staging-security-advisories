aliases: []
summary: A potential denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability exists in CERT VINCE software versions
  prior to 3.0.8. An authenticated administrative user can inject an arbitrary pickle object
  into a user’s profile, which may lead to a DoS condition when the profile is accessed. While
  the Django server restricts unpickling to prevent server crashes, this vulnerability could
  still disrupt operations.
