aliases: []
summary: GitForge.jl is a unified interface for interacting with Git "forges." Versions prior
  to 0.4.3 lack input validation for user provided values in certain functions. In the `GitForge.get_repo`
  function for GitHub, the user can provide any string for the owner and repo fields. These
  inputs are not validated or safely encoded and are sent directly to the server. This means
  a user can add path traversal patterns like `../` in the input to access any other endpoints
  on api.github.com that were not intended. Version 0.4.3 contains a patch for the issue. No
  known workarounds are available.
