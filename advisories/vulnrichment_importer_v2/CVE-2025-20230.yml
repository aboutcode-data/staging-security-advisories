aliases: []
summary: In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.4.1, 9.3.3, 9.2.5, and 9.1.8, and versions below
  3.8.38 and 3.7.23 of the Splunk Secure Gateway app on Splunk Cloud Platform, a low-privileged
  user that does not hold the “admin“ or “power“ Splunk roles could edit and delete other user
  data in App Key Value Store (KVStore) collections that the Splunk Secure Gateway app created.
  This is due to missing access control and incorrect ownership of the data in those KVStore
  collections.<br><br>In the affected versions, the `nobody` user owned the data in the KVStore
  collections. This meant that there was no specific owner assigned to the data in those collections.
