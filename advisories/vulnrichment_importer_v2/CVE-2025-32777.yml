aliases: []
summary: Volcano is a Kubernetes-native batch scheduling system. Prior to versions 1.11.2, 1.10.2,
  1.9.1, 1.11.0-network-topology-preview.3, and 1.12.0-alpha.2, attacker compromise of either
  the Elastic service or the extender plugin can cause denial of service of the scheduler. This
  is a privilege escalation, because Volcano users may run their Elastic service and extender
  plugins in separate pods or nodes from the scheduler. In the Kubernetes security model, node
  isolation is a security boundary, and as such an attacker is able to cross that boundary in
  Volcano's case if they have compromised either the vulnerable services or the pod/node in
  which they are deployed. The scheduler will become unavailable to other users and workloads
  in the cluster. The scheduler will either crash with an unrecoverable OOM panic or freeze
  while consuming excessive amounts of memory. This issue has been patched in versions 1.11.2,
  1.10.2, 1.9.1, 1.11.0-network-topology-preview.3, and 1.12.0-alpha.2.
