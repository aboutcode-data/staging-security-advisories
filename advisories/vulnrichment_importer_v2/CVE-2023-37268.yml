aliases: []
summary: Warpgate is an SSH, HTTPS and MySQL bastion host for Linux that doesn't need special
  client apps. When logging in as a user with SSO enabled an attacker may authenticate as an
  other user. Any user account which does not have a second factor enabled could be compromised.
  This issue has been addressed in commit `8173f6512a` and in releases starting with version
  0.7.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should require their users to
  use a second factor in authentication.
