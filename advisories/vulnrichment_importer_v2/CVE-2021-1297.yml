aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business
  RV160, RV160W, RV260, RV260P, and RV260W VPN Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote
  attacker to conduct directory traversal attacks and overwrite certain files that should be
  restricted on an affected system. These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input validation.
  An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by using the web-based management interface
  to upload a file to location on an affected device that they should not have access to. A
  successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite files on the file system of the affected
  device.
