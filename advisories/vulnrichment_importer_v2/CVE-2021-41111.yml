aliases: []
summary: Rundeck is an open source automation service with a web console, command line tools
  and a WebAPI. Prior to versions 3.4.5 and 3.3.15, an authenticated user with authorization
  to read webhooks in one project can craft a request to reveal Webhook definitions and tokens
  in another project. The user could use the revealed webhook tokens to trigger webhooks. Severity
  depends on trust level of authenticated users and whether any webhooks exist that trigger
  sensitive actions. There are patches for this vulnerability in versions 3.4.5 and 3.3.15.
  There are currently no known workarounds.
