aliases: []
summary: The Woffice Core plugin for WordPress, used by the Woffice Theme, is vulnerable to
  arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'saveFeaturedImage' function
  in all versions up to, and including, 5.4.21. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server
  which may make remote code execution possible.
