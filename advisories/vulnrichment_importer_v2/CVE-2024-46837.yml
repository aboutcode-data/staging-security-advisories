  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/panthor: Restrict high priorities on group_create

  We were allowing any users to create a high priority group without any
  permission checks. As a result, this was allowing possible denial of
  service.

  We now only allow the DRM master or users with the CAP_SYS_NICE
  capability to set higher priorities than PANTHOR_GROUP_PRIORITY_MEDIUM.

  As the sole user of that uAPI lives in Mesa and hardcode a value of
  MEDIUM [1], this should be safe to do.

  Additionally, as those checks are performed at the ioctl level,
  panthor_group_create now only check for priority level validity.
