aliases: []
summary: Switcher Client is a JavaScript SDK to work with Switcher API which is cloud-based
  Feature Flag. Unsanitized input flows into Strategy match operation (EXIST), where it is used
  to build a regular expression. This may result in a Regular expression Denial of Service attack
  (reDOS). This issue has been patched in version 3.1.4. As a workaround, avoid using Strategy
  settings that use REGEX in conjunction with EXIST and NOT_EXIST operations.
