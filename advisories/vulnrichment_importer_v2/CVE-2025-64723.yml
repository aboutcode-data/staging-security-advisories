aliases: []
summary: Arduino IDE is an integrated development environment. Prior to version 2.3.7, Arduino
  IDE for macOS was configured with overly permissive security entitlements that could bypass
  macOS Hardened Runtime protections. This configuration allows attackers to inject malicious
  dynamic libraries into the application process, gaining access to all TCC (Transparency, Consent,
  and Control) permissions granted to the application. The fix is included starting from the
  `2.3.7 ` release.
