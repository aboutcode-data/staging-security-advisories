aliases: []
summary: gomatrixserverlib is a Go library for matrix protocol federation. Dendrite is a Matrix
  homeserver written in Go, an alternative to Synapse. The power level parsing within gomatrixserverlib
  was failing to parse the `"events_default"` key of the `m.room.power_levels` event, defaulting
  the event default power level to zero in all cases. Power levels are the matrix terminology
  for user access level. In rooms where the `"events_default"` power level had been changed,
  this could result in events either being incorrectly authorised or rejected by Dendrite servers.
  gomatrixserverlib contains a fix as of commit `723fd49` and Dendrite 0.9.3 has been updated
  accordingly. Matrix rooms where the `"events_default"` power level has not been changed from
  the default of zero are not vulnerable. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
  for this issue.
