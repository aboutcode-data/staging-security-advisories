aliases: []
summary: tRPC allows users to build and consume fully typesafe APIs without schemas or code
  generation. Starting in version 10.27.0 and prior to versions 10.45.3 and 11.8.0, a A prototype
  pollution vulnerability exists in `@trpc/server`'s `formDataToObject` function, which is used
  by the Next.js App Router adapter. An attacker can pollute `Object.prototype` by submitting
  specially crafted FormData field names, potentially leading to authorization bypass, denial
  of service, or other security impacts. Note that this vulnerability is only present when using
  `experimental_caller` / `experimental_nextAppDirCaller`. Versions 10.45.3 and 11.8.0 fix the
  issue.
