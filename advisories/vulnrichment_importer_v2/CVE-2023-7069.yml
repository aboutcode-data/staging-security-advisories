aliases: []
summary: The Advanced iFrame plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the plugin's 'advanced_iframe' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2023.10
  due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This
  makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions
  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page. CVE-2024-24870 is likely a duplicate of this issue.
