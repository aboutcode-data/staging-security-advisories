aliases: []
summary: GoCD is a continuous delivery server. GoCD helps you automate and streamline the build-test-release
  cycle for continuous delivery of your product. GoCD versions prior to 21.1.0 can allow one
  authenticated agent to impersonate another agent, and thus receive work packages for other
  agents due to broken access control and incorrect validation of agent tokens within the GoCD
  server. Since work packages can contain sensitive information such as credentials intended
  only for a given job running against a specific agent environment, this can cause accidental
  information disclosure. Exploitation requires knowledge of agent identifiers and ability to
  authenticate as an existing agent with the GoCD server. This issue is fixed in GoCD version
  21.1.0. There are currently no known workarounds.
