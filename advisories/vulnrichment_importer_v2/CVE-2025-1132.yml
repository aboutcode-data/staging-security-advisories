aliases: []
summary: A time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the ChurchCRM 5.13.0 and prior EditEventAttendees.php within
  the EN_tyid parameter. The parameter is directly inserted into an SQL query without proper
  sanitization, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL commands. Please note that the vulnerability
  requires Administrator permissions. This flaw can potentially allow attackers to delay the
  response, indicating the presence of an SQL injection vulnerability. While it is a time-based
  blind injection, it can be exploited to gain insights into the underlying database, and with
  further exploitation, sensitive data could be retrieved.
