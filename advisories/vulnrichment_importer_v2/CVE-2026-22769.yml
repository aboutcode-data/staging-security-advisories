summary: Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines, versions prior to 6.0.3.1 HF1, contain a hardcoded
  credential vulnerability. This is considered critical as an unauthenticated remote attacker
  with knowledge of the hardcoded credential could potentially exploit this vulnerability leading
  to unauthorized access to the underlying operating system and root-level persistence. Dell
  recommends that customers upgrade or apply one of the remediations as soon as possible.
