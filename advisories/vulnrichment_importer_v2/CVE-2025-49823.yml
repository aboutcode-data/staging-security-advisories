aliases: []
summary: (conda) Constructor is a tool which allows constructing an installer for a collection
  of conda packages. Prior to version 3.11.3, shell installer scripts process the installation
  prefix (user_prefix) using an eval statement, which executes unsanitized user input as shell
  code. Although the script runs with user privileges (not root), an attacker could exploit
  this by injecting arbitrary commands through a malicious path during installation. Exploitation
  requires explicit user action. This issue has been patched in version 3.11.3.
