summary: The ESL (Electronic Shelf Label) protocol, as implemented by (for example) the OV80e934802
  RF transceiver on the ETAG-2130-V4.3 20190629 board, does not use authentication, which allows
  attackers to change label values via 433 MHz RF signals, as demonstrated by disrupting the
  organization of a hospital storage unit, or changing retail pricing.
