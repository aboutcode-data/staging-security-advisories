aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered on IROAD Dashcam FX2 devices. An unauthenticated file upload
  endpoint can be leveraged to execute arbitrary commands by uploading a CGI-based webshell.
  Once a file is uploaded, the attacker can execute commands with root privileges, gaining full
  control over the dashcam. Additionally, by uploading a netcat (nc) binary, the attacker can
  establish a reverse shell, maintaining persistent remote and privileged access to the device.
  This allows complete device takeover.
