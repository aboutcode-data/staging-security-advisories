aliases: []
summary: ampache is a web based audio/video streaming application and file manager. A CSRF attack
  can be performed in order to delete objects (Playlist, smartlist etc.). Cross-Site Request
  Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces authenticated users to submit a request to a Web application
  against which they are currently authenticated. This vulnerability can be exploited by creating
  a malicious script with an arbitrary playlist ID belonging to another user. When the user
  submits the request, their playlist will be deleted. Any User with active sessions who are
  tricked into submitting a malicious request are impacted, as their playlists or other objects
  could be deleted without their consent.
