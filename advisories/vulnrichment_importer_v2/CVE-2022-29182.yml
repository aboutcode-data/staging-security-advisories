aliases: []
summary: GoCD is a continuous delivery server. GoCD versions 19.11.0 through 21.4.0 (inclusive)
  are vulnerable to a Document Object Model (DOM)-based cross-site scripting attack via a pipeline
  run's Stage Details > Graphs tab. It is possible for a malicious script on a attacker-hosted
  site to execute script that will run within the user's browser context and GoCD session via
  abuse of a messaging channel used for communication between with the parent page and the stage
  details graph's iframe. This could allow an attacker to steal a GoCD user's session cookies
  and/or execute malicious code in the user's context. This issue is fixed in GoCD 22.1.0. There
  are currently no known workarounds.
