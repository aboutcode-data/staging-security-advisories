aliases: []
summary: 'Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in the lmtg_myhomepage Component
  (com_lmtg_myhomepage) for Mambo allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a
  URL in the mosConfig_absolute_path parameter in (1) install.lmtg_homepage.php and (2) mtg_homepage.php.  NOTE:
  this issue has been disputed by a third party, who states that the $mosConfig_absolute_path
  variable is only used within a function definition.  CVE source code analysis on 20060824
  is not conclusive but tends to concur with the dispute.  In addition, it appears that the
  component name is actually "lmtg_myhomepage"'
