  drm/panthor: Fix race when converting group handle to group object

  XArray provides it's own internal lock which protects the internal array
  when entries are being simultaneously added and removed. However there
  is still a race between retrieving the pointer from the XArray and
  incrementing the reference count.

  To avoid this race simply hold the internal XArray lock when
  incrementing the reference count, this ensures there cannot be a racing
  call to xa_erase().
