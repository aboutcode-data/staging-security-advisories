aliases: []
summary: The Weluka Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via
  the plugin's 'weluka-map' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.3 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary
  web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
