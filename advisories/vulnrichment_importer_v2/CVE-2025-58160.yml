aliases: []
summary: tracing is a framework for instrumenting Rust programs to collect structured, event-based
  diagnostic information. Prior to version 0.3.20, tracing-subscriber was vulnerable to ANSI
  escape sequence injection attacks. Untrusted user input containing ANSI escape sequences could
  be injected into terminal output when logged, potentially allowing attackers to manipulate
  terminal title bars, clear screens or modify terminal display, and potentially mislead users
  through terminal manipulation. tracing-subscriber version 0.3.20 fixes this vulnerability
  by escaping ANSI control characters when writing events to destinations that may be printed
  to the terminal. A workaround involves avoiding printing logs to terminal emulators without
  escaping ANSI control sequences.
