aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  s390/boot: Avoid possible physmem_info segment corruption

  When physical memory for the kernel image is allocated it does not
  consider extra memory required for offsetting the image start to
  match it with the lower 20 bits of KASLR virtual base address. That
  might lead to kernel access beyond its memory range.
