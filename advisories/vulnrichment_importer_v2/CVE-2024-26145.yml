summary: Discourse Calendar adds the ability to create a dynamic calendar in the first post
  of a topic on Discourse. Uninvited users are able to gain access to private events by crafting
  a request to update their attendance. This problem is resolved in commit dfc4fa15f340189f177a1d1ab2cc94ffed3c1190.
  As a workaround, one may use post visibility to limit access.
