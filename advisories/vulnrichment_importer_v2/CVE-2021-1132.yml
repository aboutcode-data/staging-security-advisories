aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the API subsystem and in the web-management interface of Cisco&nbsp;Network\
  \ Services Orchestrator (NSO) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive\
  \ data.\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the web-management interface and certain HTTP-based\
  \ APIs do not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains directory traversal character sequences\
  \ to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive\
  \ files on the affected system.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this\
  \ vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
