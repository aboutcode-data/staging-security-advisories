aliases: []
summary: The Booster for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
  due to missing file type validation in the 'add_files_to_order' function in all versions up
  to, and including, 7.2.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary
  files with double extensions on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution
  possible. This is only exploitable on select instances where the configuration will execute
  the first extension present.
