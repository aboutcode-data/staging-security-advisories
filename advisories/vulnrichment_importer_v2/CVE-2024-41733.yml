aliases: []
summary: |
  In SAP Commerce, valid user accounts can be
  identified during the customer registration and login processes. This allows a
  potential attacker to learn if a given e-mail is used for an account, but does
  not grant access to any customer data beyond this knowledge. The attacker must
  already know the e-mail that they wish to test for. The impact on
  confidentiality therefore is low and no impact to integrity or availability
