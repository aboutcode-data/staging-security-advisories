aliases: []
summary: LibreNMS is an auto-discovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP based network monitoring which includes
  support for a wide range of network hardware and operating systems. LibreNMS versions 25.6.0
  and below contain an architectural vulnerability in the ajax_form.php endpoint that permits
  Remote File Inclusion based on user-controlled POST input. The application directly uses the
  type parameter to dynamically include .inc.php files from the trusted path includes/html/forms/,
  without validation or allowlisting. This pattern introduces a latent Remote Code Execution
  (RCE) vector if an attacker can stage a file in this include path — for example, via symlink,
  development misconfiguration, or chained vulnerabilities. This is fixed in version 25.7.0.
