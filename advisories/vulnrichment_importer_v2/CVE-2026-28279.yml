aliases: []
summary: osctrl is an osquery management solution. Prior to version 0.5.0, an OS command injection
  vulnerability exists in the `osctrl-admin` environment configuration. An authenticated administrator
  can inject arbitrary shell commands via the hostname parameter when creating or editing environments.
  These commands are embedded into enrollment one-liner scripts generated using Go's `text/template`
  package (which does not perform shell escaping) and execute on every endpoint that enrolls
  using the compromised environment. An attacker with administrator access can achieve remote
  code execution on every endpoint that enrolls using the compromised environment. Commands
  execute as root/SYSTEM (the privilege level used for osquery enrollment) before osquery is
  installed, leaving no agent-level audit trail. This enables backdoor installation, credential
  exfiltration, and full endpoint compromise. This is fixed in osctrl `v0.5.0`. As a workaround,
  restrict osctrl administrator access to trusted personnel, review existing environment configurations
  for suspicious hostnames, and/or monitor enrollment scripts for unexpected commands.
