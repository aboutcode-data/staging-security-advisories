aliases: []
summary: Project Pier 0.8.8 and earlier contains an unauthenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability
  in tools/upload_file.php. The upload handler fails to validate the file type or enforce authentication,
  allowing remote attackers to upload malicious PHP files directly into a web-accessible directory.
  The uploaded file is stored with a predictable suffix and can be executed by requesting its
  URL, resulting in remote code execution.
