aliases: []
summary: The Limit Login Attempts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via its lock logging feature in versions up to, and including, 1.7.1 due to insufficient input
  sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
  inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever an administrator accesses
  the plugin's settings page. This only works when the plugin prioritizes use of the X-FORWARDED-FOR
  header, which can be configured in its settings.
