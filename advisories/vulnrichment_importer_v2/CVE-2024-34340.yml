aliases: []
summary: Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework. Prior to version
  1.2.27, Cacti calls `compat_password_hash` when users set their password. `compat_password_hash`
  use `password_hash` if there is it, else use `md5`. When verifying password, it calls `compat_password_verify`.
  In `compat_password_verify`, `password_verify` is called if there is it, else use `md5`. `password_verify`
  and `password_hash` are supported on PHP < 5.5.0, following PHP manual. The vulnerability
  is in `compat_password_verify`. Md5-hashed user input is compared with correct password in
  database by `$md5 == $hash`. It is a loose comparison, not `===`. It is a type juggling vulnerability.
  Version 1.2.27 contains a patch for the issue.
