  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: fix null deref on system suspend entry

  When system enters suspend with an active stream, SOF core
  calls hw_params_upon_resume(). On Intel platforms with HDA DMA used
  to manage the link DMA, this leads to call chain of

     hda_dsp_set_hw_params_upon_resume()
   -> hda_dsp_dais_suspend()
   -> hda_dai_suspend()
   -> hda_ipc4_post_trigger()

  A bug is hit in hda_dai_suspend() as hda_link_dma_cleanup() is run first,
  which clears hext_stream->link_substream, and then hda_ipc4_post_trigger()
  is called with a NULL snd_pcm_substream pointer.
