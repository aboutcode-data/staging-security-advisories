aliases: []
summary: Puma is a Ruby/Rack web server built for parallelism. In affected versions clients
  could clobber values set by intermediate proxies (such as X-Forwarded-For) by providing a
  underscore version of the same header (X-Forwarded_For). Any users relying on proxy set variables
  is affected. v6.4.3/v5.6.9 now discards any headers using underscores if the non-underscore
  version also exists. Effectively, allowing the proxy defined headers to always win. Users
  are advised to upgrade. Nginx has a underscores_in_headers configuration variable to discard
  these headers at the proxy level as a mitigation. Any users that are implicitly trusting the
  proxy defined headers for security should immediately cease doing so until upgraded to the
  fixed versions.
