aliases: []
summary: Qwik is a performance focused javascript framework. Prior to version 1.19.0, an Open
  Redirect vulnerability in Qwik City's default request handler middleware allows a remote attacker
  to redirect users to arbitrary protocol-relative URLs. Successful exploitation permits attackers
  to craft convincing phishing links that appear to originate from the trusted domain but redirect
  the victim to an attacker-controlled site. This issue has been patched in version 1.19.0.
