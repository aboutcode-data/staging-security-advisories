aliases: []
summary: 'The Dokan: AI Powered WooCommerce Multivendor Marketplace Solution – Build Your Own
  Amazon, eBay, Etsy plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference
  in versions up to, and including, 4.2.4 via the `/wp-json/dokan/v1/settings` REST API endpoint
  due to missing validation on a user-controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with customer-level permissions and above, to read or modify other vendors'' store
  settings including sensitive payment information (PayPal email, bank account details, routing
  numbers, IBAN, SWIFT codes), phone numbers, and addresses, and change PayPal email addresses
  to attacker-controlled addresses, enabling financial theft when the marketplace processes
  payouts.'
