aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered on certain Nuki Home Solutions devices. The code used to parse
  the JSON objects received from the WebSocket service provided by the device leads to a stack
  buffer overflow. An attacker would be able to exploit this to gain arbitrary code execution
  on a KeyTurner device. This affects Nuki Smart Lock 3.0 before 3.3.5 and 2.0 before 2.12.4,
  as well as Nuki Bridge v1 before 1.22.0 and v2 before 2.13.2.
