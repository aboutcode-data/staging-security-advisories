aliases: []
summary: The iThoughts Advanced Code Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.10. This is due to missing or incorrect
  nonce validation on the 'ithoughts_ace_update_options' AJAX action. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to update plugin settings via a forged request granted they
  can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
