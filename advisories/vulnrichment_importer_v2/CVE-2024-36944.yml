summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  Reapply "drm/qxl: simplify qxl_fence_wait"

  This reverts commit 07ed11afb68d94eadd4ffc082b97c2331307c5ea.

  Stephen Rostedt reports:
   "I went to run my tests on my VMs and the tests hung on boot up.
    Unfortunately, the most I ever got out was:

    [   93.607888] Testing event system initcall: OK
    [   93.667730] Running tests on all trace events:
    [   93.669757] Testing all events: OK
    [   95.631064] ------------[ cut here ]------------
    Timed out after 60 seconds"

  and further debugging points to a possible circular locking dependency
  between the console_owner locking and the worker pool locking.

  Reverting the commit allows Steve's VM to boot to completion again.

  [ This may obviously result in the "[TTM] Buffer eviction failed"
    messages again, which was the reason for that original revert. But at
    this point this seems preferable to a non-booting system... ]
