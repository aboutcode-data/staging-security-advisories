aliases: []
summary: Apache NiFi 1.13.0 through 2.2.0 includes the username and password used to authenticate
  with MongoDB in the NiFi provenance events that MongoDB components generate during processing.
  An authorized user with read access to the provenance events of those processors may see the
  credentials information. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 2.3.0 is the recommended mitigation, which
  removes the credentials from provenance event records.
