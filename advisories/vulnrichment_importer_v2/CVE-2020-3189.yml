aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the VPN System Logging functionality for Cisco Firepower Threat
  Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak
  that can deplete system memory over time, which can cause unexpected system behaviors or device
  crashes. The vulnerability is due to the system memory not being properly freed for a VPN
  System Logging event generated when a VPN session is created or deleted. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly creating or deleting a VPN tunnel connection, which
  could leak a small amount of system memory for each logging event. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to cause system memory depletion, which can lead to a systemwide denial
  of service (DoS) condition. The attacker does not have any control of whether VPN System Logging
  is configured or not on the device, but it is enabled by default.
