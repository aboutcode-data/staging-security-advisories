summary: LinkAce is a self-hosted archive to collect links of your favorite websites. Prior
  to 1.15.6, a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the LinkAce. This
  issue occurs in the "URL" field of the "Edit Link" module, where user input is not properly
  sanitized or encoded before being reflected in the HTML response. This allows attackers to
  inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim’s browser, leading to
  potential session hijacking, data theft, and unauthorized actions. This vulnerability is fixed
  in 1.15.6.
