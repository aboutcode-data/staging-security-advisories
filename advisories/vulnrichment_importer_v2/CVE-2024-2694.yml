aliases: []
summary: The Betheme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions
  up to, and including, 27.5.6 via deserialization of untrusted input of the 'mfn-page-items'
  post meta value. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
  access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable
  plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target
  system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or
  execute code.
