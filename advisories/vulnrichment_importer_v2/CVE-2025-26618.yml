aliases: []
summary: Erlang is a programming language and runtime system for building massively scalable
  soft real-time systems with requirements on high availability. OTP is a set of Erlang libraries,
  which consists of the Erlang runtime system, a number of ready-to-use components mainly written
  in Erlang. Packet size is not verified properly for SFTP packets. As a result when multiple
  SSH packets (conforming to max SSH packet size) are received by ssh, they might be combined
  into an SFTP packet which will exceed the max allowed packet size and potentially cause large
  amount of memory to be allocated. Note that situation described above can only happen for
  successfully authenticated users after completing the SSH handshake. This issue has been patched
  in OTP versions 27.2.4, 26.2.5.9, and 25.3.2.18. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
