aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the email message scanning of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email
  Security Appliance (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass configured
  filters on the device. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of certain email
  fields. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted email message to
  a recipient protected by the ESA. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass
  configured message filters and inject arbitrary scripting code inside the email body. The
  malicious code is not executed by default unless the recipient's email client is configured
  to execute scripts contained in emails.
