aliases: []
summary: 'Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host versions prior to 25.1.102
  and Application prior to 25.1.1413 (Windows client deployments) contain a hardcoded private
  key for the PrinterLogic Certificate Authority (CA) and a hardcoded password in product configuration
  files. The Windows client ships the CA certificate and its associated private key (and other
  sensitive settings such as a configured password) directly in shipped configuration files
  (for example clientsettings.dat and defaults.ini). An attacker who obtains these files can
  impersonate the CA, sign arbitrary certificates trusted by the Windows client, intercept or
  decrypt TLS-protected communications, and otherwise perform man-in-the-middle or impersonation
  attacks against the product''s network communications. This vulnerability has been identified
  by the vendor as: V-2022-001 — Configuration File Contains CA & Private Key.'
