datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2019/1xxx/CVE-2019-1714.json
aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the implementation of Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
  2.0 Single Sign-On (SSO) for Clientless SSL VPN (WebVPN) and AnyConnect Remote Access VPN
  in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD)
  Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to successfully establish a VPN session
  to an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper credential management when using
  NT LAN Manager (NTLM) or basic authentication. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by opening a VPN session to an affected device after another VPN user has successfully authenticated
  to the affected device via SAML SSO. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to connect
  to secured networks behind the affected device.
