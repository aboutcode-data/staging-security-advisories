aliases: []
summary: CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security
  Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running
  the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. Prior to version 1.4.2, there is a command
  Injection vulnerability in initialize_kerberos_keytab_file_login(). The vulnerability exists
  because the code directly interpolates user-controlled input into a shell command and executes
  it via system() without any sanitization or validation. This issue has been patched in version
  1.4.2.
