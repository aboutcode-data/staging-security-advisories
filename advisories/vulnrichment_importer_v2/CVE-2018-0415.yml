aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the implementation of Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN
  (EAPOL) functionality in Cisco Small Business 100 Series Wireless Access Points and Cisco
  Small Business 300 Series Wireless Access Points could allow an authenticated, adjacent attacker
  to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due
  to the improper processing of certain EAPOL frames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a stream of crafted EAPOL frames to an affected device. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to force the access point (AP) to disassociate all the associated stations
  (STAs) and to disallow future, new association requests. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvj97472.'
