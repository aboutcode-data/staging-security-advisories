aliases: []
summary: Pimcore is an open source data and experience management platform. Prior to version
  10.5.19, quoting is not done properly in UUID DAO model. There is the theoretical possibility
  to inject custom SQL if the developer is using this methods with input data and not doing
  proper input validation in advance and so relies on the auto-quoting being done by the DAO
  class. Users should update to version 10.5.19 to receive a patch or, as a workaround, apply
  the patch manually.
