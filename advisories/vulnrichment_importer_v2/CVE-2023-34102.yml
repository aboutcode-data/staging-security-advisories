aliases: []
summary: Avo is an open source ruby on rails admin panel creation framework. The polymorphic
  field type stores the classes to operate on when updating a record with user input, and does
  not validate them in the back end. This can lead to unexpected behavior, remote code execution,
  or application crashes when viewing a manipulated record. This issue has been addressed in
  commit `ec117882d` which is expected to be included in subsequent releases. Users are advised
  to limit access to untrusted users until a new release is made.
