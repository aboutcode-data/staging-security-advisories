summary: 'A vulnerability in the detection engine of Cisco Firepower System Software could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to restart an instance of the Snort detection engine on
  an affected device, resulting in a brief denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability
  is due to the incorrect handling of Transport Layer Security (TLS) TCP connection setup for
  the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TLS
  traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the
  Snort detection engine on the affected device to restart, resulting in a DoS condition. Cisco
