summary: |
  Recording of environment variables, configured for running containers, in Docker Desktop application logs could lead to unintentional disclosure of sensitive information such as api keys, passwords, etc.

  A malicious actor with read access to these logs could obtain sensitive credentials information and further use it to gain unauthorized access to other systems. Starting with version 4.41.0, Docker Desktop no longer logs environment variables set by the user.
