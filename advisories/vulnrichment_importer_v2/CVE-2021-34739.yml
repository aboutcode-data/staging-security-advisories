aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of multiple Cisco Small Business
  Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to replay valid user session
  credentials and gain unauthorized access to the web-based management interface of an affected
  device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient expiration of session credentials. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by conducting a man-in-the-middle attack against an affected
  device to intercept valid session credentials and then replaying the intercepted credentials
  toward the same device at a later time. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access
  the web-based management interface with administrator privileges.
