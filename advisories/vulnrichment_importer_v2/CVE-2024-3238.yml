aliases: []
summary: The WordPress Menu Plugin — Superfly Responsive Menu plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.0.29. This is due to
  missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ajax_handle_delete_icons() function. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files via a forged request granted
  they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
  Please not the CSRF was patched in 5.0.28, however, adequate directory traversal protection
  wasn't introduced until 5.0.30.
