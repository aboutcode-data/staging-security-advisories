aliases: []
summary: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. A vulnerability present in versions
  prior to 3.5.4, 2025.11.2, 2025.12.1, and 2026.1.0 affects anyone who uses S3 for uploads.
  While scripts may be executed, they will only be run in the context of the S3/CDN domain,
  with no site credentials. Versions 3.5.4, 2025.11.2, 2025.12.1, and 2026.1.0 fix the issue.
  As a workaround, disallow html or xml files for uploads in authorized_extensions. For existing
  html xml uploads, site owners can consider deleting them.
