aliases: []
summary: CKAN is an open-source data management system for powering data hubs and data portals.
  Prior to versions 2.9.9 and 2.10.1, the `ckan` user (equivalent to www-data) owned code and
  configuration files in the docker container and the `ckan` user had the permissions to use
  sudo. These issues allowed for code execution or privilege escalation if an arbitrary file
  write bug was available. Versions 2.9.9, 2.9.9-dev, 2.10.1, and 2.10.1-dev contain a patch.
