summary: "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local\
  \ attacker to execute a command injection attack on the underlying operating system of an\
  \ affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid user credentials\
  \ on the affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied\
  \ input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by entering crafted input as the argument\
  \ of an affected CLI command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read and write\
  \ files on the underlying operating system with the privileges of a non-root user account.\
  \ File system access is limited to the permissions that are granted to that non-root user\
  \ account."
