aliases: []
summary: Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) is an interactive video and image annotation
  tool for computer vision. An attacker with an account on an affected CVAT instance is able
  to run arbitrary code in the context of the Nuclio function container. This vulnerability
  affects CVAT deployments that run any of the serverless functions of type tracker from the
  CVAT Git repository, namely TransT and SiamMask. Deployments with custom functions of type
  tracker may also be affected, depending on how they handle state serialization. If a function
  uses an unsafe serialization library such as pickle or jsonpickle, it's likely to be vulnerable.
  Upgrade to CVAT 2.26.0 or later. If you are unable to upgrade, shut down any instances of
  the TransT or SiamMask functions you're running.
