  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net/sched: stop qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog on TC_H_ROOT

  In qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog, Qdiscs with major handle ffff: are assumed
  to be either root or ingress. This assumption is bogus since it's valid
  to create egress qdiscs with major handle ffff:
  Budimir Markovic found that for qdiscs like DRR that maintain an active
  class list, it will cause a UAF with a dangling class pointer.

  In 066a3b5b2346, the concern was to avoid iterating over the ingress
  qdisc since its parent is itself. The proper fix is to stop when parent
  TC_H_ROOT is reached because the only way to retrieve ingress is when a
  hierarchy which does not contain a ffff: major handle call into
  qdisc_lookup with TC_H_MAJ(TC_H_ROOT).

  In the scenario where major ffff: is an egress qdisc in any of the tree
  levels, the updates will also propagate to TC_H_ROOT, which then the
  iteration must stop.
