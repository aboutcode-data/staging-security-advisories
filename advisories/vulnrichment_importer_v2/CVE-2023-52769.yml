  wifi: ath12k: fix htt mlo-offset event locking

  The ath12k active pdevs are protected by RCU but the htt mlo-offset
  event handling code calling ath12k_mac_get_ar_by_pdev_id() was not
  marked as a read-side critical section.

  Mark the code in question as an RCU read-side critical section to avoid
  any potential use-after-free issues.

  Compile tested only.
