aliases: []
summary: Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and
  response. Prior to 4.12.0, a buffer over-read occurs in w_expression_match() when strlen()
  is called on str_test, because the corresponding buffer is not being properly NULL terminated
  during its allocation in OS_CleanMSG(). A compromised agent can cause a READ operation beyond
  the end of the allocated buffer (which may contain sensitive information) by sending a specially
  crafted message to the wazuh manager. An attacker who is able to craft and send an agent message
  to the wazuh manager can cause a buffer over-read and potentially access sensitive data. This
  vulnerability is fixed in 4.12.0.
