aliases: []
summary: 'Kafka UI is an Open-Source Web UI for Apache Kafka Management. Kafka UI API allows
  users to connect to different Kafka brokers by specifying their network address and port.
  As a separate feature, it also provides the ability to monitor the performance of Kafka brokers
  by connecting to their JMX ports. JMX is based on the RMI protocol, so it is inherently susceptible
  to deserialization attacks. A potential attacker can exploit this feature by connecting Kafka
  UI backend to its own malicious broker. This vulnerability affects the deployments where one
  of the following occurs: 1. dynamic.config.enabled property is set in settings. It''s not
  enabled by default, but it''s suggested to be enabled in many tutorials for Kafka UI, including
  its own README.md. OR  2. an attacker has access to the Kafka cluster that is being connected
  to Kafka UI. In this scenario the attacker can exploit this vulnerability to expand their
  access and execute code on Kafka UI as well. Instead of setting up a legitimate JMX port,
  an attacker can create an RMI listener that returns a malicious serialized object for any
  RMI call. In the worst case it could lead to remote code execution as Kafka UI has the required
  gadget chains in its classpath. This issue may lead to post-auth remote code execution. This
  is particularly dangerous as Kafka-UI does not have authentication enabled by default. This
  issue has been addressed in version 0.7.2. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no
  known workarounds for this vulnerability. These issues were discovered and reported by the
  GitHub Security lab and is also tracked as GHSL-2023-230.'
