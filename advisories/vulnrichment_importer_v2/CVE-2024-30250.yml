aliases: []
summary: Astro-Shield is an integration to enhance website security with SubResource Integrity
  hashes, Content-Security-Policy headers, and other techniques. Versions from 1.2.0 to 1.3.1
  of Astro-Shield allow bypass to the allow-lists for cross-origin resources by introducing
  valid `integrity` attributes to the injected code. This implies that the injected SRI hash
  would be added to the generated CSP header, which would lead the browser to believe that the
  injected resource is legit. This vulnerability is patched in version 1.3.2.
