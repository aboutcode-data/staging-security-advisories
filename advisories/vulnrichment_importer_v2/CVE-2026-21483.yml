aliases: []
summary: listmonk is a standalone, self-hosted, newsletter and mailing list manager. Prior to
  version 6.0.0, lower-privileged user with campaign management permissions can inject malicious
  JavaScript into campaigns or templates. When a higher-privileged user (Super Admin) views
  or previews this content, the XSS executes in their browser context, allowing the attacker
  to perform privileged actions such as creating backdoor admin accounts. The attack can be
  weaponized via the public archive feature, where victims simply need to visit a link - no
  preview click required. Version 6.0.0 fixes the issue.
