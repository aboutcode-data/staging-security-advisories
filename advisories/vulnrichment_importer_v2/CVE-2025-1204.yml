aliases: []
summary: The "update" binary in the firmware of the affected product sends attempts to mount
  to a hard-coded, routable IP address, bypassing existing device network settings to do so.
  The function triggers if the 'C' button is pressed at a specific time during the boot process.
  If an attacker is able to control or impersonate this IP address, they could upload and overwrite
  files on the device.
