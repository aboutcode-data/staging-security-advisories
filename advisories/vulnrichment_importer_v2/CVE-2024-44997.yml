  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: ethernet: mtk_wed: fix use-after-free panic in mtk_wed_setup_tc_block_cb()

  When there are multiple ap interfaces on one band and with WED on,
  turning the interface down will cause a kernel panic on MT798X.

  Previously, cb_priv was freed in mtk_wed_setup_tc_block() without
  marking NULL,and mtk_wed_setup_tc_block_cb() didn't check the value, too.

  Assign NULL after free cb_priv in mtk_wed_setup_tc_block() and check NULL
  in mtk_wed_setup_tc_block_cb().
