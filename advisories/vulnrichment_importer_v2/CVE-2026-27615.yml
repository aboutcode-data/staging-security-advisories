aliases: []
summary: ADB Explorer is a fluent UI for ADB on Windows. In versions prior to Beta 0.9.26022,
  ADB-Explorer allows the `ManualAdbPath` settings variable, which determines the path of the
  ADB binary to be executed, to be set to a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path in the application's
  settings file. This allows an attacker to set the binary's path to point to a remote network
  resource, hosted on an attacker-controlled network share, thus granting the attacker full
  control over the binary being executed by the app. An attacker may leverage this vulnerability
  to execute code remotely on a victim's machine with the privileges of the user running the
  app. Exploitation is made possible by convincing a victim to run a shortcut of the app that
  points to a custom `App.txt` settings file, which sets `ManualAdbPath` (for example, when
  downloaded in an archive file). Version Beta 0.9.26022 fixes the issue.
