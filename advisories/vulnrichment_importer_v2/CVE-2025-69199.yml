aliases: []
summary: Wings is the server control plane for Pterodactyl, a free, open-source game server
  management panel. Prior to version 1.12.0, websockets within wings lack proper rate limiting
  and throttling. As a result a malicious user can open a large number of connections and then
  request data through these sockets, causing an excessive volume of data over the network and
  overloading the host system memory and cpu. Additionally, there is not a limit applied to
  the total size of messages being sent or received, allowing a malicious user to open thousands
  of websocket connections and then send massive volumes of information over the socket, overloading
  the host network, and causing increased CPU and memory load within Wings. Version 1.12.0 patches
  the issue.
