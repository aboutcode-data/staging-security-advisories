summary: An issue was discovered in PostCSS before 8.4.31. The vulnerability affects linters
  using PostCSS to parse external untrusted CSS. An attacker can prepare CSS in such a way that
  it will contains parts parsed by PostCSS as a CSS comment. After processing by PostCSS, it
  will be included in the PostCSS output in CSS nodes (rules, properties) despite being included
  in a comment.
