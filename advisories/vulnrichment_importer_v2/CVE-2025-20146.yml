summary: "A vulnerability in the Layer 3 multicast feature of Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco\
  \ ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers, ASR 9902 Compact High-Performance Routers,\
  \ and ASR 9903 Compact High-Performance Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker\
  \ to cause a line card to reset, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\n\
  This vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of malformed IPv4 multicast packets that\
  \ are received on line cards where the interface has either an IPv4 access control list (ACL)\
  \ or a QoS policy applied. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted\
  \ IPv4 multicast packets through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the\
  \ attacker to cause line card exceptions or a hard reset. Traffic over that line card would\
  \ be lost while the line card reloads."
