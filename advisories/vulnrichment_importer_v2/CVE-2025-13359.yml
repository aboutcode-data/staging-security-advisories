aliases: []
summary: The Tag, Category, and Taxonomy Manager – AI Autotagger with OpenAI plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the "getTermsForAjax"  function in all versions
  up to, and including, 3.40.1. This is due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameters
  and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with contributor level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into
  already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database
  granted they have metabox access for the taxonomy (enabled by default for contributors).
