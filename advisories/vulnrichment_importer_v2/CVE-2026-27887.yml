aliases: []
summary: Spin is an open source developer tool for building and running serverless applications
  powered by WebAssembly. When Spin is configured to allow connections to a database or web
  server which could return responses of unbounded size (e.g. tables with many rows or large
  content bodies), Spin may in some cases attempt to buffer the entire response before delivering
  it to the guest, which can lead to the host process running out of memory, panicking, and
  crashing. In addition, a malicious guest application could incrementally insert a large number
  of rows or values into a database and then retrieve them all in a single query, leading to
  large host allocations. Spin 3.6.1, SpinKube 0.6.2, and `containerd-shim-spin` 0.22.1 have
  been patched to address the issue. As a workaround, configure Spin to only allow access to
  trusted databases and HTTP servers which limit response sizes.
