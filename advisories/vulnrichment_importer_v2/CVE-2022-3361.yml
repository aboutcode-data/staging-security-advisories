aliases: []
summary: 'The Ultimate Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to directory traversal in versions
  up to, and including 2.5.0 due to insufficient input validation on the ''template'' attribute
  used in shortcodes. This makes it possible for attackers with administrative privileges to
  supply arbitrary paths using traversal (../../) to access and include files outside of the
  intended directory. If an attacker can successfully upload a php file then remote code execution
  via inclusion may also be possible. Note: for users with less than administrative capabilities,
  /wp-admin access needs to be enabled for that user in order for this to be exploitable by
  those users.'
