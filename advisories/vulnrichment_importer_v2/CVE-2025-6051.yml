summary: A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was discovered in the
  Hugging Face Transformers library, specifically within the `normalize_numbers()` method of
  the `EnglishNormalizer` class. This vulnerability affects versions up to 4.52.4 and is fixed
  in version 4.53.0. The issue arises from the method's handling of numeric strings, which can

  potentially causing service disruption, resource exhaustion, and API vulnerabilities.
