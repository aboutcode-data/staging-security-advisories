summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/smc: fix\
  \ connection leak\n\nThere's a potential leak issue under following execution sequence :\n\
  \nsmc_release  \t\t\t\tsmc_connect_work\nif (sk->sk_state == SMC_INIT)\n\t\t\t\t\tsend_clc_confirim\n\
  \ttcp_abort();\n\t\t\t\t\t...\n\t\t\t\t\tsk.sk_state = SMC_ACTIVE\nsmc_close_active\nswitch(sk->sk_state)\
  \ {\n...\ncase SMC_ACTIVE:\n\tsmc_close_final()\n\t// then wait peer closed\n\nUnfortunately,\
  \ tcp_abort() may discard CLC CONFIRM messages that are\nstill in the tcp send buffer, in\
  \ which case our connection token cannot\nbe delivered to the server side, which means that\
  \ we cannot get a\npassive close message at all. Therefore, it is impossible for the to be\n\
  disconnected at all.\n\nThis patch tries a very simple way to avoid this issue, once the state\n\
  has changed to SMC_ACTIVE after tcp_abort(), we can actively abort the\nsmc connection, considering\
  \ that the state is SMC_INIT before\ntcp_abort(), abandoning the complete disconnection process\
  \ should not\ncause too much problem.\n\nIn fact, this problem may exist as long as the CLC\
  \ CONFIRM message is\nnot received by the server. Whether a timer should be added after\n\
  smc_close_final() needs to be discussed in the future. But even so, this\npatch provides a\
  \ faster release for connection in above case, it should\nalso be valuable."
