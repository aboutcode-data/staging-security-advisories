aliases: []
summary: CediPay is a crypto-to-fiat app for the Ghanaian market. A vulnerability in CediPay
  prior to version 1.2.3 allows attackers to bypass input validation in the transaction API.
  The issue has been fixed in version 1.2.3. If upgrading is not immediately possible, restrict
  API access to trusted networks or IP ranges; enforce strict input validation at the application
  layer; and/or monitor transaction logs for anomalies or suspicious activity. These mitigations
  reduce exposure but do not fully eliminate the vulnerability.
