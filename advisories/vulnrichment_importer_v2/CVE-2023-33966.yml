aliases: []
summary: Deno is a runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript. In deno 1.34.0 and deno_runtime 0.114.0,
  outbound HTTP requests made using the built-in `node:http` or `node:https` modules are incorrectly
  not checked against the network permission allow list (`--allow-net`). Dependencies relying
  on these built-in modules are subject to the vulnerability too. Users of Deno versions prior
  to 1.34.0 are unaffected. Deno Deploy users are unaffected. This problem has been patched
  in Deno v1.34.1 and deno_runtime 0.114.1 and all users are recommended to update to this version.
  No workaround is available for this issue.
