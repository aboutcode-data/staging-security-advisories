aliases: []
summary: Emlog is an open source website building system. In version 2.5.23, article creation
  functionality is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF). This can lead to a user
  being forced to post an article with arbitrary, attacker-controlled content. This, when combined
  with stored cross-site scripting, leads to account takeover. As of time of publication, no
  known patched versions are available.
