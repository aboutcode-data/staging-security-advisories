aliases: []
summary: The commit 3730880 (April 2023) and v.0.9-beta1 of gugoan Economizzer is vulnerable
  to Clickjacking. Clickjacking, also known as a "UI redress attack", is when an attacker uses
  multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a user into clicking on a button or link on
  another page when they were intending to click on the top-level page. Thus, the attacker is
  "hijacking" clicks meant for their page and routing them to another page, most likely owned
  by another application, domain, or both.
