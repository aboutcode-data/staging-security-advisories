aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the CLI parser of Cisco FirePOWER Software for Adaptive Security
  Appliance (ASA) FirePOWER module could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute
  arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of an affected ASA FirePOWER module
  as the root user. This vulnerability is due to improper handling of undefined command parameters.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a crafted command on the CLI or by submitting
  a crafted HTTPS request to the web-based management interface of the Cisco ASA that is hosting
  the ASA FirePOWER module. Note: To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have administrative
  access to the Cisco ASA. A user who has administrative access to a particular Cisco ASA is
  also expected to have administrative access to the ASA FirePOWER module that is hosted by
  that Cisco ASA.'
