aliases: []
summary: In mintplex-labs/anything-llm, a vulnerability exists in the thread update process
  that allows users with Default or Manager roles to escalate their privileges to Administrator.
  The issue arises from improper input validation when handling HTTP POST requests to the endpoint
  `/workspace/:slug/thread/:threadSlug/update`. Specifically, the application fails to validate
  or check user input before passing it to the `workspace_thread` Prisma model for execution.
  This oversight allows attackers to craft a Prisma relation query operation that manipulates
  the `users` model to change a user's role to admin. Successful exploitation grants attackers
  the highest level of user privileges, enabling them to see and perform all actions within
  the system.
