aliases: []
summary: Fugue is a unified interface for distributed computing that lets users execute Python,
  Pandas, and SQL code on Spark, Dask, and Ray with minimal rewrites. In version 0.9.2 and prior,
  there is a remote code execution vulnerability by pickle deserialization via FlaskRPCServer.
  The Fugue framework implements an RPC server system for distributed computing operations.
  In the core functionality of the RPC server implementation, I found that the _decode() function
  in fugue/rpc/flask.py directly uses cloudpickle.loads() to deserialize data without any sanitization.
  This creates a remote code execution vulnerability when malicious pickle data is processed
  by the RPC server. The vulnerability exists in the RPC communication mechanism where the client
  can send arbitrary serialized Python objects that will be deserialized on the server side,
  allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This issue has been
  patched via commit 6f25326.
