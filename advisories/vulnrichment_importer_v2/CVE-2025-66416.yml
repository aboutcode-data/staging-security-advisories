aliases: []
summary: The MCP Python SDK, called `mcp` on PyPI, is a Python implementation of the Model Context
  Protocol (MCP). Prior to version 1.23.0, tThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) Python SDK does
  not enable DNS rebinding protection by default for HTTP-based servers. When an HTTP-based
  MCP server is run on localhost without authentication using FastMCP with streamable HTTP or
  SSE transport, and has not configured TransportSecuritySettings, a malicious website could
  exploit DNS rebinding to bypass same-origin policy restrictions and send requests to the local
  MCP server. This could allow an attacker to invoke tools or access resources exposed by the
  MCP server on behalf of the user in those limited circumstances. Note that running HTTP-based
  MCP servers locally without authentication is not recommended per MCP security best practices.
  This issue does not affect servers using stdio transport. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.23.0.
