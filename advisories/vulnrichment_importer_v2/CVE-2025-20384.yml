summary: In Splunk Enterprise versions below 10.0.1, 9.4.6, 9.3.8, and 9.2.10, and Splunk Cloud
  Platform versions below 10.1.2507.4, 10.0.2503.6, and 9.3.2411.117.125, an unauthenticated
  attacker can inject American National Standards Institute (ANSI) escape codes into Splunk

  potentially impacting log integrity and detection capabilities.
