aliases: []
summary: 'Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) implementation
  for Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers. An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker could execute
  arbitrary code or cause an affected router to leak system memory or reload. A memory leak
  or device reload would cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. For
  more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory. Note:
  LLDP is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be in the same
  broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).'
