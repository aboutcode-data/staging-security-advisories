aliases: []
summary: GRAU DATA Blocky before 3.1 stores passwords encrypted rather than hashed. At the login
  screen, the user's password is compared to the user's decrypted cleartext password. An attacker
  with Windows admin or debugging rights can therefore steal the user's Blocky password and
  from there impersonate that local user.
