aliases: []
summary: EventSentry versions prior to 6.0.1.20 contain an unverified password change vulnerability
  in the account management functionality of the Web Reports interface. The password change
  mechanism does not require validation of the current password before allowing a new password
  to be set. An attacker who gains temporary access to an authenticated user session can change
  the account password without knowledge of the original credentials. This enables persistent
  account takeover and, if administrative accounts are affected, may result in privilege escalation.
