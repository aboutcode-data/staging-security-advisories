aliases: []
summary: The Pinterest Automatic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass
  due to missing capability checks on the 'wp_pinterest_automatic_parse_request' function and
  the 'process_form.php' script in versions up to, and including, 1.14.3. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary options on a site that can be used to create
  new administrative user accounts or redirect unsuspecting site visitors.
