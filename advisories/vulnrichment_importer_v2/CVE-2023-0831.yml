aliases: []
summary: The Under Construction plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in versions up to, and including, 3.96. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the dismiss_notice function called via the admin_action_ucp_dismiss_notice action. This
  makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to dismiss plugin notifications via a forged
  request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
  on a link.
