aliases: []
summary: OctoPrint provides a web interface for controlling consumer 3D printers. In versions
  up to and including 1.10.3, OctoPrint has a vulnerability that allows an attacker to bypass
  the login redirect and directly access the rendered HTML of certain frontend pages. The primary
  risk lies in potential future modifications to the codebase that might incorrectly rely on
  the vulnerable internal functions for authentication checks, leading to security vulnerabilities.
  This issue has been patched in version 1.11.0.
