aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the software image verification functionality of Cisco IOS XE Software
  for the Cisco Catalyst 9000 Family of switches could allow an unauthenticated, physical attacker
  to execute unsigned code at system boot time. The vulnerability is due to an improper check
  in the code function that manages the verification of the digital signatures of system image
  files during the initial boot process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by loading
  unsigned software on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
  boot a malicious software image or execute unsigned code and bypass the image verification
  check part of the secure boot process of an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability,
  the attacker would need to have unauthenticated physical access to the device or obtain privileged
  access to the root shell on the device.
