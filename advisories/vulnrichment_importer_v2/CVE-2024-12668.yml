aliases: []
summary: Velocidex WinPmem versions below 4.1 suffer from an Out of Bounds Write vulnerability. By
  using an IO Control, a user space program can trick the driver into writing a 0 into any chosen
  memory location. In conjunction with information leakage from the WinPmem driver, attackers
  can discover the location in memory for the  g_CiOptions global symbol. This can be leveraged
  to disable signed driver enforcement on the target system - allowing attackers to load unsigned
  drivers.
