aliases: []
summary: Lif Authentication Server is a server used by Lif to do various tasks regarding Lif
  accounts. This vulnerability has to do with the account recovery system where there does not
  appear to be a check to make sure the user has been sent the recovery email and entered the
  correct code. If the attacker knew the email of the target, they could supply the email and
  immediately prompt the server to update the password without ever needing the code. This issue
  has been patched in version 1.7.3.
