  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  scsi: wd33c93: Don't use stale scsi_pointer value

  A regression was introduced with commit dbb2da557a6a ("scsi: wd33c93:
  Move the SCSI pointer to private command data") which results in an oops
  in wd33c93_intr(). That commit added the scsi_pointer variable and
  initialized it from hostdata->connected. However, during selection,
  hostdata->connected is not yet valid. Fix this by getting the current
  scsi_pointer from hostdata->selecting.
