aliases: []
summary: 'SimpleMiningOS through v1259 ships with SSH host keys baked into the installation
  image, which allows man-in-the-middle attacks and makes identification of all public IPv4
  nodes trivial with Shodan.io. NOTE: the vendor indicated that they have no plans to fix this,
  and discourage deployment using public IPv4.'
