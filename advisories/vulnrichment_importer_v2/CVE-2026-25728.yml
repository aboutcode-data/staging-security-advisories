summary: 'ClipBucket v5 is an open source video sharing platform. Prior to 5.5.3 - #40, a Time-of-Check
  to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition vulnerability exists in ClipBucket''s avatar and background
  image upload functionality. The application moves uploaded files to a web-accessible location
  before validating them, creating a window where an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code
  before the file is deleted. The uploaded file was moved to a web-accessible path via move_uploaded_file(),
  then validated via ValidateImage(). If validation failed, the file was deleted via @unlink().
  This vulnerability is fixed in 5.5.3 - #40.'
