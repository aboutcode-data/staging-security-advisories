aliases: []
summary: The ThemeREX Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due
  to missing file type validation in the 'trx_addons_uploads_save_data' function in all versions
  up to, and including, 2.32.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload
  arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
