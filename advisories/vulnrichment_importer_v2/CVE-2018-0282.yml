aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the TCP socket code of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload. The vulnerability
  is due to a state condition between the socket state and the transmission control block (TCB)
  state. While this vulnerability potentially affects all TCP applications, the only affected
  application observed so far is the HTTP server. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending specific HTTP requests at a sustained rate to a reachable IP address of the affected
  software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload,
  resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.
