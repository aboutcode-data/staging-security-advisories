datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2023/5xxx/CVE-2023-5719.json
aliases: []
summary: The Crimson 3.2 Windows-based configuration tool allows users with administrative access
  to define new passwords for users and to download the resulting security configuration to
  a device. If such a password contains the percent (%) character, invalid values will be included,
  potentially truncating the string if a NUL is encountered. If the simplified password is not
  detected by the administrator, the device might be left in a vulnerable state as a result
  of more-easily compromised credentials. Note that passwords entered via the Crimson system
  web server do not suffer from this vulnerability.
