aliases: []
summary: The onOffice for WP-Websites plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via
  the 'order' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 5.7 due to insufficient escaping
  on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This
  makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Editor-level access and above, to append
  additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive
  information from the database.
