aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Integrated Management
  Controller Supervisor Software and Cisco UCS Director Software could allow an authenticated,
  remote attacker to conduct a Document Object Model-based (DOM-based), stored cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device. The
  vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management
  interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading
  a user of the affected interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or
  allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information on the affected device. Cisco
