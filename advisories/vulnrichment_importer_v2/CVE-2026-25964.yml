aliases: []
summary: Tandoor Recipes is an application for managing recipes, planning meals, and building
  shopping lists. Prior to 2.5.1, a Path Traversal vulnerability in the RecipeImport workflow
  of Tandoor Recipes allows authenticated users with import permissions to read arbitrary files
  on the server. This vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation in the file_path parameter
  and insufficient checks in the Local storage backend, enabling an attacker to bypass storage
  directory restrictions and access sensitive system files (e.g., /etc/passwd) or application
  configuration files (e.g., settings.py), potentially leading to full system compromise. This
  vulnerability is fixed in 2.5.1.
