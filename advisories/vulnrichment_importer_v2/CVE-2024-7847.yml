summary: "VULNERABILITY DETAILS\n\nRockwell Automation used the latest versions of the CVSS\
  \ scoring system to assess the following vulnerabilities. The following vulnerabilities were\
  \ reported to us by Sharon Brizinov of Claroty Research - Team82. \n\nA feature in the affected\
  \ products enables users to prepare a project file with an embedded VBA script and can be\
  \ configured to run once the project file has been opened without user intervention.  This\
  \ feature can be abused to trick a legitimate user into executing malicious code upon opening\
  \ an infected RSP/RSS project file. If exploited, a threat actor may be able to perform a\
  \ remote code execution. Connected devices may also be impacted by exploitation of this vulnerability."
