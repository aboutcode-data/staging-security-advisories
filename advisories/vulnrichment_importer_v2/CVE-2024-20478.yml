aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the software upgrade component of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure\
  \ Controller (APIC) and Cisco&nbsp;Cloud Network Controller, formerly Cisco Cloud APIC, could\
  \ allow an authenticated, remote attacker with Administrator-level privileges to install a\
  \ modified software image, leading to arbitrary code injection on an affected system.\r\n\r\
  \nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient signature validation of software images. An attacker\
  \ could exploit this vulnerability by installing a modified software image. A successful exploit\
  \ could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system and elevate their\
  \ privileges to root.\r\nNote: Administrators should always validate the hash of any upgrade\
  \ image before uploading it to Cisco APIC and Cisco Cloud Network Controller."
