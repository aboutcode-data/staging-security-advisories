aliases: []
summary: Fiber Utils is a collection of common functions created for Fiber. In versions 2.0.0-rc.3
  and below, when the system's cryptographic random number generator (crypto/rand) fails, both
  functions silently fall back to returning predictable UUID values, including the zero UUID
  "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000". The vulnerability occurs through two related but distinct
  failure paths, both ultimately caused by crypto/rand.Read() failures, compromising the security
  of all Fiber applications using these functions for security-critical operations. This issue
  is fixed in version 2.0.0-rc.4.
