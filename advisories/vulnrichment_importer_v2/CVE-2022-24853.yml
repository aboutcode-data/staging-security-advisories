summary: 'Metabase is an open source business intelligence and analytics application. Metabase
  has a proxy to load arbitrary URLs for JSON maps as part of our GeoJSON support. While we
  do validation to not return contents of arbitrary URLs, there is a case where a particularly
  crafted request could result in file access on windows, which allows enabling an `NTLM relay
  attack`, potentially allowing an attacker to receive the system password hash. If you use
  Windows and are on this version of Metabase, please upgrade immediately. The following patches
  (or greater versions) are available: 0.42.4 and 1.42.4, 0.41.7 and 1.41.7, 0.40.8 and 1.40.8.'
