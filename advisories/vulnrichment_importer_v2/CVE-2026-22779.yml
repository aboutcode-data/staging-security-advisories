aliases: []
summary: BlackSheep is an asynchronous web framework to build event based web applications with
  Python. Prior to 2.4.6, the HTTP Client implementation in BlackSheep is vulnerable to CRLF
  injection. Missing headers validation makes it possible for an attacker to modify the HTTP
  requests (e.g. insert a new header) or even create a new HTTP request. Exploitation requires
  developers to pass unsanitized user input directly into headers.The server part is not affected
  because BlackSheep delegates to an underlying ASGI server handling of response headers. This
  vulnerability is fixed in 2.4.6.
