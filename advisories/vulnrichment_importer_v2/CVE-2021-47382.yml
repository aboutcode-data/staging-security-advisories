  s390/qeth: fix deadlock during failing recovery

  Commit 0b9902c1fcc5 ("s390/qeth: fix deadlock during recovery") removed
  taking discipline_mutex inside qeth_do_reset(), fixing potential
  deadlocks. An error path was missed though, that still takes
  discipline_mutex and thus has the original deadlock potential.

  Intermittent deadlocks were seen when a qeth channel path is configured
  offline, causing a race between qeth_do_reset and ccwgroup_remove.
  Call qeth_set_offline() directly in the qeth_do_reset() error case and
  then a new variant of ccwgroup_set_offline(), without taking
  discipline_mutex.
