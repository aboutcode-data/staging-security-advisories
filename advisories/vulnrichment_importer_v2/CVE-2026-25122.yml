aliases: []
summary: apko allows users to build and publish OCI container images built from apk packages.
  From version 0.14.8 to before 1.1.0, expandapk.Split drains the first gzip stream of an APK
  archive via io.Copy(io.Discard, gzi) without explicit bounds. With an attacker-controlled
  input stream, this can force large gzip inflation work and lead to resource exhaustion (availability
  impact). The Split function reads the first tar header, then drains the remainder of the gzip
  stream by reading from the gzip reader directly without any maximum uncompressed byte limit
  or inflate-ratio cap. A caller that parses attacker-controlled APK streams may be forced to
  spend excessive CPU time inflating gzip data, leading to timeouts or process slowdown. This
  issue has been patched in version 1.1.0.
