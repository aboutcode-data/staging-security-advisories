aliases: []
summary: 'The Linux-PAM package before 1.5.2-6.1 for openSUSE Tumbleweed allows authentication
  bypass for SSH logins. The pam_access.so module doesn''t correctly restrict login if a user
  tries to connect from an IP address that is not resolvable via DNS. In such conditions, a
  user with denied access to a machine can still get access. NOTE: the relevance of this issue
  is largely limited to openSUSE Tumbleweed and openSUSE Factory; it does not affect Linux-PAM
  upstream.'
