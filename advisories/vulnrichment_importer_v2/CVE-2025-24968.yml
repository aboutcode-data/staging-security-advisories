aliases: []
summary: reNgine is an automated reconnaissance framework for web applications. An unrestricted
  project deletion vulnerability allows attackers with specific roles, such as `penetration_tester`
  or `auditor` to delete all projects in the system. This can lead to a complete system takeover
  by redirecting the attacker to the onboarding page, where they can add or modify users, including
  Sys Admins, and configure critical settings like API keys and user preferences. This issue
  affects all versions up to and including 2.20. Users are advised to monitor the project for
  future releases which address this issue. There are no known workarounds.
