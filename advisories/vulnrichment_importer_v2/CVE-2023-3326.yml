aliases: []
summary: pam_krb5 authenticates a user by essentially running kinit with the password, getting
  a ticket-granting ticket (tgt) from the Kerberos KDC (Key Distribution Center) over the network,
  as a way to verify the password. However, if a keytab is not provisioned on the system, pam_krb5
  has no way to validate the response from the KDC, and essentially trusts the tgt provided
  over the network as being valid. In a non-default FreeBSD installation that leverages pam_krb5
  for authentication and does not have a keytab provisioned, an attacker that is able to control
  both the password and the KDC responses can return a valid tgt, allowing authentication to
  occur for any user on the system.
