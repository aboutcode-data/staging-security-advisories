aliases: []
summary: Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. For versions
  2.9.0-rc1 through 2.14.19, 3.0.0-rc1 through 3.2.0-rc1, 3.1.6 and 3.0.17, when the webhook.azuredevops.username
  and webhook.azuredevops.password are not set in the default configuration, the /api/webhook
  endpoint crashes the entire argocd-server process when it receives an Azure DevOps Push event
  whose JSON array resource.refUpdates is empty. The slice index [0] is accessed without a length
  check, causing an index-out-of-range panic. A single unauthenticated HTTP POST is enough to
  kill the process. This issue is resolved in versions 2.14.20, 3.2.0-rc2, 3.1.8 and 3.0.19.
