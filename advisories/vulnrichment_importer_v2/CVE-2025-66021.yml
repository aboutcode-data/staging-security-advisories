summary: OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer is a configureable HTML Sanitizer written in Java, allowing
  inclusion of HTML authored by third-parties in web applications while protecting against XSS.
  In version 20240325.1,  OWASP java html sanitizer is vulnerable to XSS if HtmlPolicyBuilder
  allows noscript and style tags with allowTextIn inside the style tag. This could lead to XSS
  if the payload is crafted in such a way that it does not sanitise the CSS and allows tags
  which is not mentioned in HTML policy. At time of publication no known patch is available.
