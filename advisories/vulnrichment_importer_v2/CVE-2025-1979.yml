aliases: []
summary: "Versions of the package ray before 2.43.0 are vulnerable to Insertion of Sensitive\
  \ Information into Log File where the redis password is being logged in the standard logging.\
  \ If the redis password is passed as an argument, it will be logged and could potentially\
  \ leak the password.\r\rThis is only exploitable if:\r\r1) Logging is enabled;\r\r2) Redis\
  \ is using password authentication;\r\r3) Those logs are accessible to an attacker, who can\
  \ reach that redis instance.\r\r**Note:**\r\rIt is recommended that anyone who is running\
  \ in this configuration should update to the latest version of Ray, then rotate their redis\
  \ password."
