aliases: []
summary: The Classified Listing – Classified ads & Business Directory Plugin plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.4. This
  is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'rtcl_update_user_account' function.
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the administrator user's password
  and email address via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
  an action such as clicking on a link. This locks the administrator out of the site and prevents
  them from resetting their password, while granting the attacker access to their account.
