aliases: []
summary: Slim Select 2.0 versions through 2.9.0 are affected by a potential cross-site scripting
  vulnerability. In select.ts:createOption(), the text variable from the user-provided Options
  object is assigned to an innerHTML without sanitation. Software that depends on this library
  to dynamically generate lists using unsanitized user-provided input may be vulnerable to cross-site
  scripting, resulting in attacker executed JavaScript. At this time, no patch is available.
