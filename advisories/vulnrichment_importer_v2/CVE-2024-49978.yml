  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  gso: fix udp gso fraglist segmentation after pull from frag_list

  Detect gso fraglist skbs with corrupted geometry (see below) and
  pass these to skb_segment instead of skb_segment_list, as the first
  can segment them correctly.

  Valid SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST skbs
  - consist of two or more segments
  - the head_skb holds the protocol headers plus first gso_size
  - one or more frag_list skbs hold exactly one segment
  - all but the last must be gso_size

  Optional datapath hooks such as NAT and BPF (bpf_skb_pull_data) can
  modify these skbs, breaking these invariants.

  In extreme cases they pull all data into skb linear. For UDP, this
  causes a NULL ptr deref in __udpv4_gso_segment_list_csum at
  udp_hdr(seg->next)->dest.

  Detect invalid geometry due to pull, by checking head_skb size.
  Don't just drop, as this may blackhole a destination. Convert to be
  able to pass to regular skb_segment.
