summary: 'An open redirect vulnerability exists in the /preauth Servlet in Zimbra Collaboration
  Suite through 9.0 and 8.8.15. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would need to have
  obtained a valid zimbra auth token or a valid preauth token. Once the token is obtained, an
  attacker could redirect a user to any URL if url sanitisation is bypassed in incoming requests.
  NOTE: this is similar, but not identical, to CVE-2021-34807.'
