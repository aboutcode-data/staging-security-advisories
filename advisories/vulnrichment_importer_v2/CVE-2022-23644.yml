aliases: []
summary: BookWyrm is a decentralized social network for tracking reading habits and reviewing
  books. The functionality to load a cover via url is vulnerable to a server-side request forgery
  attack. Any BookWyrm instance running a version prior to v0.3.0 is susceptible to attack from
  a logged-in user. The problem has been patched and administrators should upgrade to version
  0.3.0 As a workaround, BookWyrm instances can close registration and limit members to trusted
  individuals.
