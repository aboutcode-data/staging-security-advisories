aliases: []
summary: The Salon Booking System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in versions up to, and including, 8.4.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the 'save_customer' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change
  the admin role to customer or change the user meta to arbitrary values via a forged request,
  granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on
  a link.
