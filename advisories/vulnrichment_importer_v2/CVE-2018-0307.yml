summary: 'A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local
  attacker to perform a command-injection attack on an affected device. The vulnerability is
  due to insufficient input validation of command arguments. An attacker could exploit this
  vulnerability by injecting malicious command arguments into a vulnerable CLI command. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker, authenticated as a privileged user, to execute arbitrary
  commands with root privileges. Note: On products that support multiple virtual device contexts
  (VDC), this vulnerability could allow an attacker to access files from any VDC. This vulnerability
  affects Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders, Nexus 3000 Series Switches, Nexus 3500 Platform
  Switches, Nexus 3600 Platform Switches, Nexus 5500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5600 Platform
