aliases: []
summary: The WooCommerce Ultimate Gift Card plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
  file uploads due to insufficient file type validation in the 'mwb_wgm_preview_mail' and 'mwb_wgm_woocommerce_add_cart_item_data'
  functions in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code
  execution possible.
