aliases: []
summary: Linkr is a lightweight file delivery system that downloads files from a webserver.
  Linkr versions through 2.0.0 do not verify the integrity or authenticity of .linkr manifest
  files before using their contents, allowing a tampered manifest to inject arbitrary file entries
  into a package distribution. An attacker can modify a generated .linkr manifest (for example
  by adding a new entry with a malicious URL) and when a user runs the extract command the client
  downloads the attacker-supplied file without verification. This enables arbitrary file injection
  and creates a potential path to remote code execution if a downloaded malicious binary or
  script is later executed. Version 2.0.1 adds a manifest integrity check that compares the
  checksum of the original author-created manifest to the one being extracted and aborts on
  mismatch, warning if no original manifest is hosted. Users should update to 2.0.1 or later.
  As a workaround prior to updating, use only trusted .linkr manifests, manually verify manifest
  integrity, and host manifests on trusted servers.
