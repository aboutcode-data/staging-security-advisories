aliases: []
summary: smartbanner.js is a customizable smart app banner for iOS and Android. Prior to version
  1.14.1, clicking on smartbanner `View` link and navigating to 3rd party page leaves `window.opener`
  exposed. It may allow hostile third parties to abuse `window.opener`, e.g. by redirection
  or injection on the original page with smartbanner. `rel="noopener"` is automatically populated
  to links as of `v1.14.1` which is a recommended upgrade to resolve the vulnerability. Some
  workarounds are available for those who cannot upgrade. Ensure `View` link is only taking
  users to App Store or Google Play Store where security is guarded by respective app store
  security teams. If `View` link is going to a third party page, limit smartbanner.js to be
  used on iOS that decreases the scope of the vulnerability since as of Safari 12.1,  `rel="noopener"`
  is imposed on all `target="_blank"` links. Version 1.14.1 of smartbanner.js contains a fix
  for the issue.
