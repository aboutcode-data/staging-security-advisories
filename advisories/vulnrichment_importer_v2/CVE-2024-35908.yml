summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  tls: get psock ref after taking rxlock to avoid leak

  At the start of tls_sw_recvmsg, we take a reference on the psock, and
  then call tls_rx_reader_lock. If that fails, we return directly
  without releasing the reference.

  Instead of adding a new label, just take the reference after locking
  has succeeded, since we don't need it before.
