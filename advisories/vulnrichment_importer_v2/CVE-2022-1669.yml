aliases: []
summary: A buffer overflow vulnerability has been detected in the firewall function of the device
  management web portal. The device runs a CGI binary (index.cgi) to offer a management web
  application. Once authenticated with valid credentials in this web portal, a potential attacker
  could submit any "Address" value and it would be copied to a second variable with a "strcpy"
  vulnerable function without checking its length. Because of this, it is possible to send a
  long address value to overflow the process stack, controlling the function return address.
