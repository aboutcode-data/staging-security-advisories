aliases: []
summary: 'MDaemon Mail Server 23.5.2 validates SPF, DKIM, and DMARC using the email enclosed
  in angle brackets (<>) in the From: header of SMTP DATA. An attacker can craft a From: header
  with multiple invisible Unicode thin spaces to display a spoofed sender while passing validation,
  allowing email spoofing even when anti-spoofing protections are in place. NOTE: this is disputed
  by the Supplier because UI spoofing occurs in a client, not in a server such as MDaemon''s
  product or any other server implementation. Also, if a client without its own spoofing protection
  must be used, the Header Screening feature in MDaemon''s product can be employed to mitigate
  the client-side vulnerability.'
