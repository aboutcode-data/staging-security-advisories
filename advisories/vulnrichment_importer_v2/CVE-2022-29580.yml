aliases: []
summary: There exists a path traversal vulnerability in the Android Google Search app. This
  is caused by the incorrect usage of uri.getLastPathSegment. A symbolic encoded string can
  bypass the path logic to get access to unintended directories. An attacker can manipulate
  paths that could lead to code execution on the device. We recommend upgrading beyond version
  13.41
