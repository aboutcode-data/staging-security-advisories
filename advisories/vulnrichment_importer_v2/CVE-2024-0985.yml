aliases: []
summary: Late privilege drop in REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY in PostgreSQL allows
  an object creator to execute arbitrary SQL functions as the command issuer. The command intends
  to run SQL functions as the owner of the materialized view, enabling safe refresh of untrusted
  materialized views. The victim is a superuser or member of one of the attacker's roles. The
  attack requires luring the victim into running REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY on the
  attacker's materialized view. Versions before PostgreSQL 16.2, 15.6, 14.11, 13.14, and 12.18
  are affected.
