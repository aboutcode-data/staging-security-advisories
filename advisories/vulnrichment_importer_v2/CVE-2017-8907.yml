datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2017/8xxx/CVE-2017-8907.json
aliases: []
summary: Atlassian Bamboo 5.x before 5.15.7 and 6.x before 6.0.1 did not correctly check if
  a user creating a deployment project had the edit permission and therefore the rights to do
  so.  An attacker who can login to Bamboo as a user without the edit permission for deployment
  projects is able to use this vulnerability, provided there is an existing plan with a green
  build, to create a deployment project and execute arbitrary code on an available Bamboo Agent.  By
  default a local agent is enabled; this means that code execution can occur on the system hosting
  Bamboo as the user running Bamboo.
