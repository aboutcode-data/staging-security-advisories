aliases: []
summary: The Contact Form Email WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  due to insufficient input validation and escaping via the name parameter found in the ~/trunk/cp-admin-int-list.inc.php
  file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts,
  in versions up to and including 1.3.24. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html
  is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled.
