  scsi: target: Fix WRITE_SAME No Data Buffer crash

  In newer version of the SBC specs, we have a NDOB bit that indicates there
  is no data buffer that gets written out. If this bit is set using commands
  like "sg_write_same --ndob" we will crash in target_core_iblock/file's
  execute_write_same handlers when we go to access the se_cmd->t_data_sg
  because its NULL.

  This patch adds a check for the NDOB bit in the common WRITE SAME code
  because we don't support it. And, it adds a check for zero SG elements in
  each handler in case the initiator tries to send a normal WRITE SAME with
  no data buffer.
