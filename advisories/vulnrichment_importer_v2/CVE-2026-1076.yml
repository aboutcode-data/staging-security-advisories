aliases: []
summary: The Star Review Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.2. This is due to missing nonce validation on the
  settings page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin's
  CSS settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
  an action such as clicking on a link.
