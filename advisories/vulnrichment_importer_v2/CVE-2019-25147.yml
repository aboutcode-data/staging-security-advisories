aliases: []
summary: The Pretty Links plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via various IP headers as well as the referer header in versions up to, and including, 2.1.9
  due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the track_link function. This
  makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that
  will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
