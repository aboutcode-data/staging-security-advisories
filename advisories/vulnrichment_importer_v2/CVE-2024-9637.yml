aliases: []
summary: The School Management System – WPSchoolPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.10. This
  is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details
  like email. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with teacher-level access
  and above, to change arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators, and leverage
  that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account.
