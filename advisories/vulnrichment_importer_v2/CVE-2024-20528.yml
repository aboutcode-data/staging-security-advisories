summary: "A vulnerability in the API of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker\
  \ to upload files to arbitrary locations on the underlying operating system of an affected\
  \ device. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid Super&nbsp;Admin credentials.\r\
  \n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied parameters in\
  \ API requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted API request\
  \ to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to upload custom files\
  \ to arbitrary locations on the underlying operating system, execute arbitrary code, and elevate\
  \ privileges to root."
