aliases: []
summary: Piwigo is a full featured open source photo gallery application for the web. In Piwigo
  15.6.0, using the password reset function allows sending a password-reset URL by entering
  an existing username or email address. However, the hostname used to construct this URL is
  taken from the HTTP request's Host header and is not validated at all. Therefore, an attacker
  can send a password-reset URL with a modified hostname to an existing user whose username
  or email the attacker knows or guesses. This issue has been patched in version 15.7.0.
