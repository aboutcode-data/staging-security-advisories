aliases: []
summary: melange allows users to build apk packages using declarative pipelines. In version
  0.11.3 to before 0.40.3, an attacker who can influence the tar stream from a QEMU guest VM
  could write files outside the intended workspace directory on the host. The retrieveWorkspace
  function extracts tar entries without validating that paths stay within the workspace, allowing
  path traversal via ../ sequences. This issue has been patched in version 0.40.3.
