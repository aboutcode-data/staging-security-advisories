aliases: []
summary: Bagisto is an open source laravel eCommerce platform. In versions on the 2.3 branch
  prior to 2.3.10, API routes remain active even after initial installation is complete. The
  underlying API endpoints (`/install/api/*`) are directly accessible and exploitable without
  any authentication. An attacker can bypass the Ib installer entirely by calling the API endpoints
  directly. This allows any unauthenticated attacker to create admin accounts, modify application
  configurations, and potentially overwrite existing data. Version 2.3.10 fixes the issue.
