  drm/vmwgfx: Fix stale file descriptors on failed usercopy

  A failing usercopy of the fence_rep object will lead to a stale entry in
  the file descriptor table as put_unused_fd() won't release it. This
  enables userland to refer to a dangling 'file' object through that still
  valid file descriptor, leading to all kinds of use-after-free
  exploitation scenarios.

  Fix this by deferring the call to fd_install() until after the usercopy
  has succeeded.
