aliases: []
summary: 'An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. A secondary authentication
  system is available for Installers called the Grid Guard system. This system uses predictable
  codes, and a single Grid Guard code can be used on any SMA inverter. Any such code, when combined
  with the installer account, allows changing very sensitive parameters. NOTE: the vendor reports
  that Grid Guard is not an authentication feature; it is only a tracing feature. Also, only
  Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected'
