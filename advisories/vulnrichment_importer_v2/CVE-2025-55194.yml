aliases: []
summary: Part-DB is an open source inventory management system for electronic components. Prior
  to version 1.17.3, any authenticated user can upload a profile picture with a misleading file
  extension (e.g., .jpg.txt), resulting in a persistent 500 Internal Server Error when attempting
  to view or edit that user’s profile. This makes the profile permanently inaccessible via the
  UI for both users and administrators, constituting a Denial of Service (DoS) within the user
  management interface. This issue has been patched in version 1.17.3.
