  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  nvme-tcp: fix potential memory corruption in nvme_tcp_recv_pdu()

  nvme_tcp_recv_pdu() doesn't check the validity of the header length.
  When header digests are enabled, a target might send a packet with an
  invalid header length (e.g. 255), causing nvme_tcp_verify_hdgst()
  to access memory outside the allocated area and cause memory corruptions
  by overwriting it with the calculated digest.

  Fix this by rejecting packets with an unexpected header length.
