aliases: []
summary: The Beaver Builder – WordPress Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
  bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.4. This is due to the plugin not properly
  verifying a user's authorization in the disable() function. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with contributor level access and above, to disable the Beaver Builder layout on
  arbitrary posts and pages, causing content integrity issues and layout disruption on those
  pages.
