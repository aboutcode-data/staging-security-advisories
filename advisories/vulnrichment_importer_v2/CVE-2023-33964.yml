aliases: []
summary: mx-chain-go is an implementation of the MultiversX blockchain protocol written in the
  Go language. Metachain cannot process a cross-shard miniblock. Prior to version 1.4.16, an
  invalid transaction with the wrong username on metachain is not treated correctly on the metachain
  transaction processor. This is strictly a processing issue that could have happened on MultiversX
  chain. If an error like this had occurred, the metachain would have stopped notarizing blocks
  from the shard chains. The resuming of notarization is possible only after applying a patched
  binary version. A patch in version 1.4.16 introduces `processIfTxErrorCrossShard` for the
  metachain transaction processor. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
