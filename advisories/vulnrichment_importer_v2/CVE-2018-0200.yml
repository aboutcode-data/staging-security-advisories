summary: 'A vulnerability in the web-based interface of Cisco Prime Service Catalog could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
  against a user of the web-based interface of an affected product. The vulnerability is due
  to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based interface. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted
  link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the
  context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.
