summary: The Ninja Forms Contact Form – The Drag and Drop Form Builder for WordPress plugin
  for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via an image title embedded into
  a form in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.0 due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level
  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses an injected page.
