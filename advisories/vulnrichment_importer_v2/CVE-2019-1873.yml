aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the cryptographic driver for Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance
  Software (ASA) and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to cause the device to reboot unexpectedly. The vulnerability is due to incomplete
  input validation of a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) ingress
  packet header. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted TLS/SSL packet
  to an interface on the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device
  to reload, which will result in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Note: Only traffic directed
  to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects
  systems configured in routed and transparent firewall mode and in single or multiple context
  mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. A valid SSL or TLS session
  is required to exploit this vulnerability.'
