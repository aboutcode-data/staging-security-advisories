aliases: []
summary: The The Ultimate WordPress Toolkit – WP Extended plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing
  capability check on the module_all_toggle_ajax() function in all versions up to, and including,
  3.0.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and
  above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update
  the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers
  to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site.
