aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Common Open Policy Service (COPS) of Cisco IOS XE Software for
  Cisco cBR-8 Converged Broadband Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
  cause resource exhaustion, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability
  is due to a deadlock condition in the code when processing COPS packets under certain conditions.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending COPS packets with high burst rates
  to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the CPU to consume
  excessive resources, which prevents other control plane processes from obtaining resources
  and results in a DoS.
