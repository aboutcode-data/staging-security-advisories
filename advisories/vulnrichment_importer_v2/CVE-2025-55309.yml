aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Foxit PDF and Editor for Windows and macOS before 13.2 and
  2025 before 2025.2. A crafted PDF can contain JavaScript that attaches an OnBlur action on
  a form field that destroys an annotation. During user right-click interaction, the program's
  internal focus change handling prematurely releases the annotation object, resulting in a
  use-after-free vulnerability that may cause memory corruption or application crashes.
