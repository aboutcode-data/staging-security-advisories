aliases: []
summary: Flask-Reuploaded provides file uploads for Flask. A critical path traversal and extension
  bypass vulnerability in versions prior to 1.5.0 allows remote attackers to achieve arbitrary
  file write and remote code execution through Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI). Flask-Reuploaded
  has been patched in version 1.5.0. Some workarounds are available. Do not pass user input
  to the `name` parameter, use auto-generated filenames only, and implement strict input validation
  if `name` must be used.
