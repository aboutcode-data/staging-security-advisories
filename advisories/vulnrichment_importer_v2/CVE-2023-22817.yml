aliases: []
summary: Server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability that could allow a rogue server on
  the local network to modify its URL using another DNS address to point back to the loopback
  adapter. This could then allow the URL to exploit other vulnerabilities on the local server.
  This was addressed by fixing DNS addresses that refer to loopback. This issue affects My Cloud
  OS 5 devices before 5.27.161, My Cloud Home, My Cloud Home Duo and SanDisk ibi devices before
  9.5.1-104.
