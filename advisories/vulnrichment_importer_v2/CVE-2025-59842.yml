aliases: []
summary: jupyterlab is an extensible environment for interactive and reproducible computing,
  based on the Jupyter Notebook Architecture. Prior to version 4.4.8, links generated with LaTeX
  typesetters in Markdown files and Markdown cells in JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook did not
  include the noopener attribute. This is deemed to have no impact on the default installations.
  Theoretically users of third-party LaTeX-rendering extensions could find themselves vulnerable
  to reverse tabnabbing attacks if links generated by those extensions included target=_blank
  (no such extensions are known at time of writing) and they were to click on a link generated
  in LaTeX (typically visibly different from other links). This issue has been patched in version
  4.4.8.
