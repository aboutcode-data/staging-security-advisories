aliases: []
summary: The Kubio AI Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion
  in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.1 via thekubio_hybrid_theme_load_template function.
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary files
  on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to
  bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images
  and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included.
