aliases: []
summary: SandboxJS is a JavaScript sandboxing library. Prior to 0.8.29, there is a sandbox escape
  vulnerability due to a mismatch between the key on which the validation is performed and the
  key used for accessing properties. Even though the key used in property accesses is annotated
  as string, this is never enforced. So, attackers can pass malicious objects that coerce to
  different string values when used, e.g., one for the time the key is sanitized using hasOwnProperty(key)
  and a different one for when the key is used for the actual property access. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 0.8.29.
