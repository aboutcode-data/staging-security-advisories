aliases: []
summary: The Photo Gallery by 10Web – Mobile-Friendly Image Gallery plugin for WordPress is
  vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including,
  1.8.30 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary
  web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only
  affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
