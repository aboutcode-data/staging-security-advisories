datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2026/0xxx/CVE-2026-0714.json
aliases: []
summary: A physical attack vulnerability exists in certain Moxa industrial computers using TPM-backed
  LUKS full-disk encryption on Moxa Industrial Linux 3, where the discrete TPM is connected
  to the CPU via an SPI bus. Exploitation requires invasive physical access, including opening
  the device and attaching external equipment to the SPI bus to capture TPM communications.
  If successful, the captured data may allow offline decryption of eMMC contents. This attack
  cannot be performed through brief or opportunistic physical access and requires extended physical
  access, possession of the device, appropriate equipment, and sufficient time for signal capture
  and analysis. Remote exploitation is not possible.
