aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the file type detection mechanism of the Cisco Advanced Malware
  Protection (AMP) for Endpoints macOS Connector could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to bypass malware detection. The vulnerability occurs because the software relies on only
  the file extension for detecting DMG files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
  sending a DMG file with a nonstandard extension to a device that is running an affected AMP
  for Endpoints macOS Connector. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured malware
  detection. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve34034.'
