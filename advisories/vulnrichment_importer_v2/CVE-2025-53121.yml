aliases: []
summary: Multiple stored XSS were found on different nodes with unsanitized parameters in OpenMNS
  Horizon 33.0.8 and versions earlier than 33.1.6 on multiple platforms that allow an attacker
  to store on database and then inject HTML and/or Javascript on the page. The solution is to
  upgrade to Horizon 33.1.6, 33.1.7 or Meridian 2024.2.6, 2024.2.7 or newer. Meridian and Horizon
  installation instructions state that they are intended for installation within an organization's
  private networks and should not be directly accessible from the Internet. OpenNMS thanks Fábio
  Tomé for reporting this issue.
