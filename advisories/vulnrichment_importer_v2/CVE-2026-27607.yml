aliases: []
summary: RustFS is a distributed object storage system built in Rust. In versions 1.0.0-alpha.56
  through 1.0.0-alpha.82, RustFS does not validate policy conditions in presigned POST uploads
  (PostObject), allowing attackers to bypass content-length-range, starts-with, and Content-Type
  constraints. This enables unauthorized file uploads exceeding size limits, uploads to arbitrary
  object keys, and content-type spoofing, potentially leading to storage exhaustion, unauthorized
  data access, and security bypasses. Version 1.0.0-alpha.83 fixes the issue.
