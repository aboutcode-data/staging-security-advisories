summary: The Custom Product List Table plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce

  add, delete, bulk edit, approve or cancel products via a forged request granted they can trick
  a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
