aliases: []
summary: Cowrie versions prior to 2.9.0 contain a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability
  in the emulated shell implementation of wget and curl. In the default emulated shell configuration,
  these command emulations perform real outbound HTTP requests to attacker-supplied destinations.
  Because no outbound request rate limiting was enforced, unauthenticated remote attackers could
  repeatedly invoke these commands to generate unbounded HTTP traffic toward arbitrary third-party
  targets, allowing the Cowrie honeypot to be abused as a denial-of-service amplification node
  and masking the attacker’s true source address behind the honeypot’s IP.
