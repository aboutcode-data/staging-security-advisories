summary: A vulnerability in the web-based interface of the Cisco SPA112 2-Port Phone Adapter
  could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
  against another user of the device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of
  user-supplied input by the web-based interface of the affected device. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by inserting malicious code in one of the configuration fields. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected
  interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
