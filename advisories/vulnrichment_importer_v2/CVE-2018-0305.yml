summary: 'A vulnerability in the Cisco Fabric Services component of Cisco FXOS Software and
  Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of
  service (DoS) condition on the affected device. The vulnerability exists because the affected
  software insufficiently validates Cisco Fabric Services packets. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by sending a crafted Cisco Fabric Services packet to an affected device.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to force a NULL pointer dereference and cause
  a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects the following if configured to use Cisco Fabric
  Services: Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewalls, Firepower 9300 Security Appliance,
  MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches, Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders, Nexus 3000 Series
  Switches, Nexus 3500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5600 Platform
  Switches, Nexus 6000 Series Switches, Nexus 7000 Series Switches, Nexus 7700 Series Switches,
  Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode, Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric
  Modules, UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnects, UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects, UCS 6300
  Series Fabric Interconnects. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd69966, CSCve02435, CSCve04859, CSCve41590,
