aliases: []
summary: trunk.cocoapods.org is the authentication server for the CoacoaPods dependency manager.
  Prior to commit d4fa66f49cedab449af9a56a21ab40697b9f7b97, the trunk sessions verification
  step could be manipulated for owner session hijacking Compromising a victim’s session will
  result in a full takeover of the CocoaPods trunk account. The threat actor could manipulate
  their pod specifications, disrupt the distribution of legitimate libraries, or cause widespread
  disruption within the CocoaPods ecosystem. This was patched server-side with commit d4fa66f49cedab449af9a56a21ab40697b9f7b97
  in October 2023.
