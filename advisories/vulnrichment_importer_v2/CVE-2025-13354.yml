aliases: []
summary: The Tag, Category, and Taxonomy Manager – AI Autotagger with OpenAI plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to authorization bypass in all versions up to, and including, 3.40.1. This is
  due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform an action in
  the "taxopress_merge_terms_batch" function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with subscriber level access and above, to merge or delete arbitrary taxonomy terms.
