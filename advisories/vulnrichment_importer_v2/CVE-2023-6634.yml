aliases: []
summary: The LearnPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Command Injection in all versions
  up to, and including, 4.2.5.7 via the get_content function. This is due to the plugin making
  use of the call_user_func function with user input. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to execute any public function with one parameter, which could result in remote
  code execution.
