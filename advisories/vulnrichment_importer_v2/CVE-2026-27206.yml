aliases: []
summary: Zumba Json Serializer is a library to serialize PHP variables in JSON format. In versions
  3.2.2 and below, the library allows deserialization of PHP objects from JSON using a special
  @type field. The deserializer instantiates any class specified in the @type field without
  restriction. When processing untrusted JSON input, this behavior may allow an attacker to
  instantiate arbitrary classes available in the application. If a vulnerable application passes
  attacker-controlled JSON into JsonSerializer::unserialize() and contains classes with dangerous
  magic methods (such as __wakeup() or __destruct()), this may lead to PHP Object Injection
  and potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE), depending on available gadget chains in the application
  or its dependencies. This behavior is similar in risk profile to PHP's native unserialize()
  when used without the allowed_classes restriction. Applications are impacted only if untrusted
  or attacker-controlled JSON is passed into JsonSerializer::unserialize() and the application
  or its dependencies contain classes that can be leveraged as a gadget chain. This issue has
  been fixed in version 3.2.3. If an immediate upgrade isn't feasible, mitigate the vulnerability
  by never deserializing untrusted JSON with JsonSerializer::unserialize(), validating and sanitizing
  all JSON input before deserialization, and disabling @type-based object instantiation wherever
  possible.
