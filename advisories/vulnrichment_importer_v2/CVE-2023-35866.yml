aliases: []
summary: 'In KeePassXC through 2.7.5, a local attacker can make changes to the Database security
  settings, including master password and second-factor authentication, within an authenticated
  KeePassXC Database session, without the need to authenticate these changes by entering the
  password and/or second-factor authentication to confirm changes. NOTE: the vendor''s position
  is "asking the user for their password prior to making any changes to the database settings
  adds no additional protection against a local attacker."'
