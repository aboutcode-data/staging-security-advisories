aliases: []
summary: Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open Information
  Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. Versions 8.0.0 and below incorrectly handle
  the entropy keyword when not anchored to a "sticky" buffer, which can lead to a segmentation
  fault. This issue is fixed in version 8.0.1. To workaround this issue, users can disable rules
  using the entropy keyword, or validate they are anchored to a sticky buffer.
