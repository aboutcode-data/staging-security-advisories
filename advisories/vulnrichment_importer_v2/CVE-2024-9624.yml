aliases: []
summary: The WP All Import Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 4.9.3 due to missing SSRF protection on the pmxi_curl_download
  function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access
  and above, to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application
  and can be used to query and modify information from internal services. On cloud platforms,
  it might allow attackers to read the Instance metadata.
