summary: "A vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM), Cisco Unified\
  \ Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME), Cisco Unified Communications\
  \ Manager IM &amp; Presence Service (Unified CM IM&amp;P), Cisco Unity Connection, and Cisco\
  \ Webex Calling Dedicated Instance could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute\
  \ arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of an affected device.&nbsp;\r\n\r\
  \nThis vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input in HTTP requests.\
  \ An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a sequence of crafted HTTP requests\
  \ to the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could\
  \ allow the attacker to obtain user-level access to the underlying operating system and then\
  \ elevate privileges to root.&nbsp;\r\nNote: Cisco has assigned this security advisory a Security\
  \ Impact Rating (SIR) of Critical rather than High as the score indicates. The reason is that\
  \ exploitation of this vulnerability could result in an attacker elevating privileges to root."
