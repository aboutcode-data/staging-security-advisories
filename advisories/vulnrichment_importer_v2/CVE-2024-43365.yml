aliases: []
summary: Cacti is an open source performance and fault management framework. The`consolenewsection`
  parameter is not properly sanitized when saving external links in links.php . Morever, the
  said consolenewsection parameter is stored in the database and reflected back to user in `index.php`,
  finally leading to stored XSS. Users with the privilege to create external links can manipulate
  the “consolenewsection” parameter in the http post request while creating external links to
  perform stored XSS attacks. The vulnerability known as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) occurs when
  an application allows untrusted user input to be displayed on a web page without proper validation
  or escaping. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.2.28. All users are advised
  to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
