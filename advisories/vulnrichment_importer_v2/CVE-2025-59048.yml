aliases: []
summary: OpenBao's AWS Plugin generates AWS access credentials based on IAM policies. Prior
  to version 0.1.1, the AWS Plugin is vulnerable to cross-account IAM role Impersonation in
  the AWS auth method. The vulnerability allows an IAM role from an untrusted AWS account to
  authenticate by impersonating a role with the same name in a trusted account, leading to unauthorized
  access. This impacts all users of the auth-aws plugin who operate in a multi-account AWS environment
  where IAM role names may not be unique across accounts. This vulnerability has been patched
  in version 0.1.1 of the auth-aws plugin. A workaround for this issue involves guaranteeing
  that IAM role names are unique across all AWS accounts that could potentially interact with
  your OpenBao environment, and to audit for any duplicate IAM roles.
