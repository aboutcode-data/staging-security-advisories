summary: The Contact Form, Survey & Form Builder – MightyForms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'mightyforms' shortcode in all versions up
  to, and including, 1.3.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user

  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses an injected page.
