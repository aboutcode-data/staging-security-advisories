aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the CLI parser of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated,
  local attacker to gain access to the underlying Linux shell of an affected device and execute
  arbitrary commands with root privileges on the device. The vulnerability is due to the affected
  software improperly sanitizing command arguments to prevent modifications to the underlying
  Linux filesystem on a device. An attacker who has privileged EXEC mode (privilege level 15)
  access to an affected device could exploit this vulnerability on the device by executing CLI
  commands that contain crafted arguments. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
  gain access to the underlying Linux shell of the affected device and execute arbitrary commands
  with root privileges on the device.
