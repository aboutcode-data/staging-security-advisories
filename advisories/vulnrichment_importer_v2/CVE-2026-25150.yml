aliases: []
summary: Qwik is a performance focused javascript framework. Prior to version 1.19.0, a prototype
  pollution vulnerability exists in the formToObj() function within @builder.io/qwik-city middleware.
  The function processes form field names with dot notation (e.g., user.name) to create nested
  objects, but fails to sanitize dangerous property names like __proto__, constructor, and prototype.
  This allows unauthenticated attackers to pollute Object.prototype by sending crafted HTTP
  POST requests, potentially leading to privilege escalation, authentication bypass, or denial
  of service. This issue has been patched in version 1.19.0.
