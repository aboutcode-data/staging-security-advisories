  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net/mlx5: Fix a race on command flush flow

  Fix a refcount use after free warning due to a race on command entry.
  Such race occurs when one of the commands releases its last refcount and
  frees its index and entry while another process running command flush
  flow takes refcount to this command entry. The process which handles
  commands flush may see this command as needed to be flushed if the other
  process released its refcount but didn't release the index yet. Fix it
  by adding the needed spin lock.

  It fixes the following warning trace:

  refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.
  WARNING: CPU: 11 PID: 540311 at lib/refcount.c:25 refcount_warn_saturate+0x80/0xe0
