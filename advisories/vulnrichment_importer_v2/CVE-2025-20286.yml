aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure\
  \ (OCI) cloud deployments of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an unauthenticated,\
  \ remote attacker to access sensitive data, execute limited administrative operations, modify\
  \ system configurations, or disrupt services within the impacted systems.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability\
  \ exists because credentials are improperly generated when Cisco ISE is being deployed on\
  \ cloud platforms, resulting in different Cisco ISE deployments sharing the same credentials.\
  \ These credentials are shared across multiple Cisco ISE deployments as long as the software\
  \ release and cloud platform are the same. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by\
  \ extracting the user credentials from Cisco ISE that is deployed in the cloud and then using\
  \ them to access Cisco ISE that is deployed in other cloud environments through unsecured\
  \ ports. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive data, execute limited\
  \ administrative operations, modify system configurations, or disrupt services within the\
  \ impacted systems.\r\nNote: If the Primary Administration node is deployed in the cloud,\
  \ then Cisco ISE is affected by this vulnerability. If the Primary Administration node is\
  \ on-premises, then it is not affected."
