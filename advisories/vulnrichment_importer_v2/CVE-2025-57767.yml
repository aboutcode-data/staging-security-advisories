aliases: []
summary: Asterisk is an open source private branch exchange and telephony toolkit. Prior to
  versions 20.15.2, 21.10.2, and 22.5.2, if a SIP request is received with an Authorization
  header that contains a realm that wasn't in a previous 401 response's WWW-Authenticate header,
  or an Authorization header with an incorrect realm was received without a previous 401 response
  being sent, the get_authorization_header() function in res_pjsip_authenticator_digest will
  return a NULL. This wasn't being checked before attempting to get the digest algorithm from
  the header which causes a SEGV. This issue has been patched in versions 20.15.2, 21.10.2,
  and 22.5.2. There are no workarounds.
