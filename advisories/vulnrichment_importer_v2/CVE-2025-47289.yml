aliases: []
summary: CE Phoenix is a free, open-source eCommerce platform. A stored cross-site scripting
  (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in CE Phoenix versions 1.0.9.9 through 1.1.0.2 where an
  attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the testimonial description field. Once submitted,
  if the shop owner (admin) approves the testimonial, the script executes in the context of
  any user visiting the testimonial page. Because the session cookies are not marked with the
  `HttpOnly` flag, they can be exfiltrated by the attacker — potentially leading to account
  takeover. Version 1.1.0.3 fixes the issue.
