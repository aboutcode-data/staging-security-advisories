aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ASoC: Intel: sof_sdw_rt_sdca_jack_common: ctx->headset_codec_dev = NULL

  sof_sdw_rt_sdca_jack_exit() are used by different codecs, and some of
  them use the same dai name.
  For example, rt712 and rt713 both use "rt712-sdca-aif1" and
  sof_sdw_rt_sdca_jack_exit().
  As a result, sof_sdw_rt_sdca_jack_exit() will be called twice by
  mc_dailink_exit_loop(). Set ctx->headset_codec_dev = NULL; after
  put_device(ctx->headset_codec_dev); to avoid ctx->headset_codec_dev
  being put twice.
