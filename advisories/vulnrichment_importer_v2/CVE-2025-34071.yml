aliases: []
summary: A remote code execution vulnerability in GFI Kerio Control 9.4.5 allows attackers with
  administrative access to upload and execute arbitrary code through the firmware upgrade feature.
  The system upgrade mechanism accepts unsigned .img files, which can be modified to include
  malicious scripts within the upgrade.sh or disk image components. These modified upgrade images
  are not validated for authenticity or integrity, and are executed by the system post-upload,
  enabling root access.
