summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  powerpc: Avoid nmi_enter/nmi_exit in real mode interrupt.

  nmi_enter()/nmi_exit() touches per cpu variables which can lead to kernel
  crash when invoked during real mode interrupt handling (e.g. early HMI/MCE
  interrupt handler) if percpu allocation comes from vmalloc area.

  Early HMI/MCE handlers are called through DEFINE_INTERRUPT_HANDLER_NMI()
  wrapper which invokes nmi_enter/nmi_exit calls. We don't see any issue when
  percpu allocation is from the embedded first chunk. However with
  CONFIG_NEED_PER_CPU_PAGE_FIRST_CHUNK enabled there are chances where percpu
  allocation can come from the vmalloc area.

  With kernel command line "percpu_alloc=page" we can force percpu allocation
  to come from vmalloc area and can see kernel crash in machine_check_early:

  Fix this by avoiding use of nmi_enter()/nmi_exit() in real mode if percpu
  first chunk is not embedded.
