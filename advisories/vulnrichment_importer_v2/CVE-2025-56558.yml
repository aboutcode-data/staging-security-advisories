aliases: []
summary: 'The Dyson MQTT server (2022 and possibly later) allows publications and subscriptions
  by a client that has the correct values of AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SESSION_TOKEN,
  and device serial number, even if a device (such as a Pure Hot+Cool device) has been removed
  and is not visible in the supported MyDyson app. This could allow an unexpected actor to obtain
  control and set the room temperature (up to 37 Celsius) if ownership of the device is transferred
  without wiping the device. NOTE: the Supplier''s position is that this is a potential vulnerability
  that dates back 4 years ago in 2022 and "we are unable to replicate that anymore." Based on
  the submitted report, in order to leverage this issue, an attacker needs to own a Dyson device
  with full privileges, sniff for the AWS credentials, and then transfer ownership of that Dyson
  device to the victim. Even if these steps were successfully accomplished, the attacker only
  acquires the ability to configure the Dyson device within its safe operating range, and does
  not acquire the ability to execute code on the device or obtain sensitive information.'
