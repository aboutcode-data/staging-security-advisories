aliases: []
summary: SiYuan is self-hosted, open source personal knowledge management software. In versions
  3.5.1 and prior, the SiYuan Note application utilizes a hardcoded cryptographic secret for
  its session store. This unsafe practice renders the session encryption ineffective. Since
  the sensitive AccessAuthCode is stored within the session cookie, an attacker who intercepts
  or obtains a user's encrypted session cookie (e.g., via session hijacking) can locally decrypt
  it using the public key. Once decrypted, the attacker can retrieve the AccessAuthCode in plain
  text and use it to authenticate or take over the session.
