aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered on COROS PACE 3 devices through 3.0808.0. It implements a function
  to connect the watch to a WLAN. This function is mainly for downloading firmware files. Before
  downloading firmware files, the watch requests some information about the firmware via HTTPS
  from the back-end API. However, the X.509 server certificate within the TLS handshake is not
  validated by the device. This allows an attacker within an active machine-in-the-middle position,
  using a TLS proxy and a self-signed certificate, to eavesdrop and manipulate the HTTPS communication.
  This could be abused, for example, for stealing the API access token of the assigned user
  account.
