aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) for Nexus 9000 Series Fabric
  Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode could allow an unauthenticated,
  adjacent attacker to disable switching on a small form-factor pluggable (SFP) interface. This
  vulnerability is due to incomplete validation of the source of a received LLDP packet. An
  attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted LLDP packet on an SFP interface
  to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to disable switching
  on the SFP interface, which could disrupt network traffic.
