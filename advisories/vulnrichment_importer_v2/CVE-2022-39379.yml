aliases: []
summary: 'Fluentd collects events from various data sources and writes them to files, RDBMS,
  NoSQL, IaaS, SaaS, Hadoop and so on. A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in non-default
  configurations of Fluentd allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code via specially
  crafted JSON payloads. Fluentd setups are only affected if the environment variable `FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE`
  is explicitly set to `object`. Please note: The option FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE was introduced
  in Fluentd version 1.13.2. Earlier versions of Fluentd are not affected by this vulnerability.
  This issue was patched in version 1.15.3. As a workaround do not use `FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE=object`.'
