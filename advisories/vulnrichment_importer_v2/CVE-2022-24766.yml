aliases: []
summary: mitmproxy is an interactive, SSL/TLS-capable intercepting proxy. In mitmproxy 7.0.4
  and below, a malicious client or server is able to perform HTTP request smuggling attacks
  through mitmproxy. This means that a malicious client/server could smuggle a request/response
  through mitmproxy as part of another request/response's HTTP message body. While mitmproxy
  would only see one request, the target server would see multiple requests. A smuggled request
  is still captured as part of another request's body, but it does not appear in the request
  list and does not go through the usual mitmproxy event hooks, where users may have implemented
  custom access control checks or input sanitization. Unless mitmproxy is used to protect an
  HTTP/1 service, no action is required. The vulnerability has been fixed in mitmproxy 8.0.0
  and above. There are currently no known workarounds.
