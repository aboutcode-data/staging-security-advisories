aliases: []
summary: GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An OOB-read
  vulnerability has been discovered in gst_wavparse_adtl_chunk within gstwavparse.c. This vulnerability
  arises due to insufficient validation of the size parameter, which can exceed the bounds of
  the data buffer. As a result, an OOB read occurs in the following while loop. This vulnerability
  can result in reading up to 4GB of process memory or potentially causing a segmentation fault
  (SEGV) when accessing invalid memory. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.
