summary: WordPress Core is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in versions up to, and including,
  6.2, via the ‘wp_lang’ parameter. This allows unauthenticated attackers to access and load
  arbitrary translation files. In cases where an attacker is able to upload a crafted translation
  file onto the site, such as via an upload form, this could be also used to perform a Cross-Site
  Scripting attack.
