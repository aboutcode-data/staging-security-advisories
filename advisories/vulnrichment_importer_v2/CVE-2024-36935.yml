  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ice: ensure the copied buf is NUL terminated

  Currently, we allocate a count-sized kernel buffer and copy count bytes
  from userspace to that buffer. Later, we use sscanf on this buffer but we
  don't ensure that the string is terminated inside the buffer, this can lead
  to OOB read when using sscanf. Fix this issue by using memdup_user_nul
  instead of memdup_user.
