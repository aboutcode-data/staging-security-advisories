summary: 'Use After Free vulnerability in Arm Ltd Midgard GPU Kernel Driver, Arm Ltd Bifrost
  GPU Kernel Driver, Arm Ltd Valhall GPU Kernel Driver, Arm Ltd Arm 5th Gen GPU Architecture
  Kernel Driver allows a local non-privileged user to exploit a software race condition to perform
  improper memory processing operations. If the system’s memory is carefully prepared by the
  user and the system is under heavy load, then this in turn cause a use-after-free.This issue
  affects Midgard GPU Kernel Driver: from r13p0 through r32p0; Bifrost GPU Kernel Driver: from
  r1p0 through r18p0; Valhall GPU Kernel Driver: from r37p0 through r46p0; Arm 5th Gen GPU Architecture
  Kernel Driver: from r41p0 through r46p0.'
