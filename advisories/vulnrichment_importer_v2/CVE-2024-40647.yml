aliases: []
summary: 'sentry-sdk is the official Python SDK for Sentry.io. A bug in Sentry''s Python SDK
  < 2.8.0 allows the environment variables to be passed to subprocesses despite the `env={}`
  setting. In Python''s `subprocess` calls, all environment variables are passed to subprocesses
  by default. However, if you specifically do not want them to be passed to subprocesses, you
  may use `env` argument in `subprocess` calls. Due to the bug in Sentry SDK, with the Stdlib
  integration enabled (which is enabled by default), this expectation is not fulfilled, and
  all environment variables are being passed to subprocesses instead. The issue has been patched
  in pull request #3251 and is included in sentry-sdk==2.8.0. We strongly recommend upgrading
  to the latest SDK version. However, if it''s not possible, and if passing environment variables
  to child processes poses a security risk for you, you can disable all default integrations.'
