aliases: []
summary: Ladybug adds message-based debugging, unit, system, and regression testing to Java
  applications. Versions prior to 3.0-20251107.114628 contain the APIs /iaf/ladybug/api/report/{storage}
  and /iaf/ladybug/api/report/upload, which allow uploading gzip-compressed XML files with user-controllable
  content. The system deserializes these XML files, enabling attackers to achieve Remote Code
  Execution (RCE) by submitting carefully crafted XML payloads and thereby gain access to the
  target server. This issue is fixed in version 3.0-20251107.114628.
