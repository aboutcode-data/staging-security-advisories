aliases: []
summary: WeGIA is an open source web manager with a focus on the Portuguese language and charitable
  institutions. A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `Cadastro_Atendido.php`
  endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious
  scripts in the `cpf` parameter. The application fails to validate and sanitize user inputs
  in the `cpf` parameter. This lack of validation permits the injection of malicious payloads,
  which are reflected back to the user's browser in the server's response and executed within
  the context of the victim's browser. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.6 and all
  users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
