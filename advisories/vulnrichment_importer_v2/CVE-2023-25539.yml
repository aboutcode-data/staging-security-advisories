summary: Dell NetWorker 19.6.1.2, contains an OS command injection Vulnerability in the NetWorker
  client. A remote unauthenticated attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading
  to the execution of arbitrary OS commands on the application's underlying OS, with the privileges

  an attacker to take complete control of a system, so Dell recommends customers to upgrade
  at the earliest opportunity.
