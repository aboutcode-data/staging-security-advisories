aliases: []
summary: NocoDB is software for building databases as spreadsheets. Prior to version 0.301.0,
  a blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the `uploadViaURL` functionality
  due to an unprotected `HEAD` request. While the subsequent file retrieval logic correctly
  enforces SSRF protections, the initial metadata request executes without validation. This
  allows limited outbound requests to arbitrary URLs before SSRF controls are applied. Version
  0.301.0 contains a patch for the issue.
