aliases: []
summary: Roo Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent. The project-specific MCP configuration
  for the Roo Code agent is stored in the `.roo/mcp.json` file within the VS Code workspace.
  Because the MCP configuration format allows for execution of arbitrary commands, prior to
  version 3.20.3, it would have been possible for an attacker with access to craft a prompt
  to ask the agent to write a malicious command to the MCP configuration file. If the user had
  opted-in to auto-approving file writes within the project, this would have led to arbitrary
  command execution. This issue is of moderate severity, since it requires the attacker to already
  be able to submit prompts to the agent (for instance through a prompt injection attack), for
  the user to have MCP enabled (on by default), and for the user to have enabled auto-approved
  file writes (off by default). Version 3.20.3 fixes the issue by adding an additional layer
  of opt-in configuration for auto-approving writing to Roo's configuration files, including
  all files within the `.roo/` folder.
