aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine
  (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a stored cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attack against a user of the interface on an affected device. This vulnerability exists
  because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages
  of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script
  code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
