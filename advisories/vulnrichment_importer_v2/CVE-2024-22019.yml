aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Node.js HTTP servers allows an attacker to send a specially crafted
  HTTP request with chunked encoding, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service (DoS).
  The server reads an unbounded number of bytes from a single connection, exploiting the lack
  of limitations on chunk extension bytes. The issue can cause CPU and network bandwidth exhaustion,
  bypassing standard safeguards like timeouts and body size limits.
