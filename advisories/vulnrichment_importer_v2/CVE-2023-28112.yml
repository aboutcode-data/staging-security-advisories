aliases: []
summary: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.1.0.beta3 of the
  `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, some user provided URLs were being passed to FastImage
  without SSRF protection. Insufficient protections could enable attackers to trigger outbound
  network connections from the Discourse server to private IP addresses. This affects any site
  running the `tests-passed` or `beta` branches versions 3.1.0.beta2 and prior. This issue is
  patched in version 3.1.0.beta3 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. There are no known
  workarounds.
