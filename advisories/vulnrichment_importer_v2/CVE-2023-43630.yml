summary: "PCR14 is not in the list of PCRs that seal/unseal the “vault” key, but\ndue to the\
  \ change that was implemented in commit\n“7638364bc0acf8b5c481b5ce5fea11ad44ad7fd4”, fixing\
  \ this issue alone would not solve the\nproblem of the config partition not being measured\
  \ correctly.\n\nAlso, the “vault” key is sealed/unsealed with SHA1 PCRs instead of\nSHA256.\
  \ \nThis issue was somewhat mitigated due to all of the PCR extend functions\nupdating both\
  \ the values of SHA256 and SHA1 for a given PCR ID.\n\nHowever, due to the change that was\
  \ implemented in commit\n“7638364bc0acf8b5c481b5ce5fea11ad44ad7fd4”, this is no longer the\
  \ case for PCR14, as\nthe code in “measurefs.go” explicitly updates only the SHA256 instance\
  \ of PCR14, which\nmeans that even if PCR14 were to be added to the list of PCRs sealing/unsealing\
  \ the “vault”\nkey, changes to the config partition would still not be measured.\n\n\n\nAn\
  \ attacker could modify the config partition without triggering the measured boot, this could\n\
  result in the attacker gaining full control over the device with full access to the contents\
  \ of the\nencrypted “vault”"
