aliases: []
summary: 'Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host prior to 25.2.169 and
  Application prior to 25.2.1518 (VA and SaaS deployments) expose Docker internal networks in
  a way that allows an attacker on the same external L2 segment — or an attacker able to add
  routes using the appliance as a gateway — to reach container IPs directly. This grants access
  to internal services (HTTP APIs, Redis, MySQL, etc.) that are intended to be isolated inside
  the container network. Many of those services are accessible without authentication or are
  vulnerable to known exploitation chains. As a result, compromise of a single reachable endpoint
  or basic network access can enable lateral movement, remote code execution, data exfiltration,
  and full system compromise. This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2025-003
  — Insecure Access to Docker Instance from WAN.'
