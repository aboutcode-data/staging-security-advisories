aliases: []
summary: The ShareThis Share Buttons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the plugin's 'sharethis-inline-button' shortcode in all versions up to, and
  including, 2.3.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied
  attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access
  and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
  an injected page.
