aliases: []
summary: EspoCRM is an Open Source CRM (Customer Relationship Management) software. EspoCRM
  versions 9.1.6 and earlier are vulnerable to blind LDAP Injection when LDAP authentication
  is enabled. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can manipulate LDAP queries by injecting crafted
  input containing wildcard characters (e.g., *). This may allow the attacker to bypass authentication
  controls, enumerate valid usernames, or retrieve sensitive directory information depending
  on the LDAP server configuration. This was fixed in version 9.1.7.
