aliases: []
summary: Craft CMS is a content management system. In Craft versions 3.5.0 through 4.16.17 and
  5.0.0-RC1 through 5.8.21, the save_images_Asset GraphQL mutation can be abused to fetch internal
  URLs by providing a domain name that resolves to an internal IP address, bypassing hostname
  validation. When a non-image file extension such as .txt is allowed, downstream image validation
  is bypassed, which can allow an authenticated attacker with permission to use save_images_Asset
  to retrieve sensitive data such as AWS instance metadata credentials from the underlying host.
  This issue is patched in versions 4.16.18 and 5.8.22.
