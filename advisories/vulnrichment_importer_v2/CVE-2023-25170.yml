aliases: []
summary: PrestaShop is an open source e-commerce web application that, prior to version 8.0.1,
  is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF). When authenticating users, PrestaShop
  preserves session attributes. Because this does not clear CSRF tokens upon login, this might
  enable same-site attackers to bypass the CSRF protection mechanism by performing an attack
  similar to a session-fixation. The problem is fixed in version 8.0.1.
