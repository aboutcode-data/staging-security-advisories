summary: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in RLE NOVA's PlanManager. This vulnerability allows
  an attacker to execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser by injecting malicious payload
  through the ‘comment’ and ‘brand’ parameters in ‘/index.php’. The payload is stored by the
  application and subsequently displayed without proper sanitization when other users access
  it. This vulnerability can be exploited to steal sensitive user data, such as session cookies,
  or to perform actions on behalf of the user.
