aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the firewall component of HPE Aruba Networking CX 10000 Series Switches  exists.
  It could allow an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to conduct a packet  forwarding attack
  against the ICMP and UDP protocol. For this attack to be successful an attacker requires a
  switch configuration that allows packets routing (at layer 3). Configurations that do not
  allow network traffic routing are not impacted. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker
  to bypass security policies, potentially leading to unauthorized data exposure.
