aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Emergency Responder could allow an authenticated,
  remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based
  management interface. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of some parameters
  that are passed to the web server of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this
  vulnerability by persuading a user to access a malicious link or by intercepting a user request
  for the affected web interface and injecting malicious code into that request. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected
  web-based management interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
