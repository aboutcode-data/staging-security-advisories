aliases: []
summary: GLPI is a free asset and IT management software package. Starting in version 10.0.7
  and prior to version 10.0.10, an unverified object instantiation allows one to upload malicious
  PHP files to unwanted directories. Depending on web server configuration and available system
  libraries, malicious PHP files can then be executed through a web server request. Version
  10.0.10 fixes this issue. As a workaround, remove write access on `/ajax` and `/front` files
  to the web server.
