datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2021/1xxx/CVE-2021-1380.json
aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications
  Manager (Unified CM), Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM &amp; Presence Service (Unified
  CM IM&amp;P), Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified CM
  SME), and Cisco Unity Connection could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct
  a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against an interface user. These vulnerabilities exist
  because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input.
  An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading an interface user to click a
  crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code
  in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.
