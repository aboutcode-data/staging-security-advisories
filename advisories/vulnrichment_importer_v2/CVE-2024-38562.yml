  wifi: nl80211: Avoid address calculations via out of bounds array indexing

  Before request->channels[] can be used, request->n_channels must be set.
  Additionally, address calculations for memory after the "channels" array
  need to be calculated from the allocation base ("request") rather than
  via the first "out of bounds" index of "channels", otherwise run-time
  bounds checking will throw a warning.
