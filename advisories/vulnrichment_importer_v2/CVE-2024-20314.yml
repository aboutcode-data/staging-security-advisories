summary: "A vulnerability in the IPv4 Software-Defined Access (SD-Access) fabric edge node feature\
  \ of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause high CPU\
  \ utilization and stop all traffic processing, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition\
  \ on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper handling of certain IPv4\
  \ packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending certain IPv4 packets to\
