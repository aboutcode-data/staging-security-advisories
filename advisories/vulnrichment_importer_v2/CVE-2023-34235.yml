aliases: []
summary: Strapi is an open-source headless content management system. Prior to version 4.10.8,
  it is possible to leak private fields if one is using the `t(number)` prefix. Knex query allows
  users to change the default prefix. For example, if someone changes the prefix to be the same
  as it was before or to another table they want to query, the query changes from `password`
  to `t1.password`. `password` is protected by filtering protections but `t1.password` is not
  protected. This can lead to filtering attacks on everything related to the object again, including
  admin passwords and reset-tokens. Version 4.10.8 fixes this issue.
