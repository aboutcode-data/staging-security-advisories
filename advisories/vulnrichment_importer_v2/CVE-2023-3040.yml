summary: 'A debug function in the lua-resty-json package, up to commit id 3ef9492bd3a44d9e51301d6adc3cd1789c8f534a
  (merged in PR #14) contained an out of bounds access bug that could have allowed an attacker
  to launch a DoS if the function was used to parse untrusted input data. It is important to
  note that because this debug function was only used in tests and demos, it was not exploitable
  in a normal environment.'
