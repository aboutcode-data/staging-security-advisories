datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2025-20382
datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2025/20xxx/CVE-2025-20382.json
aliases: []
summary: In Splunk Enterprise versions below 10.0.2, 9.4.6, 9.3.8, and 9.2.10, and Splunk Cloud
  Platform versions below 10.1.2507.10, 10.0.2503.8, and 9.3.2411.120, a low-privileged user
  that does not hold the "admin" or "power" Splunk roles could create a views dashboard with
  a custom background using the `data:image/png;base64` protocol that could potentially lead
  to an unvalidated redirect. This behavior circumvents the Splunk external URL warning mechanism
  by using a specially crafted URL, allowing for a redirection to an external malicious site.
  The vulnerability requires the attacker to phish the victim by tricking them into initiating
  a request within their browser. The authenticated user should not be able to exploit the vulnerability
  at will.
