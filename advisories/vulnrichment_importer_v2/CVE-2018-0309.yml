aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the implementation of a specific CLI command and the associated
  Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) MIB for Cisco NX-OS (in standalone NX-OS mode) on
  Cisco Nexus 3000 and 9000 Series Switches could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to
  exhaust system memory on an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
  The vulnerability is due to the incorrect implementation of the CLI command, resulting in
  a failure to free all allocated memory upon completion. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by authenticating to the affected device and repeatedly issuing a specific CLI command or
  sending a specific SNMP poll request for a specific Object Identifier (OID). A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to cause the IP routing process to restart or to cause a
  device reset, resulting in a DoS condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf23136.'
