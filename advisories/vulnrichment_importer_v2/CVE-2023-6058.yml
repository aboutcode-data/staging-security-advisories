aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability has been identified in Bitdefender Safepay's handling of HTTPS connections.
  The issue arises when the product blocks a connection due to an untrusted server certificate
  but allows the user to add the site to exceptions, resulting in the product trusting the certificate
  for subsequent HTTPS scans. This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform a Man-in-the-Middle
  (MITM) attack by using a self-signed certificate, which the product will trust after the site
  has been added to exceptions. This can lead to the interception and potential alteration of
  secure communications.
