aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol service of Cisco FXOS Software and
  Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause the service
  to restart, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to
  improper handling of Cisco Discovery Protocol messages that are processed by the Cisco Discovery
  Protocol service. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of malicious
  Cisco Discovery Protocol messages to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to cause the Cisco Discovery Protocol service to fail and restart. In rare conditions,
  repeated failures of the process could occur, which could cause the entire device to restart.
