aliases: []
summary: LibreNMS is an auto-discovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP based network monitoring tool. In versions
  26.1.1 and below, the device group name is not sanitized, allowing attackers with admin privileges
  to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. When a user adds a device group, an
  HTTP POST request is sent to the Request-URI "/device-groups". The name of the newly created
  device group is stored in the value of the name parameter. After the device group is created,
  the entry is displayed along with relevant buttons such as Rediscover Devices, Edit, and Delete.
  This issue has been fixed in version 26.2.0.
