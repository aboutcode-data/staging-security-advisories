aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Cisco node-jose open source library before 0.11.0 could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to re-sign tokens using a key that is embedded within
  the token. The vulnerability is due to node-jose following the JSON Web Signature (JWS) standard
  for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). This standard specifies that a JSON Web Key (JWK) representing
  a public key can be embedded within the header of a JWS. This public key is then trusted for
  verification. An attacker could exploit this by forging valid JWS objects by removing the
  original signature, adding a new public key to the header, and then signing the object using
  the (attacker-owned) private key associated with the public key embedded in that JWS header.
