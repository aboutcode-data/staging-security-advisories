aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Vasion PrinterLogic Client for Windows before 25.0.0.836.
  During client installation and repair, a PrinterLogic binary is called by the installer to
  configure the device. This window is not hidden, and is running with elevated privileges.
  A standard user can break out of this window, obtaining a full SYSTEM command prompt window.
  This results in complete compromise via arbitrary SYSTEM code execution (elevation of privileges).
