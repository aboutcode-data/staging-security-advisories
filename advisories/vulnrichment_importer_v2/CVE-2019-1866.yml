aliases: []
summary: Cisco Webex Business Suite before 39.1.0 contains a vulnerability that could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to affect the integrity of the application. The vulnerability
  is due to improper validation of host header values. An attacker with a privileged network
  position, either a man-in-the-middle or by intercepting wireless network traffic, could exploit
  this vulnerability to manipulate header values sent by a client to the affected application.
  The attacker could cause the application to use input from the header to redirect a user from
  the Cisco Webex Meetings Online site to an arbitrary site of the attacker's choosing.
