aliases: []
summary: The `fetch()` API and navigation incorrectly shared the same cache, as the cache key
  did not include the optional headers `fetch()` may contain.  Under the correct circumstances,
  an attacker may have been able to poison the local browser cache by priming it with a `fetch()`
  response controlled by the additional headers. Upon navigation to the same URL, the user would
  see the cached response instead of the expected response. This vulnerability affects Firefox
  < 123.
