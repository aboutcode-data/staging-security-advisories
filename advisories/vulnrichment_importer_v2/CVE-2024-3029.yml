aliases: []
summary: In mintplex-labs/anything-llm, an attacker can exploit improper input validation by
  sending a malformed JSON payload to the '/system/enable-multi-user' endpoint. This triggers
  an error that is caught by a catch block, which in turn deletes all users and disables the
  'multi_user_mode'. The vulnerability allows an attacker to remove all existing users and potentially
  create a new admin user without requiring a password, leading to unauthorized access and control
  over the application.
