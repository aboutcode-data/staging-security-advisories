summary: OpenSTAManager is an open source management software for technical assistance and invoicing.
  OpenSTAManager v2.9.8 and earlier contain a critical Time-Based Blind SQL Injection vulnerability
  in the global search functionality. The application fails to properly sanitize the term parameter
  before using it in SQL LIKE clauses across multiple module-specific search handlers, allowing
  attackers to inject arbitrary SQL commands and extract sensitive data through time-based Boolean
  inference.
