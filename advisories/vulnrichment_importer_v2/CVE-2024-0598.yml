aliases: []
summary: The Gutenberg Blocks by Kadence Blocks – Page Builder Features plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the contact form message settings in all
  versions up to and including 3.2.17 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level access and above, to
  inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page. This primarily affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
  has been disabled.
