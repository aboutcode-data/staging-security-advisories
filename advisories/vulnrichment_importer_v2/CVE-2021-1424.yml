aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the ipsecmgr process of Cisco&nbsp;ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS)\
  \ could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\
  \nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of incoming Internet Key Exchange Version\
  \ 2 (IKEv2) packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specifically\
  \ malformed IKEv2 packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker\
  \ to cause the ipsecmgr process to restart, which would disrupt ongoing IKE negotiations and\
  \ result in a temporary DoS condition.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address\
  \ this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
