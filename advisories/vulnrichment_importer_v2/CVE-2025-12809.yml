summary: The Dokan Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due
  to a missing capability check on the `/dokan/v1/wholesale/register` REST API endpoint in all
  versions up to, and including, 4.1.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers

  ID, along with other information such as usernames, display names, user roles, and registration
  dates.
