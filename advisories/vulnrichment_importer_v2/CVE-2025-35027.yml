aliases: []
summary: Multiple robotic products by Unitree sharing a common firmware, including the Go2,
  G1, H1, and B2 devices, contain a command injection vulnerability. By setting a malicious
  string when configuring the on-board WiFi via a BLE module of an affected robot, then triggering
  a restart of the WiFi service, an attacker can ultimately trigger commands to be run as root
  via the wpa_supplicant_restart.sh shell script. All Unitree models use firmware derived from
  the same codebase (MIT Cheetah), and the two major forks are the G1 (humanoid) and Go2 (quadruped)
  branches.
