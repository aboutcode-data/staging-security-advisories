aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability exists in Quick Heal Total Security 23.0.0 in the quarantine management
  component where insufficient validation of restore paths and improper permission handling
  allow a low-privileged local user to restore quarantined files into protected system directories.
  This behavior can be abused by a local attacker to place files in high-privilege locations,
  potentially leading to privilege escalation.
