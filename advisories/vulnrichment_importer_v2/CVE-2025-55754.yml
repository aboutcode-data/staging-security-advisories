summary: "Improper Neutralization of Escape, Meta, or Control Sequences vulnerability in Apache\
  \ Tomcat.\n\nTomcat did not escape ANSI escape sequences in log messages. If Tomcat was running\
  \ in a console on a Windows operating system, and the console supported ANSI escape sequences,\
  \ it was possible for an attacker to use a specially crafted URL to inject ANSI escape sequences\
  \ to manipulate the console and the clipboard and attempt to trick an administrator into running\
  \ an attacker controlled command. While no attack vector was found, it may have been possible\
  \ to mount this attack on other operating systems.\n\n\n\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat:\
  \ from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.10, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.44, from 9.0.40 through 9.0.108.\n\
  \nThe following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are \nknown to be affected:\
  \ 8.5.60 though 8.5.100. Other, older, EOL versions may also be affected.\nUsers are recommended\
  \ to upgrade to version 11.0.11 or later, 10.1.45 or later or 9.0.109 or later, which fix\
  \ the issue."
