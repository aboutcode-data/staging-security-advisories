  platform/x86: toshiba_acpi: Fix array out-of-bounds access

  In order to use toshiba_dmi_quirks[] together with the standard DMI
  matching functions, it must be terminated by a empty entry.

  Since this entry is missing, an array out-of-bounds access occurs
  every time the quirk list is processed.

  Fix this by adding the terminating empty entry.
