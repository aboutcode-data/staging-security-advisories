summary: |
  Lodash versions 4.0.0 through 4.17.22 are vulnerable to prototype pollution in the _.unset and _.omit functions. An attacker can pass crafted paths which cause Lodash to delete methods from global prototypes.

  The issue permits deletion of properties but does not allow overwriting their original behavior.

  This issue is patched on 4.17.23
