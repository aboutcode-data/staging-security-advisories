aliases: []
summary: Flux is an open and extensible continuous delivery solution for Kubernetes. Path Traversal
  in the kustomize-controller via a malicious `kustomization.yaml` allows an attacker to expose
  sensitive data from the controller’s pod filesystem and possibly privilege escalation in multi-tenancy
  deployments. Workarounds include automated tooling in the user's CI/CD pipeline to validate
  `kustomization.yaml` files conform with specific policies. This vulnerability is fixed in
  kustomize-controller v0.24.0 and included in flux2 v0.29.0.
