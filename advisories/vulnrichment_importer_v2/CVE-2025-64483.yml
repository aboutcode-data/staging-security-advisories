summary: Wazuh is a security detection, visibility, and compliance open source project. From
  version 4.9.0 to before 4.13.0, the Wazuh API – Agent Configuration in certain configurations
  allows authenticated users with read-only API roles to retrieve agent enrollment credentials
  through the /utils/configuration endpoint. These credentials can be used to register new agents
  within the same Wazuh tenant without requiring elevated permissions through the UI. This issue
  has been patched in version 4.13.0.
