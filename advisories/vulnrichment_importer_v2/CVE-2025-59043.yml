aliases: []
summary: OpenBao is an open source identity-based secrets management system. In OpenBao versions
  prior to 2.4.1, JSON objects after decoding may use significantly more memory than their serialized
  version. It is possible to craft a JSON payload to maximize the factor between serialized
  memory usage and deserialized memory usage, similar to a zip bomb, with factors reaching approximately
  35. This can be used to circumvent the max_request_size configuration parameter which is intended
  to protect against denial of service attacks. The request body is parsed into a map very early
  in the request handling chain before authentication, which means an unauthenticated attacker
  can send a specifically crafted JSON object and cause an out-of-memory crash. Additionally,
  for requests with large numbers of strings, the audit subsystem can consume large quantities
  of CPU. The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.4.1.
