aliases: []
summary: This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary commands
  on affected installations of D-Link DIR-2150 4.0.1 routers. Authentication is not required
  to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the xupnpd_generic.lua plugin
  for the xupnpd service, which listens on TCP port 4044 by default. When parsing the feed parameter,
  the process does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to execute a
  system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of
  the service account. Was ZDI-CAN-15906.
