aliases: []
summary: The Events Manager – Calendar, Bookings, Tickets, and more! plugin for WordPress is
  vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'event', 'location', and 'event_category'
  shortcodes in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.7.3 due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
  that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
