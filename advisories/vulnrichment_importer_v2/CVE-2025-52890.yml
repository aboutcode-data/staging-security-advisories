aliases: []
summary: Incus is a system container and virtual machine manager. When using an ACL on a device
  connected to a bridge, Incus versions 6.12 and 6.13generates nftables rules that partially
  bypass security options `security.mac_filtering`, `security.ipv4_filtering` and `security.ipv6_filtering`.
  This can lead to ARP spoofing on the bridge and to fully spoof another VM/container on the
  same bridge. Commit 254dfd2483ab8de39b47c2258b7f1cf0759231c8 contains a patch for the issue.
