aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered on G-Net Dashcam BB GONX devices. Bypassing of Device Pairing
  can occur. It uses MAC address verification as the sole mechanism for recognizing paired devices,
  allowing attackers to bypass authentication. By capturing the MAC address of an already-paired
  device through ARP scanning or other means, an attacker can spoof the MAC address and connect
  to the dashcam without going through the pairing process. This enables full access to the
  device.
