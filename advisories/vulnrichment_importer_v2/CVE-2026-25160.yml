aliases: []
summary: Alist is a file list program that supports multiple storages, powered by Gin and Solidjs.
  Prior to version 3.57.0, the application disables TLS certificate verification by default
  for all outgoing storage driver communications, making the system vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
  (MitM) attacks. This enables the complete decryption, theft, and manipulation of all data
  transmitted during storage operations, severely compromising the confidentiality and integrity
  of user data. This issue has been patched in version 3.57.0.
