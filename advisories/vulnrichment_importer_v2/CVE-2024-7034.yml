aliases: []
summary: In open-webui version 0.3.8, the endpoint `/models/upload` is vulnerable to arbitrary
  file write due to improper handling of user-supplied filenames. The vulnerability arises from
  the usage of `file_path = f"{UPLOAD_DIR}/{file.filename}"` without proper input validation
  or sanitization. An attacker can exploit this by manipulating the `file.filename` parameter
  to include directory traversal sequences, causing the resulting `file_path` to escape the
  intended `UPLOAD_DIR` and potentially overwrite arbitrary files on the system. This can lead
  to unauthorized modifications of system binaries, configuration files, or sensitive data,
  potentially enabling remote command execution.
