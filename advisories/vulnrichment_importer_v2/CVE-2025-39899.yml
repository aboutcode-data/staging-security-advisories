  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mm/userfaultfd: fix kmap_local LIFO ordering for CONFIG_HIGHPTE

  With CONFIG_HIGHPTE on 32-bit ARM, move_pages_pte() maps PTE pages using
  kmap_local_page(), which requires unmapping in Last-In-First-Out order.

  The current code maps dst_pte first, then src_pte, but unmaps them in the
  same order (dst_pte, src_pte), violating the LIFO requirement.  This
  causes the warning in kunmap_local_indexed():

    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 604 at mm/highmem.c:622 kunmap_local_indexed+0x178/0x17c
    addr \!= __fix_to_virt(FIX_KMAP_BEGIN + idx)

  Fix this by reversing the unmap order to respect LIFO ordering.

  This issue follows the same pattern as similar fixes:
  - commit eca6828403b8 ("crypto: skcipher - fix mismatch between mapping and unmapping order")
  - commit 8cf57c6df818 ("nilfs2: eliminate staggered calls to kunmap in nilfs_rename")

  Both of which addressed the same fundamental requirement that kmap_local
  operations must follow LIFO ordering.
