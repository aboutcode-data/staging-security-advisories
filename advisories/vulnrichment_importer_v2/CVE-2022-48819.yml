summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntcp: take care\
  \ of mixed splice()/sendmsg(MSG_ZEROCOPY) case\n\nsyzbot found that mixing sendpage() and\
  \ sendmsg(MSG_ZEROCOPY)\ncalls over the same TCP socket would again trigger the\ninfamous\
  \ warning in inet_sock_destruct()\n\n\tWARN_ON(sk_forward_alloc_get(sk));\n\nWhile Talal took\
  \ into account a mix of regular copied data\nand MSG_ZEROCOPY one in the same skb, the sendpage()\
  \ path\nhas been forgotten.\n\nWe want the charging to happen for sendpage(), because\npages\
  \ could be coming from a pipe. What is missing is the\ndowngrading of pure zerocopy status\
  \ to make sure\nsk_forward_alloc will stay synced.\n\nAdd tcp_downgrade_zcopy_pure() helper\
  \ so that we can\nuse it from the two callers."
