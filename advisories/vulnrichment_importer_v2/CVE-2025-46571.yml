aliases: []
summary: Open WebUI is a self-hosted artificial intelligence platform designed to operate entirely
  offline. Prior to version 0.6.6, low privileged users can upload HTML files which contain
  JavaScript code via the `/api/v1/files/` backend endpoint. This endpoint returns a file id,
  which can be used to open the file in the browser and trigger the JavaScript code in the user's
  browser. Under the default settings, files uploaded by low-privileged users can only be viewed
  by admins or themselves, limiting the impact of this vulnerability. A link to such a file
  can be sent to an admin, and if clicked, will give the low-privileged user complete control
  over the admin's account, ultimately enabling RCE via functions. Version 0.6.6 contains a
  fix for the issue.
