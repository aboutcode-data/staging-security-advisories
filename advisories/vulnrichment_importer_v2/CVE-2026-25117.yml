summary: pwn.college DOJO is an education platform for learning cybersecurity. Prior to commit
  e33da14449a5abcff507e554f66e2141d6683b0a, missing sandboxing on `/workspace/*` routes allows
  challenge authors to inject arbitrary javascript which runs on the same origin as `http[:]//dojo[.]website`.
  This is a sandbox escape leading to arbitrary javascript execution as the dojo's origin. A
  challenge author can craft a page that executes any dangerous actions that the user could.
  Version e33da14449a5abcff507e554f66e2141d6683b0a patches the issue.
