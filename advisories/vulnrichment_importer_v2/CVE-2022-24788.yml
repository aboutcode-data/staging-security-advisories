aliases: []
summary: Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual machine. Versions
  of vyper prior to 0.3.2 suffer from a potential buffer overrun. Importing a function from
  a JSON interface which returns `bytes` generates bytecode which does not clamp bytes length,
  potentially resulting in a buffer overrun. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
  workarounds for this issue.
