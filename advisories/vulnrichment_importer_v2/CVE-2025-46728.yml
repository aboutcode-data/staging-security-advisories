aliases: []
summary: 'cpp-httplib is a C++ header-only HTTP/HTTPS server and client library. Prior to version
  0.20.1, the library fails to enforce configured size limits on incoming request bodies when
  `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` is used or when no `Content-Length` header is provided. A remote
  attacker can send a chunked request without the terminating zero-length chunk, causing uncontrolled
  memory allocation on the server. This leads to potential exhaustion of system memory and results
  in a server crash or unresponsiveness. Version 0.20.1 fixes the issue by enforcing limits
  during parsing. If the limit is exceeded at any point during reading, the connection is terminated
  immediately. A short-term workaround through a Reverse Proxy is available. If updating the
  library immediately is not feasible, deploy a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) in front
  of the `cpp-httplib` application. Configure the proxy to enforce maximum request body size
  limits, thereby stopping excessively large requests before they reach the vulnerable library
  code.'
