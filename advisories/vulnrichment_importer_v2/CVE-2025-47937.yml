aliases: []
summary: TYPO3 is an open source, PHP based web content management system. Starting in version
  9.0.0 and prior to versions 9.5.51 ELTS, 10.4.50 ELTS, 11.5.44 ELTS, 12.4.31 LTS, and 13.4.12
  LTS, when performing a database query involving multiple tables through the database abstraction
  layer (DBAL), frontend user permissions are only applied via `FrontendGroupRestriction` to
  the first table. As a result, data from additional tables included in the same query may be
  unintentionally exposed to unauthorized users. Users should update to TYPO3 version 9.5.51
  ELTS, 10.4.50 ELTS, 11.5.44 ELTS, 12.4.31 LTS, or 13.4.12 LTS to fix the problem.
