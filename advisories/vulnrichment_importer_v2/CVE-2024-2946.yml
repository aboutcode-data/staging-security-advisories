summary: The ShopLentor – WooCommerce Builder for Elementor & Gutenberg +12 Modules – All in
  One Solution (formerly WooLentor) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the plugin's QR Code Widget in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.4 due

  it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject
  arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
