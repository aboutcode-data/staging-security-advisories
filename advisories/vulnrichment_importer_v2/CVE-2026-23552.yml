summary: |
  Cross-Realm Token Acceptance Bypass in KeycloakSecurityPolicy Apache Camel Keycloak component. 

  The Camel-Keycloak KeycloakSecurityPolicy does not validate the iss (issuer) claim of JWT tokens against the configured realm. A token issued by one Keycloak realm is silently accepted by a policy configured for a completely different realm, breaking tenant isolation.
  This issue affects Apache Camel: from 4.15.0 before 4.18.0.

  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.18.0, which fixes the issue.
