  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  netfilter: bridge: replace physindev with physinif in nf_bridge_info

  An skb can be added to a neigh->arp_queue while waiting for an arp
  reply. Where original skb's skb->dev can be different to neigh's
  neigh->dev. For instance in case of bridging dnated skb from one veth to
  another, the skb would be added to a neigh->arp_queue of the bridge.

  As skb->dev can be reset back to nf_bridge->physindev and used, and as
  there is no explicit mechanism that prevents this physindev from been
  freed under us (for instance neigh_flush_dev doesn't cleanup skbs from
  different device's neigh queue) we can crash on e.g. this stack:

  arp_process
    neigh_update
      skb = __skb_dequeue(&neigh->arp_queue)
        neigh_resolve_output(..., skb)
          ...
            br_nf_dev_xmit
              br_nf_pre_routing_finish_bridge_slow
                skb->dev = nf_bridge->physindev
                br_handle_frame_finish

  Let's use plain ifindex instead of net_device link. To peek into the
  original net_device we will use dev_get_by_index_rcu(). Thus either we
  get device and are safe to use it or we don't get it and drop skb.
