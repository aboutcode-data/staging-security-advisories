aliases: []
summary: An unauthenticated attacker can inject OS commands when calling a server API endpoint
  in NesterSoft WorkTime. The server API call to generate and download the WorkTime client from
  the WorkTime server is vulnerable in the “guid” parameter. This allows an attacker to execute
  arbitrary commands on the WorkTime server as NT Authority\SYSTEM with the highest privileges.
  Attackers are able to access or manipulate sensitive data and take over the whole server.
