aliases: []
summary: Bareos is open source software for backup, archiving, and recovery of data for operating
  systems. When Bareos Director >= 18.2 >= 18.2 but prior to 21.1.0, 20.0.6, and 19.2.12 is
  built and configured for PAM authentication, it will skip authorization checks completely.
  Expired accounts and accounts with expired passwords can still login. This problem will affect
  users that have PAM enabled. Currently there is no authorization (e.g. check for expired or
  disabled accounts), but only plain authentication (i.e. check if username and password match).
  Bareos Director versions 21.1.0, 20.0.6 and 19.2.12 implement the authorization check that
  was previously missing. The only workaround is to make sure that authentication fails if the
  user is not authorized.
