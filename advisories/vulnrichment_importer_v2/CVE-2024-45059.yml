aliases: []
summary: i-Educar is free, fully online school management software that can be used by school
  secretaries, teachers, coordinators, and area managers. A SQL Injection vulnerability was
  found prior to the 2.9 branch in the `ieducar/intranet/funcionario_vinculo_det.php` file,
  which creates the query by concatenating the unsanitized GET parameter `cod_func`, allowing
  the attacker to obtain sensitive information such as emails and password hashes. Commit 7824b95745fa2da6476b9901041d9c854bf52ffe
  fixes the issue.
