aliases: []
summary: MailEnable versions prior to 10.54 contain a cleartext storage of credentials vulnerability
  that can lead to local credential compromise and account takeover. The product stores user
  and administrative passwords in plaintext within AUTH.TAB with overly permissive filesystem
  access. A local authenticated user with read access to this file can recover all user passwords
  and super-admin credentials, then use them to authenticate to MailEnable services such as
  POP3, SMTP, or the webmail interface, enabling unauthorized mailbox access and administrative
  control.
