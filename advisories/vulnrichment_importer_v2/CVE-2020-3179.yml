aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnel decapsulation feature
  of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due
  to a memory handling error when GRE over IPv6 traffic is processed. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by sending crafted GRE over IPv6 packets with either IPv4 or IPv6 payload
  through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device
  to crash, resulting in a DoS condition.
