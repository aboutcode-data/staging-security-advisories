summary: An issue was discovered in ownCloud owncloud/core before 10.13.1. An attacker can access,
  modify, or delete any file without authentication if the username of a victim is known, and
  the victim has no signing-key configured. This occurs because pre-signed URLs can be accepted
  even when no signing-key is configured for the owner of the files. The earliest affected version
  is 10.6.0.
