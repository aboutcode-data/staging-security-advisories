aliases: []
summary: The LatePoint – Calendar Booking Plugin for Appointments and Events plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘service[name]’ parameter in all versions
  up to, and including, 5.1.94 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This
  makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject
  arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
  This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been
  disabled.
