  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  rtnetlink: Correct nested IFLA_VF_VLAN_LIST attribute validation

  Each attribute inside a nested IFLA_VF_VLAN_LIST is assumed to be a
  struct ifla_vf_vlan_info so the size of such attribute needs to be at least
  of sizeof(struct ifla_vf_vlan_info) which is 14 bytes.
  The current size validation in do_setvfinfo is against NLA_HDRLEN (4 bytes)
  which is less than sizeof(struct ifla_vf_vlan_info) so this validation
  is not enough and a too small attribute might be cast to a
  struct ifla_vf_vlan_info, this might result in an out of bands
  read access when accessing the saved (casted) entry in ivvl.
