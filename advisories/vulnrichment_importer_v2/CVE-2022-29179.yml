summary: Cilium is open source software for providing and securing network connectivity and
  loadbalancing between application workloads. Prior to versions 1.9.16, 1.10.11, and 1.11.15,
  if an attacker is able to perform a container escape of a container running as root on a host
  where Cilium is installed, the attacker can escalate privileges to cluster admin by using
  Cilium's Kubernetes service account. The problem has been fixed and the patch is available
  in versions 1.9.16, 1.10.11, and 1.11.5. There are no known workarounds available.
