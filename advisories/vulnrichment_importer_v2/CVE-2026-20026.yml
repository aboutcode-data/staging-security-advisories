aliases: []
summary: "Multiple&nbsp;Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the processing of\
  \ DCE/RPC requests that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the Snort\
  \ 3 Detection Engine to leak sensitive information or to restart, resulting in an interruption\
  \ of packet inspection.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to an error in buffer handling logic\
  \ when processing DCE/RPC requests, which can result in a buffer use-after-free read. An attacker\
  \ could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of DCE/RPC requests through an\
  \ established connection that is inspected by Snort 3. A successful exploit could allow the\
  \ attacker to unexpectedly restart the Snort 3 Detection Engine, which could cause a denial\
  \ of service (DoS)."
