summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Secure Firewall Management\
  \ Center (FMC) Software, formerly Firepower Management Center Software, could allow an authenticated,\
  \ remote attacker to perform an SQL injection attack against an affected device. To exploit\
  \ this vulnerability, an attacker must have a valid account on the device with the role of\
  \ Security Approver, Intrusion Admin, Access Admin, or Network Admin.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability\
  \ is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this\
  \ vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web-based management interface of\
  \ an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read the contents of\
  \ databases on the affected device and also obtain limited read access to the underlying operating\
  \ system."
