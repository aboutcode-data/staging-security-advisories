aliases: []
summary: GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An OOB-read
  vulnerability has been identified in the gst_avi_subtitle_parse_gab2_chunk function within
  gstavisubtitle.c. The function reads the name_length value directly from the input file without
  checking it properly. Then, the a condition, does not properly handle cases where name_length
  is greater than 0xFFFFFFFF - 17, causing an integer overflow. In such scenario, the function
  attempts to access memory beyond the buffer leading to an OOB-read. This vulnerability is
  fixed in 1.24.10.
