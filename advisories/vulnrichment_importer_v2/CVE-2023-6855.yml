summary: The Paid Memberships Pro – Content Restriction, User Registration, & Paid Subscriptions
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of membership levels created
  by the plugin due to an incorrectly implemented capability check in the pmpro_rest_api_get_permissions_check
  function in all versions up to 2.12.5 (inclusive). This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to change membership levels including prices.
