aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server of Cisco Meraki MX and Cisco Meraki\
  \ Z Series Teleworker Gateway devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to hijack\
  \ an AnyConnect VPN session or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition for individual users\
  \ of the AnyConnect VPN service on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to\
  \ weak entropy for handlers that are used during the VPN authentication process as well as\
  \ a race condition that exists in the same process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by correctly guessing an authentication handler and then sending crafted HTTPS requests\
  \ to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to take over the AnyConnect\
  \ VPN session from a target user or prevent the target user from establishing an AnyConnect\
  \ VPN session with the affected device."
