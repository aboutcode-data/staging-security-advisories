aliases: []
summary: The CNI portmap plugin allows containers to emulate opening a host port, forwarding
  that traffic to the container. Versions 1.6.0 through 1.8.0  inadvertently forward all traffic
  with the same destination port as the host port when the portmap plugin is configured with
  the nftables backend, thus ignoring the destination IP. This includes traffic not intended
  for the node itself, i.e. traffic to containers hosted on the node. Containers that request
  HostPort forwarding can intercept all traffic destined for that port. This requires that the
  portmap plugin be explicitly configured to use the nftables backend. This issue is fixed in
  version 1.9.0. To workaround, configure the portmap plugin to use the iptables backend. It
  does not have this vulnerability.
