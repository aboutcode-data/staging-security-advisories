aliases: []
summary: "dotCMS versions 24.03.22 and after, identified a Boolean-based blind SQLi vulnerability\
  \ in the /api/v1/contenttype endpoint. This endpoint uses the sites query parameter, which\
  \ accepts a comma-separated list of site identifiers or keys.\n\nThe vulnerability was triggered\
  \ via the sites parameter, which was directly concatenated into a SQL query without proper\
  \ sanitization. \n\nExploitation allowed an authenticated attacker with low privileges to\
  \ extract data from database, perform privilege escalation, or trigger denial-of-service conditions.\
  \ \n\nThe vulnerability was verified using tools such as SQLMap and confirmed to allow full\
  \ database exfiltration and potential denial-of-service conditions via crafted payloads.\n\
  \nThe vulnerability is fixed in the following versions of dotCMS stack: 25.08.14 / 25.07.10-1v2\
  \ LTS / 24.12.27v10 LTS / 24.04.24v21 LTS"
