aliases: []
summary: Cosign is a project under the sigstore organization which aims to make signatures invisible
  infrastructure. In versions prior to 1.12.0 a number of vulnerabilities have been found in
  cosign verify-blob, where Cosign would successfully verify an artifact when verification should
  have failed. First a cosign bundle can be crafted to successfully verify a blob even if the
  embedded rekorBundle does not reference the given signature. Second, when providing identity
  flags, the email and issuer of a certificate is not checked when verifying a Rekor bundle,
  and the GitHub Actions identity is never checked. Third, providing an invalid Rekor bundle
  without the experimental flag results in a successful verification. And fourth an invalid
  transparency log entry will result in immediate success for verification. Details and examples
  of these issues can be seen in the GHSA-8gw7-4j42-w388 advisory linked. Users are advised
  to upgrade to 1.12.0. There are no known workarounds for these issues.
