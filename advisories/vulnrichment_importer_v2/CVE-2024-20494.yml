aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the TLS cryptography functionality of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance\
  \ (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated,\
  \ remote attacker to cause the device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service\
  \ (DoS) condition.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper data validation during the\
  \ TLS 1.3 handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted TLS\
  \ 1.3 packet to an affected system through a TLS 1.3-enabled listening socket. A successful\
  \ exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\
  \n\r Note: This vulnerability can also impact the integrity of a device by causing VPN HostScan\
  \ communication failures or file transfer failures when Cisco ASA Software is upgraded using\
  \ Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM)."
