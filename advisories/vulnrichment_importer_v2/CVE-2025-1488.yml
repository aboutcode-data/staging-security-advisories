aliases: []
summary: The WPO365 | MICROSOFT 365 GRAPH MAILER plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Open
  Redirect in all versions up to, and including, 3.2. This is due to insufficient validation
  on the redirect url supplied via the 'redirect_to' parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to redirect users to potentially malicious sites if 1. they can successfully trick
  them into performing an action and 2. the plugin is activated but not configured.
