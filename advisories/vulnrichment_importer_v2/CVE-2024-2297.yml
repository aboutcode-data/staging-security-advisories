aliases: []
summary: 'The Bricks theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions
  up to, and including, 1.9.6.1. This is due to insufficient validation checks placed on the
  create_autosave AJAX function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
  access and above, to execute arbitrary PHP code with elevated (administrator-level) privileges.
  NOTE: Successful exploitation requires (1) the Bricks Builder to be enabled for posts (2)
  Builder access to be enabled for contributor-level users, and (3) "Code Execution" to be enabled
  for administrator-level users within the theme''s settings.'
