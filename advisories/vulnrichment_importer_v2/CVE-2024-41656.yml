aliases: []
summary: Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform. Starting in version
  10.0.0 and prior to version 24.7.1, an unsanitized payload sent by an Integration platform
  integration allows storing arbitrary HTML tags on the Sentry side with the subsequent rendering
  them on the Issues page. Self-hosted Sentry users may be impacted in case of untrustworthy
  Integration platform integrations sending external issues from their side to Sentry. A patch
  has been released in Sentry 24.7.1. For Sentry SaaS customers, no action is needed. This has
  been patched on July 23, and even prior to the fix, the exploitation was not possible due
  to the strict Content Security Policy deployed on sentry.io site. For self-hosted users, the
  maintainers of Sentry strongly recommend upgrading Sentry to the latest version. If it is
  not possible, one could enable CSP on one's self-hosted installation with `CSP_REPORT_ONLY
  = False` (enforcing mode). This will mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting.
