aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the IPv6 protocol handling of the management interfaces of Cisco
  IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause an IPv6 flood on
  the management interface network of an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the
  software incorrectly forwards IPv6 packets that have an IPv6 node-local multicast group address
  destination and are received on the management interfaces. An attacker could exploit this
  vulnerability by connecting to the same network as the management interfaces and injecting
  IPv6 packets that have an IPv6 node-local multicast group address destination. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to cause an IPv6 flood on the corresponding network. Depending
  on the number of Cisco IOS XR Software nodes on that network segment, exploitation could cause
  excessive network traffic, resulting in network degradation or a denial of service (DoS) condition.
