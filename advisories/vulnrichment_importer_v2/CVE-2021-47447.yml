aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/msm/a3xx: fix error handling in a3xx_gpu_init()

  These error paths returned 1 on failure, instead of a negative error
  code.  This would lead to an Oops in the caller.  A second problem is
  that the check for "if (ret != -ENODATA)" did not work because "ret" was
  set to 1.
