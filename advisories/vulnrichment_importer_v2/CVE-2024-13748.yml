aliases: []
summary: The Ultimate Classified Listings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the Title parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.4 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute
  whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and
  installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
