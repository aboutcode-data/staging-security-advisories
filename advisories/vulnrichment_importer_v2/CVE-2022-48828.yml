  NFSD: Fix ia_size underflow

  iattr::ia_size is a loff_t, which is a signed 64-bit type. NFSv3 and
  NFSv4 both define file size as an unsigned 64-bit type. Thus there
  is a range of valid file size values an NFS client can send that is
  already larger than Linux can handle.

  Currently decode_fattr4() dumps a full u64 value into ia_size. If
  that value happens to be larger than S64_MAX, then ia_size
  underflows. I'm about to fix up the NFSv3 behavior as well, so let's
  catch the underflow in the common code path: nfsd_setattr().
