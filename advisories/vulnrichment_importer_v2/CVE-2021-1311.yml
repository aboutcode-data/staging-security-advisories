aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the reclaim host role feature of Cisco Webex Meetings and Cisco
  Webex Meetings Server could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to take over the host
  role during a meeting. This vulnerability is due to a lack of protection against brute forcing
  of the host key. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests
  to a vulnerable Cisco Webex Meetings or Webex Meetings Server site. A successful exploit would
  require the attacker to have access to join a Webex meeting, including applicable meeting
  join links and passwords. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to acquire or take
  over the host role for a meeting.
