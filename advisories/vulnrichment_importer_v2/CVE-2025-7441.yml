summary: The StoryChief plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads in all
  versions up to, and including, 1.0.42. This vulnerability occurs through the /wp-json/storychief/webhook

  for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which
  may make remote code execution possible.
