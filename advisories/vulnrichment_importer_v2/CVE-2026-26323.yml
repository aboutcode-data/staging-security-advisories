aliases: []
summary: 'OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Versions 2026.1.8 through 2026.2.13 have a command
  injection in the maintainer/dev script `scripts/update-clawtributors.ts`. The issue affects
  contributors/maintainers (or CI) who run `bun scripts/update-clawtributors.ts` in a source
  checkout that contains a malicious commit author email (e.g. crafted `@users[.]noreply[.]github[.]com`
  values). Normal CLI usage is not affected (`npm i -g openclaw`): this script is not part of
  the shipped CLI and is not executed during routine operation. The script derived a GitHub
  login from `git log` author metadata and interpolated it into a shell command (via `execSync`).
  A malicious commit record could inject shell metacharacters and execute arbitrary commands
  when the script is run. Version 2026.2.14 contains a patch.'
