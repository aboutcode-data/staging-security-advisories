  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  udp: do not accept non-tunnel GSO skbs landing in a tunnel

  When rx-udp-gro-forwarding is enabled UDP packets might be GROed when
  being forwarded. If such packets might land in a tunnel this can cause
  various issues and udp_gro_receive makes sure this isn't the case by
  looking for a matching socket. This is performed in
  udp4/6_gro_lookup_skb but only in the current netns. This is an issue
  with tunneled packets when the endpoint is in another netns. In such
  cases the packets will be GROed at the UDP level, which leads to various
  issues later on. The same thing can happen with rx-gro-list.

  We saw this with geneve packets being GROed at the UDP level. In such
  case gso_size is set; later the packet goes through the geneve rx path,
  the geneve header is pulled, the offset are adjusted and frag_list skbs
  are not adjusted with regard to geneve. When those skbs hit
  skb_fragment, it will misbehave. Different outcomes are possible
  depending on what the GROed skbs look like; from corrupted packets to
  kernel crashes.

  One example is a BUG_ON[1] triggered in skb_segment while processing the
  frag_list. Because gso_size is wrong (geneve header was pulled)
  skb_segment thinks there is "geneve header size" of data in frag_list,
  although it's in fact the next packet. The BUG_ON itself has nothing to
  do with the issue. This is only one of the potential issues.

  Looking up for a matching socket in udp_gro_receive is fragile: the
  lookup could be extended to all netns (not speaking about performances)
  but nothing prevents those packets from being modified in between and we
  could still not find a matching socket. It's OK to keep the current
  logic there as it should cover most cases but we also need to make sure
  we handle tunnel packets being GROed too early.

  This is done by extending the checks in udp_unexpected_gso: GSO packets
  lacking the SKB_GSO_UDP_TUNNEL/_CSUM bits and landing in a tunnel must
  be segmented.
