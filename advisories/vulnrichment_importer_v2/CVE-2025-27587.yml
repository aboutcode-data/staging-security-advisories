aliases: []
summary: 'OpenSSL 3.0.0 through 3.3.2 on the PowerPC architecture is vulnerable to a Minerva
  attack, exploitable by measuring the time of signing of random messages using the EVP_DigestSign
  API, and then using the private key to extract the K value (nonce) from the signatures. Next,
  based on the bit size of the extracted nonce, one can compare the signing time of full-sized
  nonces to signatures that used smaller nonces, via statistical tests. There is a side-channel
  in the P-364 curve that allows private key extraction (also, there is a dependency between
  the bit size of K and the size of the side channel). NOTE: This CVE is disputed because the
  OpenSSL security policy explicitly notes that any side channels which require same physical
  system to be detected are outside of the threat model for the software. The timing signal
  is so small that it is infeasible to be detected without having the attacking process running
  on the same physical system.'
