aliases: []
summary: RustCrypto/RSA is a portable RSA implementation in pure Rust. Due to a non-constant-time
  implementation, information about the private key is leaked through timing information which
  is observable over the network. An attacker may be able to use that information to recover
  the key. There is currently no fix available. As a workaround, avoid using the RSA crate in
  settings where attackers are able to observe timing information, e.g. local use on a non-compromised
  computer.
