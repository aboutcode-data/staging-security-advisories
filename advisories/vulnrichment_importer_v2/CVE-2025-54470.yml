summary: "This vulnerability affects NeuVector deployments only when the Report anonymous cluster\
  \ data option is enabled. When this option is enabled, NeuVector sends anonymous telemetry\
  \ data to the telemetry server.\n\n\nIn affected versions, NeuVector does not enforce TLS\
  \ \ncertificate verification when transmitting anonymous cluster data to the\n telemetry server.\
  \ As a result, the communication channel is susceptible\n to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks,\
  \ where an attacker could intercept \nor modify the transmitted data. Additionally, NeuVector\
  \ loads the \nresponse of the telemetry server is loaded into memory without size \nlimitation,\
  \ which makes  it vulnerable to a Denial of Service(DoS) \nattack"
