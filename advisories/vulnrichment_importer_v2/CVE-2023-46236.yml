summary: FOG is a free open-source cloning/imaging/rescue suite/inventory management system.
  Prior to version 1.5.10, a server-side-request-forgery (SSRF) vulnerability allowed an unauthenticated
  user to trigger a GET request as the server to an arbitrary endpoint and URL scheme. This
  also allows remote access to files visible to the Apache user group. Other impacts vary based
  on server configuration. Version 1.5.10 contains a patch.
