aliases: []
summary: Locutus brings stdlibs of other programming languages to JavaScript for educational
  purposes. In versions from 2.0.12 to before 2.0.39, a prototype pollution vulnerability exists
  in locutus. Despite a previous fix that attempted to mitigate prototype pollution by checking
  whether user input contained a forbidden key, it is still possible to pollute Object.prototype
  via a crafted input using String.prototype. This issue has been patched in version 2.0.39.
