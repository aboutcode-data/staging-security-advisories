aliases: []
summary: |
  In spring AMQP versions 1.0.0 to
  2.4.16 and 3.0.0 to 3.0.9 , allowed list patterns for deserializable class
  names were added to Spring AMQP, allowing users to lock down deserialization of
  data in messages from untrusted sources; however by default, when no allowed
  list was provided, all classes could be deserialized.



  Specifically, an application is
  vulnerable if




     *  the
       SimpleMessageConverter or SerializerMessageConverter is used

     *  the user
       does not configure allowed list patterns

     *  untrusted
       message originators gain permissions to write messages to the RabbitMQ
       broker to send malicious content
