aliases: []
summary: "Versions of the package snyk before 1.1297.3 are vulnerable to Insertion of Sensitive\
  \ Information into Log File through local Snyk CLI debug logs. Container Registry credentials\
  \ provided via environment variables or command line arguments can be exposed when executing\
  \ Snyk CLI in DEBUG or DEBUG/TRACE mode.\r\rThe issue affects the following Snyk commands:\r\
  \r1. When snyk container test or snyk container monitor commands are run against a container\
  \ registry, with debug mode enabled, the container registry credentials may be written into\
  \ the local Snyk CLI debug log. This only happens with credentials specified in environment\
  \ variables (SNYK_REGISTRY_USERNAME and SNYK_REGISTRY_PASSWORD), or in the CLI (--password/-p\
  \ and  --username/-u).\r\r2. When snyk auth command is executed with debug mode enabled AND\
  \ the log level is set to TRACE, the Snyk access / refresh credential tokens used to connect\
  \ the CLI to Snyk may be written into the local CLI debug logs.\r\r3. When snyk iac test is\
  \ executed with a Remote IAC Custom rules bundle, debug mode enabled, AND the log level is\
  \ set to TRACE, the docker registry token may be written into the local CLI debug logs."
