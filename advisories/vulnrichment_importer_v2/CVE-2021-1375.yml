aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the fast reload feature of Cisco IOS XE Software running
  on Cisco Catalyst 3850, Cisco Catalyst 9300, and Cisco Catalyst 9300L Series Switches could
  allow an authenticated, local attacker to either execute arbitrary code on the underlying
  operating system, install and boot a malicious software image, or execute unsigned binaries
  on an affected device. These vulnerabilities are due to improper checks performed by system
  boot routines. To exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker would need privileged access
  to the CLI of the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to either execute
  arbitrary code on the underlying operating system or execute unsigned code and bypass the
  image verification check part of the secure boot process. For more information about these
  vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.
