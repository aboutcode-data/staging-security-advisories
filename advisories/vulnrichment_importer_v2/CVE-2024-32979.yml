aliases: []
summary: Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform built as a web
  application atop the Django Python framework with a PostgreSQL or MySQL database. It was discovered
  that due to improper handling and escaping of user-provided query parameters, a maliciously
  crafted Nautobot URL could potentially be used to execute a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  (Reflected XSS) attack against users. All filterable object-list views in Nautobot are vulnerable.
  This issue has been fixed in Nautobot versions 1.6.20 and 2.2.3. There are no known workarounds
  for this vulnerability.
