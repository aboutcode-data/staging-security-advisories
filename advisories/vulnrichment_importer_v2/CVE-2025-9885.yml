summary: The MPWizard – Create Mercado Pago Payment Links plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.1. This is due to
  missing or incorrect nonce validation in the '/includes/admin/class-mpwizard-table.php' file.

  request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
  on a link.
