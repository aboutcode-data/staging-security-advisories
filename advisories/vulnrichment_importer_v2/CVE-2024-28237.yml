aliases: []
summary: OctoPrint provides a web interface for controlling consumer 3D printers. OctoPrint
  versions up until and including 1.9.3 contain a vulnerability that allows malicious admins
  to configure or talk a victim with administrator rights into configuring a webcam snapshot
  URL which when tested through the "Test" button included in the web interface will execute
  JavaScript code in the victims browser when attempting to render the snapshot image. An attacker
  who successfully talked a victim with admin rights into performing a snapshot test with such
  a crafted URL could use this to retrieve or modify sensitive configuration settings, interrupt
  prints or otherwise interact with the OctoPrint instance in a malicious way. The vulnerability
  is patched in version 1.10.0rc3. OctoPrint administrators are strongly advised to thoroughly
  vet who has admin access to their installation and what settings they modify based on instructions
  by strangers.
