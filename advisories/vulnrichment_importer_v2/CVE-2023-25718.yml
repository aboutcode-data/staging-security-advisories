aliases: []
summary: In ConnectWise Control through 22.9.10032 (formerly known as ScreenConnect), after
  an executable file is signed, additional instructions can be added without invalidating the
  signature, such as instructions that result in offering the end user a (different) attacker-controlled
  executable file. It is plausible that the end user may allow the download and execution of
  this file to proceed. There are ConnectWise Control configuration options that add mitigations.
