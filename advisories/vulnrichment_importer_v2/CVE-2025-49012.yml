aliases: []
summary: Himmelblau is an interoperability suite for Microsoft Azure Entra ID and Intune. Himmelblau
  versions 0.9.0 through 0.9.14 and 1.00-alpha are vulnerable to a privilege escalation issue
  when Entra ID group-based access restrictions are configured using group display names instead
  of object IDs. Starting in version 0.9.0, Himmelblau introduced support for specifying group
  names in the `pam_allow_groups` configuration option. However, Microsoft Entra ID permits
  the creation of multiple groups with the same `displayName` via the Microsoft Graph API—even
  by non-admin users, depending on tenant settings. As a result, a user could create a personal
  group with the same name as a legitimate access group (e.g., `"Allow-Linux-Login"`), add themselves
  to it, and be granted authentication or `sudo` rights by Himmelblau. Because affected Himmelblau
  versions compare group names by either `displayName` or by the immutable `objectId`, this
  allows bypassing access control mechanisms intended to restrict login to members of official,
  centrally-managed groups. This issue is fixed in Himmelblau version **0.9.15** and later.
  In these versions, group name matching in `pam_allow_groups` has been deprecated and removed,
  and only group `objectId`s (GUIDs) may be specified for secure group-based filtering. To mitigate
  the issue without upgrading, replace all entries in `pam_allow_groups` with the objectId of
  the target Entra ID group(s) and/or audit your tenant for groups with duplicate display names
  using the Microsoft Graph API.
