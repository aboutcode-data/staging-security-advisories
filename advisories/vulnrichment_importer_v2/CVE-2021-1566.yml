aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Cisco Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) for Endpoints integration
  of Cisco AsyncOS for Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) and Cisco Web Security Appliance
  (WSA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to intercept traffic between an affected
  device and the AMP servers. This vulnerability is due to improper certificate validation when
  an affected device establishes TLS connections. A man-in-the-middle attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by sending a crafted TLS packet to an affected device. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to spoof a trusted host and then extract sensitive information or
  alter certain API requests.
