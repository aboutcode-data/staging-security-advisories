aliases: []
summary: The session hijacking attack targets the application layer's control mechanism, which
  manages authenticated sessions between a host PC and a PLC. During such sessions, a session
  key is utilized to maintain security. However, if an attacker captures this session key, they
  can inject traffic into an ongoing authenticated session. To successfully achieve this, the
  attacker also needs to spoof both the IP address and MAC address of the originating host which
  is typical of a session-based attack.
