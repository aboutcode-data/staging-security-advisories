aliases: []
summary: OpenEXR provides the specification and reference implementation of the EXR file format,
  an image storage format for the motion picture industry. In versions 3.2.0 through 3.2.4,
  3.3.0 through 3.3.5, and 3.4.0 through 3.4.2, a memory safety bug in the legacy OpenEXR Python
  adapter (the deprecated OpenEXR.InputFile wrapper) allow crashes and likely code execution
  when opening attacker-controlled EXR files or when passing crafted Python objects. Integer
  overflow and unchecked allocation in InputFile.channel() and InputFile.channels() can lead
  to heap overflow (32 bit) or a NULL deref (64 bit). Versions 3.2.5, 3.3.6, and 3.4.3 contain
  a patch for the issue.
