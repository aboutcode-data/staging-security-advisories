summary: 'The GitKraken Desktop 10.8.0 and 11.1.0 is susceptible to code injection due to misconfigured
  Electron Fuses. Specifically, the following insecure settings were observed: RunAsNode is
  enabled and EnableNodeCliInspectArguments is not disabled. These configurations allow the

  in arbitrary code execution.'
