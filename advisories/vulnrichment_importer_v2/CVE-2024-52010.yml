aliases: []
summary: Zoraxy is a general purpose HTTP reverse proxy and forwarding tool. A command injection
  vulnerability in the Web SSH feature allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary
  commands as root on the host. Zoraxy has a Web SSH terminal feature that allows authenticated
  users to connect to SSH servers from their browsers. In HandleCreateProxySession the request
  to create an SSH session is handled. An attacker can exploit the username variable to escape
  from the bash command and inject arbitrary commands into sshCommand. This is possible, because,
  unlike hostname and port, the username is not validated or sanitized.
