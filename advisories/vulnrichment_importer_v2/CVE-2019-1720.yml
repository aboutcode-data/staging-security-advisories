aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the XML API of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video
  Communication Server (VCS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause the CPU
  to increase to 100% utilization, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected
  system. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of the XML input. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by sending a specifically crafted XML payload. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to exhaust CPU resources, resulting in a DoS condition until the
  system is manually rebooted. Software versions prior to X12.5.1 are affected.
