summary: 'Nagios XI < 2024R1.3.2 contains a remote code execution vulnerability by chaining
  two flaws: an arbitrary file upload and a path traversal in the Core Config Snapshots interface.
  The issue arises from insufficient validation of file paths and extensions during MIB upload
  and snapshot rename operations. Exploitation results in the placement of attacker-controlled
  PHP files in a web-accessible directory, executed as the www-data user.'
