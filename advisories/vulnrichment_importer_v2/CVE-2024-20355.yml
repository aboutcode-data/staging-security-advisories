aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the implementation of SAML 2.0 single sign-on (SSO) for remote access
  VPN services in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat
  Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to successfully establish
  a VPN session on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper separation of authorization
  domains when using SAML authentication. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using
  valid credentials to successfully authenticate using their designated connection profile (tunnel
  group), intercepting the SAML SSO token that is sent back from the Cisco ASA device, and then
  submitting the same SAML SSO token to a different tunnel group for authentication. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to establish a remote access VPN session using a connection
  profile that they are not authorized to use and connect to secured networks behind the affected
  device that they are not authorized to access. For successful exploitation, the attacker must
  have valid remote access VPN user credentials.
