aliases: []
summary: Vim is an open source, command line text editor. Prior to version 9.1.2132, a heap
  buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Vim's tag file resolution logic when processing the
  'helpfile' option. The vulnerability is located in the get_tagfname() function in src/tag.c.
  When processing help file tags, Vim copies the user-controlled 'helpfile' option value into
  a fixed-size heap buffer of MAXPATHL + 1 bytes (typically 4097 bytes) using an unsafe STRCPY()
  operation without any bounds checking. This issue has been patched in version 9.1.2132.
