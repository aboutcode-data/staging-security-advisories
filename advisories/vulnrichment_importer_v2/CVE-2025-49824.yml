datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2025-49824
datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2025/49xxx/CVE-2025-49824.json
aliases: []
summary: conda-smithy is a tool for combining a conda recipe with configurations to build using
  freely hosted CI services into a single repository. Prior to version 3.47.1, the travis_encrypt_binstar_token
  implementation in the conda-smithy package has been identified as vulnerable to an Oracle
  Padding Attack. This vulnerability results from the use of an outdated and insecure padding
  scheme during RSA encryption. A malicious actor with access to an oracle system can exploit
  this flaw by iteratively submitting modified ciphertexts and analyzing responses to infer
  the plaintext without possessing the private key. This issue has been patched in version 3.47.1.
