aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the detection engine of Cisco Firepower System Software could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured file action policy to drop the
  Server Message Block (SMB) protocol if a malware file is detected. The vulnerability is due
  to how the SMB protocol handles a case in which a large file transfer fails. This case occurs
  when some pieces of the file are successfully transferred to the remote endpoint, but ultimately
  the file transfer fails and is reset. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
  a crafted SMB file transfer request through the targeted device. An exploit could allow the
  attacker to pass an SMB file that contains malware, which the device is configured to block.
  This vulnerability affects Cisco Firepower System Software when one or more file action policies
  are configured, on software releases prior to 6.2.3. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc20141.'
