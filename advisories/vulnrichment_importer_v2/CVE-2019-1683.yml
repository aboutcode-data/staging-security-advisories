aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the certificate handling component of the Cisco SPA112, SPA525,
  and SPA5X5 Series IP Phones could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to listen to or
  control some aspects of a Transport Level Security (TLS)-encrypted Session Initiation Protocol
  (SIP) conversation. The vulnerability is due to the improper validation of server certificates.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious server certificate to
  present to the client. An exploit could allow an attacker to eavesdrop on TLS-encrypted traffic
  and potentially route or redirect calls initiated by an affected device. Affected software
  include version 7.6.2 of the Cisco Small Business SPA525 Series IP Phones and Cisco Small
  Business SPA5X5 Series IP Phones and version 1.4.2 of the Cisco Small Business SPA500 Series
  IP Phones and Cisco Small Business SPA112 Series IP Phones.
