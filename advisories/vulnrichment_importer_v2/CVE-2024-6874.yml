summary: |
  libcurl's URL API function
  [curl_url_get()](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/curl_url_get.html) offers punycode
  conversions, to and from IDN. Asking to convert a name that is exactly 256
  bytes, libcurl ends up reading outside of a stack based buffer when built to
  use the *macidn* IDN backend. The conversion function then fills up the
  provided buffer exactly - but does not null terminate the string.

  This flaw can lead to stack contents accidently getting returned as part of
  the converted string.
