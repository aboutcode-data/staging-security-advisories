aliases: []
summary: Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host versions prior to 25.1.102
  and Application versions prior to 25.1.1413 (macOS/Linux client deployments) are vulnerable
  to an authentication bypass in PrinterInstallerClientService. The service requires root privileges
  for certain administrative operations, but these checks rely on calls to geteuid(). By preloading
  a malicious shared object overriding geteuid(), a local attacker can trick the service into
  believing it is running with root privileges. This bypass enables execution of administrative
  commands (e.g., enabling debug mode, managing configurations, or invoking privileged features)
  without proper authorization. While some actions requiring write access to protected files
  may still fail, the flaw effectively breaks the intended security model of the inter-process
  communication (IPC) system, allowing local attackers to escalate privileges and compromise
  system integrity. This vulnerability has been confirmed to be remediated, but it is unclear
  as to when the patch was introduced.
