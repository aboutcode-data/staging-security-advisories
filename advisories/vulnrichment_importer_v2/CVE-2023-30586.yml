aliases: []
summary: A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in Node.js 20 that allowed loading arbitrary
  OpenSSL engines when the experimental permission model is enabled, which can bypass and/or
  disable the permission model. The attack complexity is high. However, the crypto.setEngine()
  API can be used to bypass the permission model when called with a compatible OpenSSL engine.
  The OpenSSL engine can, for example, disable the permission model in the host process by manipulating
  the process's stack memory to locate the permission model Permission::enabled_ in the host
  process's heap memory. Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model
  is an experimental feature of Node.js.
