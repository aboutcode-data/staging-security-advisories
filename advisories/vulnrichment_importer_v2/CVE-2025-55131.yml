aliases: []
summary: A flaw in Node.js's buffer allocation logic can expose uninitialized memory when allocations
  are interrupted, when using the `vm` module with the timeout option. Under specific timing
  conditions, buffers allocated with `Buffer.alloc` and other `TypedArray` instances like `Uint8Array`
  may contain leftover data from previous operations, allowing in-process secrets like tokens
  or passwords to leak or causing data corruption. While exploitation typically requires precise
  timing or in-process code execution, it can become remotely exploitable when untrusted input
  influences workload and timeouts, leading to potential confidentiality and integrity impact.
