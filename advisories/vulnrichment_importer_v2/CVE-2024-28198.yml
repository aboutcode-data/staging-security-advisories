aliases: []
summary: OpenOlat is an open source web-based e-learning platform for teaching, learning, assessment
  and communication. By manually manipulating http requests when using the draw.io integration
  it is possible to read arbitrary files as the configured system user and SSRF. The problem
  is fixed in version 18.1.6 and 18.2.2. It is advised to upgrade to the latest version of 18.1.x
  or 18.2.x. Users unable to upgrade may work around this issue by disabling the Draw.io module
  or the entire REST API which will secure the system.
