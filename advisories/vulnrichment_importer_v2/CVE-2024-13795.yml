aliases: []
summary: The Ecwid by Lightspeed Ecommerce Shopping Cart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 6.12.27. This is due to
  missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ecwid_deactivate_feedback() function. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send deactivation messages on behalf of a site
  owner via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
  action such as clicking on a link.
