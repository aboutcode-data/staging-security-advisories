  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  char: xillybus: Check USB endpoints when probing device

  Ensure, as the driver probes the device, that all endpoints that the
  driver may attempt to access exist and are of the correct type.

  All XillyUSB devices must have a Bulk IN and Bulk OUT endpoint at
  address 1. This is verified in xillyusb_setup_base_eps().

  On top of that, a XillyUSB device may have additional Bulk OUT
  endpoints. The information about these endpoints' addresses is deduced
  from a data structure (the IDT) that the driver fetches from the device
  while probing it. These endpoints are checked in setup_channels().

  A XillyUSB device never has more than one IN endpoint, as all data
  towards the host is multiplexed in this single Bulk IN endpoint. This is
  why setup_channels() only checks OUT endpoints.
