summary: An executable used in Rockwell Automation ThinManager ThinServer can be configured
  to enable an API feature in the HTTPS Server Settings. This feature is disabled by default.
  When the API is enabled and handling requests, a path traversal vulnerability exists that

  that contains manipulating variables.
