aliases: []
summary: Fickling is a Python pickling decompiler and static analyzer. Fickling versions up
  to and including 0.1.6 do not treat Python's cProfile module as unsafe. Because of this, a
  malicious pickle that uses cProfile.run() is classified as SUSPICIOUS instead of OVERTLY_MALICIOUS.
  If a user relies on Fickling's output to decide whether a pickle is safe to deserialize, this
  misclassification can lead them to execute attacker-controlled code on their system. This
  affects any workflow or product that uses Fickling as a security gate for pickle deserialization.
  This issue has been patched in version 0.1.7.
