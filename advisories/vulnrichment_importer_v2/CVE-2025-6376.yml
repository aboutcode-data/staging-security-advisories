aliases: []
summary: |
  A remote
  code execution security issue exists in the Rockwell Automation Arena®.  A crafted DOE
  file can force Arena Simulation to write beyond the boundaries of an allocated
  object. Exploitation
  requires user interaction, such as opening a malicious file within the software.
  If exploited, a threat actor could execute arbitrary code on the target system.
  The software must run under the context of the administrator in order to cause
  worse case impact. This is reflected in the Rockwell CVSS score, as AT:P.
