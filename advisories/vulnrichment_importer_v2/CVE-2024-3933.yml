aliases: []
summary: In Eclipse OpenJ9 release versions prior to 0.44.0 and after 0.13.0, when running with
  JVM option -Xgc:concurrentScavenge, the sequence generated for System.arrayCopy on the IBM
  Z platform with hardware and software support for guarded storage [1], could allow access
  to a buffer with an incorrect length value when executing an arraycopy sequence while the
  Concurrent Scavenge Garbage Collection cycle is active and the source and destination memory
  regions for arraycopy overlap. This allows read and write to addresses beyond the end of the
  array range.
