summary: 'A vulnerability in the implementation of RSA-encrypted nonces in Cisco IOS Software
  and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to obtain the encrypted
  nonces of an Internet Key Exchange Version 1 (IKEv1) session. The vulnerability exists because
  the affected software responds incorrectly to decryption failures. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability sending crafted ciphertexts to a device configured with IKEv1 that uses
  RSA-encrypted nonces. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain the encrypted
  nonces. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve77140.'
