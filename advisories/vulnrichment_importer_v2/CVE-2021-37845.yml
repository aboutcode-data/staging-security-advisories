aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Citadel through webcit-932. A meddler-in-the-middle attacker
  can fixate their own session during the cleartext phase before a STARTTLS command (a violation
  of "The STARTTLS command is only valid in non-authenticated state." in RFC2595). This potentially
  allows an attacker to cause a victim's e-mail messages to be stored into an attacker's IMAP
  mailbox, but depends on details of the victim's client behavior.
