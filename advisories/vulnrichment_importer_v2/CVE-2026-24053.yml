aliases: []
summary: Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. Prior to version 2.0.74, due to a Bash command
  validation flaw in parsing ZSH clobber syntax, it was possible to bypass directory restrictions
  and write files outside the current working directory without user permission prompts. Exploiting
  this required the user to use ZSH and the ability to add untrusted content into a Claude Code
  context window. This issue has been patched in version 2.0.74.
