aliases: []
summary: An incorrect setting of UXN bits within mmu_flags_to_s1_pte_attr lead to privileged
  executable pages being mapped as executable from an unprivileged context. This can be leveraged
  by an attacker to bypass executability restrictions of kernel-mode pages from user-mode. An
  incorrect setting of PXN bits within mmu_flags_to_s1_pte_attr lead to unprivileged executable
  pages being mapped as executable from a privileged context. This can be leveraged by an attacker
  to bypass executability restrictions of user-mode pages from kernel-mode. Typically this allows
  a potential attacker to circumvent a mitigation, making exploitation of potential kernel-mode
  vulnerabilities easier. We recommend updating kernel beyond commit 7d731b4e9599088ac3073956933559da7bca6a00
  and rebuilding.
