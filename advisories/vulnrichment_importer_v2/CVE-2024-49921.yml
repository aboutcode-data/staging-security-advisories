  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/amd/display: Check null pointers before used

  [WHAT & HOW]
  Poniters, such as dc->clk_mgr, are null checked previously in the same
  function, so Coverity warns "implies that "dc->clk_mgr" might be null".
  As a result, these pointers need to be checked when used again.

  This fixes 10 FORWARD_NULL issues reported by Coverity.
