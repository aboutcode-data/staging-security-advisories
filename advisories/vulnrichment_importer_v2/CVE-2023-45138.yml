summary: Change Request is an pplication allowing users to request changes on a wiki without
  publishing the changes directly. Starting in version 0.11 and prior to version 1.9.2, it's
  possible for a user without any specific right to perform script injection and remote code
  execution just by inserting an appropriate title when creating a new Change Request. This
  vulnerability is particularly critical as Change Request aims at being created by user without
  any particular rights. The vulnerability has been fixed in Change Request 1.9.2. It's possible
  to workaround the issue without upgrading by editing the document `ChangeRequest.Code.ChangeRequestSheet`
  and by performing the same change as in the fix commit.
