summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Data Center Network
  Manager (DCNM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative credentials
  to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface. The vulnerability
  is due to insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious data into a specific data field in
  the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code
  in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To
  exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need administrative credentials on the affected
  device.
