aliases: []
summary: "An arbitrary file deletion vulnerability exists in PaperCut NG/MF, specifically affecting\
  \ Windows servers with Web Print enabled. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must\
  \ first obtain local login access to the Windows Server hosting PaperCut NG/MF and be capable\
  \ of executing low-privilege code directly on the server. \n\nImportant: In most installations,\
  \ this risk is mitigated by the default Windows Server configuration, which typically restricts\
  \ local login access to Administrators only. However, this vulnerability could pose a risk\
  \ to customers who allow non-administrative users to log in to the local console of the Windows\
  \ environment hosting the PaperCut NG/MF application server.\n\nNote: This CVE has been split\
  \ into two separate CVEs (CVE-2024-3037 and CVE-2024-8404) and it’s been rescored with a \"\
  Privileges Required (PR)\" rating of low, and “Attack Complexity (AC)” rating of low, reflecting\
  \ the worst-case scenario where an Administrator has granted local login access to standard\
  \ users on the host server."
