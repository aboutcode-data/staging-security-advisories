aliases: []
summary: An Improper Access Control vulnerability allows an attacker to access the control panel
  of the B420 without requiring any sort of authorization or authentication due to the IP based
  authorization. If an authorized user has accessed a publicly available B420 product using
  valid credentials, an insider attacker can gain access to the same panel without requiring
  any sort of authorization. The B420 module was already obsolete at the time this vulnerability
  was found (The End of Life announcement was made in 2013).
