aliases: []
summary: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under
  the Apache license. Affected versions of the 3.x beta branch are subject to a Use-After-Free
  issue in the `avc420_ensure_buffer` and `avc444_ensure_buffer` functions. If the value of
  `piDstSize[x]` is 0, `ppYUVDstData[x]` will be freed. However, in this case `ppYUVDstData[x]`
  will not have been updated which leads to a Use-After-Free vulnerability. This issue has been
  addressed in version 3.0.0-beta3. Users of the 3.x beta releases are advised to upgrade. There
  are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
