  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  netfilter: nf_tables: unconditionally flush pending work before notifier

  syzbot reports:

  KASAN: slab-uaf in nft_ctx_update include/net/netfilter/nf_tables.h:1831
  KASAN: slab-uaf in nft_commit_release net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c:9530

   nf_tables_trans_destroy_work+0x152b/0x1750 net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c:9597

  Problem is that the notifier does a conditional flush, but its possible
  that the table-to-be-removed is still referenced by transactions being
  processed by the worker, so we need to flush unconditionally.

  We could make the flush_work depend on whether we found a table to delete
  in nf-next to avoid the flush for most cases.

  AFAICS this problem is only exposed in nf-next, with
  commit e169285f8c56 ("netfilter: nf_tables: do not store nft_ctx in transaction objects"),
  with this commit applied there is an unconditional fetch of
  table->family which is whats triggering the above splat.
