  \ Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker\
  \ to access sensitive configuration information. The attacker would require low privilege\
  \ credentials on an affected device.\r\nThis vulnerability exists because of improper encryption\
  \ of sensitive information stored within the GUI configuration manager. An attacker could\
  \ exploit this vulnerability by logging into the GUI of Cisco FMC Software and navigating\
  \ to certain sensitive configurations. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view\
  \ sensitive configuration parameters in clear text.Cisco has released software updates that\
  \ address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.[[Publication_URL{Layout()}]]This\
