aliases: []
summary: This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations
  of Bentley MicroStation CONNECT 10.16.02.034. User interaction is required to exploit this
  vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The
  specific flaw exists within the parsing of OBJ files. The issue results from the lack of proper
  validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based
  buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the
  current process. Was ZDI-CAN-16172.
