  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  io_uring/kbuf: hold io_buffer_list reference over mmap

  If we look up the kbuf, ensure that it doesn't get unregistered until
  after we're done with it. Since we're inside mmap, we cannot safely use
  the io_uring lock. Rely on the fact that we can lookup the buffer list
  under RCU now and grab a reference to it, preventing it from being
  unregistered until we're done with it. The lookup returns the
  io_buffer_list directly with it referenced.
