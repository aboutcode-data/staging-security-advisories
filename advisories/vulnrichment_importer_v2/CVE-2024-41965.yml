aliases: []
summary: Vim is an open source command line text editor. double-free in dialog_changed() in
  Vim < v9.1.0648. When abandoning a buffer, Vim may ask the user what to do with the modified
  buffer. If the user wants the changed buffer to be saved, Vim may create a new Untitled file,
  if the buffer did not have a name yet. However, when setting the buffer name to Unnamed, Vim
  will falsely free a pointer twice, leading to a double-free and possibly later to a heap-use-after-free,
  which can lead to a crash. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0648.
