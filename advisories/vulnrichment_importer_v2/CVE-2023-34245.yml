aliases: []
summary: '@udecode/plate-link is the link handler for the udecode/plate rich-text editor plugin
  system for Slate & React. Affected versions of the link plugin and link UI component do not
  sanitize URLs to prevent use of the `javascript:` scheme. As a result, links with JavaScript
  URLs can be inserted into the Plate editor through various means, including opening or pasting
  malicious content. `@udecode/plate-link` 20.0.0 resolves this issue by introducing an `allowedSchemes`
  option to the link plugin, defaulting to `[''http'', ''https'', ''mailto'', ''tel'']`. URLs
  using a scheme that isn''t in this list will not be rendered to the DOM. Users are advised
  to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade are advised to override the `LinkElement` and `PlateFloatingLink`
  components with implementations that explicitly check the URL scheme before rendering any
  anchor elements.'
