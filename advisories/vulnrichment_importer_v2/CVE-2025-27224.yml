aliases: []
summary: TRUfusion Enterprise through 7.10.4.0 uses the /trufusionPortal/fileupload endpoint
  to upload files. However, the application doesn't properly sanitize the input to this endpoint,
  ultimately allowing path traversal sequences to be included. This can be used to write to
  any filename with any file type at any location on the local server, ultimately allowing execution
  of arbitrary code.
