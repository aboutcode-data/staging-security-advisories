aliases: []
summary: CryptPad is a collaboration suite. Prior to version 2025.3.0, the "Link Bouncer" functionality
  attempts to filter javascript URIs to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), however this can
  be bypassed. There is an "early allow" code path that happens before the URI's protocol/scheme
  is checked, which a maliciously crafted URI can follow. This issue has been patched in version
  2025.3.0.
