summary: |
  Certain instructions need intercepting and emulating by Xen.  In some
  cases Xen emulates the instruction by replaying it, using an executable
  stub.  Some instructions may raise an exception, which is supposed to be
  handled gracefully.  Certain replayed instructions have additional logic
  to set up and recover the changes to the arithmetic flags.

  For replayed instructions where the flags recovery logic is used, the
  metadata for exception handling was incorrect, preventing Xen from
  handling the the exception gracefully, treating it as fatal instead.
