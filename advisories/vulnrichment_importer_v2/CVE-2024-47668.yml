aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  lib/generic-radix-tree.c: Fix rare race in __genradix_ptr_alloc()

  If we need to increase the tree depth, allocate a new node, and then
  race with another thread that increased the tree depth before us, we'll
  still have a preallocated node that might be used later.

  If we then use that node for a new non-root node, it'll still have a
  pointer to the old root instead of being zeroed - fix this by zeroing it
  in the cmpxchg failure path.
