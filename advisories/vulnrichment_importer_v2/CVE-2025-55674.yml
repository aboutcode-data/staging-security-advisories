datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2025-55674
datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2025/55xxx/CVE-2025-55674.json
aliases: []
summary: |
  A bypass of the DISALLOWED_SQL_FUNCTIONS security feature in Apache Superset allows for the execution of blocked SQL functions. An attacker can use a special inline block to circumvent the denylist. This allows a user with SQL Lab access to execute functions that were intended to be disabled, leading to the disclosure of sensitive database information like the software version.

  This issue affects Apache Superset: before 5.0.0.

  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 5.0.0, which fixes the issue.
