aliases: []
summary: This vulnerability was a potential CSRF attack. When running the Firebase emulator
  suite, there is an export endpoint that is used normally to export data from running emulators.
  If a user was running the emulator and navigated to a malicious website with the exploit on
  a browser that allowed calls to localhost (ie Chrome before v94), the website could exfiltrate
  emulator data. We recommend upgrading past version 13.6.0 or commit  068a2b08dc308c7ab4b569617f5fc8821237e3a0
