aliases: []
summary: The MStore API WordPress plugin before 3.9.8 does not sanitise and escape a parameter
  before using it in a SQL statement, leading to a Blind SQL injection exploitable by unauthenticated
  users. This is only exploitable if the site owner elected to pay to get access to the plugins'
  pro features, and uses the woocommerce-appointments plugin.
