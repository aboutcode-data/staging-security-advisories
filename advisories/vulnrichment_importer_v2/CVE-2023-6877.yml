summary: The RSS Aggregator by Feedzy – Feed to Post, Autoblogging, News & YouTube Video Feeds
  Aggregator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's
  shortcode(s) in all versions up to, and including, 4.3.3 due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping on the Content-Type field of error messages when retrieving an invalid
  RSS feed. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access
  and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
  an injected page.
