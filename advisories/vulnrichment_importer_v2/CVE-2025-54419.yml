aliases: []
summary: A SAML library not dependent on any frameworks that runs in Node. In version 5.0.1,
  Node-SAML loads the assertion from the (unsigned) original response document. This is different
  than the parts that are verified when checking signature. This allows an attacker to modify
  authentication details within a valid SAML assertion. For example, in one attack it is possible
  to remove any character from the SAML assertion username. To conduct the attack an attacker
  would need a validly signed document from the identity provider (IdP). This is fixed in version
  5.1.0.
