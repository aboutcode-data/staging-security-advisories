aliases: []
summary: Parse Server is an open source http web server backend. In versions prior to 4.10.7
  there is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Parse Server. This vulnerability affects
  Parse Server in the default configuration with MongoDB. The main weakness that leads to RCE
  is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file `DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely
  to affect Postgres and any other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed
  on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. The only
  known workaround is to manually patch your installation with code referenced at the source
  GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm.
