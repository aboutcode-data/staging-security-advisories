aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the TLS handler of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software
  and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software for Cisco Firepower 1000 Series firewalls
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information. The
  vulnerability is due to improper implementation of countermeasures against the Bleichenbacher
  attack for cipher suites that rely on RSA for key exchange. An attacker could exploit this
  vulnerability by sending crafted TLS messages to the device, which would act as an oracle
  and allow the attacker to carry out a chosen-ciphertext attack. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to perform cryptanalytic operations that may allow decryption of previously
  captured TLS sessions to the affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must
  be able to perform both of the following actions: Capture TLS traffic that is in transit between
  clients and the affected device Actively establish a considerable number of TLS connections
  to the affected device'
