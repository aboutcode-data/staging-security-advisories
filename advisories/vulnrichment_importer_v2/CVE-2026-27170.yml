aliases: []
summary: OpenSift is an AI study tool that sifts through large datasets using semantic search
  and generative AI. In versions 1.1.2-alpha and below, URL ingest allows overly permissive
  server-side fetch behavior and can be coerced into requesting unsafe targets. Potential access/probing
  of private/local network resources from the OpenSift host process when ingesting attacker-controlled
  URLs. This issue has been fixed in version 1.1.3-alpha. To workaround when using trusted local-only
  exceptions, use OPENSIFT_ALLOW_PRIVATE_URLS=true with caution.
