aliases: []
summary: Opencast is a free and open source solution for automated video capture and distribution
  at scale. Prior to Opencast 10.14 and 11.7, users could pass along URLs for files belonging
  to organizations other than the user's own, which Opencast would then import into the current
  organization, bypassing organizational barriers. Attackers must have full access to Opencast's
  ingest REST interface, and also know internal links to resources in another organization of
  the same Opencast cluster. Users who do not run a multi-tenant cluster are not affected by
  this issue. This issue is fixed in Opencast 10.14 and 11.7.
