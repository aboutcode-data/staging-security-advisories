aliases: []
summary: SAP NetWeaver is vulnerable to an Information Disclosure vulnerability caused by the
  injection of malicious instructions into user configuration settings. An attacker with administrative
  privileges can craft these instructions so that when accessed by the victim, sensitive information
  such as user credentials is exposed. These credentials may then be used to gain unauthorized
  access to local or adjacent systems. This results in high impact to Confidentiality, with
  no significant effect on Integrity or Availability.
