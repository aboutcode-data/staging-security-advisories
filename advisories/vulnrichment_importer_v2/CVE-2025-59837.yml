aliases: []
summary: Astro is a web framework that includes an image proxy. In versions 5.13.4 and later
  before 5.13.10, the image proxy domain validation can be bypassed by using backslashes in
  the href parameter, allowing server-side requests to arbitrary URLs. This can lead to server-side
  request forgery (SSRF) and potentially cross-site scripting (XSS). This vulnerability exists
  due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2025-58179. Fixed in 5.13.10.
