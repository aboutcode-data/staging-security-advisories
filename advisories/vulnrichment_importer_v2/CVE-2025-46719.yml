aliases: []
summary: Open WebUI is a self-hosted artificial intelligence platform designed to operate entirely
  offline. Prior to version 0.6.6, a vulnerability in the way certain html tags in chat messages
  are rendered allows attackers to inject JavaScript code into a chat transcript. The JavaScript
  code will be executed in the user's browser every time that chat transcript is opened, allowing
  attackers to retrieve the user's access token and gain full control over their account. Chat
  transcripts can be shared with other users in the same server, or with the whole open-webui
  community if "Enable Community Sharing" is enabled in the admin panel. If this exploit is
  used against an admin user, it is possible to achieve Remote Code Execution on the server
  where the open-webui backend is hosted. This can be done by creating a new function which
  contains malicious python code. This vulnerability also affects chat transcripts uploaded
  to `https://openwebui.com/c/<user>/<chat_id>`, allowing for wormable stored XSS in https[:]//openwebui[.]com.
  Version 0.6.6 contains a patch for the issue.
