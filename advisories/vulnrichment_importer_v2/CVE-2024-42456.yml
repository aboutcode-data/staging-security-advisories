summary: A vulnerability in Veeam Backup & Replication platform allows a low-privileged user
  with a specific role to exploit a method that updates critical configuration settings, such
  as modifying the trusted client certificate used for authentication on a specific port. This

  critical services. The issue arises due to insufficient permission requirements on the method,
  allowing users with low privileges to perform actions that should require higher-level permissions.
