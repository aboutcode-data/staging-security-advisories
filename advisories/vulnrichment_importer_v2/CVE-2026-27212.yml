aliases: []
summary: 'Swiper is a free and mobile touch slider with hardware accelerated transitions and
  native behavior. Versions 6.5.1 through 12.1.1 have a Prototype pollution vulnerability. The
  vulnerability resides in line 94 of shared/utils.mjs, where the indexOf() function is used
  to check whether user provided input contain forbidden strings. Despite a previous fix that
  attempted to mitigate prototype pollution by checking whether user input contained a forbidden
  key, it is still possible to pollute Object.prototype via a crafted input using Array.prototype.
  The exploit works across Windows and Linux and on Node and Bun runtimes.  Any application
  that processes attacker-controlled input using this package may be affected  by the following:
  Authentication Bypass, Denial of Service and RCE. This issue is fixed in version 12.1.2.'
