aliases: []
summary: 'DHIS2 Core contains the service layer and Web API for DHIS2, an information system
  for data capture. Starting in the 2.36 branch and prior to versions 2.37.9.1, 2.38.3.1, and
  2.39.1.2, using object model traversal in the payload of a PATCH request, authenticated users
  with write access to an object may be able to modify related objects that they should not
  have access to. DHIS2 implementers should upgrade to a supported version of DHIS2 to receive
  a patch: 2.37.9.1, 2.38.3.1, or 2.39.1.2. It is possible to work around this issue by blocking
  all PATCH requests on a reverse proxy, but this may cause some issues with the functionality
  of built-in applications using legacy PATCH requests.'
