summary: The WP Applink plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via
  the ‘title’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 0.4.1 due to insufficient input
  sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
  Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute
  whenever a user accesses an injected page.
