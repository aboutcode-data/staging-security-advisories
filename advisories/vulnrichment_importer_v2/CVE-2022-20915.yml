aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the implementation of IPv6 VPN over MPLS (6VPE) with Zone-Based
  Firewall (ZBFW) of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker
  to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is
  due to improper error handling of an IPv6 packet that is forwarded from an MPLS and ZBFW-enabled
  interface in a 6VPE deployment. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a
  crafted IPv6 packet sourced from a device on the IPv6-enabled virtual routing and forwarding
  (VRF) interface through the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to reload the device, resulting in a DoS condition.
