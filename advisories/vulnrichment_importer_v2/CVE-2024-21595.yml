aliases: []
summary: |
  An Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows a network-based, unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

  If an attacker sends high rate of specific ICMP traffic to a device with VXLAN configured, this causes a deadlock of the PFE and results in the device becoming unresponsive. A manual restart will be required to recover the device.

  This issue only affects EX4100, EX4400, EX4600, QFX5000 Series devices.

  This issue affects:

  Juniper Networks Junos OS
