aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the Remote Access VPN (RAVPN) service of Cisco Adaptive Security\
  \ Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an\
  \ unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) of the RAVPN service.\r\
  \n\r This vulnerability is due to resource exhaustion. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by sending a large number of VPN authentication requests to an affected device. A successful\
  \ exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust resources, resulting in a DoS of the RAVPN service\
  \ on the affected device. Depending on the impact of the attack, a reload of the device may\
  \ be required to restore the RAVPN service. Services that are not related to VPN are not affected.\r\
  \n\r Cisco Talos discussed these attacks in the blog post Large-scale brute-force activity\
  \ targeting VPNs, SSH services with commonly used login credentials."
