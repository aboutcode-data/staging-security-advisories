aliases: []
summary: Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability
  involves **insecure communication** between the FRP (Fast Reverse Proxy) client and server
  when Gradio's `share=True` option is used. HTTPS is not enforced on the connection, allowing
  attackers to intercept and read files uploaded to the Gradio server, as well as modify responses
  or data sent between the client and server. This impacts users who are sharing Gradio demos
  publicly over the internet using `share=True` without proper encryption, exposing sensitive
  data to potential eavesdroppers. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>=5` to address this
  issue. As a workaround, users can avoid using `share=True` in production environments and
  instead host their Gradio applications on servers with HTTPS enabled to ensure secure communication.
