aliases: []
summary: The Visitor Logic Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.0.3 via deserialization of untrusted input from the `lpblocks`
  cookie. This is due to the `lp_track()` function passing unsanitized cookie data directly
  to the `unserialize()` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject
  a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is
  present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the
  attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code granted they
  can access the WordPress site.
