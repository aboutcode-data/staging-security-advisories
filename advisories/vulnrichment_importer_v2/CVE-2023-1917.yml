aliases: []
summary: 'The PowerPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via
  the plugin''s shortcode(s) in versions up to, and including, 10.0 due to insufficient input
  sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in
  pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. NOTE: A partial fix for
  the issue was introduced in version 10.0.1, and an additional patch (version 10.0.2) was released
  to address a workaround.'
