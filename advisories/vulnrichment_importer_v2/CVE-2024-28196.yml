aliases: []
summary: your_spotify is an open source, self hosted Spotify tracking dashboard. YourSpotify
  version < 1.9.0 does not prevent other pages from displaying it in an iframe and is thus vulnerable
  to clickjacking. Clickjacking can be used to trick an existing user of YourSpotify to trigger
  actions, such as allowing signup of other users or deleting the current user account. Clickjacking
  works by opening the target application in an invisible iframe on an attacker-controlled site
  and luring a victim to visit the attacker page and interacting with it. By positioning elements
  over the invisible iframe, a victim can be tricked into triggering malicious or destructive
  actions in the invisible iframe, while they think they interact with a totally different site
  altogether. When a victim visits an attacker-controlled site while they are logged into YourSpotify,
  they can be tricked into performing actions on their YourSpotify instance without their knowledge.
  These actions include allowing signup of other users or deleting the current user account,
  resulting in a high impact to the integrity of YourSpotify. This issue has been addressed
  in version 1.9.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
