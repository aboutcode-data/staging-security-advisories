  USB: serial: mos7840: fix crash on resume

  Since commit c49cfa917025 ("USB: serial: use generic method if no
  alternative is provided in usb serial layer"), USB serial core calls the
  generic resume implementation when the driver has not provided one.

  This can trigger a crash on resume with mos7840 since support for
  multiple read URBs was added back in 2011. Specifically, both port read
  URBs are now submitted on resume for open ports, but the context pointer
  of the second URB is left set to the core rather than mos7840 port
  structure.

  Fix this by implementing dedicated suspend and resume functions for
  mos7840.

  Tested with Delock 87414 USB 2.0 to 4x serial adapter.
