aliases: []
summary: LINE client for iOS prior to 15.4 allows man-in-the-middle attacks due to improper
  SSL/TLS certificate validation in an integrated financial SDK. The SDK interfered with the
  application's network processing, causing server certificate verification to be disabled for
  a significant portion of network traffic, which could allow a network-adjacent attacker to
  intercept or modify encrypted communications.
