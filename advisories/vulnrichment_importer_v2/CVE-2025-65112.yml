aliases: []
summary: PubNet is a self-hosted Dart & Flutter package service. Prior to version 1.1.3, the
  /api/storage/upload endpoint in PubNet allows unauthenticated users to upload packages as
  any user by providing arbitrary author-id values. This enables identity spoofing, privilege
  escalation, and supply chain attacks. This issue has been patched in version 1.1.3.
