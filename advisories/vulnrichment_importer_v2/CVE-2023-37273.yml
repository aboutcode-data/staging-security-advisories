aliases: []
summary: Auto-GPT is an experimental open-source application showcasing the capabilities of
  the GPT-4 language model. Running Auto-GPT version prior to 0.4.3 by cloning the git repo
  and executing `docker compose run auto-gpt` in the repo root uses a different docker-compose.yml
  file from the one suggested in the official docker set up instructions. The docker-compose.yml
  file located in the repo root mounts itself into the docker container without write protection.
  This means that if malicious custom python code is executed via the `execute_python_file`
  and `execute_python_code` commands, it can overwrite the docker-compose.yml file and abuse
  it to gain control of the host system the next time Auto-GPT is started. The issue has been
  patched in version 0.4.3.
