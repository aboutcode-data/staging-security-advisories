aliases: []
summary: Grav is an open-source, flat-file content management system. Prior to version 1.7.45,
  Grav validates accessible functions through the Utils::isDangerousFunction function, but does
  not impose restrictions on twig functions like twig_array_map, allowing attackers to bypass
  the validation and execute arbitrary commands. Twig processing of static pages can be enabled
  in the front matter by any administrative user allowed to create or edit pages. As the Twig
  processor runs unsandboxed, this behavior can be used to gain arbitrary code execution and
  elevate privileges on the instance. Upgrading to patched version 1.7.45 can mitigate this
  issue.
