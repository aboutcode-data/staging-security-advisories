aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software could allow an authenticated,
  local attacker to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges. This vulnerability
  is due to insufficient input validation by the system CLI. An attacker with privileges to
  run commands could exploit this vulnerability by first authenticating to an affected device
  using either local terminal access or a management shell interface and then submitting crafted
  input to the system CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands
  on the underlying operating system with root-level privileges. An attacker with limited user
  privileges could use this vulnerability to gain complete control over the system. Note: For
  additional information about specific impacts, see the Details section of this advisory.'
