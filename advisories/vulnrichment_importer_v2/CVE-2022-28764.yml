summary: The Zoom Client for Meetings (for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows) before version
  5.12.6 is susceptible to a local information exposure vulnerability. A failure to clear data
  from a local SQL database after a meeting ends and the usage of an insufficiently secure per-device
  key encrypting that database results in a local malicious user being able to obtain meeting
  information such as in-meeting chat for the previous meeting attended from that local user
  account.
