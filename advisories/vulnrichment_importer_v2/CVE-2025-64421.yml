aliases: []
summary: Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications,
  and databases. In Coolify versions up to and including v4.0.0-beta.434, a low privileged user
  (member) can invite a high privileged user. At first, the application will throw an error,
  but if the attacker clicks the invite button a second time, it actually works. This way, a
  low privileged user can invite themselves as an administrator to the Coolify instance. After
  the high privileged user is invited, the attacker can initiate a password reset and log in
  with the new admin. As of time of publication, it is unclear if a patch is available.
