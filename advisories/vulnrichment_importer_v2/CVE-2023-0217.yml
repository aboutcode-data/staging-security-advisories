aliases: []
summary: |
  An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an
  application tries to check a malformed DSA public key by the
  EVP_PKEY_public_check() function. This will most likely lead
  to an application crash. This function can be called on public
  keys supplied from untrusted sources which could allow an attacker
  to cause a denial of service attack.

  The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call this function
  but applications might call the function if there are additional
  security requirements imposed by standards such as FIPS 140-3.
