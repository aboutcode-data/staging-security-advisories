aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco AsyncOS for Cisco Web
  Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored
  cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface of an affected device. The
  vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate
  user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious data
  into a specific data field in an affected interface. A successful exploit could allow the
  attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface.
