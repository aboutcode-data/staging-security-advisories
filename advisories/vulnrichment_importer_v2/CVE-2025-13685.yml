aliases: []
summary: The Photo Gallery by Ays plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.8. This is due to missing nonce verification on
  the bulk action functionality in the 'process_bulk_action()' function. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to perform bulk operations (delete, publish, or unpublish galleries)
  via a forged request granted they can trick an administrator into performing an action such
  as clicking on a link.
