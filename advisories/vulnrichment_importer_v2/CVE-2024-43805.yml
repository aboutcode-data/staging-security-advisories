aliases: []
summary: 'jupyterlab is an extensible environment for interactive and reproducible computing,
  based on the Jupyter Notebook Architecture. This vulnerability depends on user interaction
  by opening a malicious notebook with Markdown cells, or Markdown file using JupyterLab preview
  feature. A malicious user can access any data that the attacked user has access to as well
  as perform arbitrary requests acting as the attacked user. JupyterLab v3.6.8, v4.2.5 and Jupyter
  Notebook v7.2.2 have been patched to resolve this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. There
  is no workaround for the underlying DOM Clobbering susceptibility. However, select plugins
  can be disabled on deployments which cannot update in a timely fashion to minimise the risk.
  These are: 1. `@jupyterlab/mathjax-extension:plugin` - users will loose ability to preview
  mathematical equations. 2. `@jupyterlab/markdownviewer-extension:plugin` - users will loose
  ability to open Markdown previews. 3. `@jupyterlab/mathjax2-extension:plugin` (if installed
  with optional `jupyterlab-mathjax2` package) - an older version of the mathjax plugin for
  JupyterLab 4.x. To disable these extensions run: ```jupyter labextension disable @jupyterlab/markdownviewer-extension:plugin
  && jupyter labextension disable @jupyterlab/mathjax-extension:plugin && jupyter labextension
  disable @jupyterlab/mathjax2-extension:plugin ``` in bash.'
