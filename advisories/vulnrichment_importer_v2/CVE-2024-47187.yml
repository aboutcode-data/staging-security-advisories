aliases: []
summary: Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention System and Network
  Security Monitoring engine. Prior to version 7.0.7, missing initialization of the random seed
  for "thash" leads to datasets having predictable hash table behavior. This can lead to dataset
  file loading to use excessive time to load, as well as runtime performance issues during traffic
  handling. This issue has been addressed in 7.0.7. As a workaround, avoid loading datasets
  from untrusted sources. Avoid dataset rules that track traffic in rules.
