datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2025/14xxx/CVE-2025-14265.json
aliases: []
summary: In versions of ScreenConnect™ prior to 25.8, server-side validation and integrity checks
  within the extension subsystem could allow the installation and execution of untrusted or
  arbitrary extensions by authorized or administrative users. Abuse of this behavior could result
  in the execution of custom code on the server or unauthorized access to application configuration
  data. This issue affects only the ScreenConnect server component; host and guest clients are
  not impacted. ScreenConnect 25.8 introduces enhanced server-side configuration handling and
  integrity checks to ensure only trusted extensions can be installed.
