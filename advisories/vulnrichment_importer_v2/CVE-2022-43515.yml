aliases: []
summary: Zabbix Frontend provides a feature that allows admins to maintain the installation
  and ensure that only certain IP addresses can access it. In this way, any user will not be
  able to access the Zabbix Frontend while it is being maintained and possible sensitive data
  will be prevented from being disclosed. An attacker can bypass this protection and access
  the instance using IP address not listed in the defined range.
