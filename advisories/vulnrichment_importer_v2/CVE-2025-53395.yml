aliases: []
summary: Paramount Macrium Reflect through 2025-06-26 allows local attackers to execute arbitrary
  code with administrator privileges via a crafted .mrimgx backup file and a malicious VSSSvr.dll
  located in the same directory. When a user with administrative privileges mounts a backup
  by opening the .mrimgx file, Reflect loads the attacker's VSSSvr.dll after the mount completes.
  This occurs because of untrusted DLL search path behavior in ReflectMonitor.exe.
