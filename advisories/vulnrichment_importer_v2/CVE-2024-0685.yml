aliases: []
summary: The Ninja Forms Contact Form – The Drag and Drop Form Builder for WordPress plugin
  for WordPress is vulnerable to Second Order SQL Injection via the email address value submitted
  through forms in all versions up to, and including, 3.7.1 due to insufficient escaping on
  the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This
  makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject SQL in their email address that
  will append additional into the already existing query when an administrator triggers a personal
  data export.
