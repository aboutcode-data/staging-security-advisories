aliases: []
summary: Ubee DDW365 XCNDDW365 devices have predictable default WPA2 PSKs that could lead to
  unauthorized remote access. A remote attacker (in proximity to a Wi-Fi network) can derive
  the default WPA2-PSK value by observing a beacon frame. A PSK is generated by using the first
  six characters of the SSID and the last six of the BSSID, decrementing the last digit.
