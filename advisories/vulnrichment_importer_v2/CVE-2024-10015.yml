summary: The ConvertCalculator for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the 'id' and 'type' parameters in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.1 due

  attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
  that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
