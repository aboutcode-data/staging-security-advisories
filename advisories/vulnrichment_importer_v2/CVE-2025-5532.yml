aliases: []
summary: The Campus Directory – Faculty, Staff & Student Directory Plugin for WordPress plugin
  for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'emd_mb_meta'
  shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.0 due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
  that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
