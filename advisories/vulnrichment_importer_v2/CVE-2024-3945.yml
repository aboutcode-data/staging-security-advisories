summary: The WP To Do plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all
  versions up to, and including, 1.3.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the wptodo_manage() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add
  new todo items via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
  an action such as clicking on a link.
