aliases: []
summary: OWSLib is a Python package for client programming with Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)
  web service interface standards, and their related content models. OWSLib's XML parser (which
  supports both `lxml` and `xml.etree`) does not disable entity resolution, and could lead to
  arbitrary file reads from an attacker-controlled XML payload. This affects all XML parsing
  in the codebase. This issue has been addressed in version 0.28.1. All users are advised to
  upgrade. The only known workaround is to patch the library manually. See `GHSA-8h9c-r582-mggc`
  for details.
