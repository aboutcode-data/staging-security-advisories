summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: stmmac:\
  \ dwmac-rk: fix oob read in rk_gmac_setup\n\nKASAN reports an out-of-bounds read in rk_gmac_setup\
  \ on the line:\n\n\twhile (ops->regs[i]) {\n\nThis happens for most platforms since the regs\
  \ flexible array member is\nempty, so the memory after the ops structure is being read here.\
  \  It\nseems that mostly this happens to contain zero anyway, so we get lucky\nand everything\
  \ still works.\n\nTo avoid adding redundant data to nearly all the ops structures, add a\n\
  new flag to indicate whether the regs field is valid and avoid this loop\nwhen it is not."
