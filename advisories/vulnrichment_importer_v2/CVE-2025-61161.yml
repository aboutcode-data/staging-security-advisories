aliases: []
summary: DLL hijacking vulnerability in Evope Collector 1.1.6.9.0 and related components load
  the wtsapi32.dll library from an uncontrolled search path (C:\ProgramData\Evope). This allows
  local unprivileged attackers to execute arbitrary code or escalate privileges to SYSTEM by
  placing a crafted DLL in that location. The vulnerable component is Evope.Service.exe, which
  runs with SYSTEM privileges and automatically loads the DLL on startup or reboot.
