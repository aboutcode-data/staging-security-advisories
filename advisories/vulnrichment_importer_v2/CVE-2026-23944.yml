aliases: []
summary: Arcane is an interface for managing Docker containers, images, networks, and volumes.
  Prior to version 1.13.2, unauthenticated requests could be proxied to remote environment agents,
  allowing access to remote environment resources without authentication. The environment proxy
  middleware handled `/api/environments/{id}/...` requests for remote environments before authentication
  was enforced. When the environment ID was not local, the middleware proxied the request and
  attached the manager-held agent token, even if the caller was unauthenticated. This enabled
  unauthenticated access to remote environment operations (e.g., listing containers, streaming
  logs, or other agent endpoints). An unauthenticated attacker could access and manipulate remote
  environment resources via the proxy, potentially leading to data exposure, unauthorized changes,
  or service disruption. Version 1.13.2 patches the vulnerability.
