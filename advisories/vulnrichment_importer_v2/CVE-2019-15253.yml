aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Digital Network Architecture
  (DNA) Center could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected
  device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the
  web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive,
  browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs administrator
  credentials. This vulnerability affects Cisco DNA Center Software releases earlier than 1.3.0.6
  and 1.3.1.4.
