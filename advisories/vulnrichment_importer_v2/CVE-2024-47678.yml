  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  icmp: change the order of rate limits

  ICMP messages are ratelimited :

  After the blamed commits, the two rate limiters are applied in this order:

  1) host wide ratelimit (icmp_global_allow())

  2) Per destination ratelimit (inetpeer based)

  In order to avoid side-channels attacks, we need to apply
  the per destination check first.

  This patch makes the following change :

  1) icmp_global_allow() checks if the host wide limit is reached.
     But credits are not yet consumed. This is deferred to 3)

  2) The per destination limit is checked/updated.
     This might add a new node in inetpeer tree.

  3) icmp_global_consume() consumes tokens if prior operations succeeded.

  This means that host wide ratelimit is still effective
  in keeping inetpeer tree small even under DDOS.

  As a bonus, I removed icmp_global.lock as the fast path
  can use a lock-free operation.
