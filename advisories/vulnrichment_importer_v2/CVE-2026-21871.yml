aliases: []
summary: NiceGUI is a Python-based UI framework. From versions 2.13.0 to 3.4.1, there is a XSS
  risk in NiceGUI when developers pass attacker-controlled strings into ui.navigate.history.push()
  or ui.navigate.history.replace(). These helpers are documented as History API wrappers for
  updating the browser URL without page reload. However, if the URL argument is embedded into
  generated JavaScript without proper escaping, a crafted payload can break out of the intended
  string context and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim’s browser. Applications that
  do not pass untrusted input into ui.navigate.history.push/replace are not affected. This issue
  has been patched in version 3.5.0.
