summary: Strapi is an open-source content management system. Prior to version 4.19.1, a super
  admin can create a collection where an item in the collection has an association to another
  collection. When this happens, another user with Author Role can see the list of associated
  items they did not create. They should see nothing but their own items they created not all
  items ever created. Users should upgrade @strapi/plugin-content-manager to version 4.19.1
