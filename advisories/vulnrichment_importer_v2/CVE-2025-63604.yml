aliases: []
summary: A code injection vulnerability exists in baryhuang/mcp-server-aws-resources-python
  0.1.0 that allows remote code execution through insufficient input validation in the execute_query
  method. The vulnerability stems from the exposure of dangerous Python built-in functions (__import__,
  getattr, hasattr) in the execution namespace and the direct use of exec() to execute user-supplied
  code. An attacker can craft malicious queries to execute arbitrary Python code, leading to
  AWS credential theft (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY), file system access, environment
  variable disclosure, and potential system compromise. The vulnerability allows attackers to
  bypass intended security controls and gain unauthorized access to sensitive AWS resources
  and credentials stored in the server's environment.
