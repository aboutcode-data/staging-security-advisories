  KVM: arm64: Fix circular locking dependency

  The rule inside kvm enforces that the vcpu->mutex is taken *inside*
  kvm->lock. The rule is violated by the pkvm_create_hyp_vm() which acquires
  the kvm->lock while already holding the vcpu->mutex lock from
  kvm_vcpu_ioctl(). Avoid the circular locking dependency altogether by
  protecting the hyp vm handle with the config_lock, much like we already
  do for other forms of VM-scoped data.
