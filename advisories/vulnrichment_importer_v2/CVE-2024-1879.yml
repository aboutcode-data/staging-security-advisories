aliases: []
summary: A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in significant-gravitas/autogpt version
  v0.5.0 allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the AutoGPT server. The vulnerability
  stems from the lack of protections on the API endpoint receiving instructions, enabling an
  attacker to direct a user running AutoGPT in their local network to a malicious website. This
  site can then send crafted requests to the AutoGPT server, leading to command execution. The
  issue is exacerbated by CORS being enabled for arbitrary origins by default, allowing the
  attacker to read the response of all cross-site queries. This vulnerability was addressed
  in version 5.1.
