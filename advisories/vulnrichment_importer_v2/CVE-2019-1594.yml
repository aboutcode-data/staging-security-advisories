aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the 802.1X implementation for Cisco NX-OS Software could allow
  an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected
  device. The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of Extensible Authentication
  Protocol over LAN (EAPOL) frames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
  a crafted EAPOL frame to an interface on the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to cause the Layer 2 (L2) forwarding process to restart multiple times, leading
  to a system-level restart of the device and a DoS condition. Note: This vulnerability affects
  only NX-OS devices configured with 802.1X functionality. Cisco Nexus 1000V Switch for VMware
  vSphere devices are affected in versions prior to 5.2(1)SV3(1.4b). Nexus 3000 Series Switches
  are affected in versions prior to 7.0(3)I7(4). Nexus 3500 Platform Switches are affected in
  versions prior to 7.0(3)I7(4). Nexus 2000, 5500, 5600, and 6000 Series Switches are affected
  in versions prior to 7.3(5)N1(1) and 7.1(5)N1(1b). Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches are
  affected in versions prior to 8.2(3). Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI Mode are affected
  in versions prior to 13.2(1l). Nexus 9000 Series Switches in Standalone NX-OS Mode are affected
  in versions prior to 7.0(3)I7(4).'
