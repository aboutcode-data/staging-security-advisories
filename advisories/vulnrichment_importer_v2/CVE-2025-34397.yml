aliases: []
summary: MailEnable versions prior to 10.54 contain a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
  in the Message parameter of /Mobile/Compose.aspx. The Message value is not properly sanitized
  when processed via a GET request and is reflected into a JavaScript context in the response.
  By supplying a crafted payload that terminates the existing script block/function, injects
  attacker-controlled JavaScript, and comments out the remaining code, a remote attacker can
  execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim’s browser when the victim opens the crafted reply
  URL. Successful exploitation can redirect victims to malicious sites, steal non-HttpOnly cookies,
  inject arbitrary HTML or CSS, and perform actions as the authenticated user.
