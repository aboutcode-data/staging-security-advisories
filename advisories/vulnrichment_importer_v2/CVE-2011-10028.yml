aliases: []
summary: The RealNetworks RealArcade platform includes an ActiveX control (InstallerDlg.dll,
  version 2.6.0.445) that exposes a method named Exec via the StubbyUtil.ProcessMgr COM object.
  This method allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands on a victim's Windows machine
  without proper validation or restrictions. This platform was sometimes referred to or otherwise
  known as RealArcade or Arcade Games and has since consolidated with RealNetworks' platform,
  GameHouse.
