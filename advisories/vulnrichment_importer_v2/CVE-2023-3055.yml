aliases: []
summary: The Page Builder by AZEXO plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.27.133. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce
  validation on the 'azh_save' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to update the post content and inject malicious JavaScript via a forged request, granted they
  can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
