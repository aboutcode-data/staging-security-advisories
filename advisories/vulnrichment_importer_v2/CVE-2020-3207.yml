aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the processing of boot options of specific Cisco IOS XE Software
  switches could allow an authenticated, local attacker with root shell access to the underlying
  operating system (OS) to conduct a command injection attack during device boot. This vulnerability
  is due to insufficient input validation checks while processing boot options. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by modifying device boot options to execute attacker-provided
  code. A successful exploit may allow an attacker to bypass the Secure Boot process and execute
  malicious code on an affected device with root-level privileges.
