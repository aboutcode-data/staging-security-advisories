summary: '* Lack of authentication in Citrix Xen Mobile through 10.8 allows low-privileged local
  users to execute system commands as root by making requests to private services listening
  on ports 8000, 30000 and 30001.  NOTE: the vendor disputes that this is a vulnerability, stating
  it is "already mitigated by the internal firewall that limits access to configuration services
  to localhost.'
