aliases: []
summary: Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework. Prior to version
  1.2.27, an arbitrary file write vulnerability, exploitable through the "Package Import" feature,
  allows authenticated users having the "Import Templates" permission to execute arbitrary PHP
  code on the web server. The vulnerability is located within the `import_package()` function
  defined into the `/lib/import.php` script. The function blindly trusts the filename and file
  content provided within the XML data, and writes such files into the Cacti base path (or even
  outside, since path traversal sequences are not filtered). This can be exploited to write
  or overwrite arbitrary files on the web server, leading to execution of arbitrary PHP code
  or other security impacts. Version 1.2.27 contains a patch for this issue.
