aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  s390/sclp: Prevent release of buffer in I/O

  When a task waiting for completion of a Store Data operation is
  interrupted, an attempt is made to halt this operation. If this attempt
  fails due to a hardware or firmware problem, there is a chance that the
  SCLP facility might store data into buffers referenced by the original
  operation at a later time.

  Handle this situation by not releasing the referenced data buffers if
  the halt attempt fails. For current use cases, this might result in a
  leak of few pages of memory in case of a rare hardware/firmware
  malfunction.
