summary: The Elegant Themes Divi theme, Extra theme, and Divi Page Builder plugin for WordPress
  are vulnerable to DOM-Based Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘title’ parameter in versions
  up to, and including, 4.25.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This
  makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above,
  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page.
