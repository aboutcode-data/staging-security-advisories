aliases: []
summary: The Advanced Ads – Ad Manager & AdSense plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote
  Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.12 via the select_one() function.
  This is due to the endpoint not properly restricting access to the AJAX endpoint or limiting
  the functions that can be called to safe functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to call arbitrary functions beginning with get_the_ like get_the_excerpt which can
  make information exposure possible.
