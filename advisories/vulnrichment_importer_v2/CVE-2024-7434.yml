summary: The UltraPress theme for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions
  up to, and including, 1.2.1 via deserialization of untrusted input. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object.

  additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to
  delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
