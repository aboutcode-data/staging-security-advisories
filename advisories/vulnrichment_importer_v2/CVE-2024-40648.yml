aliases: []
summary: matrix-rust-sdk is an implementation of a Matrix client-server library in Rust. The
  `UserIdentity::is_verified()` method in the matrix-sdk-crypto crate before version 0.7.2 doesn't
  take into account the verification status of the user's own identity while performing the
  check and may as a result return a value contrary to what is implied by its name and documentation.
  If the method is used to decide whether to perform sensitive operations towards a user identity,
  a malicious homeserver could manipulate the outcome in order to make the identity appear trusted.
  This is not a typical usage of the method, which lowers the impact. The method itself is not
  used inside the `matrix-sdk-crypto` crate. The 0.7.2 release of the `matrix-sdk-crypto` crate
  includes a fix. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
  vulnerability.
