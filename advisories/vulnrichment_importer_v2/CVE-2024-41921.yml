aliases: []
summary: A code injection vulnerability has been discovered in the Robot Operating System (ROS)
  'rostopic' command-line tool, affecting ROS distributions Noetic Ninjemys and earlier. The
  vulnerability lies in the 'echo' verb, which allows a user to introspect a ROS topic and accepts
  a user-provided Python expression via the --filter option. This input is passed directly to
  the eval() function without sanitization, allowing a local user to craft and execute arbitrary
  code.
