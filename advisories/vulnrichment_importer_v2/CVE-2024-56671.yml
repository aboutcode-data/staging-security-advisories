  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  gpio: graniterapids: Fix vGPIO driver crash

  Move setting irq_chip.name from probe() function to the initialization
  of "irq_chip" struct in order to fix vGPIO driver crash during bootup.

  Crash was caused by unauthorized modification of irq_chip.name field
  where irq_chip struct was initialized as const.

  This behavior is a consequence of suboptimal implementation of
  gpio_irq_chip_set_chip(), which should be changed to avoid
  casting away const qualifier.
