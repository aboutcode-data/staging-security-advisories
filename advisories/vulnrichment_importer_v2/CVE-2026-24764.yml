aliases: []
summary: OpenClaw (formerly Clawdbot) is a personal AI assistant users run on their own devices.
  In versions 2026.2.2 and below, when the Slack integration is enabled, channel metadata (topic/description)
  can be incorporated into the model's system prompt. Prompt injection is a documented risk
  for LLM-driven systems. This issue increases the injection surface by allowing untrusted Slack
  channel metadata to be treated as higher-trust system input. This issue has been fixed in
  version 2026.2.3.
