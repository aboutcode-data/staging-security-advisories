aliases: []
summary: The Super Backup & Clone - Migrate for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation and a missing capability check

  makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected
  site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
