aliases: []
summary: The Newscrunch theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all
  versions up to, and including, 1.8.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the newscrunch_install_and_activate_plugin() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to upload arbitrary files via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
