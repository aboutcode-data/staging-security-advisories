aliases: []
summary: An unrestricted file upload vulnerability exists in MiniWeb HTTP Server <= Build 300
  that allows unauthenticated remote attackers to upload arbitrary files to the server’s filesystem.
  By abusing the upload handler and crafting a traversal path, an attacker can place a malicious
  .exe in system32, followed by a .mof file in the WMI directory. This triggers execution of
  the payload with SYSTEM privileges via the Windows Management Instrumentation service. The
  exploit is only viable on Windows versions prior to Vista.
