  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  serial: sc16is7xx: convert from _raw_ to _noinc_ regmap functions for FIFO

  The SC16IS7XX IC supports a burst mode to access the FIFOs where the
  initial register address is sent ($00), followed by all the FIFO data
  without having to resend the register address each time. In this mode, the
  IC doesn't increment the register address for each R/W byte.

  The regmap_raw_read() and regmap_raw_write() are functions which can
  perform IO over multiple registers. They are currently used to read/write
  from/to the FIFO, and although they operate correctly in this burst mode on
  the SPI bus, they would corrupt the regmap cache if it was not disabled
  manually. The reason is that when the R/W size is more than 1 byte, these
  functions assume that the register address is incremented and handle the
  cache accordingly.

  Convert FIFO R/W functions to use the regmap _noinc_ versions in order to
  remove the manual cache control which was a workaround when using the
  _raw_ versions. FIFO registers are properly declared as volatile so
  cache will not be used/updated for FIFO accesses.
