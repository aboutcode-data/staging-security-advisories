aliases: []
summary: "In snapd versions prior to 2.62, snapd failed to properly check the file\ntype when\
  \ extracting a snap. The snap format is a squashfs file-system\nimage and so can contain files\
  \ that are non-regular files (such as pipes \nor sockets etc). Various file entries within\
  \ the snap squashfs image\n(such as icons etc) are directly read by snapd when it is extracted.\
  \ An \nattacker who could convince a user to install a malicious snap which\ncontained non-regular\
  \ files at these paths could then cause snapd to block\nindefinitely trying to read from such\
  \ files and cause a denial of service."
