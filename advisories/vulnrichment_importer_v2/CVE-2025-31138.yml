aliases: []
summary: tarteaucitron.js is a compliant and accessible cookie banner. A vulnerability was identified
  in tarteaucitron.js prior to 1.20.1, where user-controlled inputs for element dimensions (width
  and height) were not properly validated. This allowed an attacker with direct access to the
  site's source code or a CMS plugin to set values like 100%;height:100%;position:fixed;, potentially
  covering the entire viewport and facilitating clickjacking attacks. An attacker with high
  privileges could exploit this vulnerability to overlay malicious UI elements on top of legitimate
  content, trick users into interacting with hidden elements (clickjacking), or disrupt the
  intended functionality and accessibility of the website. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.20.1.
