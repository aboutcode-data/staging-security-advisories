aliases: []
summary: "A security flaw involving hard-coded credentials in LevelOne WBR-6012's web services\
  \ allows attackers to gain unauthorized access during the first 30 seconds post-boot. Other\
  \ vulnerabilities can force a reboot, circumventing the initial time restriction for exploitation.The\
  \ backdoor string can be found at address 0x80100910\r\n\r\n    80100910 40 6d 21 74     \
  \   ds         \"@m!t2K1\"\r\n             32 4b 31 00\r\n             \r\nIt is referenced\
  \ by the function located at 0x800b78b0 and is used as shown in the pseudocode below:\r\n\r\
  \n    if ((SECOND_FROM_BOOT_TIME < 300) &&\r\n        (is_equal = strcmp(password,\"@m!t2K1\"\
  )) {\r\n            return 1;}\r\n            \r\nWhere 1 is the return value to admin-level\
  \ access (0 being fail and 3 being user)."
