aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the system resource management of Cisco Elastic Services Controller
  (ESC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) to
  the health monitor API on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to inadequate provisioning
  of kernel parameters for the maximum number of TCP connections and SYN backlog. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending a flood of crafted TCP packets to an affected
  device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to block TCP listening ports that are
  used by the health monitor API. This vulnerability only affects customers who use the health
  monitor API.
