aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the Cisco Group Encrypted Transport VPN (GET VPN) feature of Cisco\
  \ IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker who\
  \ has administrative control of either a group member or a key server to execute arbitrary\
  \ code on an affected device or cause the device to crash.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due\
  \ to insufficient validation of attributes in the Group Domain of Interpretation (GDOI) and\
  \ G-IKEv2 protocols of the GET VPN feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by\
  \ either compromising an installed key server or modifying the configuration of a group member\
  \ to point to a key server that is controlled by the attacker. A successful exploit could\
  \ allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and gain full control of the affected system\
  \ or cause the affected system to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\
  \ For more information, see the Details [\"#details\"] section of this advisory."
