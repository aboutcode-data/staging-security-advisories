summary: GestSup versions up to and including 3.2.60 contain a cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
  vulnerability where the application does not verify the authenticity of client requests. An
  attacker can induce a logged-in user to submit crafted requests that perform actions with
  the victim's privileges. This can be exploited to create privileged accounts by targeting
  the administrative user creation endpoint.
