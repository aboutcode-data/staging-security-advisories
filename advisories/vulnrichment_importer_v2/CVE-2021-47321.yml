  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  watchdog: Fix possible use-after-free by calling del_timer_sync()

  This driver's remove path calls del_timer(). However, that function
  does not wait until the timer handler finishes. This means that the
  timer handler may still be running after the driver's remove function
  has finished, which would result in a use-after-free.

  Fix by calling del_timer_sync(), which makes sure the timer handler
  has finished, and unable to re-schedule itself.
