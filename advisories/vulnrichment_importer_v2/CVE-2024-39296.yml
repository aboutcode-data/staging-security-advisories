  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  bonding: fix oops during rmmod

  "rmmod bonding" causes an oops ever since commit cc317ea3d927 ("bonding:
  remove redundant NULL check in debugfs function").  Here are the relevant
  functions being called:

  bonding_exit()
    bond_destroy_debugfs()
      debugfs_remove_recursive(bonding_debug_root);
      bonding_debug_root = NULL; <--------- SET TO NULL HERE
    bond_netlink_fini()
      rtnl_link_unregister()
        __rtnl_link_unregister()
          unregister_netdevice_many_notify()
            bond_uninit()
              bond_debug_unregister()
                (commit removed check for bonding_debug_root == NULL)
                debugfs_remove()
                simple_recursive_removal()
                  down_write() -> OOPS

  However, reverting the bad commit does not solve the problem completely
  because the original code contains a race that could cause the same
  oops, although it was much less likely to be triggered unintentionally:

  CPU1
    rmmod bonding
      bonding_exit()
        bond_destroy_debugfs()
          debugfs_remove_recursive(bonding_debug_root);

  CPU2
    echo -bond0 > /sys/class/net/bonding_masters
      bond_uninit()
        bond_debug_unregister()
          if (!bonding_debug_root)

  CPU1
          bonding_debug_root = NULL;

  So do NOT revert the bad commit (since the removed checks were racy
  anyway), and instead change the order of actions taken during module
  removal.  The same oops can also happen if there is an error during
  module init, so apply the same fix there.
