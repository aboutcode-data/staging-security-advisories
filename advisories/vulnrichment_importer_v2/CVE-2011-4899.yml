aliases: []
summary: 'wp-admin/setup-config.php in the installation component in WordPress 3.3.1 and earlier
  does not ensure that the specified MySQL database service is appropriate, which allows remote
  attackers to configure an arbitrary database via the dbhost and dbname parameters, and subsequently
  conduct static code injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via (1) an HTTP request
  or (2) a MySQL query.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this issue; however,
  remote code execution makes the issue important in many realistic environments'
