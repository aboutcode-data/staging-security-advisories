  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: tls: handle backlogging of crypto requests

  Since we're setting the CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_BACKLOG flag on our
  requests to the crypto API, crypto_aead_{encrypt,decrypt} can return
   -EBUSY instead of -EINPROGRESS in valid situations. For example, when
  the cryptd queue for AESNI is full (easy to trigger with an
  artificially low cryptd.cryptd_max_cpu_qlen), requests will be enqueued
  to the backlog but still processed. In that case, the async callback
  will also be called twice: first with err == -EINPROGRESS, which it
  seems we can just ignore, then with err == 0.

  Compared to Sabrina's original patch this version uses the new
  tls_*crypt_async_wait() helpers and converts the EBUSY to
  EINPROGRESS to avoid having to modify all the error handling
  paths. The handling is identical.
