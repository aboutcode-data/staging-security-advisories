  ixgbe: Fix NULL pointer dereference in ethtool loopback test

  The ixgbe driver currently generates a NULL pointer dereference when
  performing the ethtool loopback test. This is due to the fact that there
  isn't a q_vector associated with the test ring when it is setup as
  interrupts are not normally added to the test rings.

  To address this I have added code that will check for a q_vector before
  returning a napi_id value. If a q_vector is not present it will return a
  value of 0.
