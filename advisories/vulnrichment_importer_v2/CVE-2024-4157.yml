summary: The Contact Form Plugin by Fluent Forms for Quiz, Survey, and Drag & Drop WP Form Builder
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including,
  5.1.15 via deserialization of untrusted input in the extractDynamicValues function. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject
  a PHP Object. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the
  target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data,
  or execute code. Successful exploitation requires the attacker to have "View Form" and "Manage
  Form" permissions, which must be explicitly set by an administrator. However, this requirement
  can be bypassed when this vulnerability is chained with CVE-2024-2771.
