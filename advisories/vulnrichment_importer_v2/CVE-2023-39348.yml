aliases: []
summary: Spinnaker is an open source, multi-cloud continuous delivery platform. Log output when
  updating GitHub status is improperly set to FULL always.  It's recommended to apply the patch
  and rotate the GitHub token used for github status notifications.  Given that this would output
  github tokens to a log system, the risk is slightly higher than a "low" since token exposure
  could grant elevated access to repositories outside of control.  If using READ restricted
  tokens, the exposure is such that the token itself could be used to access resources otherwise
  restricted from reads. This only affects users of GitHub Status Notifications. This issue
  has been addressed in pull request 1316. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade
  should disable GH Status Notifications, Filter their logs for Echo log data and use read-only
  tokens that are limited in scope.
