aliases: []
summary: The WP Firebase Push Notification plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.0. This is due to missing or incorrect
  nonce validation on the wfpn_brodcast_notification_message() function. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to send broadcast notifications via a forged request granted
  they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
