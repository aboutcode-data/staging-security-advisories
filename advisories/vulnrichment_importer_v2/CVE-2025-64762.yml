aliases: []
summary: The AuthKit library for Next.js provides convenient helpers for authentication and
  session management using WorkOS & AuthKit with Next.js. In authkit-nextjs version 2.11.0 and
  below, authenticated responses do not defensively apply anti-caching headers. In environments
  where CDN caching is enabled, this can result in session tokens being included in cached responses
  and subsequently served to multiple users. Next.js applications deployed on Vercel are unaffected
  unless they manually enable CDN caching by setting cache headers on authenticated paths. Patched
  in authkit-nextjs 2.11.1, which applies anti-caching headers to all responses behind authentication.
