  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  tracing/timerlat: Drop interface_lock in stop_kthread()

  stop_kthread() is the offline callback for "trace/osnoise:online", since
  commit 5bfbcd1ee57b ("tracing/timerlat: Add interface_lock around clearing
  of kthread in stop_kthread()"), the following ABBA deadlock scenario is
  introduced:

  T1                            | T2 [BP]               | T3 [AP]
  osnoise_hotplug_workfn()      | work_for_cpu_fn()     | cpuhp_thread_fun()
                                |   _cpu_down()         |   osnoise_cpu_die()
    mutex_lock(&interface_lock) |                       |     stop_kthread()
                                |     cpus_write_lock() |       mutex_lock(&interface_lock)
    cpus_read_lock()            |     cpuhp_kick_ap()   |

  As the interface_lock here in just for protecting the "kthread" field of
  the osn_var, use xchg() instead to fix this issue. Also use
  for_each_online_cpu() back in stop_per_cpu_kthreads() as it can take
  cpu_read_lock() again.
