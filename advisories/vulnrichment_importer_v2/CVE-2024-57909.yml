  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  iio: light: bh1745: fix information leak in triggered buffer

  The 'scan' local struct is used to push data to user space from a
  triggered buffer, but it does not set values for inactive channels, as
  it only uses iio_for_each_active_channel() to assign new values.

  Initialize the struct to zero before using it to avoid pushing
  uninitialized information to userspace.
