summary: 'An Improper Preservation of Consistency Between Independent Representations of Shared
  State vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows
  a locally authenticated attacker with low privileges to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). If
  the device is very busy for example while executing a series of show commands on the CLI one
  or more SFPs might not be detected anymore. The system then changes its state to "unplugged"
  which is leading to traffic impact and at least a partial DoS. Once the system is less busy
  the port states return to their actual value. Indicators of compromise are log messages about
  unplugged SFPs and corresponding syspld messages without any physical or environmental cause.
  These can be checked by issuing the following commands: user@device# show log messages | match
  unplugged %PFE-6: fpc0 sfp-0/1/2 SFP unplugged %PFE-6: fpc0 sfp-0/1/3 SFP unplugged The following
  log messages will also be seen when this issue happens: fpc0 Error tvp_drv_syspld_read: syspld
  read failed for address <address> fpc0 Error[-1]:tvp_optics_presence_get - Syspld read failed
  for port <pic/port> fpc0 optics pres failed(-1) for pic <pic> port <port> fpc0 tvp_drv_syspld_read:
