aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the IPv4 protocol handling of Cisco StarOS could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability
  is due to a memory leak that occurs during packet processing. An attacker could exploit this
  vulnerability by sending a series of crafted IPv4 packets through an affected device. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust the available memory and cause an unexpected restart
  of the npusim process, leading to a DoS condition on the affected device.
