aliases: []
summary: Bagisto is an open source laravel eCommerce platform. Bagisto v2.3.7 is vulnerable
  to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) due to unsanitized user input being processed by
  the server-side templating engine when rendering product descriptions. This allows an attacker
  with product creation privileges to inject arbitrary template expressions that are evaluated
  by the backend — potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 2.3.8.
