aliases: []
summary: The HT Contact Form Widget For Elementor Page Builder & Gutenberg Blocks & Form Builder.
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation

  possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server
  which may make remote code execution possible.
