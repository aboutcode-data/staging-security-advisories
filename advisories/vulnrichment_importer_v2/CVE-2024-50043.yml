  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  nfsd: fix possible badness in FREE_STATEID

  When multiple FREE_STATEIDs are sent for the same delegation stateid,
  it can lead to a possible either use-after-free or counter refcount
  underflow errors.

  In nfsd4_free_stateid() under the client lock we find a delegation
  stateid, however the code drops the lock before calling nfs4_put_stid(),
  that allows another FREE_STATE to find the stateid again. The first one
  will proceed to then free the stateid which leads to either
  use-after-free or decrementing already zeroed counter.
