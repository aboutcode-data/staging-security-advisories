summary: The Course Redirects for Learndash plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 0.4. This is due to missing nonce validation

  attackers to modify plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
