aliases: []
summary: The Social Media WPCF7 Stop Words plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.3. This is due to missing or incorrect
  nonce validation on the smWpCfSwOptions() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to update the plugin's settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request
  granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on
  a link.
