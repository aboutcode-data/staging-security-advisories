aliases: []
summary: The Activity Log for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access
  of data due to a missing capability check on the winter_activity_log_action() function in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.2.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Subscriber-level access and above, to view potentially sensitive information (e.g., the
  password of a higher level user, such as an administrator) contained in the exposed log files.
