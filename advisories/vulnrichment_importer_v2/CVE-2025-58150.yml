aliases: []
summary: |
  Shadow mode tracing code uses a set of per-CPU variables to avoid
  cumbersome parameter passing.  Some of these variables are written to
  with guest controlled data, of guest controllable size.  That size can
  be larger than the variable, and bounding of the writes was missing.
