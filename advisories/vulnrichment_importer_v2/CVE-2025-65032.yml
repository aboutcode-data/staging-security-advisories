aliases: []
summary: Rallly is an open-source scheduling and collaboration tool. Prior to version 4.5.4,
  an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability allows any authenticated user to
  change the display names of other participants in polls without being an admin or the poll
  owner. By manipulating the participantId parameter in a rename request, an attacker can modify
  another user’s name, violating data integrity and potentially causing confusion or impersonation
  attacks. This issue has been patched in version 4.5.4.
