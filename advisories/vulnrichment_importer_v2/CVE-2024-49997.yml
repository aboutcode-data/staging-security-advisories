summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: ethernet: lantiq_etop: fix memory disclosure

  When applying padding, the buffer is not zeroed, which results in memory
  disclosure. The mentioned data is observed on the wire. This patch uses
  skb_put_padto() to pad Ethernet frames properly. The mentioned function
  zeroes the expanded buffer.

  In case the packet cannot be padded it is silently dropped. Statistics
  are also not incremented. This driver does not support statistics in the
  old 32-bit format or the new 64-bit format. These will be added in the
  future. In its current form, the patch should be easily backported to
  stable versions.

  Ethernet MACs on Amazon-SE and Danube cannot do padding of the packets
  in hardware, so software padding must be applied.
