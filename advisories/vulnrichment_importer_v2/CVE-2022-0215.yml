aliases: []
summary: The Login/Signup Popup, Waitlist Woocommerce ( Back in stock notifier ), and Side Cart
  Woocommerce (Ajax) WordPress plugins by XootiX are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  via the save_settings function found in the ~/includes/xoo-framework/admin/class-xoo-admin-settings.php
  file which makes it possible for attackers to update arbitrary options on a site that can
  be used to create an administrative user account and grant full privileged access to a compromised
  site. This affects versions <= 2.2 in Login/Signup Popup, versions <= 2.5.1 in Waitlist Woocommerce
  ( Back in stock notifier ), and versions <= 2.0 in Side Cart Woocommerce (Ajax).
