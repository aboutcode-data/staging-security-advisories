aliases: []
summary: UnForm Server versions < 10.1.15 contain an unauthenticated arbitrary file read and
  SMB coercion vulnerability in the Doc Flow feature’s 'arc' endpoint. The Doc Flow module uses
  the 'arc' handler to retrieve and render pages or resources specified by the user-supplied
  'pp' parameter, but it does so without enforcing authentication or restricting path inputs.
  As a result, an unauthenticated remote attacker can supply local filesystem paths to read
  arbitrary files accessible to the service account. On Windows deployments, providing a UNC
  path can also coerce the server into initiating outbound SMB authentication, potentially exposing
  NTLM credentials for offline cracking or relay. This issue may lead to sensitive information
  disclosure and, in some environments, enable further lateral movement.
