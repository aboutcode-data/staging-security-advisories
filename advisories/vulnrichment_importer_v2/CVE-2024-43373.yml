aliases: []
summary: webcrack is a tool for reverse engineering javascript. An arbitrary file write vulnerability
  exists in the webcrack module when processing specifically crafted malicious code on Windows
  systems. This vulnerability is triggered when using the unpack bundles feature in conjunction
  with the saving feature. If a module name includes a path traversal sequence with Windows
  path separators, an attacker can exploit this to overwrite files on the host system. This
  vulnerability allows an attacker to write arbitrary `.js` files to the host system, which
  can be leveraged to hijack legitimate Node.js modules to gain arbitrary code execution. This
  vulnerability has been patched in version 2.14.1.
