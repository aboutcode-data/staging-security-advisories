aliases: []
summary: The Frontend Admin by DynamiApps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
  modification of arbitrary WordPress options in all versions up to, and including, 3.28.20.
  This is due to insufficient capability checks and input validation in the ActionOptions::run()
  save handler. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify critical WordPress
  options such as users_can_register, default_role, and admin_email via submitting crafted form
  data to public frontend forms.
