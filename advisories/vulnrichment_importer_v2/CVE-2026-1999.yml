aliases: []
summary: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server
  that allowed an attacker to merge their own pull request into a repository without having
  push access by exploiting an authorization bypass in the enable_auto_merge mutation for pull
  requests. This issue only affected repositories that allow forking as the attack relies on
  opening a pull request from an attacker-controlled fork into the target repository. Exploitation
  was only possible in specific scenarios. It required a clean pull request status and only
  applied to branches without branch protection rules enabled. This vulnerability affected GitHub
  Enterprise Server versions prior to 3.19.2, 3.18.5, and 3.17.11, and was fixed in versions
  3.19.2, 3.18.5, and 3.17.11. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.
