datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2023/27xxx/CVE-2023-27524.json
aliases: []
summary: |
  Session Validation attacks in Apache Superset versions up to and including 2.0.1. Installations that have not altered the default configured SECRET_KEY according to installation instructions allow for an attacker to authenticate and access unauthorized resources. This does not affect Superset administrators who have changed the default value for SECRET_KEY config.

  All superset installations should always set a unique secure random SECRET_KEY. Your SECRET_KEY is used to securely sign all session cookies and encrypting sensitive information on the database.
  Add a strong SECRET_KEY to your `superset_config.py` file like:

  SECRET_KEY = <YOUR_OWN_RANDOM_GENERATED_SECRET_KEY>

  Alternatively you can set it with `SUPERSET_SECRET_KEY` environment variable.
