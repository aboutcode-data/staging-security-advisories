aliases: []
summary: Indico is an event management system that uses Flask-Multipass, a multi-backend authentication
  system for Flask. In Indico prior to version 3.3.4, corresponding to Flask-Multipass prior
  to version 0.5.5, there is a Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability during account creation when
  redirecting to the `next` URL. Exploitation requires initiating the account creation process
  with a maliciously crafted link, and then finalizing the signup process. Because of this,
  it can only target newly created (and thus unprivileged) Indico users. Indico 3.3.4 upgrades
  the dependency on Flask-Multipass to version 0.5.5, which fixes the issue. Those who build
  the Indico package themselves and cannot upgrade can update the `flask-multipass` dependency
  to `>=0.5.5` which fixes the vulnerability. Otherwise one could configure one's web server
  to disallow requests containing a query string with a `next` parameter that starts with `javascript:`.
