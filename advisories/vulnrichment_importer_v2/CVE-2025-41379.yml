aliases: []
summary: The Intellian C700 web panel allows you to add firewall rules. Each of these rules
  has an associated ID, but there is a problem when adding a new rule, the ID used to create
  the database entry may be different from the JSON ID. If the rule needs to be deleted later,
  the system will use the JSON ID and therefore fail. This can be exploited by an attacker to
  create rules that cannot be deleted unless the device is reset to factory defaults.
