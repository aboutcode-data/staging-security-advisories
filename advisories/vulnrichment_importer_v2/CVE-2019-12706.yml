aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) functionality of Cisco AsyncOS
  Software for Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to bypass the configured user filters on an affected device. The vulnerability exists because
  the affected software insufficiently validates certain incoming SPF messages. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending a custom SPF packet to an affected device. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the configured header filters, which could allow
  malicious content to pass through the device.
