aliases: []
summary: GoCD is an open source continuous delivery server. GoCD versions before 23.1.0 are
  vulnerable to a stored XSS vulnerability, where pipeline configuration with a malicious pipeline
  label configuration can affect browser display of pipeline runs generated from that configuration.
  An attacker that has permissions to configure GoCD pipelines could include JavaScript elements
  within the label template, causing a XSS vulnerability to be triggered for any users viewing
  the Value Stream Map or Job Details for runs of the affected pipeline, potentially allowing
  them to perform arbitrary actions within the victim's browser context rather than their own.
  This issue has been fixed in GoCD 23.1.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
  workarounds for this vulnerability.
