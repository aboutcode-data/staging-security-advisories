aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in the PCI Express (PCIe) Integrity and Data Encryption (IDE)

  rebinding may allow stale write transactions from a previous security context to be processed
  in a new one. This can lead to unintended data access across trusted domains, compromising
  confidentiality and integrity.
