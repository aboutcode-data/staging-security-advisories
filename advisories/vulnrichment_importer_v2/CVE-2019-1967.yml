aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Network Time Protocol (NTP) feature of Cisco NX-OS Software
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition
  on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to excessive use of system resources when
  the affected device is logging a drop action for received MODE_PRIVATE (Mode 7) NTP packets.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by flooding the device with a steady stream of
  Mode 7 NTP packets. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause high CPU and memory
  usage on the affected device, which could cause internal system processes to restart or cause
  the affected device to unexpectedly reload. Note: The NTP feature is enabled by default.'
