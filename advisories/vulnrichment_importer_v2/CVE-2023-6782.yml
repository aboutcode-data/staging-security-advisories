summary: The AMP for WP – Accelerated Mobile Pages plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
  Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's shortcode(s) in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.92

  makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions
  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page.
