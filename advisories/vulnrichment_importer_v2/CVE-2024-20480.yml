aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the DHCP Snooping feature of Cisco IOS XE Software on Software-Defined\
  \ Access (SD-Access) fabric edge nodes could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to\
  \ cause high CPU utilization on an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS)\
  \ condition that requires a manual reload to recover.  \r\n\r This vulnerability is due to\
  \ improper handling of IPv4 DHCP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by\
  \ sending certain IPv4 DHCP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow\
  \ the attacker to cause the device to exhaust CPU resources and stop processing traffic, resulting\
  \ in a DoS condition that requires a manual reload to recover."
