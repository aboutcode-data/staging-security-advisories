aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco SocialMiner could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
  against a user of the web-based management interface. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click
  a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script
  code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based
  information.
