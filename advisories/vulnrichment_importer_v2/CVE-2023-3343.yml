aliases: []
summary: The User Registration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in
  versions up to, and including, 3.0.1 via deserialization of untrusted input from the 'profile-pic-url'
  parameter. This allows authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above,
  to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is
  present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the
  attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
