aliases: []
summary: Node-SAML is a SAML library not dependent on any frameworks that runs in Node. The
  lack of checking of current timestamp allows a LogoutRequest XML to be reused multiple times
  even when the current time is past the NotOnOrAfter. This could impact the user where they
  would be logged out from an expired LogoutRequest. In bigger contexts, if LogoutRequests are
  sent out in mass to different SPs, this could impact many users on a large scale. This issue
  was patched in version 4.0.5.
