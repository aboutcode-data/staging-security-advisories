aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Cisco Small Business Switches software could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to bypass the user authentication mechanism of an affected device. The vulnerability
  exists because under specific circumstances, the affected software enables a privileged user
  account without notifying administrators of the system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by using this account to log in to an affected device and execute commands with full admin
  rights. Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. This advisory
  will be updated with fixed software information once fixed software becomes available. There
  is a workaround to address this vulnerability.
