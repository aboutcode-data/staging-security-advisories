aliases: []
summary: JumpServer is an open source bastion host and an operation and maintenance security
  audit system. Prior to 4.8.0 and 3.10.18, an attacker with a low-privileged account can access
  the Kubernetes session feature and manipulate the kubeconfig file to redirect API requests
  to an external server controlled by the attacker. This allows the attacker to intercept and
  capture the Kubernetes cluster token. This can potentially allow unauthorized access to the
  cluster and compromise its security. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.8.0 and 3.10.18.
