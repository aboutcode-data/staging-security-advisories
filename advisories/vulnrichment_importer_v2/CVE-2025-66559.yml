aliases: []
summary: 'Taiko Alethia is an Ethereum-equivalent, permissionless, based rollup designed to
  scale Ethereum without compromising its fundamental properties. In 2.3.1 and earlier, TaikoInbox._verifyBatches
  (packages/protocol/contracts/layer1/based/TaikoInbox.sol:627-678) advanced the local tid to
  whatever transition matched the current blockHash before knowing whether that batch would
  actually be verified. When the loop later broke (e.g., cooldown window not yet passed or transition
  invalidated), the function still wrote that newer tid into batches[lastVerifiedBatchId].verifiedTransitionId
  after decrementing batchId. Result: the last verified batch could end up pointing at a transition
  index from the next batch (often zeroed), corrupting the verified chain pointer.'
