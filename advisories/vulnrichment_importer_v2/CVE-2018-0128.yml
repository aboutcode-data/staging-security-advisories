summary: 'A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Data Center Analytics
  Framework could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device. The
  vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management
  interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading
  a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to
  access sensitive browser-based information. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvh02082.'
