summary: There is a Cross‑Site Scripting (XSS) issue in Esri ArcGIS Pro versions 3.6.0 and earlier.
  ArcGIS Pro is a desktop application, and exploitation is limited to local users interacting
  with the application; no privileged role or elevated permissions are required beyond standard
  local user access. A local attacker can supply malicious strings that may be rendered and
  executed when a specific dialog within ArcGIS Pro is opened. This issue is fixed in ArcGIS
  Pro version 3.6.1.
