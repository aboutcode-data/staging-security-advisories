aliases: []
summary: The LatePoint – Calendar Booking Plugin for Appointments and Events plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.2.5. This
  is due to the 'call_by_route_name' function in the routing layer only validating user capabilities
  without enforcing nonce verification. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to perform multiple administrative actions via forged requests granted they can trick a site
  administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
