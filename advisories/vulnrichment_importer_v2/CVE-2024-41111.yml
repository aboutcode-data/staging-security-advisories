aliases: []
summary: Sliver is an open source cross-platform adversary emulation/red team framework, it
  can be used by organizations of all sizes to perform security testing. Sliver version 1.6.0
  (prerelease) is vulnerable to RCE on the teamserver by a low-privileged "operator" user. The
  RCE is as the system root user. The exploit is pretty fun as we make the Sliver server pwn
  itself. As described in a past issue (#65), "there is a clear security boundary between the
  operator and server, an operator should not inherently be able to run commands or code on
  the server." An operator who exploited this vulnerability would be able to view all console
  logs, kick all other operators, view and modify files stored on the server, and ultimately
  delete the server. This issue has not yet be addressed but is expected to be resolved before
  the full release of version 1.6.0. Users of the 1.6.0 prerelease should avoid using Silver
  in production.
