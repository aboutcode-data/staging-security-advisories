  erofs: fix memory leak of LZMA global compressed deduplication

  When stressing microLZMA EROFS images with the new global compressed
  deduplication feature enabled (`-Ededupe`), I found some short-lived
  temporary pages weren't properly released, which could slowly cause
  unexpected OOMs hours later.

  Let's fix it now (LZ4 and DEFLATE don't have this issue.)
