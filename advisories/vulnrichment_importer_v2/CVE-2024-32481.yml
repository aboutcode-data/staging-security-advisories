aliases: []
summary: Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum virtual machine. Starting
  in version 0.3.8 and prior to version 0.4.0b1, when looping over a `range` of the form `range(start,
  start + N)`, if `start` is negative, the execution will always revert. This issue is caused
  by an incorrect assertion inserted by the code generation of the range `stmt.parse_For_range()`.
  The issue arises when `start` is signed, instead of using `sle`, `le` is used and `start`
  is interpreted as an unsigned integer for the comparison. If it is a negative number, its
  255th bit is set to `1` and is hence interpreted as a very large unsigned integer making the
  assertion always fail. Any contract having a `range(start, start + N)` where `start` is a
  signed integer with the possibility for `start` to be negative is affected. If a call goes
  through the loop while supplying a negative `start` the execution will revert. Version 0.4.0b1
  fixes the issue.
