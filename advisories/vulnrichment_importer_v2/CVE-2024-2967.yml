summary: The Guest posting / Frontend Posting wordpress plugin – WP Front User Submit / Front
  Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via form settings
  in all versions up to, and including, 4.4.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
  escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions
  and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
  an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
  has been disabled.
