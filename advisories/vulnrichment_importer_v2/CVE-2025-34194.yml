aliases: []
summary: Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host versions prior to 25.1.102
  and Application versions prior to 25.1.1413 (Windows client deployments) contain an insecure
  temporary-file handling vulnerability in the PrinterInstallerClient components. The software
  creates files as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM inside a directory under the control of the local user
  (C:\Users\%USER%\AppData\Local\Temp\). An attacker who can place symbolic links or otherwise
  influence filenames in that directory can cause the service to follow the link and write to
  arbitrary filesystem locations as SYSTEM. This allows a local, unprivileged user to overwrite
  or create files as SYSTEM, leading to local privilege escalation and the ability to modify
  configuration files, replace or inject binaries, or otherwise compromise confidentiality,
  integrity, and availability of the system. This vulnerability has been confirmed to be remediated,
  but it is unclear as to when the patch was introduced.
