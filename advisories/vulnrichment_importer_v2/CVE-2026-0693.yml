aliases: []
summary: The Allow HTML in Category Descriptions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
  Cross-Site Scripting via category descriptions in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.4.
  This is due to the plugin unconditionally removing the `wp_kses_data` output filter for term_description,
  link_description, link_notes, and user_description fields without checking user capabilities.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above,
  to inject arbitrary web scripts in category descriptions that will execute whenever a user
  accesses a page where the category description is displayed. This only affects multi-site
  installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
