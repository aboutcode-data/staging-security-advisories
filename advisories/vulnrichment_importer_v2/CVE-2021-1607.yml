aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services
  Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attack against a user. These vulnerabilities exist because the web-based management
  interface does not sufficiently validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these
  vulnerabilities by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected
  interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit these vulnerabilities,
  the attacker would need valid administrative credentials.
