aliases: []
summary: Vite is a frontend tooling framework for javascript. The Vite dev server option `server.fs.deny`
  can be bypassed on case-insensitive file systems using case-augmented versions of filenames.
  Notably this affects servers hosted on Windows. This bypass is similar to CVE-2023-34092 --
  with surface area reduced to hosts having case-insensitive filesystems. Since `picomatch`
  defaults to case-sensitive glob matching, but the file server doesn't discriminate; a blacklist
  bypass is possible. By requesting raw filesystem paths using augmented casing, the matcher
  derived from `config.server.fs.deny` fails to block access to sensitive files. This issue
  has been addressed in vite@5.0.12, vite@4.5.2, vite@3.2.8, and vite@2.9.17. Users are advised
  to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should restrict access to dev servers.
