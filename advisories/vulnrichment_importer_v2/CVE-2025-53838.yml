aliases: []
summary: LinkAce is a self-hosted archive to collect website links. A stored cross-site scripting
  (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in versions prior to 2.1.9 that allows an attacker to inject
  arbitrary JavaScript, which is then executed in the context of a user's browser when the malicious
  link is clicked. This is a one-click XSS, meaning the victim only needs to click a crafted
  link — no further interaction is required. The application contains a stored XSS vulnerability
  due to insufficient filtering and escaping of user-supplied data inserted into link attributes.
  Malicious JavaScript code can be saved in the database along with the link and executed in
  the user’s browser when clicking the link, leading to arbitrary script execution within the
  context of the site. Version 2.1.9 fixes the issue.
