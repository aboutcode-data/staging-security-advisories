summary: "A vulnerability in an API of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker\
  \ with valid read-only credentials to obtain sensitive information, change node configurations,\
  \ and restart the node.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to a lack of authorization in a specific\
  \ API and improper validation of user-supplied data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by sending a crafted HTTP request to a specific API on the device. A successful exploit\
  \ could allow the attacker to attacker to obtain information, modify system configuration,\
  \ and reload the device.\r\nNote:&nbsp;To successfully exploit this vulnerability, the attacker\
  \ must have valid read-only administrative credentials. In a single-node deployment, new devices\
  \ will not be able to authenticate during the reload time."
