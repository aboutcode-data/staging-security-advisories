aliases: []
summary: The WP Post Author – Boost Your Blog&#039;s Engagement with Author Box, Social Links,
  Co-Authors, Guest Authors, Post Rating System, and Custom User Registration Form Builder plugin
  for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the linked_user_id parameter in
  all versions up to, and including, 3.8.1 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied
  parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to append additional
  SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information
  from the database.
