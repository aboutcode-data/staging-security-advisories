aliases: []
summary: The Booster for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
  due to missing file type validation in the validate_product_input_fields_on_add_to_cart function
  in versions 4.0.1 to 7.2.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload
  arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
