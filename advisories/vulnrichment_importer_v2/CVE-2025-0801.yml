aliases: []
summary: The RateMyAgent Official plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the 'rma-settings-wizard'. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update
  the plugin's API key via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
  performing an action such as clicking on a link.
