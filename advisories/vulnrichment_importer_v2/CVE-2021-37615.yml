aliases: []
summary: Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and
  modifying the metadata of image files. A null pointer dereference was found in Exiv2 versions
  v0.27.4 and earlier. The null pointer dereference is triggered when Exiv2 is used to print
  the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability
  to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted
  image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when printing the interpreted (translated)
  data, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation that requires an extra command line
  option (`-p t` or `-P t`). The bug is fixed in version v0.27.5.
