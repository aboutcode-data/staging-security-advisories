aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the anycast gateway feature of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow
  an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a device to learn invalid Address Resolution
  Protocol (ARP) entries. The ARP entries are for nonlocal IP addresses for the subnet. The
  vulnerability is due to improper validation of a received gratuitous ARP (GARP) request. An
  attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious GARP packet on the local
  subnet to cause the ARP table on the device to become corrupted. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to populate the ARP table with incorrect entries, which could lead to traffic
  disruptions.
