summary: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. Under certain scenarios, TensorFlow
  can fail to specialize a type during shape inference. This case is covered by the `DCHECK`
  function however, `DCHECK` is a no-op in production builds and an assertion failure in debug
  builds. In the first case execution proceeds to the `ValueOrDie` line. This results in an
  assertion failure as `ret` contains an error `Status`, not a value. In the second case we
  also get a crash due to the assertion failure. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0.
  We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, and TensorFlow 2.6.3, as these are
  also affected and still in supported range.
