  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  aio: Fix null ptr deref in aio_complete() wakeup

  list_del_init_careful() needs to be the last access to the wait queue
  entry - it effectively unlocks access.

  Previously, finish_wait() would see the empty list head and skip taking
  the lock, and then we'd return - but the completion path would still
  attempt to do the wakeup after the task_struct pointer had been
  overwritten.
