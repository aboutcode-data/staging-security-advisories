aliases: []
summary: The Wp cycle text announcement plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection
  via the 'cycle-text' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 8.1 due to insufficient
  escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing
  SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access
  and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used
  to extract sensitive information from the database.
