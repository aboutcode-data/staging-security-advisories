aliases: []
summary: 'The HT Mega – Absolute Addons For Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  DOM-Based Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s Countdown widget in all versions up
  to, and including, 2.8.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user
  supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses an injected page. NOTE: This vulnerability exists due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2024-3307.'
