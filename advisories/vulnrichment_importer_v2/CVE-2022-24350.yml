aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in IhisiSmm in Insyde InsydeH2O with kernel 5.0 through 5.5.
  IHISI function 0x17 verifies that the output buffer lies within the command buffer but does
  not verify that output data does not go beyond the end of the command buffer. In particular,
  the GetFlashTable function is called directly on the Command Buffer before the DataSize is
  check, leading to possible circumstances where the data immediately following the command
  buffer could be destroyed before returning a buffer size error.
