summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco BroadWorks Application\
  \ Delivery Platform could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site\
  \ scripting attack against a user of the interface.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because\
  \ the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker\
  \ could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted\
  \ link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in\
  \ the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information."
