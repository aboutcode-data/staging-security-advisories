aliases: []
summary: Malicious software running in a guest VM can exploit the buffer overflow to achieve
  code execution on the host in the bhyve userspace process, which typically runs as root. Note
  that bhyve runs in a Capsicum sandbox, so malicious code is constrained by the capabilities
  available to the bhyve process.
