summary: The Gutenberg Block Editor Toolkit – EditorsKit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'editorskit' shortcode in all versions up
  to, and including, 1.40.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user

  accesses an injected page.
