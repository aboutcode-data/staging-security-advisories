aliases: []
summary: Insufficient length checks in the ShapeShift KeepKey hardware wallet firmware before
  7.7.0 allow a global buffer overflow via crafted messages. Flaws in cf_confirmExecTx() in
  ethereum_contracts.c can be used to reveal arbitrary microcontroller memory on the device
  screen or crash the device. With physical access to a PIN-unlocked device, attackers can extract
  the BIP39 mnemonic secret from the hardware wallet.
