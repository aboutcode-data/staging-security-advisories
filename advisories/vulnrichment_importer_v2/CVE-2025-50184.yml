aliases: []
summary: DbGate is cross-platform database manager. In versions 6.4.3-premium-beta.5 and below,
  DbGate is vulnerable to a directory traversal flaw. The file parameter is not properly restricted
  to the intended uploads directory. As a result, the endpoint that lists files within the upload
  directory can be manipulated to access arbitrary files on the system. By supplying a crafted
  path to the file parameter, an attacker can read files outside the upload directory, potentially
  exposing sensitive system-level data. This is fixed in version 6.4.3-beta.8.
