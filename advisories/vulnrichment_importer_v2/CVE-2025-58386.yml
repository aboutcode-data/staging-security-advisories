aliases: []
summary: In Terminalfour 8 through 8.4.1.1, the userLevel parameter in the user management function
  is not subject to proper server-side authorization checks. A Power User can intercept and
  modify this parameter to assign the Administrator role to other existing lower-privileged
  accounts, or invite a new lower-privileged account and escalate its privileges. While manipulating
  this request, the Power User can also change the target account's password, effectively taking
  full control of it.
