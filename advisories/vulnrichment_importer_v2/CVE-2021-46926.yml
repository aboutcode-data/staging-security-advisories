  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ALSA: hda: intel-sdw-acpi: harden detection of controller

  The existing code currently sets a pointer to an ACPI handle before
  checking that it's actually a SoundWire controller. This can lead to
  issues where the graph walk continues and eventually fails, but the
  pointer was set already.

  This patch changes the logic so that the information provided to
  the caller is set when a controller is found.
