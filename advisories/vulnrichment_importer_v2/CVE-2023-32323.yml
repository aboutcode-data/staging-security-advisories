aliases: []
summary: Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by the Matrix.org
  Foundation. A malicious user on a Synapse homeserver X with permission to create certain state
  events can disable outbound federation from X to an arbitrary homeserver Y. Synapse instances
  with federation disabled are not affected. In versions of Synapse up to and including 1.73,
  Synapse did not limit the size of `invite_room_state`, meaning that it was possible to create
  an arbitrarily large invite event. Synapse 1.74 refuses to create oversized `invite_room_state`
  fields. Server operators should upgrade to Synapse 1.74 or newer urgently.
