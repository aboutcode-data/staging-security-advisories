aliases: []
summary: The image upload component allows SVG files and the regular expression used to remove
  script tags can be bypassed by using a Cross Site Scripting payload which does not match the
  regular expression; one example of this is the inclusion of whitespace within the script tag.
  An attacker must target an authenticated user with permissions to access this feature, however
  once uploaded the payload is also accessible to unauthenticated users.
