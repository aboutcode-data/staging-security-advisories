aliases: []
summary: "In Apache Cassandra it is possible for a local attacker without access\n to the Apache\
  \ Cassandra process or configuration files to manipulate \nthe RMI registry to perform a man-in-the-middle\
  \ attack and capture user \nnames and passwords used to access the JMX interface. The attacker\
  \ can \nthen use these credentials to access the JMX interface and perform \nunauthorized\
  \ operations.\n\n\nThis is same vulnerability that CVE-2020-13946 was issued for, but the\
  \ Java option was changed in JDK10.\n\n\nThis issue affects Apache Cassandra from 4.0.2 through\
  \ 5.0.2 running Java 11.\n\n\nOperators are recommended to upgrade to a release equal to or\
  \ later than 4.0.15, 4.1.8, or 5.0.3 which fixes the issue."
