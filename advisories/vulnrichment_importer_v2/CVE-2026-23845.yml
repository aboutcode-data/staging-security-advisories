aliases: []
summary: Mailpit is an email testing tool and API for developers. Versions prior to 1.28.3 are
  vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via HTML Check CSS Download. The HTML Check
  feature (`/api/v1/message/{ID}/html-check`) is designed to analyze HTML emails for compatibility.
  During this process, the `inlineRemoteCSS()` function automatically downloads CSS files from
  external `<link rel="stylesheet" href="...">` tags to inline them for testing. Version 1.28.3
  fixes the issue.
