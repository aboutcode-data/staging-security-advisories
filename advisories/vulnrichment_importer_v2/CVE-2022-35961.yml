aliases: []
summary: OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. The functions
  `ECDSA.recover` and `ECDSA.tryRecover` are vulnerable to a kind of signature malleability
  due to accepting EIP-2098 compact signatures in addition to the traditional 65 byte signature
  format. This is only an issue for the functions that take a single `bytes` argument, and not
  the functions that take `r, v, s` or `r, vs` as separate arguments. The potentially affected
  contracts are those that implement signature reuse or replay protection by marking the signature
  itself as used rather than the signed message or a nonce included in it. A user may take a
  signature that has already been submitted, submit it again in a different form, and bypass
  this protection. The issue has been patched in 4.7.3.
