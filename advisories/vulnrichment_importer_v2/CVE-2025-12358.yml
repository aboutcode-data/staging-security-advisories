aliases: []
summary: The ShopEngine Elementor WooCommerce Builder Addon plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.8.5. This is due to
  missing nonce validation on the "post_add_to_list" function as well as an incorrect permissions
  callback in the "Api/init" function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to add or remove products from a user's wishlist via a forged request granted they can trick
  a site's user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
