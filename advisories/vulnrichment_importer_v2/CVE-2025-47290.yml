aliases: []
summary: containerd is a container runtime. A time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability
  was found in containerd v2.1.0. While unpacking an image during an image pull, specially crafted
  container images could arbitrarily modify the host file system. The only affected version
  of containerd is 2.1.0.  Other versions of containerd are not affected. This bug has been
  fixed in containerd 2.1.1. Users should update to this version to resolve the issue. As a
  workaround, ensure that only trusted images are used and that only trusted users have permissions
  to import images.
