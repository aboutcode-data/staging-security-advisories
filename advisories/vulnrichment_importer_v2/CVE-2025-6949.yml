aliases: []
summary: An Execution with Unnecessary Privileges vulnerability has been identified in Moxa’s
  network security appliances and routers. A critical authorization flaw in the API allows an
  authenticated, low-privileged user to create a new administrator account, including accounts
  with usernames identical to existing users. In certain scenarios, this vulnerability could
  allow an attacker to gain full administrative control over the affected device, leading to
  potential account impersonation. While successful exploitation can severely impact the confidentiality,
  integrity, and availability of the affected device itself, there is no loss of confidentiality
  or integrity within any subsequent systems.
