aliases: []
summary: Guzzle, an extensible PHP HTTP client. `Authorization` and `Cookie` headers on requests
  are sensitive information. In affected versions on making a request which responds with a
  redirect to a URI with a different port, if we choose to follow it, we should remove the `Authorization`
  and `Cookie` headers from the request, before containing. Previously, we would only consider
  a change in host or scheme. Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.5 as soon
  as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.8
  or 7.4.5. Note that a partial fix was implemented in Guzzle 7.4.2, where a change in host
  would trigger removal of the curl-added Authorization header, however this earlier fix did
  not cover change in scheme or change in port. An alternative approach would be to use your
  own redirect middleware, rather than ours, if you are unable to upgrade. If you do not require
  or expect redirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects all together.
