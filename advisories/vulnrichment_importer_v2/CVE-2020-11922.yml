aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in WiZ Colors A60 1.14.0. The device sends unnecessary information
  to the cloud controller server. Although this information is sent encrypted and has low risk
  in isolation, it decreases the privacy of the end user. The information sent includes the
  local IP address being used and the SSID of the Wi-Fi network the device is connected to.
  (Various resources such as wigle.net can be use for mapping of SSIDs to physical locations.)
