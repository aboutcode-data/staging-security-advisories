summary: The tagDiv Composer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 5.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation

  to inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
