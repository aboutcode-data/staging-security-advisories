aliases: []
summary: The Linux kernel NFSD implementation prior to versions 5.19.17 and 6.0.2 are vulnerable
  to buffer overflow. NFSD tracks the number of pages held by each NFSD thread by combining
  the receive and send buffers of a remote procedure call (RPC) into a single array of pages.
  A client can force the send buffer to shrink by sending an RPC message over TCP with garbage
  data added at the end of the message. The RPC message with garbage data is still correctly
  formed according to the specification and is passed forward to handlers. Vulnerable code in
  NFSD is not expecting the oversized request and writes beyond the allocated buffer space.
