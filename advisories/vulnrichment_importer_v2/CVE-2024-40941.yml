aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: don't read past the mfuart notifcation

  In case the firmware sends a notification that claims it has more data
  than it has, we will read past that was allocated for the notification.
  Remove the print of the buffer, we won't see it by default. If needed,
  we can see the content with tracing.

  This was reported by KFENCE.
