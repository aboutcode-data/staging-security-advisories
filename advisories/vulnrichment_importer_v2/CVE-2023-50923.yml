aliases: []
summary: 'In QUIC in RFC 9000, the Latency Spin Bit specification (section 17.4) does not strictly
  constrain the bit value when the feature is disabled, which might allow remote attackers to
  construct a covert channel with data represented as changes to the bit value. NOTE: The "Sheridan,
  S., Keane, A. (2015). In Proceedings of the 14th European Conference on Cyber Warfare and
  Security (ECCWS), University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, UK." paper says "Modern Internet
  communication protocols provide an almost infinite number of ways in which data can be hidden
  or embed whithin seemingly normal network traffic."'
