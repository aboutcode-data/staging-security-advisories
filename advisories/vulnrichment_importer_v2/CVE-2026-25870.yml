aliases: []
summary: DoraCMS version 3.1 and prior contains a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability
  in its UEditor remote image fetch functionality. The application accepts user-supplied URLs
  and performs server-side HTTP or HTTPS requests without sufficient validation or destination
  restrictions. The implementation does not enforce allowlists, block internal or private IP
  address ranges, or apply request timeouts or response size limits. An attacker can abuse this
  behavior to induce the server to issue outbound requests to arbitrary hosts, including internal
  network resources, potentially enabling internal network scanning and denial of service through
  resource exhaustion.
