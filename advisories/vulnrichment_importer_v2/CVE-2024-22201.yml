aliases: []
summary: Jetty is a Java based web server and servlet engine. An HTTP/2 SSL connection that
  is established and TCP congested will be leaked when it times out. An attacker can cause many
  connections to end up in this state, and the server may run out of file descriptors, eventually
  causing the server to stop accepting new connections from valid clients. The vulnerability
  is patched in 9.4.54, 10.0.20, 11.0.20, and 12.0.6.
