aliases: []
summary: The WP Quick FrontEnd Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
  Scripting in versions up to, and including, 5.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and
  output escaping on the 'save_content_front' function that uses print_r on the user-supplied
  $_REQUEST values . This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary
  web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an
  action such as clicking on a link.
