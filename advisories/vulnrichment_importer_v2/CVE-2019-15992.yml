aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the implementation of the Lua interpreter integrated in Cisco Adaptive
  Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could
  allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on
  the underlying Linux operating system of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  restrictions on the allowed Lua function calls within the context of user-supplied Lua scripts.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a heap overflow condition and execute
  arbitrary code with root privileges on the underlying Linux operating system of an affected
  device.
