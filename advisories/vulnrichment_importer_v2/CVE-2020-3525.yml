summary: "A vulnerability in the Admin portal of Cisco&nbsp;Identity Services Engine (ISE) could\
  \ allow an authenticated, remote attacker to recover service account passwords that are saved\
  \ on an affected system.\r\nThe vulnerability is due to the incorrect inclusion of saved passwords\
  \ when loading configuration pages in the Admin portal. An attacker with read or write access\
  \ to the Admin portal could exploit this vulnerability by browsing to a page that contains\
  \ sensitive data. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to recover passwords and expose\
  \ those accounts to further attack.Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.\
  \ There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
