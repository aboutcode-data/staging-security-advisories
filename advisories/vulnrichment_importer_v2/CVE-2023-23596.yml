aliases: []
summary: 'jc21 NGINX Proxy Manager through 2.9.19 allows OS command injection. When creating
  an access list, the backend builds an htpasswd file with crafted username and/or password
  input that is concatenated without any validation, and is directly passed to the exec command,
  potentially allowing an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system.
  NOTE: this is not part of any NGINX software shipped by F5.'
