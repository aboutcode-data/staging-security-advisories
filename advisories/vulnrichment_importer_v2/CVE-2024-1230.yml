aliases: []
summary: The SimpleShop plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in
  all versions up to, and including, 2.10.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the maybe_disconnect_simpleshop function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to disconnect the site from simpleshop via a forged request granted they can trick a site
  administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
