aliases: []
summary: Lite XL versions 2.1.8 and prior automatically execute the .lite_project.lua file when
  opening a project directory, without prompting the user for confirmation. The .lite_project.lua
  file is intended for project-specific configuration but can contain executable Lua logic.
  This behavior could allow execution of untrusted Lua code if a user opens a malicious project,
  potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the Lite XL process.
