aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the web interface of the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA)
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly,
  resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. It is also possible on certain software
  releases that the ASA will not reload, but an attacker could view sensitive system information
  without authentication by using directory traversal techniques. The vulnerability is due to
  lack of proper input validation of the HTTP URL. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker
  to cause a DoS condition or unauthenticated disclosure of information. This vulnerability
  applies to IPv4 and IPv6 HTTP traffic. This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software and Cisco
  Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software that is running on the following Cisco products: 3000
  Series Industrial Security Appliance (ISA), ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall, ASA 5500 Series Adaptive
  Security Appliances, ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls, ASA Services Module for
  Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers, Adaptive Security Virtual
  Appliance (ASAv), Firepower 2100 Series Security Appliance, Firepower 4100 Series Security
  Appliance, Firepower 9300 ASA Security Module, FTD Virtual (FTDv). Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvi16029.'
