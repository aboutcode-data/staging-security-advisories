aliases: []
summary: A client-side security misconfiguration vulnerability exists in OpenBlow whistleblowing
  platform across multiple versions and default deployments, due to the absence of critical
  HTTP response headers including Content-Security-Policy, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy,
  Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy, and Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy. This omission weakens browser-level
  defenses and exposes users to cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and referer leakage.
  Although some instances attempt to enforce CSP via HTML <meta> tags, this method is ineffective,
  as modern browsers rely on header-based enforcement to reliably block inline scripts and untrusted
  resources.
