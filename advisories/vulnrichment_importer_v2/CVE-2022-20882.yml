aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business
  RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to
  execute arbitrary code on an affected device or cause the device to restart unexpectedly,
  resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient
  validation of user fields within incoming HTTP packets. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities
  by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device with root-level privileges
  or to cause the device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. To exploit these
  vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have valid Administrator credentials on the affected
  device. Cisco has not released software updates that address these vulnerabilities.
