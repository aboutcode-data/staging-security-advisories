summary: The Zox News - Professional WordPress News & Magazine Theme plugin for WordPress is
  vulnerable to unauthorized data modification. This vulnerability can lead to privilege escalation
  and denial of service conditions due to missing capability checks on the backup_options()
  and reset_options() functions in all versions up to and including 3.17.0. This vulnerability
  allows authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access and above to update and delete
  arbitrary option values on the WordPress site. Attackers can exploit this issue to update
  the default user role for registration to Administrator and enable user registration, thereby
  gaining administrative access to the vulnerable site. Additionally, they could delete critical
  options, causing errors that may disrupt the site's functionality and deny service to legitimate
  users.
