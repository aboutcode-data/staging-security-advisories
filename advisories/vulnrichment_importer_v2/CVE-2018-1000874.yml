aliases: []
summary: 'PHP cebe markdown parser version 1.2.0 and earlier contains a Cross Site Scripting
  (XSS) vulnerability in all distributed parsers allowing a malicious crafted script to be executed
  that can result in the lose of user data and sensitive user information. This attack can be
  exploited by crafting a three backtick wrapped payload with a character in front: L: "```<script>alert();</script>```".
  NOTE: This has been argued as a non-issue (see references) since it is not the parser''s job
  to sanitize malicious code from a parsed document'
