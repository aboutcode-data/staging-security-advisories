aliases: []
summary: Grav is a file-based Web platform. Prior to 1.8.0-beta.27, when a user with privilege
  of user creation creates a new user through the Admin UI and supplies a username containing
  path traversal sequences (for example ..\Nijat or ../Nijat), Grav writes the account YAML
  file to an unintended path outside user/accounts/. The written YAML can contain account fields
  such as email, fullname, twofa_secret, and hashed_password. This vulnerability is fixed in
  1.8.0-beta.27.
