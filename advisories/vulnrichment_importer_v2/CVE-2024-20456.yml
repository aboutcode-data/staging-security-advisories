summary: "A vulnerability in the boot process of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an authenticated,\
  \ local attacker with high privileges to bypass the Cisco Secure Boot functionality and load\
  \ unverified software on an affected device. To exploit this successfully, the attacker must\
  \ have root-system privileges on the affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to an\
  \ error in the software build process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating\
  \ the system&rsquo;s configuration options to bypass some of the integrity checks that are\
  \ performed during the booting process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to control\
  \ the boot configuration, which could enable them to bypass of the requirement to run Cisco\
  \ signed images or alter the security properties of the running system."
