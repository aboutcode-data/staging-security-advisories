aliases: []
summary: The Jeg Elementor Kit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the Testimonial Widget Attributes in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.3 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with contributor access or higher, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute
  whenever a user accesses an injected page. CVE-2024-32721 is likely a duplicate of this issue.
