  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  iwlwifi: fix use-after-free

  If no firmware was present at all (or, presumably, all of the
  firmware files failed to parse), we end up unbinding by calling
  device_release_driver(), which calls remove(), which then in
  iwlwifi calls iwl_drv_stop(), freeing the 'drv' struct. However
  the new code I added will still erroneously access it after it
  was freed.

  Set 'failure=false' in this case to avoid the access, all data
  was already freed anyway.
