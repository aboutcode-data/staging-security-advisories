aliases: []
summary: In lunary-ai/lunary versions <=v1.2.11, an attacker can bypass email validation by
  using a dot character ('.') in the email address. This allows the creation of multiple accounts
  with essentially the same email address (e.g., 'attacker123@gmail.com' and 'attacker.123@gmail.com'),
  leading to incorrect synchronization and potential security issues.
