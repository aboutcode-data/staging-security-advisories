aliases: []
summary: 'A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability has been identified in the JavaScript library
  microlight version 0.0.7, a lightweight syntax highlighting library. When processing elements
  with non-standard CSS color values, the library fails to validate the result of a regular
  expression match before accessing its properties, leading to an uncaught TypeError and potential
  application crash. NOTE: this is disputed by multiple parties because there is no common scenario
  in which an adversary can insert those non-standard values.'
