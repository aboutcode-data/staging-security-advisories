aliases: []
summary: The Ultimate Member – User Profile, Registration, Login, Member Directory, Content
  Restriction & Membership Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the plugin's 'um_loggedin' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.6 due to
  insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject
  arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
