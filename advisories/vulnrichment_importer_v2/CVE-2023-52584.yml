  spmi: mediatek: Fix UAF on device remove

  The pmif driver data that contains the clocks is allocated along with
  spmi_controller.
  On device remove, spmi_controller will be freed first, and then devres
  , including the clocks, will be cleanup.
  This leads to UAF because putting the clocks will access the clocks in
  the pmif driver data, which is already freed along with spmi_controller.

  This can be reproduced by enabling DEBUG_TEST_DRIVER_REMOVE and
  building the kernel with KASAN.

  Fix the UAF issue by using unmanaged clk_bulk_get() and putting the
  clocks before freeing spmi_controller.
