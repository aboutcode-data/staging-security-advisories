aliases: []
summary: 'Multiple vulnerabilities in Oracle Java 7 before Update 11 allow remote attackers
  to execute arbitrary code by (1) using the public getMBeanInstantiator method in the JmxMBeanServer
  class to obtain a reference to a private MBeanInstantiator object, then retrieving arbitrary
  Class references using the findClass method, and (2) using the Reflection API with recursion
  in a way that bypasses a security check by the java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup.checkSecurityManager
  method due to the inability of the sun.reflect.Reflection.getCallerClass method to skip frames
  related to the new reflection API, as exploited in the wild in January 2013, as demonstrated
  by Blackhole and Nuclear Pack, and a different vulnerability than CVE-2012-4681 and CVE-2012-3174.
  NOTE: some parties have mapped the recursive Reflection API issue to CVE-2012-3174, but CVE-2012-3174
  is for a different vulnerability whose details are not public as of 20130114.  CVE-2013-0422
  covers both the JMX/MBean and Reflection API issues.  NOTE: it was originally reported that
  Java 6 was also vulnerable, but the reporter has retracted this claim, stating that Java 6
  is not exploitable because the relevant code is called in a way that does not bypass security
  checks.  NOTE: as of 20130114, a reliable third party has claimed that the findClass/MBeanInstantiator
  vector was not fixed in Oracle Java 7 Update 11.  If there is still a vulnerable condition,
  then a separate CVE identifier might be created for the unfixed issue.'
