aliases: []
summary: A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the /publix/run
  endpoint of JATOS 3.7.1 through 3.9.6 (inclusive). This allows remote attackers to execute
  arbitrary JavaScript in a user's web browser by including a malicious payload in the "code"
  URL parameter. When an authenticated admin user accesses the study's URL, the malicious script
  gets interpreted and executes within their browser, which can lead to unauthorized actions,
  account compromise, and privilege escalation.
