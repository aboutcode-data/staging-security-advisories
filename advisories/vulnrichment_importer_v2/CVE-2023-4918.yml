aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in the Keycloak package, more specifically org.keycloak.userprofile.
  When a user registers itself through registration flow, the "password" and "password-confirm"
  field from the form will occur as regular user attributes. All users and clients with proper
  rights and roles are able to read users attributes, allowing a malicious user with minimal
  access to retrieve the users passwords in clear text, jeopardizing their environment.
