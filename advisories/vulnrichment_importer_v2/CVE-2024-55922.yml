aliases: []
summary: 'TYPO3 is a free and open source Content Management Framework. A vulnerability has
  been identified in the backend user interface functionality involving deep links. Specifically,
  this functionality is susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Additionally, state-changing
  actions in downstream components incorrectly accepted submissions via HTTP GET and did not
  enforce the appropriate HTTP method. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires
  the victim to have an active session on the backend user interface and to be deceived into
  interacting with a malicious URL targeting the backend, which can occur under the following
  conditions: The user opens a malicious link, such as one sent via email. The user visits a
  compromised or manipulated website while the following settings are misconfigured: 1. `security.backend.enforceReferrer`
  feature is disabled, 2. `BE/cookieSameSite` configuration is set to lax or none The vulnerability
  in the affected downstream component “Form Framework Module” allows attackers to manipulate
  or delete persisted form definitions. Users are advised to update to TYPO3 versions 11.5.42
  ELTS, 12.4.25 LTS, 13.4.3 LTS which fix the problem described. There are no known workarounds
  for this vulnerability.'
