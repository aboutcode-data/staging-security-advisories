aliases: []
summary: 'Shield is an authentication and authorization framework for CodeIgniter 4. This vulnerability
  may allow [SameSite Attackers](https://canitakeyoursubdomain.name/) to bypass the [CodeIgniter4
  CSRF protection](https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/libraries/security.html) mechanism
  with CodeIgniter Shield. For this attack to succeed, the attacker must have direct (or indirect,
  e.g., XSS) control over a subdomain site (e.g., `https://a.example.com/`) of the target site
  (e.g., `http://example.com/`). Upgrade to **CodeIgniter v4.2.3 or later** and **Shield v1.0.0-beta.2
  or later**. As a workaround: set `Config\Security::$csrfProtection` to `''session,''`remove
  old session data right after login (immediately after ID and password match) and regenerate
  CSRF token right after login (immediately after ID and password match)'
