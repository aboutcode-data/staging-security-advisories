summary: Mailpit is an email testing tool and API for developers. Versions 1.28.0 and below
  have a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the /proxy endpoint, allowing attackers
  to make requests to internal network resources. The /proxy endpoint validates http:// and
  https:// schemes, but it does not block internal IP addresses, enabling attackers to access
  internal services and APIs. This vulnerability is limited to HTTP GET requests with minimal
  headers. The issue is fixed in version 1.28.1.
