aliases: []
summary: In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability
  exists where account recovery hashes of users are inadvertently exposed to unauthorized actors.
  This issue occurs when authenticated users inspect responses from `GET /v1/users/me` and `GET
  /v1/users/me/org` endpoints. The exposed account recovery hashes, while not directly related
  to user passwords, represent sensitive information that should not be accessible to unauthorized
  parties. Exposing these hashes could potentially facilitate account recovery attacks or other
  malicious activities. The vulnerability was addressed in version 1.2.6.
