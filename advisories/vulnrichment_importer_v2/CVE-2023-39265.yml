aliases: []
summary: Apache Superset would allow for SQLite database connections to be incorrectly registered
  when an attacker uses alternative driver names like sqlite+pysqlite or by using database imports.
  This could allow for unexpected file creation on Superset webservers. Additionally, if Apache
  Superset is using a SQLite database for its metadata (not advised for production use) it could
  result in more severe vulnerabilities related to confidentiality and integrity. This vulnerability
  exists in Apache Superset versions up to and including 2.1.0.
