aliases: []
summary: Sing-box is an open source proxy system. Affected versions are subject to an authentication
  bypass when specially crafted requests are sent to sing-box. This affects all SOCKS5 inbounds
  with user authentication and an attacker may be able to bypass authentication. Users are advised
  to update to sing-box 1.4.4 or to 1.5.0-rc.4. Users unable to update should not expose the
  SOCKS5 inbound to insecure environments.
