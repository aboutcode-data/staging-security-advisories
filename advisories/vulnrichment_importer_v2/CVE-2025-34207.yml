aliases: []
summary: 'Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host prior to 22.0.1049 and
  Application prior to 20.0.2786 (VA and SaaS deployments) configure the SSH client within Docker
  instances with the following options: `UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null`, `StrictHostKeyChecking=no`,
  and `ForwardAgent yes`.  These settings disable verification of the remote host’s SSH key
  and automatically forward the developer’s SSH‑agent to any host that matches the configured
  wildcard patterns.  As a result, an attacker who can reach a single compromised container
  can cause the container to connect to a malicious SSH server, capture the forwarded private
  keys, and use those keys for unrestricted lateral movement across the environment. This vulnerability
  has been identified by the vendor as: V-2024-027 — Insecure Secure Shell (SSH) Configuration.'
