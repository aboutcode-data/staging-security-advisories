summary: "KNIME Business Hub is affected by the Ingress-nginx CVE-2025-1974 ( a.k.a IngressNightmare\
  \ ) vulnerability which affects the ingress-nginx component. In the worst case a complete\
  \ takeover of the Kubernetes cluster is possible. Since the affected component is only reachable\
  \ from within the cluster, i.e. requires an authenticated user, the severity in the context\
  \ of KNIME Business Hub is slightly lower.\n\n\n\nBesides applying the publicly known workarounds,\
  \ we strongly recommend updating to one of the following versions of KNIME Business Hub: \n\
  \n\n\n  *  1.13.3 or above \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  *  1.12.4 or above \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  *  1.11.4 or\
  \ above \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  *  1.10.4 or above\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  *"
