aliases: []
summary: tgstation-server is a toolset to manage production BYOND servers. Starting in version
  4.7.0 and prior to 5.12.1, instance users with the list chat bots permission can read chat
  bot connections strings without the associated permission. This issue is patched in version
  5.12.1. As a workaround, remove the list chat bots permission from users that should not have
  the ability to view connection strings. Invalidate any credentials previously stored for safety.
