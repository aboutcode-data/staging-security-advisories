aliases: []
summary: ScratchTools is a web extension designed to make interacting with the Scratch programming
  language community (Scratching) easier. In affected versions anybody who uses the Recently
  Viewed Projects feature is vulnerable to having their account taken over if they view a project
  that tries to. The issue is that if a user visits a project that includes Javascript in the
  title, then when the Recently Viewed Projects feature displays it, it could run the Javascript.
  This issue has been addressed in the 2.5.2 release. Users having issues scratching should
  open an issue in the project issue tracker https://github.com/STForScratch/ScratchTools/
