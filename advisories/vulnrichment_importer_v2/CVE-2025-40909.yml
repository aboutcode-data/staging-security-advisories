aliases: []
summary: "Perl threads have a working directory race condition where file operations may target\
  \ unintended paths.\n\nIf a directory handle is open at thread creation, the process-wide\
  \ current working directory is temporarily changed in order to clone that handle for the new\
  \ thread, which is visible from any third (or more) thread already running. \n\nThis may lead\
  \ to unintended operations such as loading code or accessing files from unexpected locations, which\
  \ a local attacker may be able to exploit.\n\nThe bug was introduced in commit 11a11ecf4bea72b17d250cfb43c897be1341861e\
  \ and released in Perl version 5.13.6"
