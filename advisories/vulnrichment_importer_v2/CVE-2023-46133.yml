aliases: []
summary: CryptoES is a cryptography algorithms library compatible with ES6 and TypeScript. Prior
  to version 2.1.0, CryptoES PBKDF2 is 1,000 times weaker than originally specified in 1993,
  and at least 1,300,000 times weaker than current industry standard. This is because it both
  defaults to SHA1, a cryptographic hash algorithm considered insecure since at least 2005,
  and defaults to one single iteration, a 'strength' or 'difficulty' value specified at 1,000
  when specified in 1993. PBKDF2 relies on iteration count as a countermeasure to preimage and
  collision attacks. If used to protect passwords, the impact is high. If used to generate signatures,
  the impact is high. Version 2.1.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, configure
  CryptoES to use SHA256 with at least 250,000 iterations.
