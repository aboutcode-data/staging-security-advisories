summary: UmbracoIdentityExtensions is an Umbraco add-on package that enables easy extensibility
  points for ASP.Net Identity integration. In affected versions client secrets are not required
  which may expose some endpoints to untrusted actors. Since Umbraco is not a single-page application,
  the implicit flow is not safe. For traditional MVC applications, it is recommended to use
  the authorization code flow, which requires the client to authenticate with the authorization
  server using a client secret. This flow provides better security, as it involves exchanging
  an authorization code for an access token and/or ID token, rather than directly returning
  tokens in the URL fragment. This issue has been patched in commit `e792429f9` and a release
  to Nuget is pending. Users are advised to upgrade when possible.
