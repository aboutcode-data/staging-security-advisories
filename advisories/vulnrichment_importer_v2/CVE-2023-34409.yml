aliases: []
summary: In Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) server 2.x before 2.37.1, the authenticate
  function in auth_server.go does not properly formalize and sanitize URL paths to reject path
  traversal attempts. This allows an unauthenticated remote user, when a crafted POST request
  is made against unauthenticated API routes, to access otherwise protected API routes leading
  to escalation of privileges and information disclosure.
