aliases: []
summary: CryptPad is a collaboration suite. Prior to version 2025.3.0, enforcement of Two-Factor
  Authentication (2FA) in CryptPad can be trivially bypassed, due to weak implementation of
  access controls. An attacker that compromises a user's credentials can gain access to the
  victim's account, even if the victim has 2FA set up. This is due to 2FA not being enforced
  if the path parameter is not 44 characters long, which can be bypassed by simply URL encoding
  a single character in the path. This issue has been patched in version 2025.3.0.
