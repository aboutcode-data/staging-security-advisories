aliases: []
summary: "The WordPress Comments Import & Export plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized\
  \ modification of data due to a missing capability check on the save_settings function in\
  \ all versions up to, and including, 2.4.3. Additionally, the plugin fails to properly sanitize\
  \ and escape FTP settings parameters. \r\nThis makes it possible for authenticated attackers,\
  \ with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts on the plugin settings\
  \ page that will execute whenever an administrative user accesses an injected page.\r\nThe\
  \ vulnerability was partially fixed in version 2.4.3 and fully fixed in version 2.4.4"
