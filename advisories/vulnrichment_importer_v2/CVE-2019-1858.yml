aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) input packet processor
  of Cisco FXOS Software and Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to cause the SNMP application to leak system memory, which could cause an affected device
  to restart unexpectedly. The vulnerability is due to improper error handling when processing
  inbound SNMP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple crafted
  SNMP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause
  the SNMP application to leak system memory because of an improperly handled error condition
  during packet processing. Over time, this memory leak could cause the SNMP application to
  restart multiple times, leading to a system-level restart and a denial of service (DoS) condition.
