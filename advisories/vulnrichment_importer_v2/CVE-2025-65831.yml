aliases: []
summary: The application uses an insecure hashing algorithm (MD5) to hash passwords. If an attacker
  obtained a copy of these hashes, either through exploiting cloud services, performing TLS
  downgrade attacks on the traffic from a mobile device, or through another means, they may
  be able to crack the hash in a reasonable amount of time and gain unauthorized access to the
  victim's account.
