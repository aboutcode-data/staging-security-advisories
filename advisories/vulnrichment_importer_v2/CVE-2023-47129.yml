summary: Statmic is a core Laravel content management system Composer package. Prior to versions
  3.4.13 and 4.33.0, on front-end forms with an asset upload field, PHP files crafted to look
  like images may be uploaded. This only affects forms using the "Forms" feature and not just
  _any_ arbitrary form. This does not affect the control panel. This issue has been patched
  in 3.4.13 and 4.33.0.
