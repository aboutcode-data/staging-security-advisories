aliases: []
summary: Chall-Manager is a platform-agnostic system able to start Challenges on Demand of a
  player. When decoding a scenario (i.e. a zip archive), the path of the file to write is not
  checked, potentially leading to zip slips. Exploitation does not require authentication nor
  authorization, so anyone can exploit it. It should nonetheless not be exploitable as it is
  highly recommended to bury Chall-Manager deep within the infrastructure due to its large capabilities,
  so no users could reach the system. Patch has been implemented by commit 47d188f and shipped
  in v0.1.4.
