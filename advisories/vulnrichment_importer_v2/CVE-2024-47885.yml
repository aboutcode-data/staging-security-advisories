aliases: []
summary: The Astro web framework has a DOM Clobbering gadget in the client-side router starting
  in version 3.0.0 and prior to version 4.16.1. It can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) in
  websites enables Astro's client-side routing and has *stored* attacker-controlled scriptless
  HTML elements (i.e., `iframe` tags with unsanitized `name` attributes) on the destination
  pages. This vulnerability can result in cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on websites that
  built with Astro that enable the client-side routing with `ViewTransitions` and store the
  user-inserted scriptless HTML tags without properly sanitizing the `name` attributes on the
  page. Version 4.16.1 contains a patch for this issue.
