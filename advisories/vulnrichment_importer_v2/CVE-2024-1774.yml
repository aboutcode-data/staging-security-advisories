aliases: []
summary: The Customily Product Personalizer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via user cookies in all versions up to, and including, 1.23.3 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page. We unfortunately could not get in touch with the vendor through various means to disclose
  this issue.
