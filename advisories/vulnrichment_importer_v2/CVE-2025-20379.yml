datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2025/20xxx/CVE-2025-20379.json
aliases: []
summary: In Splunk Enterprise versions below 10.0.1, 9.4.5, 9.3.7, and 9.2.9 and Splunk Cloud
  Platform versions below 9.3.2411.116, 9.3.2408.124, 10.0.2503.5 and 10.1.2507.1, a low-privileged
  user that does not hold the “admin“ or “power“ Splunk roles could run a saved search with
  a risky command using the permissions of a higher-privileged user to bypass the SPL safeguards
  for risky commands. They could bypass these safeguards on the “/services/streams/search“ endpoint
  through its “q“ parameter by circumventing endpoint restrictions using character encoding
  in the REST path. The vulnerability requires the attacker to phish the victim by tricking
  them into initiating a request within their browser. The authenticated user should not be
  able to exploit the vulnerability at will.
