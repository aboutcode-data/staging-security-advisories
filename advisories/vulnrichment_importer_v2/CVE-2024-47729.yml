  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/xe: Use reserved copy engine for user binds on faulting devices

  User binds map to engines with can fault, faults depend on user binds
  completion, thus we can deadlock. Avoid this by using reserved copy
  engine for user binds on faulting devices.

  While we are here, normalize bind queue creation with a helper.

  v2:
   - Pass in extensions to bind queue creation (CI)
  v3:
   - s/resevered/reserved (Lucas)
   - Fix NULL hwe check (Jonathan)
