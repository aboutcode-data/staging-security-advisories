aliases: []
summary: InstallBuilder Qt installers built with versions previous to 22.10 try to load DLLs
  from the installer binary parent directory when displaying popups. This may allow an attacker
  to plant a malicious DLL in the installer parent directory to allow executing code with the
  privileges of the installer (when the popup triggers the loading of the library). Exploiting
  these type of vulnerabilities generally require that an attacker has access to a vulnerable
  machine to plant the malicious DLL.
