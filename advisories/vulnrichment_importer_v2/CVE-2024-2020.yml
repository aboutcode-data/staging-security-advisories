aliases: []
summary: The Calculated Fields Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the form page href parameter in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.56 due
  to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
  an injected page. Exploitation requires the professional version or higher.
