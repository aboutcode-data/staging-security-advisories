summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  power: supply: axp288_fuel_gauge: Fix external_power_changed race

  fuel_gauge_external_power_changed() dereferences info->bat,
  which gets sets in axp288_fuel_gauge_probe() like this:

    info->bat = devm_power_supply_register(dev, &fuel_gauge_desc, &psy_cfg);

  As soon as devm_power_supply_register() has called device_add()
  the external_power_changed callback can get called. So there is a window
  where fuel_gauge_external_power_changed() may get called while
  info->bat has not been set yet leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

  Fixing this is easy. The external_power_changed callback gets passed
  the power_supply which will eventually get stored in info->bat,
  so fuel_gauge_external_power_changed() can simply directly use
  the passed in psy argument which is always valid.
