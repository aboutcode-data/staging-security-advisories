  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  can: isotp: fix potential CAN frame reception race in isotp_rcv()

  When receiving a CAN frame the current code logic does not consider
  concurrently receiving processes which do not show up in real world
  usage.

  The following syz problem is one of the scenarios. so->rx.len is
  changed by isotp_rcv_ff() during isotp_rcv_cf(), so->rx.len equals
  0 before alloc_skb() and equals 4096 after alloc_skb(). That will
  trigger skb_over_panic() in skb_put().

  Therefore we make sure the state changes and data structures stay
  consistent at CAN frame reception time by adding a spin_lock in
  isotp_rcv(). This fixes the issue reported by syzkaller but does not
  affect real world operation.
