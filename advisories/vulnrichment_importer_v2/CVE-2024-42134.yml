  virtio-pci: Check if is_avq is NULL

  [bug]
  In the virtio_pci_common.c function vp_del_vqs, vp_dev->is_avq is involved
  to determine whether it is admin virtqueue, but this function vp_dev->is_avq
   may be empty. For installations, virtio_pci_legacy does not assign a value
   to vp_dev->is_avq.

  [fix]
  Check whether it is vp_dev->is_avq before use.

  [test]
  Test with virsh Attach device
  Before this patch, the following command would crash the guest system
