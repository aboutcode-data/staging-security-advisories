aliases: []
summary: 'Spin is the developer tool for building and running serverless applications powered
  by WebAssembly. Prior to 2.4.3, some specifically configured Spin applications that use `self`
  requests without a specified URL authority can be induced to make requests to arbitrary hosts
  via the `Host` HTTP header. The following conditions need to be met for an application to
  be vulnerable: 1. The environment Spin is deployed in routes requests to the Spin runtime
  based on the request URL instead of the `Host` header, and leaves the `Host` header set to
  its original value; 2. The Spin application''s component handling the incoming request is
  configured with an `allow_outbound_hosts` list containing `"self"`; and 3. In reaction to
  an incoming request, the component makes an outbound request whose URL doesn''t include the
  hostname/port. Spin 2.4.3 has been released to fix this issue.'
