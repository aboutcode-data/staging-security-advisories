aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the AppNav-XE feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS)
  condition. This vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of certain TCP segments. An
  attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a stream of crafted TCP traffic at a
  high rate through an interface of an affected device. That interface would need to have AppNav
  interception enabled. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to
  reload.
