aliases: []
summary: A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the RequestsToolkit component
  of the langchain-community package (specifically, langchain_community.agent_toolkits.openapi.toolkit.RequestsToolkit)
  in langchain-ai/langchain version 0.0.27. This vulnerability occurs because the toolkit does
  not enforce restrictions on requests to remote internet addresses, allowing it to also access
  local addresses. As a result, an attacker could exploit this flaw to perform port scans, access
  local services, retrieve instance metadata from cloud environments (e.g., Azure, AWS), and
  interact with servers on the local network. This issue has been fixed in version 0.0.28.
