aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Google Cloud Platform's guest-oslogin versions between 20190304
  and 20200507 allows a user that is only granted the role "roles/compute.osLogin" to escalate
  privileges to root. Using their membership to the "docker" group, an attacker with this role
  is able to run docker and mount the host OS. Within docker, it is possible to modify the host
  OS filesystem and modify /etc/groups to gain administrative privileges. All images created
  after 2020-May-07 (20200507) are fixed, and if you cannot update, we recommend you edit /etc/group/security.conf
  and remove the "docker" user from the OS Login entry.
