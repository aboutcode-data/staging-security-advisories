  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/xe: prevent UAF around preempt fence

  The fence lock is part of the queue, therefore in the current design
  anything locking the fence should then also hold a ref to the queue to
  prevent the queue from being freed.

  However, currently it looks like we signal the fence and then drop the
  queue ref, but if something is waiting on the fence, the waiter is
  kicked to wake up at some later point, where upon waking up it first
  grabs the lock before checking the fence state. But if we have already
  dropped the queue ref, then the lock might already be freed as part of
  the queue, leading to uaf.

  To prevent this, move the fence lock into the fence itself so we don't
  run into lifetime issues. Alternative might be to have device level
  lock, or only release the queue in the fence release callback, however
  that might require pushing to another worker to avoid locking issues.
