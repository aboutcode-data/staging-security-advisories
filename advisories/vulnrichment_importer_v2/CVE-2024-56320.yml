aliases: []
summary: GoCD is a continuous deliver server. GoCD versions prior to 24.5.0 are vulnerable to
  admin privilege escalation due to improper authorization of access to the admin "Configuration
  XML" UI feature, and its associated API. A malicious insider/existing authenticated GoCD user
  with an existing GoCD user account could abuse this vulnerability to access information intended
  only for GoCD admins, or to escalate their privileges to that of a GoCD admin in a persistent
  manner. it is not possible for this vulnerability to be abused prior to authentication/login.
  The issue is fixed in GoCD 24.5.0. GoCD users who are not able to immediate upgrade can mitigate
  this issue by using a reverse proxy, WAF or similar to externally block access paths with
  a `/go/rails/` prefix. Blocking this route causes no loss of functionality. If it is not possible
  to upgrade or block the above route, consider reducing the GoCD user base to more trusted
  set of users, including temporarily disabling use of plugins such as the guest-login-plugin,
  which allow limited anonymous access as a regular user account.
