aliases: []
summary: axios is a promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. The issue occurs
  when passing absolute URLs rather than protocol-relative URLs to axios. Even if ⁠baseURL is
  set, axios sends the request to the specified absolute URL, potentially causing SSRF and credential
  leakage. This issue impacts both server-side and client-side usage of axios. This issue is
  fixed in 1.8.2.
