summary: 'JFreeChart v1.5.4 was discovered to be vulnerable to ArrayIndexOutOfBounds via the
  ''setSeriesNeedle(int index, int type)'' method. NOTE: this is disputed by multiple third
  parties who believe there was not reasonable evidence to determine the existence of a vulnerability.
  The submission may have been based on a tool that is not sufficiently robust for vulnerability
  identification.'
