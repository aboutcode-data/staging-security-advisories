aliases: []
summary: 'Meinberg Lantime M300 and M1000 devices allow attackers (with privileges to configure
  a device) to execute arbitrary OS commands by editing the /config/netconf.cmd script (aka
  Extended Network Configuration). Note: According to the description, the vulnerability requires
  a fully authenticated super-user account using a webUI function that allows super users to
  edit a script supposed to execute OS commands. The given weakness enumeration (CWE-78) is
  not applicable in this case as it refers to abusing functions/input fields not supposed to
  be accepting OS commands by using ''Special Elements.'
