aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in a diagnostic command for the Plug-and-Play (PnP) subsystem of Cisco
  IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges to the
  level of an Administrator user (level 15) on an affected device. The vulnerability is due
  to insufficient protection of sensitive information. An attacker with low privileges could
  exploit this vulnerability by issuing the diagnostic CLI show pnp profile when a specific
  PnP listener is enabled on the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain
  a privileged authentication token. This token can be used to send crafted PnP messages and
  execute privileged commands on the targeted system.
