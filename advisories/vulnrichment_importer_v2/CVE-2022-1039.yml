aliases: []
summary: The weak password on the web user interface can be exploited via HTTP or HTTPS. Once
  such access has been obtained, the other passwords can be changed. The weak password on Linux
  accounts can be accessed via SSH or Telnet, the former of which is by default enabled on trusted
  interfaces. While the SSH service does not support root login, a user logging in using either
  of the other Linux accounts may elevate to root access using the su command if they have access
  to the associated password.
