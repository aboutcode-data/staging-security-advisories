aliases: []
summary: 'The UpdraftPlus: WP Backup & Migration Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  PHP Object Injection in all versions from 1.23.8 to 1.24.11 via deserialization of untrusted
  input in the ''recursive_unserialized_replace'' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software,
  which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP
  chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme
  installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary
  files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present. An administrator
  must perform a search and replace action to trigger the exploit.'
