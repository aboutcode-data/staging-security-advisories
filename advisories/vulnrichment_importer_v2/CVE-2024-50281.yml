  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  KEYS: trusted: dcp: fix NULL dereference in AEAD crypto operation

  When sealing or unsealing a key blob we currently do not wait for
  the AEAD cipher operation to finish and simply return after submitting
  the request. If there is some load on the system we can exit before
  the cipher operation is done and the buffer we read from/write to
  is already removed from the stack. This will e.g. result in NULL
  pointer dereference errors in the DCP driver during blob creation.

  Fix this by waiting for the AEAD cipher operation to finish before
  resuming the seal and unseal calls.
