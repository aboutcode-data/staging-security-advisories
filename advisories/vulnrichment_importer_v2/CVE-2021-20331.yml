aliases: []
summary: Specific versions of the MongoDB C# Driver may erroneously publish events containing
  authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an application. The published
  events may contain security-sensitive data when commands such as "saslStart", "saslContinue",
  "isMaster", "createUser", and "updateUser" are executed. Without due care, an application
  may inadvertently expose this authenticated-related information, e.g., by writing it to a
  log file. This issue only arises if an application enables the command listener feature (this
  is not enabled by default). This issue affects the MongoDB C# Driver v2.12 versions prior
  to and including 2.12.1.
