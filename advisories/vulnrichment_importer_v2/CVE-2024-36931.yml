  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  s390/cio: Ensure the copied buf is NUL terminated

  Currently, we allocate a lbuf-sized kernel buffer and copy lbuf from
  userspace to that buffer. Later, we use scanf on this buffer but we don't
  ensure that the string is terminated inside the buffer, this can lead to
  OOB read when using scanf. Fix this issue by using memdup_user_nul instead.
