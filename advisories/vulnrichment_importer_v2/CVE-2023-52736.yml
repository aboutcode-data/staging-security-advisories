  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ALSA: hda: Do not unset preset when cleaning up codec

  Several functions that take part in codec's initialization and removal
  are re-used by ASoC codec drivers implementations. Drivers mimic the
  behavior of hda_codec_driver_probe/remove() found in
  sound/pci/hda/hda_bind.c with their component->probe/remove() instead.

  One of the reasons for that is the expectation of
  snd_hda_codec_device_new() to receive a valid pointer to an instance of
  struct snd_card. This expectation can be met only once sound card
  components probing commences.

  As ASoC sound card may be unbound without codec device being actually
  removed from the system, unsetting ->preset in
  snd_hda_codec_cleanup_for_unbind() interferes with module unload -> load
  scenario causing null-ptr-deref. Preset is assigned only once, during
  device/driver matching whereas ASoC codec driver's module reloading may
  occur several times throughout the lifetime of an audio stack.
