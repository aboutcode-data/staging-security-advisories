aliases: []
summary: In illumos illumos-gate 2024-02-15, an error occurs in the elliptic curve point addition
  algorithm that uses mixed Jacobian-affine coordinates, causing the algorithm to yield a result
  of POINT_AT_INFINITY when it should not. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this to interfere
  with a connection, resulting in an attacked party computing an incorrect shared secret.
