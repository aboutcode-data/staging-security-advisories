aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the default configuration of the Cisco Aironet Active Sensor could
  allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to restart the sensor. The vulnerability is due
  to a default local account with a static password. The account has privileges only to reboot
  the device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by guessing the account name and
  password to access the CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to reboot the device
  repeatedly, creating a denial of service (DoS) condition. It is not possible to change the
  configuration or view sensitive data with this account. Versions prior to DNAC1.2.8 are affected.
