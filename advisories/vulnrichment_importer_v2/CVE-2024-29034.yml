aliases: []
summary: CarrierWave is a solution for file uploads for Rails, Sinatra and other Ruby web frameworks.
  The vulnerability CVE-2023-49090 wasn't fully addressed. This vulnerability is caused by the
  fact that when uploading to object storage, including Amazon S3, it is possible to set a Content-Type
  value that is interpreted by browsers to be different from what's allowed by `content_type_allowlist`,
  by providing multiple values separated by commas. This bypassed value can be used to cause
  XSS. Upgrade to 3.0.7 or 2.2.6.
