summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  lib/test_hmm.c: handle src_pfns and dst_pfns allocation failure

  The kcalloc() in dmirror_device_evict_chunk() will return null if the
  physical memory has run out.  As a result, if src_pfns or dst_pfns is
  dereferenced, the null pointer dereference bug will happen.

  Moreover, the device is going away.  If the kcalloc() fails, the pages
  mapping a chunk could not be evicted.  So add a __GFP_NOFAIL flag in
  kcalloc().

  Finally, as there is no need to have physically contiguous memory, Switch
  kcalloc() to kvcalloc() in order to avoid failing allocations.
