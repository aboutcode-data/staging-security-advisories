summary: |
  The default credentials for the setup HSQL database (HSQLDB) for FileCatalyst Workflow are published in a vendor knowledgebase article. Misuse of these credentials could lead to a compromise of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the software.

  The HSQLDB is only included to facilitate installation, has been deprecated, and is not intended for production use per vendor guides. However, users who have not configured FileCatalyst Workflow to use an alternative database per recommendations are vulnerable to attack from any source that can reach the HSQLDB.
