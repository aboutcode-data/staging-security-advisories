aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Secure Copy (SCP) feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance
  (ASA) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service
  (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to the use of an incorrect data type for a length
  variable. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by initiating the transfer of a large
  file to an affected device via SCP. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need
  to have valid privilege level 15 credentials on the affected device. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to cause the length variable to roll over, which could cause the
  affected device to crash.
