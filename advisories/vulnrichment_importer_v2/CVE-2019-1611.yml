  system of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of arguments
  passed to certain CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including
  malicious input as the argument of an affected command. A successful exploit could allow the
  attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with elevated privileges.
