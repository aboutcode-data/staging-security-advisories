aliases: []
summary: The Password Protected plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass via
  IP address spoofing in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.11. This is due to the plugin
  trusting client-controlled HTTP headers (such as X-Forwarded-For, HTTP_CLIENT_IP, and similar
  headers) to determine user IP addresses in the `pp_get_ip_address()` function when the "Use
  transients" feature is enabled. This makes it possible for attackers to bypass authorization
  by spoofing these headers with the IP address of a legitimately authenticated user, granted
  the "Use transients" option is enabled (non-default configuration) and the site is not behind
  a CDN or reverse proxy that overwrites these headers.
