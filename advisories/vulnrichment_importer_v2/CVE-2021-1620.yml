aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) support for the AutoReconnect
  feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote
  attacker to exhaust the free IP addresses from the assigned local pool. This vulnerability
  occurs because the code does not release the allocated IP address under certain failure conditions.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by trying to connect to the device with a non-AnyConnect
  client. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust the IP addresses from the
  assigned local pool, which prevents users from logging in and leads to a denial of service
  (DoS) condition.
