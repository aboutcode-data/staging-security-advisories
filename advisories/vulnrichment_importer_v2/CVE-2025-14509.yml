aliases: []
summary: The Lucky Wheel for WooCommerce – Spin a Sale plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  PHP Code Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.13. This is due to the plugin
  using eval() to execute user-supplied input from the 'Conditional Tags' setting without proper
  validation or sanitization. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level
  access and above, to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. In WordPress multisite installations,
  this allows Site Administrators to execute arbitrary code, a capability they should not have
  since plugin/theme file editing is disabled for non-Super Admins in multisite environments.
