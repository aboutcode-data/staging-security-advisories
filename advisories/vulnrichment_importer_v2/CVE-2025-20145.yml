aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the access control list (ACL) processing in the egress direction\
  \ of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured\
  \ ACL.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because certain packets are handled incorrectly when\
  \ they are received on an ingress interface on one line card and destined out of an egress\
  \ interface on another line card where the egress ACL is configured. An attacker could exploit\
  \ this vulnerability by attempting to send traffic through an affected device. A successful\
  \ exploit could allow the attacker to bypass an egress ACL on the affected device.\r\nFor\
  \ more information about this vulnerability, see the  section of this advisory.\r\nCisco has\
  \ released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that\
  \ address this vulnerability."
