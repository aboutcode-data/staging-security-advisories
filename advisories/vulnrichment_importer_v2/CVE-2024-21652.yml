aliases: []
summary: Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Prior to
  versions 2.8.13, 2.9.9, and 2.10.4, an attacker can exploit a chain of vulnerabilities, including
  a Denial of Service (DoS) flaw and in-memory data storage weakness, to effectively bypass
  the application's brute force login protection. This is a critical security vulnerability
  that allows attackers to bypass the brute force login protection mechanism. Not only can they
  crash the service affecting all users, but they can also make unlimited login attempts, increasing
  the risk of account compromise. Versions 2.8.13, 2.9.9, and 2.10.4 contain a patch for this
  issue.
