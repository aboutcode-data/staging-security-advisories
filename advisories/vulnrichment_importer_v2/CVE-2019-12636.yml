aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business Smart
  and Managed Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site
  request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  CSRF protections for the web-based management interface on an affected device. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious
  link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the
  privilege level of the targeted user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker
  could alter the configuration, execute commands, or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition
  on an affected device.
