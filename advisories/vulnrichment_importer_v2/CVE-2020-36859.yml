summary: The Core Config Manager (CCM) in Nagios XI versions prior to CCM 3.0.7 / Nagios XI
  5.7.4 contains multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the object edit pages. Unsanitized

  unauthorized disclosure or modification of configuration and application data, and in some
  environments could allow further compromise of the application or backend database.
