summary: "A vulnerability in system file transfer functions of Cisco&nbsp;SD-WAN vManage Software\
  \ could allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain escalated privileges on the underlying\
  \ operating system.\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper validation of path input to the\
  \ system file transfer functions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending\
  \ requests that contain specially crafted path variables to the vulnerable system. A successful\
  \ exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files, allowing the attacker to\
  \ modify the system in such a way that could allow the attacker to gain escalated privileges.Cisco&nbsp;has\
  \ released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that\
  \ address this vulnerability."
