aliases: []
summary: SAP MII allows users to create dashboards and save them as JSP through the SSCE (Self
  Service Composition Environment). An attacker can intercept a request to the server, inject
  malicious JSP code in the request and forward to server. When this dashboard is opened by
  users having at least SAP_XMII Developer role, malicious content in the dashboard gets executed,
  leading to remote code execution in the server, which allows privilege escalation. The malicious
  JSP code can contain certain OS commands, through which an attacker can read sensitive files
  in the server, modify files or even delete contents in the server thus compromising the confidentiality,
  integrity and availability of the server hosting the SAP MII application. Also, an attacker
  authenticated as a developer can use the application to upload and execute a file which will
  permit them to execute operating systems commands completely compromising the server hosting
  the application.
