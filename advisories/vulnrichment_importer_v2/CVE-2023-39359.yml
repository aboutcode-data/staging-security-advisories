  SQL injection vulnerability was discovered which allows authenticated users to perform privilege
  escalation and remote code execution. The vulnerability resides in the `graphs.php` file.
  When dealing with the cases of ajax_hosts and ajax_hosts_noany, if the `site_id` parameter
  is greater than 0, it is directly reflected in the WHERE clause of the SQL statement. This
