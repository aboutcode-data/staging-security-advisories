aliases: []
summary: "Multiple vulnerabilities in the update process of Cisco ThousandEyes Endpoint Agent\
  \ for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to delete arbitrary files on an\
  \ affected device.\r\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities are due to improper access controls on files\
  \ that are in the local file system. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by using\
  \ a symbolic link to perform an agent upgrade that redirects the delete operation of any protected\
  \ file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files from the file\
  \ system of the affected device."
