aliases: []
summary: A Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server
  that allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code by exploiting the pre-receive hook functionality,
  potentially leading to privilege escalation and system compromise. The vulnerability involves
  using dynamically allocated ports that become temporarily available, such as during a hot
  patch upgrade. This means the vulnerability is only exploitable during specific operational
  conditions, which limits the attack window. Exploitation required either site administrator
  permissions to enable and configure pre-receive hooks or a user with permissions to modify
  repositories containing pre-receive hooks where this functionality was already enabled. This
  vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.17 and was fixed
  in versions 3.16.2, 3.15.6, 3.14.11, 3.13.14. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub
  Bug Bounty program.
