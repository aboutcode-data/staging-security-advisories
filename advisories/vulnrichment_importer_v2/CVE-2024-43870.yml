  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  perf: Fix event leak upon exit

  When a task is scheduled out, pending sigtrap deliveries are deferred
  to the target task upon resume to userspace via task_work.

  However failures while adding an event's callback to the task_work
  engine are ignored. And since the last call for events exit happen
  after task work is eventually closed, there is a small window during
  which pending sigtrap can be queued though ignored, leaking the event
  refcount addition such as in the following scenario:

      TASK A
      -----

      do_exit()
         exit_task_work(tsk);

         <IRQ>
         perf_event_overflow()
            event->pending_sigtrap = pending_id;
            irq_work_queue(&event->pending_irq);
         </IRQ>
      =========> PREEMPTION: TASK A -> TASK B
         event_sched_out()
            event->pending_sigtrap = 0;
            atomic_long_inc_not_zero(&event->refcount)
            // FAILS: task work has exited
            task_work_add(&event->pending_task)
         [...]
         <IRQ WORK>
         perf_pending_irq()
            // early return: event->oncpu = -1
         </IRQ WORK>
         [...]
      =========> TASK B -> TASK A
         perf_event_exit_task(tsk)
            perf_event_exit_event()
               free_event()
                  WARN(atomic_long_cmpxchg(&event->refcount, 1, 0) != 1)
                  // leak event due to unexpected refcount == 2

  As a result the event is never released while the task exits.

  Fix this with appropriate task_work_add()'s error handling.
