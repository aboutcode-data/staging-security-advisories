aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net/smc: remove device from smcd_dev_list after failed device_add()

  If the device_add() for a smcd_dev fails, there's no cleanup step that
  rolls back the earlier list_add(). The device subsequently gets freed,
  and we end up with a corrupted list.

  Add some error handling that removes the device from the list.
