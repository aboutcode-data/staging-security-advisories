aliases: []
summary: Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host prior to version 25.1.102 and
  Application prior to version 25.1.1413 (VA/SaaS deployments) contain a blind and non-blind
  server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. The '/var/www/app/console_release/hp/badgeSetup.php'
  script is reachable from the Internet without any authentication and builds URLs from user‑controlled
  parameters before invoking either the custom processCurl() function or PHP’s file_get_contents();
  in both cases the hostname/URL is taken directly from the request with no whitelist, scheme
  restriction, IP‑range validation, or outbound‑network filtering. Consequently, any unauthenticated
  attacker can force the server to issue arbitrary HTTP requests to internal resources. This
  enables internal network reconnaissance, credential leakage, pivoting, and data exfiltration. This
  vulnerability has been confirmed to be remediated, but it is unclear as to when the patch
  was introduced.
