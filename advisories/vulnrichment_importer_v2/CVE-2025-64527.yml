aliases: []
summary: Envoy is a high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. In 1.33.12, 1.34.10, 1.35.6,
  1.36.2, and earlier, Envoy crashes when JWT authentication is configured with the remote JWKS
  fetching, allow_missing_or_failed is enabled, multiple JWT tokens are present in the request
  headers and the JWKS fetch fails. This is caused by a re-entry bug in the JwksFetcherImpl.
  When the first token's JWKS fetch fails, onJwksError() callback triggers processing of the
  second token, which calls fetch() again on the same fetcher object. The original callback's
  reset() then clears the second fetch's state (receiver_ and request_) which causes a crash
  when the async HTTP response arrives.
