aliases: []
summary: 'The Syliud PayPal Plugin is the Sylius Core Team’s plugin for the PayPal Commerce
  Platform. Prior to 1.6.2, 1.7.2, and 2.0.2, a discovered vulnerability allows users to modify
  their shopping cart after completing the PayPal Checkout process and payment authorization.
  If a user initiates a PayPal transaction from a product page or the cart page and then returns
  to the order summary page, they can still manipulate the cart contents before finalizing the
  order. As a result, the order amount in Sylius may be higher than the amount actually captured
  by PayPal, leading to a scenario where merchants deliver products or services without full
  payment. The issue is fixed in versions: 1.6.2, 1.7.2, 2.0.2 and above.'
