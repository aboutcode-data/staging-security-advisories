aliases: []
summary: The The Grid Plus – Unlimited grid layout plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
  shortcode execution via grid_plus_load_by_category AJAX action in all versions up to, and
  including, 1.3.5. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does
  not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.
