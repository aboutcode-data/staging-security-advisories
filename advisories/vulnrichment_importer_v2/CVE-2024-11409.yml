aliases: []
summary: The Grid View Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.0 via deserialization of untrusted input from cs_all_photos_details
  parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Editor-level access and
  above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If
  a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it
  could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
