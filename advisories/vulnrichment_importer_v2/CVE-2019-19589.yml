summary: 'The Lever PDF Embedder plugin 4.4 for WordPress does not block the distribution of
  polyglot PDF documents that are valid JAR archives. Note: It has been argued that "The vulnerability
  reported in PDF Embedder Plugin is not valid as the plugin itself doesn''t control or manage
  the file upload process. It only serves the uploaded PDF files and the responsibility of uploading
  PDF file remains with the Site owner of Wordpress installation, the upload of PDF file is
  managed by Wordpress core and not by PDF Embedder Plugin. Control & block of polyglot file
  is required to be taken care at the time of upload, not on showing the file. Moreover, the
  reference mentions retrieving the files from the browser cache and manually renaming it to
  jar for executing the file. That refers to a two step non-connected steps which has nothing
  to do with PDF Embedder.'
