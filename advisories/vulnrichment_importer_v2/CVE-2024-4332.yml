aliases: []
summary: An authentication bypass vulnerability has been identified in the REST and SOAP API
  components of Tripwire Enterprise (TE) 9.1.0 when TE is configured to use LDAP/Active Directory
  SAML authentication and its optional "Auto-synchronize LDAP Users, Roles, and Groups" feature
  is enabled. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to bypass authentication if
  a valid username is known. Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow remote attackers
  to gain privileged access to the APIs and lead to unauthorized information disclosure or modification.
