aliases: []
summary: SSH.NET is a Secure Shell (SSH) library for .NET. In versions 2020.0.0 and 2020.0.1,
  during an `X25519` key exchange, the client’s private key is generated with `System.Random`.
  `System.Random` is not a cryptographically secure random number generator, it must therefore
  not be used for cryptographic purposes. When establishing an SSH connection to a remote host,
  during the X25519 key exchange, the private key is generated with a weak random number generator
  whose seed can be brute forced. This allows an attacker who is able to eavesdrop on the communications
  to decrypt them. Version 2020.0.2 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, one may
  disable support for `curve25519-sha256` and `curve25519-sha256@libssh.org` key exchange algorithms.
