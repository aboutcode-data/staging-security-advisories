summary: A vulnerability was discovered in the Alta Recovery Vault feature of Veritas NetBackup
  before 10.4 and NetBackup Appliance before 5.4. By design, only the cloud administrator should

  a NetBackup administrator to modify the expiration of backups under Governance mode (which
  could cause premature deletion).
