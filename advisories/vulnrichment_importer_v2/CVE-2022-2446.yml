aliases: []
summary: The WP Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted input
  via the 'current_theme_root' parameter in versions up to, and including 1.2.9. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers with administrative privileges to call files using
  a PHAR wrapper that will deserialize and call arbitrary PHP Objects that can be used to perform
  a variety of malicious actions granted a POP chain is also present. It also requires that
  the attacker is successful in uploading a file with the serialized payload.
