aliases: []
summary: The WP Timetics- AI-powered Appointment Booking Calendar and Online Scheduling Plugin
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Account Takeover/Privilege Escalation via Insecure Direct
  Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.25 via the save() due to missing
  validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to reset the emails and passwords of arbitrary user accounts, including administrators, which
  makes account takeover and privilege escalation possible.
