aliases: []
summary: Nuxt is a free and open-source framework to create full-stack web applications and
  websites with Vue.js. `nuxt/icon` provides an API to allow client side icon lookup. This endpoint
  is at `/api/_nuxt_icon/[name]`. The proxied request path is improperly parsed, allowing an
  attacker to change the scheme and host of the request. This leads to SSRF, and could potentially
  lead to sensitive data exposure. The `new URL` constructor is used to parse the final path.
  This constructor can be passed a relative scheme or path in order to change the host the request
  is sent to. This constructor is also very tolerant of poorly formatted URLs. As a result we
  can pass a path prefixed with the string `http:`. This has the effect of changing the scheme
  to HTTP. We can then subsequently pass a new host, for example `http:127.0.0.1:8080`. This
  would allow us to send requests to a local server. This issue has been addressed in release
  version 1.4.5 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
  vulnerability.
