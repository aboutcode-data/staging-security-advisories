aliases: []
summary: FreePBX is an open-source web-based graphical user interface (GUI) that manages Asterisk.
  Prior to 17.0.5 and 16.0.17, FreePBX module api (PBX API) is vulnerable to privilege escalation
  by authenticated users with REST/GraphQL API access. This vulnerability allows an attacker
  to forge a valid JWT with full access to the REST and GraphQL APIs on a FreePBX that they've
  already connected to, possibly as a lower privileged user. The JWT is signed using the api-oauth.key
  private key. An attacker can generate their own token if they possess this key (e.g., by accessing
  an affected instance), and specify any scopes they wish (e.g., rest, gql), bypassing traditional
  authorization checks. However, FreePBX enforces that the jti (JWT ID) claim must exist in
  the database (api_access_tokens table in the asterisk MySQL database) in order for the token
  to be accepted. Therefore, the attacker must know a jti value that already exists on the target
  instance. This vulnerability is fixed in 17.0.5 and 16.0.17.
