summary: A vulnerability in Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker
  with level-15 privileges or an unauthenticated attacker with physical access to an affected
  device to execute persistent code at boot time and break the chain of trust. This vulnerability
  is due to improper validation of software packages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by placing a crafted file into a specific location on an affected device. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to execute persistent code on the underlying operating system. Because
  this vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass a major security feature of a device, Cisco
  has raised the Security Impact Rating (SIR) of this advisory from Medium to High.
