aliases: []
summary: Radiometrics VizAir is vulnerable to exposure of the system's REST API key through
  a publicly accessible configuration file. This allows attackers to remotely alter weather
  data and configurations, automate attacks against multiple instances, and extract sensitive
  meteorological data, which could potentially compromise airport operations. Additionally,
  attackers could flood the system with false alerts, leading to a denial-of-service condition
  and significant disruption to airport operations. Unauthorized remote control over aviation
  weather monitoring and data manipulation could result in incorrect flight planning and hazardous
  takeoff and landing conditions.
