aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ASoc: PCM6240: Return directly after a failed devm_kzalloc() in pcmdevice_i2c_probe()

  The value “-ENOMEM” was assigned to the local variable “ret”
  in one if branch after a devm_kzalloc() call failed at the beginning.
  This error code will trigger then a pcmdevice_remove() call with a passed
  null pointer so that an undesirable dereference will be performed.
  Thus return the appropriate error code directly.
