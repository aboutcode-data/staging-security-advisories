summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Evolved Programmable\
  \ Network Manager (EPNM) and Cisco Prime Infrastructure could allow an authenticated, remote\
  \ attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against users of the interface\
  \ of an affected system.\r\n\r The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface\
  \ does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by inserting malicious code into specific data fields in the interface. A successful exploit\
  \ could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected\
  \ interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability,\
  \ the attacker must have valid administrative credentials.\r\n\r    \r\n\r  {{value}} [\"\
