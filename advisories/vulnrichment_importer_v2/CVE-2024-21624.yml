  This security advisory pertains to a potential information leak (e.g., environment variables)
  in instances where developers utilize `MessageTemplate` and incorporate user-provided data
  into templates. The identified vulnerability has been remedied in pull request #2509 and will
  be included in versions released from 2.2.0. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to these
  patched versions to safeguard against the vulnerability. A temporary workaround involves filtering
  underscores before incorporating user input into the message template.'
