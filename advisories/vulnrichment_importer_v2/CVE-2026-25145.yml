aliases: []
summary: melange allows users to build apk packages using declarative pipelines. From version
  0.14.0 to before 0.40.3, an attacker who can influence a melange configuration file (e.g.,
  through pull request-driven CI or build-as-a-service scenarios) could read arbitrary files
  from the host system. The LicensingInfos function in pkg/config/config.go reads license files
  specified in copyright[].license-path without validating that paths remain within the workspace
  directory, allowing path traversal via ../ sequences. The contents of the traversed file are
  embedded into the generated SBOM as license text, enabling exfiltration of sensitive data
  through build artifacts. This issue has been patched in version 0.40.3.
