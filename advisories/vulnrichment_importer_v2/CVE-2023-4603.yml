aliases: []
summary: The Star CloudPRNT for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected
  Cross-Site Scripting via the 'printersettings'  parameter in versions up to, and including,
  2.0.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
  unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can
  successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
