aliases: []
summary: D-Link D-View 8 versions 2.0.1.107 and below contain an improper access control vulnerability
  in backend API endpoints. Any authenticated user can supply an arbitrary user_id value to
  retrieve sensitive credential data belonging to other users, including super administrators.
  The exposed credential material can be reused directly as a valid authentication secret, allowing
  full impersonation of the targeted account. This results in complete account takeover and
  full administrative control over the D-View system.
