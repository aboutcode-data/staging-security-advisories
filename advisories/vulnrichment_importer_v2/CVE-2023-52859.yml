  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  perf: hisi: Fix use-after-free when register pmu fails

  When we fail to register the uncore pmu, the pmu context may not been
  allocated. The error handing will call cpuhp_state_remove_instance()
  to call uncore pmu offline callback, which migrate the pmu context.
  Since that's liable to lead to some kind of use-after-free.

  Use cpuhp_state_remove_instance_nocalls() instead of
  cpuhp_state_remove_instance() so that the notifiers don't execute after
  the PMU device has been failed to register.
