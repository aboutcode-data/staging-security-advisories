aliases: []
summary: The Wicked Folders plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in versions up to, and including, 2.18.16. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the ajax_add_folder function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke
  this function via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
  an action such as clicking on a link leading them to perform actions intended for administrators
  such as changing the folder structure maintained by the plugin.
