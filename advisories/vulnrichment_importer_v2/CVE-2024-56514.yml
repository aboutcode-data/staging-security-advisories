aliases: []
summary: Karmada is a Kubernetes management system that allows users to run cloud-native applications
  across multiple Kubernetes clusters and clouds. Prior to version 1.12.0, both in karmadactl
  and karmada-operator, it is possible to supply a filesystem path, or an HTTP(s) URL to retrieve
  the custom resource definitions(CRDs) needed by Karmada. The CRDs are downloaded as a gzipped
  tarfile and are vulnerable to a TarSlip vulnerability. An attacker able to supply a malicious
  CRD file into a Karmada initialization could write arbitrary files in arbitrary paths of the
  filesystem. From Karmada version 1.12.0, when processing custom CRDs files, CRDs archive verification
  is utilized to enhance file system robustness. A workaround is available. Someone who needs
  to set flag `--crd` to customize the CRD files required for Karmada initialization when using
  `karmadactl init` to set up Karmada can manually inspect the CRD files to check whether they
  contain sequences such as `../` that would alter file paths, to determine if they potentially
  include malicious files. When using karmada-operator to set up Karmada, one must upgrade one's
  karmada-operator to one of the fixed versions.
