aliases: []
summary: XWiki is an open-source wiki software platform. When a user without script right creates
  a document with an XWiki.Notifications.Code.NotificationDisplayerClass object, and later an
  admin edits and saves that document, the possibly malicious content of that object is output
  as raw HTML, allowing XSS attacks. While the notification displayer executes Velocity, the
  existing generic analyzer already warns admins before editing Velocity code. Note that warnings
  before editing documents with dangerous properties have only been introduced in XWiki 15.9,
  before that version, this was a known issue and the advice was simply to be careful. This
  vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 15.10.16, 16.4.7, and 16.10.2 by adding a required
  rights analyzer that warns the admin before editing about the possibly malicious code.
