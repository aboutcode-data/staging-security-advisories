aliases: []
summary: The DASHBOARD BUILDER – WordPress plugin for Charts and Graphs plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.7. This
  is due to missing nonce validation on the settings handler in dashboardbuilder-admin.php.
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the stored SQL query and database
  credentials used by the [show-dashboardbuilder] shortcode via a forged request granted they
  can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. The modified
  SQL query is subsequently executed on the front-end when the shortcode is rendered, enabling
  arbitrary SQL injection and data exfiltration through the publicly visible chart output.
