aliases: []
summary: A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the parisneo/lollms-webui project
  allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on a victim's system. The vulnerability
  stems from the `/execute_code` API endpoint, which does not properly validate requests, enabling
  an attacker to craft a malicious webpage that, when visited by a victim, submits a form to
  the victim's local lollms-webui instance to execute arbitrary OS commands. This issue allows
  attackers to take full control of the victim's system without requiring direct network access
  to the vulnerable application.
