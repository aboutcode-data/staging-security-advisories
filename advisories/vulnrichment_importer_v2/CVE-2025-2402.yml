summary: "A hard-coded, non-random password for the object store (minio) of KNIME Business Hub\
  \ in all versions except the ones listed below allows an unauthenticated remote attacker in\
  \ possession of the password to read and manipulate swapped jobs or read and manipulate in-\
  \ and output data of active jobs. It is also possible to cause a denial-of-service of most\
  \ functionality of KNIME Business Hub by writing large amounts of data to the object store\
  \ directly. \n\n\n\nThere are no viable workarounds therefore we strongly recommend to update\
  \ to one of the following versions of KNIME Business Hub: \n\n\n\n  *  1.13.2 or later \n\n\
  \n\n\n\n\n  *  1.12.3 or later \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  *  1.11.3 or later \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  *  1.10.3\
  \ or later"
