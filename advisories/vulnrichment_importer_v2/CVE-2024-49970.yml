  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/amd/display: Implement bounds check for stream encoder creation in DCN401

  'stream_enc_regs' array is an array of dcn10_stream_enc_registers
  structures. The array is initialized with four elements, corresponding
  to the four calls to stream_enc_regs() in the array initializer. This
  means that valid indices for this array are 0, 1, 2, and 3.

  The error message 'stream_enc_regs' 4 <= 5 below, is indicating that
  there is an attempt to access this array with an index of 5, which is
  out of bounds. This could lead to undefined behavior

  Here, eng_id is used as an index to access the stream_enc_regs array. If
  eng_id is 5, this would result in an out-of-bounds access on the
  stream_enc_regs array.

  Thus fixing Buffer overflow error in dcn401_stream_encoder_create
