aliases: []
summary: A mass assignment vulnerability exists in the `/api/invite/:code` endpoint of the mintplex-labs/anything-llm
  repository, allowing unauthorized creation of high-privileged accounts. By intercepting and
  modifying the HTTP request during the account creation process via an invitation link, an
  attacker can add a `role` property with `admin` value, thereby gaining administrative access.
  This issue arises due to the lack of property allowlisting and blocklisting, enabling the
  attacker to exploit the system and perform actions as an administrator.
