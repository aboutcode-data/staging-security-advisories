aliases: []
summary: HTTPie is a command-line HTTP client. HTTPie has the practical concept of sessions,
  which help users to persistently store some of the state that belongs to the outgoing requests
  and incoming responses on the disk for further usage. Before 3.1.0, HTTPie didn‘t distinguish
  between cookies and hosts they belonged. This behavior resulted in the exposure of some cookies
  when there are redirects originating from the actual host to a third party website. Users
  are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds.
