  drm/v3d: Ensure job pointer is set to NULL after job completion

  After a job completes, the corresponding pointer in the device must
  be set to NULL. Failing to do so triggers a warning when unloading
  the driver, as it appears the job is still active. To prevent this,
  assign the job pointer to NULL after completing the job, indicating
  the job has finished.
