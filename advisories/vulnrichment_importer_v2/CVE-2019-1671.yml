aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management
  Center (FMC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected system. The
  vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management
  interface of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading
  a user of the interface to click a maliciously crafted link. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or
  access sensitive, browser-based information.
