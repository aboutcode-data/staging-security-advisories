aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) functionality of software for
  Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode could
  allow an unauthenticated, local attacker with physical access to view sensitive information
  on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper data-protection mechanisms
  for disk encryption keys that are used within the partitions on an affected device hard drive.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by obtaining physical access to the affected
  device to view certain cleartext keys. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute
  a custom boot process or conduct further attacks on an affected device.
