  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  misc: lis3lv02d_i2c: Fix regulators getting en-/dis-abled twice on suspend/resume

  When not configured for wakeup lis3lv02d_i2c_suspend() will call
  lis3lv02d_poweroff() even if the device has already been turned off
  by the runtime-suspend handler and if configured for wakeup and
  the device is runtime-suspended at this point then it is not turned
  back on to serve as a wakeup source.

  Before commit b1b9f7a49440 ("misc: lis3lv02d_i2c: Add missing setting
  of the reg_ctrl callback"), lis3lv02d_poweroff() failed to disable
  the regulators which as a side effect made calling poweroff() twice ok.

  Now that poweroff() correctly disables the regulators, doing this twice
  triggers a WARN() in the regulator core:

  unbalanced disables for regulator-dummy
  WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 92 at drivers/regulator/core.c:2999 _regulator_disable
  ...

  Fix lis3lv02d_i2c_suspend() to not call poweroff() a second time if
  already runtime-suspended and add a poweron() call when necessary to
  make wakeup work.

  lis3lv02d_i2c_resume() has similar issues, with an added weirness that
  it always powers on the device if it is runtime suspended, after which
  the first runtime-resume will call poweron() again, causing the enabled
  count for the regulator to increase by 1 every suspend/resume. These
  unbalanced regulator_enable() calls cause the regulator to never
  be turned off and trigger the following WARN() on driver unbind:

  WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 1724 at drivers/regulator/core.c:2396 _regulator_put

  Fix this by making lis3lv02d_i2c_resume() mirror the new suspend().
