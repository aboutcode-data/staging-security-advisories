aliases: []
summary: The PowerPack Pro for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
  in all versions up to, and including, 2.10.17. This is due to the plugin not restricting low
  privileged users from setting a default role for a registration form. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to create a registration
  form with administrator set as the default role and then register as an administrator.
