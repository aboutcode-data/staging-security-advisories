aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the Central Web Authentication (CWA) feature of Cisco IOS XE Software\
  \ for Wireless Controllers could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to bypass the\
  \ pre-authentication access control list (ACL), which could allow access to network resources\
  \ before user authentication.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to a logic error when activating\
  \ the pre-authentication ACL that is received from the authentication, authorization, and\
  \ accounting (AAA) server. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to a\
  \ wireless network that is configured for CWA and sending traffic through an affected device\
  \ that should be denied by the configured ACL before user authentication. A successful exploit\
  \ could allow the attacker to bypass configured ACL protections on the affected device before\
  \ the user authentication is completed, allowing the attacker to access trusted networks that\
  \ the device might be protecting."
