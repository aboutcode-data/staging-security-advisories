aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the nginx configurations that are provided as part of the VPN-less
  reverse proxy for Cisco Finesse could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to create
  a denial of service (DoS) condition for new and existing users who are connected through a
  load balancer. This vulnerability is due to improper IP address filtering by the reverse proxy.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of unauthenticated requests
  to the reverse proxy. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause all current traffic
  and subsequent requests to the reverse proxy through a load balancer to be dropped, resulting
  in a DoS condition.
