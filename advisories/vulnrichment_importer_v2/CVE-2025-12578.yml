aliases: []
summary: The Reuters Direct plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the the 'class-reuters-direct-settings.php' page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to reset the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site
  administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
