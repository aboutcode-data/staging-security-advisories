summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  Revert "mm/writeback: fix possible divide-by-zero in wb_dirty_limits(), again"

  Patch series "mm: Avoid possible overflows in dirty throttling".

  Dirty throttling logic assumes dirty limits in page units fit into
  32-bits.  This patch series makes sure this is true (see patch 2/2 for
  more details).


  This patch (of 2):

  This reverts commit 9319b647902cbd5cc884ac08a8a6d54ce111fc78.

  The commit is broken in several ways.  Firstly, the removed (u64) cast
  from the multiplication will introduce a multiplication overflow on 32-bit
  archs if wb_thresh * bg_thresh >= 1<<32 (which is actually common - the
  default settings with 4GB of RAM will trigger this).  Secondly, the
  div64_u64() is unnecessarily expensive on 32-bit archs.  We have
  div64_ul() in case we want to be safe & cheap.  Thirdly, if dirty
  thresholds are larger than 1<<32 pages, then dirty balancing is going to
  blow up in many other spectacular ways anyway so trying to fix one
  possible overflow is just moot.
