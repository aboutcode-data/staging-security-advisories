aliases: []
summary: The Car Dealer Automotive WordPress Theme – Responsive theme for WordPress is vulnerable
  to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the delete_post_photo()
  and add_car() functions in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.3. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files
  on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted
  (such as wp-config.php). The add_car() function may also make it possible to read arbitrary
  files.
