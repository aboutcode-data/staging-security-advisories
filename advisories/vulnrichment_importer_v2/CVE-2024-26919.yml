  usb: ulpi: Fix debugfs directory leak

  The ULPI per-device debugfs root is named after the ulpi device's
  parent, but ulpi_unregister_interface tries to remove a debugfs
  directory named after the ulpi device itself. This results in the
  directory sticking around and preventing subsequent (deferred) probes
  from succeeding. Change the directory name to match the ulpi device.
