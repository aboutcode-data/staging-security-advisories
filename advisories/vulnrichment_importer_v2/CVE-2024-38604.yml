aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  block: refine the EOF check in blkdev_iomap_begin

  blkdev_iomap_begin rounds down the offset to the logical block size
  before stashing it in iomap->offset and checking that it still is
  inside the inode size.

  Check the i_size check to the raw pos value so that we don't try a
  zero size write if iter->pos is unaligned.
