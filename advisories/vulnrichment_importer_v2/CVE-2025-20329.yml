aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the logging component of Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint\
  \ (CE) and Cisco RoomOS Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view sensitive\
  \ information in clear text on an affected system. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker\
  \ must have valid administrative&nbsp;credentials.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because\
  \ certain unencrypted credentials are stored when SIP media component logging is enabled.\
  \ An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the audit logs on an affected\
  \ system and obtaining credentials to which they may not normally have access. A successful\
  \ exploit could allow the attacker to use those credentials to access confidential information,\
  \ some of which may contain personally identifiable information (PII).\r\nNote: To access\
  \ the logs that are stored in the Webex Cloud or stored on the device itself, an attacker\
  \ must have valid administrative credentials."
