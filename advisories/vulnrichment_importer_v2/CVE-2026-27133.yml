aliases: []
summary: Strimzi provides a way to run an Apache Kafka cluster on Kubernetes or OpenShift in
  various deployment configurations. From 0.47.0 to before 0.50.1, when a chain consisting of
  multiple CA (Certificate Authority) certificates is used in the trusted certificates configuration
  of a Kafka Connect operand or of the target cluster in the Kafka MirrorMaker 2 operand, all
  of the certificates that are part of the CA chain will be trusted individually when connecting
  to the Apache Kafka cluster. Due to this error, the affected operand (Kafka Connect or Kafka
  MirrorMaker 2) might accept connections to Kafka brokers using server certificates signed
  by one of the other CAs in the CA chain and not just by the last CA in the chain. This issue
  is fixed in Strimzi 0.50.1.
