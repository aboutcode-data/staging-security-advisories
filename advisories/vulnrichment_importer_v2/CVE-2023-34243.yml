aliases: []
summary: TGstation is a toolset to manage production BYOND servers. In affected versions if
  a Windows user was registered in tgstation-server (TGS), an attacker could discover their
  username by brute-forcing the login endpoint with an invalid password. When a valid Windows
  logon was found, a distinct response would be generated. This issue has been addressed in
  version 5.12.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may be mitigated by
  rate-limiting API calls with software that sits in front of TGS in the HTTP pipeline such
  as fail2ban.
