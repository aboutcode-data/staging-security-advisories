  HID: intel-ish-hid: Fix use-after-free issue in ishtp_hid_remove()

  The system can experience a random crash a few minutes after the driver is
  removed. This issue occurs due to improper handling of memory freeing in
  the ishtp_hid_remove() function.

  The function currently frees the `driver_data` directly within the loop
  that destroys the HID devices, which can lead to accessing freed memory.
  Specifically, `hid_destroy_device()` uses `driver_data` when it calls
  `hid_ishtp_set_feature()` to power off the sensor, so freeing
  `driver_data` beforehand can result in accessing invalid memory.

  This patch resolves the issue by storing the `driver_data` in a temporary
  variable before calling `hid_destroy_device()`, and then freeing the
  `driver_data` after the device is destroyed.
