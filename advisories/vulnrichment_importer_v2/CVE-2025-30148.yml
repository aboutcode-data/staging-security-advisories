aliases: []
summary: Silverstripe Framework is a PHP framework which powers the Silverstripe CMS. Prior
  to 5.3.23, bad actor with access to edit content in the CMS could send a specifically crafted
  encoded payload to the server, which could be used to inject a JavaScript payload on the front
  end of the site. The payload would be sanitized on the client-side, but server-side sanitization
  doesn't catch it. The server-side sanitization logic has been updated to sanitize against
  this attack. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.3.23.
