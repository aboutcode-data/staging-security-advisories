summary: |
  Lack of input sanitization in BMC Control-M  branches 9.0.20 and 9.0.21 allows logged-in users for manipulation of generated  web pages via injection of  HTML code. This might lead to a successful phishing attack for example by tricking users into using a hyperlink pointing to a website controlled by an attacker.

  Fix for 9.0.20 branch was released in version 9.0.20.238. Fix for 9.0.21 branch was released in version 9.0.21.200.
