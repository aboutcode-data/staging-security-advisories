aliases: []
summary: pyrage is a set of Python bindings for the rage file encryption library (age in Rust).
  `pyrage` uses the Rust `age` crate for its underlying operations, and `age` is vulnerable
  to GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w. All details of GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w are relevant to `pyrage` for the
  versions specified in this advisory. See GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w for full details. Versions of
  `pyrage` before 1.2.0 lack plugin support and are therefore **not affected**. An equivalent
  issue was fixed in [the reference Go implementation of age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age),
  see advisory GHSA-32gq-x56h-299c. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.3 and all users
  are advised to update. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
