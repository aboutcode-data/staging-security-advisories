aliases: []
summary: Teltonika’s Remote Management System versions prior to 4.10.0 have a feature allowing
  users to access managed devices’ local secure shell (SSH)/web management services over the
  cloud proxy. A user can request a web proxy and obtain a URL in the Remote Management System
  cloud subdomain. This URL could be shared with others without Remote Management System authentication
  . An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to create a malicious webpage that uses a trusted
  and certified domain. An attacker could initiate a reverse shell when a victim connects to
  the malicious webpage, achieving remote code execution on the victim device.
