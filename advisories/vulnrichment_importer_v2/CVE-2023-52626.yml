  net/mlx5e: Fix operation precedence bug in port timestamping napi_poll context

  Indirection (*) is of lower precedence than postfix increment (++). Logic
  in napi_poll context would cause an out-of-bound read by first increment
  the pointer address by byte address space and then dereference the value.
  Rather, the intended logic was to dereference first and then increment the
  underlying value.
