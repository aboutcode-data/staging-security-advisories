  ice: Fix KASAN error in LAG NETDEV_UNREGISTER handler

  Currently, the same handler is called for both a NETDEV_BONDING_INFO
  LAG unlink notification as for a NETDEV_UNREGISTER call.  This is
  causing a problem though, since the netdev_notifier_info passed has
  a different structure depending on which event is passed.  The problem
  manifests as a call trace from a BUG: KASAN stack-out-of-bounds error.

  Fix this by creating a handler specific to NETDEV_UNREGISTER that only
  is passed valid elements in the netdev_notifier_info struct for the
  NETDEV_UNREGISTER event.

  Also included is the removal of an unbalanced dev_put on the peer_netdev
  and related braces.
