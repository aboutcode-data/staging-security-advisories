aliases: []
summary: Ash Authentication provides authentication for the Ash framework. The confirmation
  flow for account creation currently uses a GET request triggered by clicking a link sent via
  email. Some email clients and security tools (e.g., Outlook, virus scanners, and email previewers)
  may automatically follow these links, unintentionally confirming the account. This allows
  an attacker to register an account using another user’s email and potentially have it auto-confirmed
  by the victim’s email client. This does not allow attackers to take over or access existing
  accounts or private data. It is limited to account confirmation of new accounts only. This
  vulnerability is fixed in 4.7.0.
