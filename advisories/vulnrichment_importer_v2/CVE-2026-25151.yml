aliases: []
summary: Qwik is a performance focused javascript framework. Prior to version 1.19.0, Qwik City’s
  server-side request handler inconsistently interprets HTTP request headers, which can be abused
  by a remote attacker to circumvent form submission CSRF protections using specially crafted
  or multi-valued Content-Type headers. This issue has been patched in version 1.19.0.
