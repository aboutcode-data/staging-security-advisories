aliases: []
summary: Rekor's goals are to provide an immutable tamper resistant ledger of metadata generated
  within a software projects supply chain. A malformed proposed entry of the `intoto/v0.0.2`
  type can cause a panic on a thread within the Rekor process. The thread is recovered so the
  client receives a 500 error message and service still continues, so the availability impact
  of this is minimal. This has been fixed in v1.2.0 of Rekor. Users are advised to upgrade.
  There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
