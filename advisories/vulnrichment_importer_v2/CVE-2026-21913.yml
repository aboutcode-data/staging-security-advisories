summary: "An Incorrect Initialization of Resource vulnerability in the Internal Device Manager\
  \ (IDM) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on EX4000 models allows an unauthenticated, network-based\
  \ attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).\n\nOn EX4000 models with 48 ports (EX4000-48T,\
  \ EX4000-48P, EX4000-48MP) a high volume of traffic destined to the device will cause an FXPC\
  \ crash and restart, which leads to a complete service outage until the device has automatically\
  \ restarted.\n\n\n\n\nThe following reboot reason can be seen in the output of 'show chassis\
  \ routing-engine' and as a log message:\n\n  reason=0x4000002 reason_string=0x4000002:watchdog\
  \ + panic with core dump \n\n\n\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS on EX4000-48T, EX4000-48P and\
  \ EX4000-48MP:\n\n\n\n  *  24.4 versions before 24.4R2,\n  *  25.2 versions before 25.2R1-S2,\
  \ 25.2R2.\n\n\n\n\nThis issue does not affect versions before 24.4R1 as the first Junos OS\
  \ version for the EX4000 models was 24.4R1."
