aliases: []
summary: The Charity Addon for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.2 via the 'nacharity_elementor_template' shortcode
  due to insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for
  authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract data from private
  or draft posts created by Elementor that they should not have access to.
