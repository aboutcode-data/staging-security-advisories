aliases: []
summary: There's a possible overflow in handle_image() when shim tries to load and execute crafted
  EFI executables; The handle_image() function takes into account the SizeOfRawData field from
  each section to be loaded. An attacker can leverage this to perform out-of-bound writes into
  memory. Arbitrary code execution is not discarded in such scenario.
