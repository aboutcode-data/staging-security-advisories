summary: CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security
  Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running
  the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. In versions 1.3.3 and prior, a heap buffer
  overflow vulnerability in CryptoLib's `Crypto_TC_ApplySecurity()` allows an attacker to craft
  a malicious TC frame that causes out-of-bounds memory writes. This can result in denial of
  service (DoS) or, under certain conditions, remote code execution (RCE). Any application or
  system that relies on CryptoLib for Telecommand (TC) processing and does not strictly validate
  incoming TC frames is at risk. This includes satellite ground stations or mission control
  software where attackers can inject malformed frames. A patch is available at commit c7e8a8745ff4b5e9bd7e500e91358e86d5abedcc.
