aliases: []
summary: LTI Consumer XBlock implements the consumer side of the LTI specification enabling
  integration of third-party LTI provider tools. Versions 7.0.0 and above, prior to 7.2.2, are
  vulnerable to Missing Authorization.  Any LTI tool that is integrated with on the Open edX
  platform can post a grade back for any LTI XBlock so long as it knows or can guess the block
  location for that XBlock. An LTI tool submits scores to the edX platform for line items. The
  code that uploads that score to the LMS grade tables determines which XBlock to upload the
  grades for by reading the resource_link_id field of the associated line item. The LTI tool
  may submit any value for the resource_link_id field, allowing a malicious LTI tool to submit
  scores for any LTI XBlock on the platform. The impact is a loss of integrity for LTI XBlock
  grades. This issue is patched in 7.2.2. No workarounds exist.
