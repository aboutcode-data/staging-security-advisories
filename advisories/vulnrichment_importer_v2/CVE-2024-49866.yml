  tracing/timerlat: Fix a race during cpuhp processing

  There is another found exception that the "timerlat/1" thread was
  scheduled on CPU0, and lead to timer corruption finally:

  ```

  ```

  After tracing the scheduling event, it was discovered that the migration
  of the "timerlat/1" thread was performed during thread creation. Further
  analysis confirmed that it is because the CPU online processing for
  osnoise is implemented through workers, which is asynchronous with the
  offline processing. When the worker was scheduled to create a thread, the
  CPU may has already been removed from the cpu_online_mask during the offline
  process, resulting in the inability to select the right CPU:

  T1                       | T2
  [CPUHP_ONLINE]           | cpu_device_down()
  osnoise_hotplug_workfn() |
                           |     cpus_write_lock()
                           |     takedown_cpu(1)
                           |     cpus_write_unlock()
  [CPUHP_OFFLINE]          |
      cpus_read_lock()     |
      start_kthread(1)     |
      cpus_read_unlock()   |

  To fix this, skip online processing if the CPU is already offline.
