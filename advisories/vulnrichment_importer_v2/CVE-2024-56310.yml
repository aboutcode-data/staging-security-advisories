aliases: []
summary: REDCap through 14.9.6 has a security flaw in the Project Dashboards name, exposing
  users to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. An attacker can exploit this by luring
  users into clicking on a Project Dashboards name that contains the malicious payload, which
  triggers a logout request and terminates their session. This vulnerability stems from the
  absence of CSRF protections on the logout functionality, allowing malicious actions to be
  executed without user consent.
