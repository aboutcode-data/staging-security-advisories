aliases: []
summary: The Digital Marketing and Agency Templates Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.1. This
  is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the import_templates() function. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger an import via a forged request granted
  they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
