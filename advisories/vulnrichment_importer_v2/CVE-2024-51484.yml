summary: Ampache is a web based audio/video streaming application and file manager. The current
  implementation of token parsing fails to properly validate CSRF tokens when activating or
  deactivating controllers. This vulnerability allows an attacker to exploit CSRF attacks, potentially
  enabling them to change website features that should only be managed by administrators through
  malicious requests. This issue has been addressed in version 7.0.1 and all users are advised
  to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
