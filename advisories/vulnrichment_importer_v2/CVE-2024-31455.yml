aliases: []
summary: Minder by Stacklok is an open source software supply chain security platform. A refactoring
  in commit `5c381cf` added the ability to get GitHub repositories registered to a project without
  specifying a specific provider.  Unfortunately, the SQL query for doing so was missing parenthesis,
  and would select a random repository. This issue is patched in pull request 2941. As a workaround,
  revert prior to `5c381cf`, or roll forward past `2eb94e7`.
