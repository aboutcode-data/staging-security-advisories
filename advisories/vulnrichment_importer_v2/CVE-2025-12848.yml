aliases: []
summary: "Webform Multiple File Upload module for Drupal 7.x contains a cross-site scripting\
  \ (XSS) vulnerability in the file name renderer. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this\
  \ vulnerability by uploading a file with a malicious\nfilename containing JavaScript code\
  \ (e.g., \"<img src=1 onerror=alert(document.domain)>\") to a Webform node with a Multifile\
  \ field where file type validation is disabled. This allows the execution of arbitrary scripts\n\
  in the context of the victim's browser.\n \nThe issue is present in a third-party library\
  \ and has been addressed in a patch available at  https://github.com/fyneworks/multifile/pull/44\
  \ . Users are advised to apply the provided patch or update to a fixed version of the module."
