aliases: []
summary: A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability was discovered in the file upload feature of
  automatic1111/stable-diffusion-webui version 1.10.0. The vulnerability is due to improper
  handling of form-data with a large filename in the file upload request. By sending a payload
  with an excessively large filename, the server becomes overwhelmed and unresponsive, leading
  to unavailability for legitimate users. This issue can be exploited without authentication,
  making it highly scalable and increasing the risk of exploitation.
