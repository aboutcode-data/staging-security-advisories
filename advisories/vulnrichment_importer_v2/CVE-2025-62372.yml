aliases: []
summary: vLLM is an inference and serving engine for large language models (LLMs). From version
  0.5.5 to before 0.11.1, users can crash the vLLM engine serving multimodal models by passing
  multimodal embedding inputs with correct ndim but incorrect shape (e.g. hidden dimension is
  wrong), regardless of whether the model is intended to support such inputs (as defined in
  the Supported Models page). This issue has been patched in version 0.11.1.
