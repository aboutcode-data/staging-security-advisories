aliases: []
summary: The Hash Form – Drag & Drop Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP
  Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.0 via deserialization of untrusted
  input in the 'process_entry' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP
  chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could
  allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
