  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  soc: qcom: cmd-db: Map shared memory as WC, not WB

  Linux does not write into cmd-db region. This region of memory is write
  protected by XPU. XPU may sometime falsely detect clean cache eviction
  as "write" into the write protected region leading to secure interrupt
  which causes an endless loop somewhere in Trust Zone.

  The only reason it is working right now is because Qualcomm Hypervisor
  maps the same region as Non-Cacheable memory in Stage 2 translation
  tables. The issue manifests if we want to use another hypervisor (like
  Xen or KVM), which does not know anything about those specific mappings.

  Changing the mapping of cmd-db memory from MEMREMAP_WB to MEMREMAP_WT/WC
  removes dependency on correct mappings in Stage 2 tables. This patch
  fixes the issue by updating the mapping to MEMREMAP_WC.

  I tested this on SA8155P with Xen.
