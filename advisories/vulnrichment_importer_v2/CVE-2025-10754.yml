aliases: []
summary: The DocoDoco Store Locator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
  due to missing file type validation in the zip upload functionality in all versions up to,
  and including, 1.0.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Editor-level
  access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote
  code execution possible.
