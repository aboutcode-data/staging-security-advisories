aliases: []
summary: corydolphin/flask-cors is vulnerable to log injection when the log level is set to
  debug. An attacker can inject fake log entries into the log file by sending a specially crafted
  GET request containing a CRLF sequence in the request path. This vulnerability allows attackers
  to corrupt log files, potentially covering tracks of other attacks, confusing log post-processing
  tools, and forging log entries. The issue is due to improper output neutralization for logs.
