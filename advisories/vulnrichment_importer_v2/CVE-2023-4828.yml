aliases: []
summary: An improper check for an exceptional condition in the Insider Threat Management (ITM)
  Server could be used by an attacker to change the server's configuration of any already-registered
  agent so that the agent sends all future communications to an attacker-chosen URL. This could
  result in disclosure of sensitive data events from the agent about the personally identifiable
  information (PII) and intellectual property it monitors, and all such data could be altered
  or deleted before reaching the ITM Server. An attacker must first successfully obtain valid
  agent credentials and agent hostname. All versions prior to 7.14.3.69 are affected.
