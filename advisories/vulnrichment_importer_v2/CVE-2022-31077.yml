aliases: []
summary: KubeEdge is built upon Kubernetes and extends native containerized application orchestration
  and device management to hosts at the Edge. In affected versions a malicious message response
  from KubeEdge can crash the CSI Driver controller server by triggering a nil-pointer dereference
  panic. As a consequence, the CSI Driver controller will be in denial of service. This bug
  has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.0, 1.10.1, and 1.9.3. Users should update to these versions
  to resolve the issue. At the time of writing, no workaround exists.
