aliases: []
summary: OTP is a set of Erlang libraries, which consists of the Erlang runtime system, a number
  of ready-to-use components mainly written in Erlang, and a set of design principles for Erlang
  programs. A regression was introduced into the ssl application of OTP starting at OTP-25.3.2.8,
  OTP-26.2, and OTP-27.0, resulting in a server or client verifying the peer when incorrect
  extended key usage is presented (i.e., a server will verify a client if they have server auth
  ext key usage and vice versa).
