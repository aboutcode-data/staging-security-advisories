aliases: []
summary: Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. Due to an error in command parsing, versions
  prior to 1.0.105 were vulnerable to a bypass of the Claude Code confirmation prompt to trigger
  execution of an untrusted command. Reliably exploiting this requires the ability to add untrusted
  content into a Claude Code context window. Users on standard Claude Code auto-update will
  have received this fix automatically. Users performing manual updates are advised to update
  to version 1.0.105 or the latest version.
