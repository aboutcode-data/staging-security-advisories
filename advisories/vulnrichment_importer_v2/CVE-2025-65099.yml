aliases: []
summary: Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. Prior to version 1.0.39, when running on a machine
  with Yarn 3.0 or above, Claude Code could have been tricked to execute code contained in a
  project via yarn plugins before the user accepted the startup trust dialog. Exploiting this
  would have required a user to start Claude Code in an untrusted directory and to be using
  Yarn 3.0 or above. This issue has been patched in version 1.0.39.
