  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  xen-netfront: Add missing skb_mark_for_recycle

  Notice that skb_mark_for_recycle() is introduced later than fixes tag in
  commit 6a5bcd84e886 ("page_pool: Allow drivers to hint on SKB recycling").

  It is believed that fixes tag were missing a call to page_pool_release_page()
  between v5.9 to v5.14, after which is should have used skb_mark_for_recycle().
  Since v6.6 the call page_pool_release_page() were removed (in
  commit 535b9c61bdef ("net: page_pool: hide page_pool_release_page()")
  and remaining callers converted (in commit 6bfef2ec0172 ("Merge branch
  'net-page_pool-remove-page_pool_release_page'")).

  This leak became visible in v6.8 via commit dba1b8a7ab68 ("mm/page_pool: catch
  page_pool memory leaks").
