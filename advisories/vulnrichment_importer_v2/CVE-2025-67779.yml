aliases: []
summary: It was found that the fix addressing CVE-2025-55184 in React Server Components was
  incomplete and does not prevent a denial of service attack in a specific case. React Server
  Components versions 19.0.2, 19.1.3 and 19.2.2 are affected, allowing unsafe deserialization
  of payloads from HTTP requests to Server Function endpoints. This can cause an infinite loop
  that hangs the server process and may prevent future HTTP requests from being served.
