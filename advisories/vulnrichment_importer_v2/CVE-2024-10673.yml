aliases: []
summary: The Top Store theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized arbitrary plugin installation
  due to a missing capability check on the top_store_install_and_activate_callback() function
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with subscriber-level access and above, to install arbitrary plugins which can contain other
  exploitable vulnerabilities to elevate privileges and gain remote code execution.
