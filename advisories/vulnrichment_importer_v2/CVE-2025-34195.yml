aliases: []
summary: 'Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host versions prior to 1.0.735
  and Application prior to 20.0.1330 (Windows client deployments) contain a remote code execution
  vulnerability during driver installation caused by unquoted program paths. The PrinterInstallerClient
  driver-installation component launches programs using an unquoted path under "C:\Program Files
  (x86)\Printer Properties Pro\Printer Installer". Because the path is unquoted, the operating
  system may execute a program located at a short-path location such as C:\Program.exe before
  the intended binaries in the quoted path. If an attacker can place or cause a program to exist
  at that location, it will be executed with the privileges of the installer process (which
  may be elevated), enabling arbitrary code execution and potential privilege escalation. This
  weakness can be used to achieve remote code execution and full compromise of affected Windows
  endpoints. This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2022-006 — Driver Upload
  Security.'
