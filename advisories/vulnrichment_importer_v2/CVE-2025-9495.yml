aliases: []
summary: The Vitogate 300 web interface fails to enforce proper server-side authentication and
  relies on frontend-based authentication controls. This allows an attacker to simply modify
  HTML elements in the browser’s developer tools to bypass login restrictions. By removing specific
  UI elements, an attacker can reveal the hidden administration menu, giving them full control
  over the device.
