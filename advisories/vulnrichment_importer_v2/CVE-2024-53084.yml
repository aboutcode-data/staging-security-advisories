summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/imagination: Break an object reference loop

  When remaining resources are being cleaned up on driver close,
  outstanding VM mappings may result in resources being leaked, due
  to an object reference loop, as shown below, with each object (or
  set of objects) referencing the object below it:

      PVR GEM Object
      GPU scheduler "finished" fence
      GPU scheduler “scheduled” fence
      PVR driver “done” fence
      PVR Context
      PVR VM Context
      PVR VM Mappings
      PVR GEM Object

  The reference that the PVR VM Context has on the VM mappings is a
  soft one, in the sense that the freeing of outstanding VM mappings
  is done as part of VM context destruction; no reference counts are
  involved, as is the case for all the other references in the loop.

  To break the reference loop during cleanup, free the outstanding
  VM mappings before destroying the PVR Context associated with the
  VM context.
