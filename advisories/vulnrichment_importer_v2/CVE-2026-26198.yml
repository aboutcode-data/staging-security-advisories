aliases: []
summary: Ormar is a async mini ORM for Python. In versions 0.9.9 through 0.22.0, when performing
  aggregate queries, Ormar ORM constructs SQL expressions by passing user-supplied column names
  directly into `sqlalchemy.text()` without any validation or sanitization. The `min()` and
  `max()` methods in the `QuerySet` class accept arbitrary string input as the column parameter.
  While `sum()` and `avg()` are partially protected by an `is_numeric` type check that rejects
  non-existent fields, `min()` and `max()` skip this validation entirely. As a result, an attacker-controlled
  string is embedded as raw SQL inside the aggregate function call. Any unauthorized user can
  exploit this vulnerability to read the entire database contents, including tables unrelated
  to the queried model, by injecting a subquery as the column parameter. Version 0.23.0 contains
  a patch.
