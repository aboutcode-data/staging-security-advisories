summary: A vulnerability in Cisco FXOS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker
  with administrative credentials to cause a buffer overflow condition. The vulnerability is
  due to incorrect bounds checking of values that are parsed from a specific file. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a crafted file that, when it is processed, may
  cause a stack-based buffer overflow. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute
  arbitrary code on the underlying operating system with root privileges. An attacker would
  need to have valid administrative credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
