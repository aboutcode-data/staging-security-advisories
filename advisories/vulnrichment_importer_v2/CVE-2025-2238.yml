aliases: []
summary: The Vikinger theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege in all versions up to,
  and including, 1.9.30. This is due to insufficient user_meta restrictions in the 'vikinger_user_meta_update_ajax'
  function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access
  and above, to escalate their privileges to Administrator-level.
