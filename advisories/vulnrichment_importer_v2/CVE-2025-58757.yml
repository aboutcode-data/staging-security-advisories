aliases: []
summary: MONAI (Medical Open Network for AI) is an AI toolkit for health care imaging. In versions
  up to and including 1.5.0, the `pickle_operations` function in `monai/data/utils.py` automatically
  handles dictionary key-value pairs ending with a specific suffix and deserializes them using
  `pickle.loads()` . This function also lacks any security measures. The deserialization may
  lead to code execution. As of time of publication, no known fixed versions are available.
