summary: |
  An issue was discovered in 6.0 before 6.0.2, 5.2 before 5.2.11, and 4.2 before 4.2.28.
  The `django.contrib.auth.handlers.modwsgi.check_password()` function for authentication via `mod_wsgi` allows remote attackers to enumerate users via a timing attack.
  Earlier, unsupported Django series (such as 5.0.x, 4.1.x, and 3.2.x) were not evaluated and may also be affected.
  Django would like to thank Stackered for reporting this issue.
