summary: An incorrect comparison vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that
  allowed commit smuggling by displaying an incorrect diff. To do so, an attacker would need
  write access to the repository and be able to correctly guess the target branch before it’s
  created by the code maintainer. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise
  Server prior to 3.9 and was fixed in versions 3.4.18, 3.5.15, 3.6.11, 3.7.8, and 3.8.1. This
  vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.
