aliases: []
summary: Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.31.0
  and prior to version 2025.4.1, missing validation in `Mk:api` allows malicious AiScript code
  to access additional endpoints that it isn't designed to have access to. The missing validation
  allows malicious AiScript code to prefix a URL with `../` to step out of the `/api` directory,
  thereby being able to make requests to other endpoints, such as `/files`, `/url`, and `/proxy`.
  Version 2025.4.1 fixes the issue.
