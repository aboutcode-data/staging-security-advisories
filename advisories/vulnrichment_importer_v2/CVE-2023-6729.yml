aliases: []
summary: Nokia SR OS routers allow read-write access to the entire file system via SFTP or SCP
  for users configured with "access console." Consequently, a low privilege authenticated user
  with "access console" can read or replace the router configuration file as well as other files
  stored in the Compact Flash or SD card without using CLI commands. This type of attack can
  lead to a compromise or denial of service of the router after the system is rebooted.
