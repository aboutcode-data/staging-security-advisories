aliases: []
summary: 'If LibreOffice has an encrypted document open and crashes, that document is auto-saved
  encrypted. On restart, LibreOffice offers to restore the document and prompts for the password
  to decrypt it. If the recovery is successful, and if the file format of the recovered document
  was not LibreOffice''s default ODF file format, then affected versions of LibreOffice default
  that subsequent saves of the document are unencrypted. This may lead to a user accidentally
  saving a MSOffice file format document unencrypted while believing it to be encrypted. This
  issue affects: LibreOffice 6-3 series versions prior to 6.3.6; 6-4 series versions prior to
  6.4.3.'
