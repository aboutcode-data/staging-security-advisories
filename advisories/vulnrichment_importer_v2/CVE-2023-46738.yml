aliases: []
summary: CubeFS is an open-source cloud-native file storage system. A security vulnerability
  was found in CubeFS HandlerNode in versions prior to 3.3.1 that could allow authenticated
  users to send maliciously-crafted requests that would crash the ObjectNode and deny other
  users from using it. The root cause was improper handling of incoming HTTP requests that could
  allow an attacker to control the ammount of memory that the ObjectNode would allocate. A malicious
  request could make the ObjectNode allocate more memory that the machine had available, and
  the attacker could exhaust memory by way of a single malicious request. An attacker would
  need to be authenticated in order to invoke the vulnerable code with their malicious request
  and have permissions to delete objects. In addition, the attacker would need to know the names
  of existing buckets of the CubeFS deployment - otherwise the request would be rejected before
  it reached the vulnerable code. As such, the most likely attacker is an inside user or an
  attacker that has breached the account of an existing user in the cluster. The issue has been
  patched in v3.3.1. There is no other mitigation besides upgrading.
