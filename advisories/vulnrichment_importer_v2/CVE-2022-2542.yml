aliases: []
summary: The uContext for Clickbank plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery to Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including 3.9.1. This is due to missing
  nonce validation in the ~/app/sites/ajax/actions/keyword_save.php file that is called via
  the doAjax() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the
  plugin's settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick
  a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
