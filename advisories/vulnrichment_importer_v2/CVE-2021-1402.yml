aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the software-based SSL/TLS message handler of Cisco Firepower Threat
  Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload
  of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability
  is due to insufficient validation of SSL/TLS messages when the device performs software-based
  SSL decryption. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SSL/TLS
  message through an affected device. SSL/TLS messages sent to an affected device do not trigger
  this vulnerability. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a process to crash.
  This crash would then trigger a reload of the device. No manual intervention is needed to
  recover the device after the reload.
