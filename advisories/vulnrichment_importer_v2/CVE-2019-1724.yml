aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the session management functionality of the web-based interface
  for Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to hijack a valid user session on an affected system. An attacker could use
  this impersonated session to create a new user account or otherwise control the device with
  the privileges of the hijacked session. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper session
  management controls. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP
  request to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to take control
  of an existing user session on the device. Exploitation of the vulnerability requires that
  an authorized user session is active and that the attacker can craft an HTTP request to impersonate
  that session.
