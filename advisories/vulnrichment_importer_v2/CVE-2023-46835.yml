aliases: []
summary: |
  The current setup of the quarantine page tables assumes that the
  quarantine domain (dom_io) has been initialized with an address width
  of DEFAULT_DOMAIN_ADDRESS_WIDTH (48) and hence 4 page table levels.

  However dom_io being a PV domain gets the AMD-Vi IOMMU page tables
  levels based on the maximum (hot pluggable) RAM address, and hence on
  systems with no RAM above the 512GB mark only 3 page-table levels are
  configured in the IOMMU.

  On systems without RAM above the 512GB boundary
  amd_iommu_quarantine_init() will setup page tables for the scratch
  page with 4 levels, while the IOMMU will be configured to use 3 levels
  only, resulting in the last page table directory (PDE) effectively
  becoming a page table entry (PTE), and hence a device in quarantine
  mode gaining write access to the page destined to be a PDE.

  Due to this page table level mismatch, the sink page the device gets
  read/write access to is no longer cleared between device assignment,
  possibly leading to data leaks.
