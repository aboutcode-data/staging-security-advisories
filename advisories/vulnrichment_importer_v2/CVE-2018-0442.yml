aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP)
  protocol component of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to retrieve memory contents, which could lead to the disclosure of confidential
  information. The vulnerability is due to insufficient condition checks in the part of the
  code that handles CAPWAP keepalive requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a crafted CAPWAP keepalive packet to a vulnerable Cisco WLC device. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve the contents of device memory, which could lead
  to the disclosure of confidential information.
