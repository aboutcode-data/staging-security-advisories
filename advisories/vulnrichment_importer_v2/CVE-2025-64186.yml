aliases: []
summary: Evervault is a payment security solution. A vulnerability was identified in the `evervault-go`
  SDK’s attestation verification logic in versions of `evervault-go` prior to 1.3.2 that may
  allow incomplete documents to pass validation. This may cause the client to trust an enclave
  operator that does not meet expected integrity guarantees. The exploitability of this issue
  is limited in Evervault-hosted environments as an attacker would require the pre-requisite
  ability to serve requests from specific evervault domain names, following from our ACME challenge
  based TLS certificate acquisition pipeline. The vulnerability primarily affects applications
  which only check PCR8. Though the efficacy is also reduced for applications that check all
  PCR values, the impact is largely remediated by checking PCR 0, 1 and 2. The identified issue
  has been addressed in version 1.3.2 by validating attestation documents before storing in
  the cache, and replacing the naive equality checks with a new SatisfiedBy check. Those who
  useevervault-go to attest Enclaves that are hosted outside of Evervault environments and cannot
  upgrade have two possible workarounds available. Modify the application logic to fail verification
  if PCR8 is not explicitly present and non-empty and/or add custom pre-validation to reject
  documents that omit any required PCRs.
