  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net/sched: taprio: extend minimum interval restriction to entire cycle too

  It is possible for syzbot to side-step the restriction imposed by the
  blamed commit in the Fixes: tag, because the taprio UAPI permits a
  cycle-time different from (and potentially shorter than) the sum of
  entry intervals.

  We need one more restriction, which is that the cycle time itself must
  be larger than N * ETH_ZLEN bit times, where N is the number of schedule
  entries. This restriction needs to apply regardless of whether the cycle
  time came from the user or was the implicit, auto-calculated value, so
  we move the existing "cycle == 0" check outside the "if "(!new->cycle_time)"
  branch. This way covers both conditions and scenarios.

  Add a selftest which illustrates the issue triggered by syzbot.
