datasource_url: https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2022/42xxx/CVE-2022-42268.json
aliases: []
summary: Omniverse Kit contains a vulnerability in the reference applications Create, Audio2Face,
  Isaac Sim, View, Code, and Machinima. These applications allow executable Python code to be
  embedded in Universal Scene Description (USD) files to customize all aspects of a scene. If
  a user opens a USD file that contains embedded Python code in one of these applications, the
  embedded Python code automatically runs with the privileges of the user who opened the file.
  As a result, an unprivileged remote attacker could craft a USD file containing malicious Python
  code and persuade a local user to open the file, which may lead to information disclosure,
  data tampering, and denial of service.
