aliases: []
summary: Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating
  parallel jobs on Kubernetes. Versions 3.6.13 and below and versions 3.7.0 through 3.7.4, contain
  unsafe untar code that handles symbolic links in archives. Concretely, the computation of
  a link's target and the subsequent check are flawed. An attacker can overwrite the file /var/run/argo/argoexec
  with a script of their choice, which would be executed at the pod's start. The patch deployed
  against CVE-2025-62156 is ineffective against malicious archives containing symbolic links.
  This issue is fixed in versions 3.6.14 and 3.7.5.
