  ASoC: q6afe-clocks: fix reprobing of the driver

  Q6afe-clocks driver can get reprobed. For example if the APR services
  are restarted after the firmware crash. However currently Q6afe-clocks
  driver will oops because hw.init will get cleared during first _probe
  call. Rewrite the driver to fill the clock data at runtime rather than
  using big static array of clocks.
