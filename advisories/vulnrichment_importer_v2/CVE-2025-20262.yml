aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the Protocol Independent Multicast Version 6 (PIM6) feature of\
  \ Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS\
  \ mode could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, remote attacker to trigger a crash of\
  \ the PIM6 process, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability\
  \ is due to improper processing of PIM6 ephemeral data queries. An attacker could exploit\
  \ this vulnerability by sending a crafted ephemeral query to an affected device through one\
  \ of the following methods: NX-API REST, NETCONF, RESTConf, gRPC, or Model Driven Telemetry.\
  \ A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the PIM6 process to crash and restart,\
  \ causing potential adjacency flaps and resulting in a DoS of the PIM6 and ephemeral query\
  \ processes."
