summary: pgAdmin <= 8.3 is affected by a path-traversal vulnerability while deserializing users’
  sessions in the session handling code. If the server is running on Windows, an unauthenticated
  attacker can load and deserialize remote pickle objects and gain code execution. If the server
  is running on POSIX/Linux, an authenticated attacker can upload pickle objects, deserialize
  them, and gain code execution.
