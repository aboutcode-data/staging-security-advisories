aliases: []
summary: The WP Discourse plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all
  versions up to, and including, 2.5.9. This is due to the plugin unconditionally sending Discourse
  API credentials (Api-Key and Api-Username headers) to any host specified in a post's discourse_permalink
  custom field during comment synchronization. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with author-level access and above, to exfiltrate sensitive Discourse API credentials to attacker-controlled
  servers, as well as query internal services and potentially perform further attacks.
