aliases: []
summary: KubeVirt is a virtual machine management add-on for Kubernetes. Versions 1.5.3 and
  below, and 1.6.0 contained a flawed implementation of the Kubernetes aggregation layer's authentication
  flow which could enable bypass of RBAC controls. It was discovered that the virt-api component
  fails to correctly authenticate the client when receiving API requests over mTLS. In particular,
  it fails to validate the CN (Common Name) field in the received client TLS certificates against
  the set of allowed values defined in the extension-apiserver-authentication configmap. Failre
  to validate certain fields in the client TLS certificate may allow an attacker to bypass existing
  RBAC controls by directly communicating with the aggregated API server, impersonating the
  Kubernetes API server and its aggregator component. This issue is fixed in versions 1.5.3
  and 1.6.1.
