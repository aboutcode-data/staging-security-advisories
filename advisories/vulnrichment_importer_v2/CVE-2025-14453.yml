aliases: []
summary: The My Album Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the 'style_css' shortcode attribute in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.4 due to
  insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
  that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
