  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  cpumap: Zero-initialise xdp_rxq_info struct before running XDP program

  When running an XDP program that is attached to a cpumap entry, we don't
  initialise the xdp_rxq_info data structure being used in the xdp_buff
  that backs the XDP program invocation. Tobias noticed that this leads to
  random values being returned as the xdp_md->rx_queue_index value for XDP
  programs running in a cpumap.

  This means we're basically returning the contents of the uninitialised
  memory, which is bad. Fix this by zero-initialising the rxq data
  structure before running the XDP program.
