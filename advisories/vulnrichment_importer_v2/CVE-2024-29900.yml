aliases: []
summary: Electron Packager bundles Electron-based application source code with a renamed Electron
  executable and supporting files into folders ready for distribution. A random segment of ~1-10kb
  of Node.js heap memory allocated either side of a known buffer will be leaked into the final
  executable. This memory _could_ contain sensitive information such as environment variables,
  secrets files, etc. This issue is patched in 18.3.1.
