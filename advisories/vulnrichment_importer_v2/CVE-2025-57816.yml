aliases: []
summary: Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform. Prior to version 2.69.1, the
  Fides Webserver API's built-in IP-based rate limiting is ineffective in environments with
  CDNs, proxies or load balancers. The system incorrectly applies rate limits based on directly
  connected infrastructure IPs rather than client IPs, and stores counters in-memory rather
  than in a shared store. This allows attackers to bypass intended rate limits and potentially
  cause denial of service. This vulnerability only affects deployments relying on Fides's built-in
  rate limiting for protection. Deployments using external rate limiting solutions (WAFs, API
  gateways, etc.) are not affected. Version 2.69.1 fixes the issue. There are no application-level
  workarounds. However, rate limiting may instead be implemented externally at the infrastructure
  level using a WAF, API Gateway, or similar technology.
