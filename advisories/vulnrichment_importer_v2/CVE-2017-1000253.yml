summary: Linux distributions that have not patched their long-term kernels with https://git.kernel.org/linus/a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86
  (committed on April 14, 2015). This kernel vulnerability was fixed in April 2015 by commit
  a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (backported to Linux 3.10.77 in May 2015), but it
  was not recognized as a security threat. With CONFIG_ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_RANDOMIZE_PIE enabled,
  and a normal top-down address allocation strategy, load_elf_binary() will attempt to map a
  PIE binary into an address range immediately below mm->mmap_base. Unfortunately, load_elf_
  binary() does not take account of the need to allocate sufficient space for the entire binary
  which means that, while the first PT_LOAD segment is mapped below mm->mmap_base, the subsequent
  PT_LOAD segment(s) end up being mapped above mm->mmap_base into the are that is supposed to
  be the "gap" between the stack and the binary.
