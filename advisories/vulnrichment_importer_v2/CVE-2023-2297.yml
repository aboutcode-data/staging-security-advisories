aliases: []
summary: The Profile Builder – User Profile & User Registration Forms plugin for WordPress is
  vulnerable to unauthorized password resets  in versions up to, and including 3.9.0. This is
  due to the plugin using native password reset functionality, with insufficient validation
  on the password reset function (wppb_front_end_password_recovery). The function uses the plaintext
  value of a password reset key instead of a hashed value which means it can easily be retrieved
  and subsequently used. An attacker can leverage CVE-2023-0814, or another vulnerability like
  SQL Injection in another plugin or theme installed on the site to successfully exploit this
  vulnerability.
