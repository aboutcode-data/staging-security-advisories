summary: A vulnerability in the user account management system of Cisco AsyncOS for Cisco Content
  Security Management Appliance (SMA) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate
  their privileges to root. This vulnerability is due to a procedural flaw in the password generation
  algorithm. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by enabling specific Administrator-only
  features and connecting to the appliance through the CLI with elevated privileges. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root and access the underlying
  operating system. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid Administrator
  credentials.
