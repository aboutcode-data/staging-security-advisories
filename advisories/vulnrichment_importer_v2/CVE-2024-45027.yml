summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  usb: xhci: Check for xhci->interrupters being allocated in xhci_mem_clearup()

  If xhci_mem_init() fails, it calls into xhci_mem_cleanup() to mop
  up the damage. If it fails early enough, before xhci->interrupters
  is allocated but after xhci->max_interrupters has been set, which
  happens in most (all?) cases, things get uglier, as xhci_mem_cleanup()
  unconditionally derefences xhci->interrupters. With prejudice.

  Gate the interrupt freeing loop with a check on xhci->interrupters
  being non-NULL.

  Found while debugging a DMA allocation issue that led the XHCI driver
  on this exact path.
