aliases: []
summary: macrozheng mall version 1.0.3 and prior contains an authentication vulnerability in
  the mall-portal password reset workflow that allows an unauthenticated attacker to reset arbitrary
  user account passwords using only a victim’s telephone number. The password reset flow exposes
  the one-time password (OTP) directly in the API response and validates password reset requests
  solely by comparing the provided OTP to a value stored by telephone number, without verifying
  user identity or ownership of the telephone number. This enables remote account takeover of
  any user with a known or guessable telephone number.
