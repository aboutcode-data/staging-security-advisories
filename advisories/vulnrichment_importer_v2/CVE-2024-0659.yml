summary: The Easy Digital Downloads – Sell Digital Files (eCommerce Store & Payments Made Easy)
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the variable pricing
  option title in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.6 due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with shop manger-level
  access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
  an injected page.
