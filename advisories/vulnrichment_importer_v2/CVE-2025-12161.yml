summary: The Smart Auto Upload Images plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
  due to missing file type validation in the auto-image creation functionality in all versions

  access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote
  code execution possible.
