  media: v4l: async: Fix notifier list entry init

  struct v4l2_async_notifier has several list_head members, but only
  waiting_list and done_list are initialized. notifier_entry was kept
  'zeroed' leading to an uninitialized list_head.
  This results in a NULL-pointer dereference if csi2_async_register() fails,
  e.g. node for remote endpoint is disabled, and returns -ENOTCONN.
  The following calls to v4l2_async_nf_unregister() results in a NULL
  pointer dereference.
  Add the missing list head initializer.
