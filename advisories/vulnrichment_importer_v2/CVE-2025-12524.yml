summary: The Post Type Switcher plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object
  Reference in versions up to, and including, 4.0.0 due to missing validation on a user controlled

  to modify the post type of arbitrary posts and pages they do not own, including those created
  by administrators, which can lead to site disruption, broken navigation, and SEO impact.
