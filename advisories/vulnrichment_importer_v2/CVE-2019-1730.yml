aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Bash shell implementation for Cisco NX-OS Software could allow
  an authenticated, local attacker to bypass the limited command set of the restricted Guest
  Shell and execute commands at the privilege level of a network-admin user outside of the Guest
  Shell. The attacker must authenticate with valid administrator device credentials. The vulnerability
  is due to the incorrect implementation of a CLI command that allows a Bash command to be incorrectly
  invoked on the Guest Shell CLI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating
  to the device and entering a crafted command at the Guest Shell prompt. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to issue commands that should be restricted by a Guest Shell account.
