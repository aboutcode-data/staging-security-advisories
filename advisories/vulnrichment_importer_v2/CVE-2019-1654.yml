aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the development shell (devshell) authentication for Cisco Aironet
  Series Access Points (APs) running the Cisco AP-COS operating system could allow an authenticated,
  local attacker to access the development shell without proper authentication, which allows
  for root access to the underlying Linux OS. The attacker would need valid device credentials.
  The vulnerability exists because the software improperly validates user-supplied input at
  the CLI authentication prompt for development shell access. An attacker could exploit this
  vulnerability by authenticating to the device and entering crafted input at the CLI. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to access the AP development shell without proper authentication,
  which allows for root access to the underlying Linux OS. Software versions prior to 8.3.150.0,
  8.5.135.0, and 8.8.100.0 are affected.
