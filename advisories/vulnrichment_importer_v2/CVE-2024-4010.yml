aliases: []
summary: The Email Subscribers by Icegram Express plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
  access of data, modification of data, and loss of data due to a missing capability check on
  the handle_ajax_request function in all versions up to, and including, 5.7.19. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to cause
  a loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, by performing multiple unauthorized
  actions. Some of these actions could also be leveraged to conduct PHP Object Injection and
  SQL Injection attacks.
