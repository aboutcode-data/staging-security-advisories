aliases: []
summary: Stimulsoft GmbH Stimulsoft Designer (Web) 2023.1.3 is vulnerable to Server Side Request
  Forgery (SSRF). TThe Reporting Designer (Web) offers the possibility to embed sources from
  external locations. If the user chooses an external location, the request to that resource
  is performed by the server rather than the client. Therefore, the server causes outbound traffic
  and potentially imports data. An attacker may also leverage this behaviour to exfiltrate data
  of machines on the internal network of the server hosting the Stimulsoft Reporting Designer
  (Web).
