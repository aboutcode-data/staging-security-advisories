aliases: []
summary: 'TorchServe is a flexible and easy-to-use tool for serving and scaling PyTorch models
  in production. In affected versions the two gRPC ports 7070 and 7071, are not bound to [localhost](http://localhost/)
  by default, so when TorchServe is launched, these two interfaces are bound to all interfaces.
  Customers using PyTorch inference Deep Learning Containers (DLC) through Amazon SageMaker
  and EKS are not affected. This issue in TorchServe has been fixed in PR #3083. TorchServe
  release 0.11.0 includes the fix to address this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade.
  There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.'
