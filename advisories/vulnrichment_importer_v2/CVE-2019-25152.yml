summary: The Abandoned Cart Lite for WooCommerce and Abandoned Cart Pro for WooCommerce plugins
  for WordPress are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via multiple parameters in versions
  up to, and including, 5.1.3 and 7.12.0 respectively, due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary
  web scripts in user input that will execute on the admin dashboard.
