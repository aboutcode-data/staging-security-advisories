aliases: []
summary: Nextcloud server is an open source personal cloud solution. In affected versions an
  attacker could brute force to find if federated sharing is being used and potentially try
  to brute force access tokens for federated shares (`a-zA-Z0-9` ^ 15). It is recommended that
  the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 22.2.9, 23.0.6 or 24.0.2. Users unable to upgrade may
  disable federated sharing via the Admin Sharing settings in `index.php/settings/admin/sharing`.
