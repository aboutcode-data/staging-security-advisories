aliases: []
summary: Some access control products are vulnerable to a session hijacking attack because the
  product does not update the session ID after a user successfully logs in. To exploit the vulnerability,
  attackers have to request the session ID at the same time as a valid user logs in, and gain
  device operation permissions by forging the IP and session ID of an authenticated user.
