aliases: []
summary: Specific MongoDB Rust Driver versions can include credentials used by the connection
  pool to authenticate connections in the monitoring event that is emitted when the pool is
  created. The user's logging infrastructure could then potentially ingest these events and
  unexpectedly leak the credentials. Note that such monitoring is not enabled by default. This
  issue affects MongoDB Rust Driver version 2.0.0-alpha, MongoDB Rust Driver version 2.0.0-alpha1
  and MongoDB Rust Driver version 1.0.0 through to and including 1.2.1
