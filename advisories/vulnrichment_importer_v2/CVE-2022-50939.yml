aliases: []
summary: e107 CMS version 3.2.1 contains a critical file upload vulnerability that allows authenticated
  administrators to override arbitrary server files through path traversal. The vulnerability
  exists in the Media Manager's remote URL upload functionality (image.php) where the upload_caption
  parameter is not properly sanitized. An attacker with administrative privileges can use directory
  traversal sequences (../../../) in the upload_caption field to overwrite critical system files
  outside the intended upload directory. This can lead to complete compromise of the web application
  by overwriting configuration files, executable scripts, or other critical system components.
  The vulnerability was discovered by Hubert Wojciechowski and affects the image.php component
  in the admin interface.
