datasource_id: vulnrichment_importer_v2/CVE-2024-6095

aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the /models/apply endpoint of mudler/localai versions 2.15.0 allows
  for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and partial Local File Inclusion (LFI). The endpoint
  supports both http(s):// and file:// schemes, where the latter can lead to LFI. However, the
  output is limited due to the length of the error message. This vulnerability can be exploited
  by an attacker with network access to the LocalAI instance, potentially allowing unauthorized
  access to internal HTTP(s) servers and partial reading of local files. The issue is fixed
  in version 2.17.
