aliases: []
summary: The WorklogPRO - Jira Timesheets plugin in the Jira Data Center before 4.24.2-jira9,
  4.24.2-jira10 and 4.24.2-jira11 allows attackers to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript via
  XSS. This is exploited via a crafted payload placed in the name of a filter. This code is
  executed in the browser when the user attempts to create a timesheet with the filter timesheet
  type on the custom timesheet dialog because the filter name is not properly sanitized during
  the action.
