aliases: []
summary: A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists in Agnitum Outpost Internet Security
  8.1 that allows an unprivileged user to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. The
  flaw resides in the acs.exe component, which exposes a named pipe that accepts unauthenticated
  commands. By exploiting a directory traversal weakness in the pipe protocol, an attacker can
  instruct the service to load a malicious DLL from a user-controlled location. The DLL is then
  executed in the context of the privileged service.
