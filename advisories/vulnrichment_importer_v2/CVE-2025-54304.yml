aliases: []
summary: 'An issue was discovered on Thermo Fisher Ion Torrent OneTouch 2 INS1005527 devices.
  When they are powered on, an X11 display server is started. The display server listens on
  all network interfaces and is accessible over port 6000. The X11 access control list, by default,
  allows connections from 127.0.0.1 and 192.168.2.15. If a device is powered on and later connected
  to a network with DHCP, the device may not be assigned the 192.168.2.15 IP address, leaving
  the display server accessible by other devices on the network. The exposed X11 display server
  can then be used to gain root privileges and the ability to execute code remotely by interacting
  with matchbox-desktop and spawning a terminal. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products
  that are no longer supported by the maintainer.'
