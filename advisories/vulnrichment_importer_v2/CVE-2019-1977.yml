aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability within the Endpoint Learning feature of Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches
  running in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode could allow an unauthenticated, remote
  attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an endpoint device in certain circumstances.
  The vulnerability is due to improper endpoint learning when packets are received on a specific
  port from outside the ACI fabric and destined to an endpoint located on a border leaf when
  Disable Remote Endpoint Learning has been enabled. This can result in a Remote (XR) entry
  being created for the impacted endpoint that will become stale if the endpoint migrates to
  a different port or leaf switch. This results in traffic not reaching the impacted endpoint
  until the Remote entry can be relearned by another mechanism.
