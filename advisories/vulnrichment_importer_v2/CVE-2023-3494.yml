aliases: []
summary: The fwctl driver implements a state machine which is executed when a bhyve guest accesses
  certain x86 I/O ports.  The interface lets the guest copy a string into a buffer resident
  in the bhyve process' memory.  A bug in the state machine implementation can result in a buffer
  overflowing when copying this string. Malicious, privileged software running in a guest VM
  can exploit the buffer overflow to achieve code execution on the host in the bhyve userspace
  process, which typically runs as root, mitigated by the capabilities assigned through the
  Capsicum sandbox available to the bhyve process.
