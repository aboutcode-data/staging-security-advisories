aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) 9.0 and 10.0 and 10.1. A stored
  cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Classic Web Client due to insufficient
  sanitization of HTML content in ICS files. When a user views an e-mail message containing
  a malicious ICS entry, its embedded JavaScript executes via an ontoggle event inside a <details>
  tag. This allows an attacker to run arbitrary JavaScript within the victim's session, potentially
  leading to unauthorized actions such as setting e-mail filters to redirect messages to an
  attacker-controlled address. As a result, an attacker can perform unauthorized actions on
  the victim's account, including e-mail redirection and data exfiltration.
