  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ceph: prevent use-after-free in encode_cap_msg()

  In fs/ceph/caps.c, in encode_cap_msg(), "use after free" error was
  caught by KASAN at this line - 'ceph_buffer_get(arg->xattr_buf);'. This
  implies before the refcount could be increment here, it was freed.

  In same file, in "handle_cap_grant()" refcount is decremented by this
  line - 'ceph_buffer_put(ci->i_xattrs.blob);'. It appears that a race
  occurred and resource was freed by the latter line before the former
  line could increment it.

  encode_cap_msg() is called by __send_cap() and __send_cap() is called by
  ceph_check_caps() after calling __prep_cap(). __prep_cap() is where
  arg->xattr_buf is assigned to ci->i_xattrs.blob. This is the spot where
  the refcount must be increased to prevent "use after free" error.
