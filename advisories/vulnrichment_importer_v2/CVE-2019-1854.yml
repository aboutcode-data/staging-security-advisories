aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the management web interface of Cisco Expressway Series could allow
  an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a directory traversal attack against an affected
  device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation on the web interface. An
  attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web interface.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass security restrictions and access the
  web interface of a Cisco Unified Communications Manager associated with the affected device.
  Valid credentials would still be required to access the Cisco Unified Communications Manager
  interface.
