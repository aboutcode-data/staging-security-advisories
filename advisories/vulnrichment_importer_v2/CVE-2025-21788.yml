  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw: fix memleak in certain XDP cases

  If the XDP program doesn't result in XDP_PASS then we leak the
  memory allocated by am65_cpsw_build_skb().

  It is pointless to allocate SKB memory before running the XDP
  program as we would be wasting CPU cycles for cases other than XDP_PASS.
  Move the SKB allocation after evaluating the XDP program result.

  This fixes the memleak. A performance boost is seen for XDP_DROP test.

  XDP_DROP test:
  Before: 460256 rx/s                  0 err/s
  After:  784130 rx/s                  0 err/s
