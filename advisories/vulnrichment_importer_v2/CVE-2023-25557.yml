aliases: []
summary: DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. The DataHub frontend acts as a proxy able
  to forward any REST or GraphQL requests to the backend. The goal of this proxy is to perform
  authentication if needed and forward HTTP requests to the DataHub Metadata Store (GMS). It
  has been discovered that the proxy does not adequately construct the URL when forwarding data
  to GMS, allowing external users to reroute requests from the DataHub Frontend to any arbitrary
  hosts. As a result attackers may be able to reroute a request from originating from the frontend
  proxy to any other server and return the result. This vulnerability was discovered and reported
  by the GitHub Security lab and is tracked as GHSL-2022-076.
