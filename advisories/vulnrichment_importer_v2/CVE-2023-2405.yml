summary: The CRM and Lead Management by vcita plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.6.2. This is due to missing nonce validation

  the plugin's settings and inject malicious JavaScript via a forged request granted they can
  trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
