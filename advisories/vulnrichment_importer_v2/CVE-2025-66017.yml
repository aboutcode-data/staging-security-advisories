aliases: []
summary: CGGMP24 is a state-of-art ECDSA TSS protocol that supports 1-round signing (requires
  3 preprocessing rounds), identifiable abort, and a key refresh protocol. In versions 0.6.3
  and prior of cggmp21 and version 0.7.0-alpha.1 of cggmp24, presignatures can be used in the
  way that significantly reduces security. cggmp24 version 0.7.0-alpha.2 release contains API
  changes that make it impossible to use presignatures in contexts in which it reduces security.
