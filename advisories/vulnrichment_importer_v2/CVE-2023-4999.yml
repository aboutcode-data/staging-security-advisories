aliases: []
summary: The Horizontal scrolling announcement plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection
  via the plugin's [horizontal-scrolling] shortcode in versions up to, and including, 9.2 due
  to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation
  on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level
  and above permissions to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that
  can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
