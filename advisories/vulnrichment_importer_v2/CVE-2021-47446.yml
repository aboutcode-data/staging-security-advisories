  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/msm/a4xx: fix error handling in a4xx_gpu_init()

  This code returns 1 on error instead of a negative error.  It leads to
  an Oops in the caller.  A second problem is that the check for
  "if (ret != -ENODATA)" cannot be true because "ret" is set to 1.
