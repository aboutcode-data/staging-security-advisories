aliases: []
summary: pycares is a Python module which provides an interface to c-ares. c-ares is a C library
  that performs DNS requests and name resolutions asynchronously. Prior to version 4.9.0, pycares
  is vulnerable to a use-after-free condition that occurs when a Channel object is garbage collected
  while DNS queries are still pending. This results in a fatal Python error and interpreter
  crash. The vulnerability has been fixed in pycares 4.9.0 by implementing a safe channel destruction
  mechanism.
