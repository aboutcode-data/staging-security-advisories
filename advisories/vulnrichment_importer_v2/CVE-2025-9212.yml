aliases: []
summary: The WP Dispatcher plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due
  to missing file type validation in the wp_dispatcher_process_upload() function in all versions
  up to, and including, 1.2.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
  access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote
  code execution possible. The directory does have an .htaccess file which limits the ability
  to achieve remote code execution.
