aliases: []
summary: The FlyingPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a
  missing capability check on its AJAX actions in versions up to, and including, 3.9.6. This
  makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above,
  to interact with the plugin in ways administrators are intended to. One action (save_config)
  allows for the configuration of an external CDN. This could be used to include malicious javascript
  from a source controlled by the attacker.
