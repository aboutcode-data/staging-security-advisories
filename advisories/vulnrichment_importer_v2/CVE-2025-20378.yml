aliases: []
summary: In Splunk Enterprise versions below 10.0.1, 9.4.5, 9.3.7, 9.2.9, and Splunk Cloud Platform
  versions below 10.0.2503.5, 9.3.2411.111, and 9.3.2408.121, an unauthenticated attacker could
  craft a malicious URL using the `return_to` parameter of the Splunk Web login endpoint. When
  an authenticated user visits the malicious URL, it could cause an unvalidated redirect to
  an external malicious site. To be successful, the attacker has to trick the victim into initiating
  a request from their browser. The unauthenticated attacker should not be able to exploit the
  vulnerability at will.
