aliases: []
summary: The All-in-One WP Migration and Backup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
  PHP Code Injection due to missing file type validation during the export in all versions up
  to, and including, 7.86. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level
  access and above, to create an export file with the .php extension on the affected site's
  server, adding an arbitrary PHP code to it, which may make remote code execution possible.
