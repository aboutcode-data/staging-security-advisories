aliases: []
summary: E.D.D.I (Enhanced Dialog Driven Interface) is a middleware to connect and manage LLM
  API bots. In versions before 5.5.0, an attacker with access to the `/backup/import` API endpoint
  can write arbitrary files to locations outside the intended extraction directory due to a
  Zip Slip vulnerability. Although the application runs as a non-root user (`185`), limiting
  direct impact on system-level files, this vulnerability can still be exploited to overwrite
  application files (e.g., JAR libraries) owned by the application user. This overwrite can
  potentially lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the application's context. This issue
  has been patched in version 5.5.0.
