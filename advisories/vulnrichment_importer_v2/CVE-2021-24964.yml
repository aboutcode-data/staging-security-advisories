aliases: []
summary: The LiteSpeed Cache WordPress plugin before 4.4.4 does not properly verify that requests
  are coming from QUIC.cloud servers, allowing attackers to make requests to certain endpoints
  by using a specific X-Forwarded-For header value. In addition, one of the endpoint could be
  used to set CSS code if a setting is enabled, which will then be output in some pages without
  being sanitised and escaped. Combining those two issues, an unauthenticated attacker could
  put Cross-Site Scripting payloads in pages visited by users.
