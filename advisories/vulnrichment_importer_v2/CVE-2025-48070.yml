aliases: []
summary: Plane is open-source project management software. Versions prior to 0.23 have insecure
  permissions in UserSerializer that allows users to change fields that are meant to be read-only,
  such as email. This can lead to account takeover when chained with another vulnerability such
  as cross-site scripting (XSS). Version 0.23 fixes the issue.
