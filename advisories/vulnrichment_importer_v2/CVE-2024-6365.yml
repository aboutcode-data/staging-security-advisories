aliases: []
summary: The Product Table by WBW plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution
  in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.1 via the 'saveCustomTitle' function. This is due
  to missing authorization and lack of sanitization of appended data in the languages/customTitle.php
  file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute code on the server.
