aliases: []
summary: Sakai is a Collaboration and Learning Environment. Prior to versions 23.5 and 25.0,
  EncryptionUtilityServiceImpl initialized an AES256TextEncryptor password (serverSecretKey)
  using RandomStringUtils with the default java.util.Random. java.util.Random is a non‑cryptographic
  PRNG and can be predicted from limited state/seed information (e.g., start time window), substantially
  reducing the effective search space of the generated key. An attacker who can obtain ciphertexts
  (e.g., exported or at‑rest strings protected by this service) and approximate the PRNG seed
  can feasibly reconstruct the serverSecretKey and decrypt affected data. SAK-49866 is patched
  in Sakai 23.5, 25.0, and trunk.
