aliases: []
summary: melange allows users to build apk packages using declarative pipelines. From version
  0.10.0 to before 0.40.3, an attacker who can influence inputs to the patch pipeline could
  execute arbitrary shell commands on the build host. The patch pipeline in pkg/build/pipelines/patch.yaml
  embeds input-derived values (series paths, patch filenames, and numeric parameters) into shell
  scripts without proper quoting or validation, allowing shell metacharacters to break out of
  their intended context. The vulnerability affects the built-in patch pipeline which can be
  invoked through melange build and melange license-check operations. An attacker who can control
  patch-related inputs (e.g., through pull request-driven CI, build-as-a-service, or by influencing
  melange configurations) can inject shell metacharacters such as backticks, command substitutions
  $(…), semicolons, pipes, or redirections to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges
  of the melange build process. This issue has been patched in version 0.40.3.
