  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  platform/surface: aggregator: Add missing call to ssam_request_sync_free()

  Although rare, ssam_request_sync_init() can fail. In that case, the
  request should be freed via ssam_request_sync_free(). Currently it is
  leaked instead. Fix this.
