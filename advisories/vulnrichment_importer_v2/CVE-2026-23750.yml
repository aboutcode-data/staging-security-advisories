aliases: []
summary: Golioth Pouch version 0.1.0, prior to commit 1b2219a1, contains a heap-based buffer
  overflow in BLE GATT server certificate handling. server_cert_write() allocates a heap buffer
  of size CONFIG_POUCH_SERVER_CERT_MAX_LEN when receiving the first fragment, then appends subsequent
  fragments using memcpy() without verifying that sufficient capacity remains. An adjacent BLE
  client can send unauthenticated fragments whose combined size exceeds the allocated buffer,
  causing a heap overflow and crash; integrity impact is also possible due to memory corruption.
