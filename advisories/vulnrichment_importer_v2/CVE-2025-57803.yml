aliases: []
summary: ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital
  images. Prior to versions 6.9.13-28 and 7.1.2-2 for ImageMagick's 32-bit build, a 32-bit integer
  overflow in the BMP encoder’s scanline-stride computation collapses bytes_per_line (stride)
  to a tiny value while the per-row writer still emits 3 × width bytes for 24-bpp images. The
  row base pointer advances using the (overflowed) stride, so the first row immediately writes
  past its slot and into adjacent heap memory with attacker-controlled bytes. This is a classic,
  powerful primitive for heap corruption in common auto-convert pipelines. This issue has been
  patched in versions 6.9.13-28 and 7.1.2-2.
