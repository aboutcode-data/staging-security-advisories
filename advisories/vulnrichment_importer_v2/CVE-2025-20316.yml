summary: "A vulnerability in the access control list (ACL) programming of Cisco IOS XE Software\
  \ for Cisco Catalyst 9500X and 9600X Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote\
  \ attacker to bypass a configured ACL on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due\
  \ to the flooding of traffic from an unlearned MAC address on a switch virtual interface (SVI)\
  \ that has an egress ACL applied. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by causing\
  \ the VLAN to flush its MAC address table. This condition can also occur if the MAC address\
  \ table is full. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass an egress ACL on\
  \ an affected device."
