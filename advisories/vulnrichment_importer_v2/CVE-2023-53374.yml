aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  Bluetooth: hci_conn: fail SCO/ISO via hci_conn_failed if ACL gone early

  Not calling hci_(dis)connect_cfm before deleting conn referred to by a
  socket generally results to use-after-free.

  When cleaning up SCO connections when the parent ACL is deleted too
  early, use hci_conn_failed to do the connection cleanup properly.

  We also need to clean up ISO connections in a similar situation when
  connecting has started but LE Create CIS is not yet sent, so do it too
  here.
