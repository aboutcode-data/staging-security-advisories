aliases: []
summary: The Cookie Notice & Compliance for GDPR / CCPA plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'cookie_notice_options[refuse_code_head]' parameter in
  versions up to, and including, 2.4.17.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
  escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrative privileges
  and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
  the injected /wp-admin/admin.php?page=cookie-notice page. This only affects multi-site installations
  and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
