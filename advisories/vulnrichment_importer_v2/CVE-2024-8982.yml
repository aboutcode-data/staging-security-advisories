aliases: []
summary: A Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in OpenLLM version 0.6.10 allows attackers
  to include files from the local server through the web application. This flaw could expose
  internal server files and potentially sensitive information such as configuration files, passwords,
  and other critical data. Unauthorized access to critical server files, such as configuration
  files, user credentials (/etc/passwd), and private keys, can lead to a complete compromise
  of the system's security. Attackers could leverage the exposed information to further penetrate
  the network, exfiltrate data, or escalate privileges within the environment.
