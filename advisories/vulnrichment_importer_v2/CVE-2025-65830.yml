aliases: []
summary: Due to a lack of certificate validation, all traffic from the mobile application can
  be intercepted. As a result, an adversary located "upstream" can decrypt the TLS traffic,
  inspect its contents, and modify the requests in transit. This may result in a total compromise
  of the user's account if the attacker intercepts a request with active authentication tokens
  or cracks the MD5 hash sent on login.
