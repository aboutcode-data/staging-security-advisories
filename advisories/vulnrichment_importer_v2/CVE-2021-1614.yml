summary: A vulnerability in the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) packet handling function
  of Cisco SD-WAN Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain access to
  information stored in MPLS buffer memory. This vulnerability is due to insufficient handling
  of malformed MPLS packets that are processed by a device that is running Cisco SD-WAN Software.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted MPLS packet to an affected
  device that is running Cisco SD-WAN Software or Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.
