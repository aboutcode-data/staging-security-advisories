aliases: []
summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. The REST API exposes the history of any
  page in XWiki of which the attacker knows the name. The exposed information includes for each
  modification of the page the time of the modification, the version number, the author of the
  modification (both username and displayed name) and the version comment. This information
  is exposed regardless of the rights setup, and even when the wiki is configured to be fully
  private. On a private wiki, this can be tested by accessing /xwiki/rest/wikis/xwiki/spaces/Main/pages/WebHome/history,
  if this shows the history of the main page then the installation is vulnerable. This has been
  patched in XWiki 15.10.9 and XWiki 16.3.0RC1.
