aliases: []
summary: Auth0 is an authentication broker that supports both social and enterprise identity
  providers, including Active Directory, LDAP, Google Apps, and Salesforce. In versions before
  `11.33.0`, when the “additional signup fields” feature [is configured](https://github.com/auth0/lock#additional-sign-up-fields),
  a malicious actor can inject invalidated HTML code into these additional fields, which is
  then stored in the service `user_metdata` payload (using the `name` property). Verification
  emails, when applicable, are generated using this metadata. It is therefor possible for an
  actor to craft a malicious link by injecting HTML, which is then rendered as the recipient's
  name within the delivered email template. You are impacted by this vulnerability if you are
  using `auth0-lock` version `11.32.2` or lower and are using the “additional signup fields”
  feature in your application. Upgrade to version `11.33.0`.
