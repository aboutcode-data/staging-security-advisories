aliases: []
summary: ClipBucket v5 is an open source video sharing platform. Versions 5.5.2-#147 and below
  contain a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in ClipBucket’s Collection tags
  feature. An authenticated normal user can create a tag containing HTML or JavaScript, which
  is later rendered unescaped in collection detail and tag-list pages. As a result, arbitrary
  JavaScript executes in the browsers of all users who view the affected pages. This issue is
  fixed in version 5.5.2-#152.
