aliases: []
summary: Element Desktop is a Matrix client for desktop platforms with Element Web at its core.
  Element Desktop before 1.9.7 is vulnerable to a remote program execution bug with user interaction.
  The exploit is non-trivial and requires clicking on a malicious link, followed by another
  button click. To the best of our knowledge, the vulnerability has never been exploited in
  the wild. If you are using Element Desktop < 1.9.7, we recommend upgrading at your earliest
  convenience. If successfully exploited, the vulnerability allows an attacker to specify a
  file path of a binary on the victim's computer which then gets executed. Notably, the attacker
  does *not* have the ability to specify program arguments. However, in certain unspecified
  configurations, the attacker may be able to specify an URI instead of a file path which then
  gets handled using standard platform mechanisms. These may allow exploiting further vulnerabilities
  in those mechanisms, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
