aliases: []
summary: Metabase is a business intelligence and embedded analytics tool. Versions prior to
  v0.52.16.4, v1.52.16.4, v0.53.8, and v1.53.8 are vulnerable to circumvention of local link
  access protection in GeoJson endpoint. Self hosted Metabase instances that are using the GeoJson
  feature could be potentially impacted if their Metabase is colocated with other unsecured
  resources. This is fixed in v0.52.16.4, v1.52.16.4, v0.53.8, and v1.53.8. Migrating to Metabase
  Cloud or redeploying Metabase in a dedicated subnet with strict outbound port controls is
  an available workaround.
