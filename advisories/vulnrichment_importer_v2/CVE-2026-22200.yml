aliases: []
summary: Enhancesoft osTicket versions 1.18.x prior to 1.18.3 and 1.17.x prior to 1.17.7 contain
  an arbitrary file read vulnerability in the ticket PDF export functionality. A remote attacker
  can submit a ticket containing crafted rich-text HTML that includes PHP filter expressions
  which are insufficiently sanitized before being processed by the mPDF PDF generator during
  export. When the attacker exports the ticket to PDF, the generated PDF can embed the contents
  of attacker-selected files from the server filesystem as bitmap images, allowing disclosure
  of sensitive local files in the context of the osTicket application user. This issue is exploitable
  in default configurations where guests may create tickets and access ticket status, or where
  self-registration is enabled.
