aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the VPN and management web servers of the Cisco Adaptive Security\
  \ Virtual Appliance (ASAv) and Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Virtual (FTDv), formerly\
  \ Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Virtual, platforms could allow an unauthenticated, remote\
  \ attacker to cause the virtual devices to run out of system memory, which could cause SSL\
  \ VPN connection processing to slow down and eventually cease all together.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability\
  \ is due to a lack of proper memory management for new incoming SSL/TLS connections on the\
  \ virtual platforms. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number\
  \ of new incoming SSL/TLS connections to the targeted virtual platform. A successful exploit\
  \ could allow the attacker to deplete system memory,&nbsp;resulting in a denial of service\
  \ (DoS) condition. The memory could be reclaimed slowly if the attack traffic is stopped,\
  \ but a manual reload may be required to restore operations quickly."
