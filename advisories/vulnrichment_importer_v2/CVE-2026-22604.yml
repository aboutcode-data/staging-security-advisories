aliases: []
summary: OpenProject is an open-source, web-based project management software. For OpenProject
  versions from 11.2.1 to before 16.6.2, when sending a POST request to the /account/change_password
  endpoint with an arbitrary User ID as the password_change_user_id parameter, the resulting
  error page would show the username for the requested user. Since this endpoint is intended
  to be called without being authenticated, this allows to enumerate the user names of all accounts
  registered in an OpenProject instance. This issue has been patched in version 16.6.2.
