summary: The WP Google Street View (with 360° virtual tour) & Google maps + Local SEO plugin
  for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'wpgsv_map' shortcode in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.1.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
  escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor level access
  and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
  an injected page.
