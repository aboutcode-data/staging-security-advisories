aliases: []
summary: This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations
  of AVEVA Edge 2020 SP2 Patch 0(4201.2111.1802.0000). User interaction is required to exploit
  this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of APP files. The issue results from the lack
  of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted
  data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current
  process. Was ZDI-CAN-17212.
