summary: 'DISPUTE NOTE: this issue does not pose a security risk as it (according to analysis
  by the original software developer, NLnet Labs) falls within the expected functionality and
  security controls of the application. Red Hat has made a claim that there is a security risk
  within Red Hat products. NLnet Labs has no further information about the claim, and suggests
  that affected Red Hat customers refer to available Red Hat documentation or support channels.
  ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION: A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the ub_ctx_set_fwd function
  in Unbound. This issue could allow an attacker who can invoke specific sequences of API calls
  to cause a segmentation fault. When certain API functions such as ub_ctx_set_fwd and ub_ctx_resolvconf
  are called in a particular order, the program attempts to read from a NULL pointer, leading
  to a crash. This issue can result in a denial of service by causing the application to terminate
  unexpectedly.'
