summary: The TCD Google Maps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via 'map' shortcode in versions up to, and including, 1.8 due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in
  pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
