aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Smart Software Manager
  On-Prem (SSM On-Prem) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct SQL injection
  attacks on an affected system. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management
  interface inadequately validates user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by authenticating to the application as a low-privileged user and sending crafted SQL queries
  to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read sensitive data
  on the underlying database.
