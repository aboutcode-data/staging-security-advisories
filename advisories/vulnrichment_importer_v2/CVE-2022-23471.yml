aliases: []
summary: containerd is an open source container runtime. A bug was found in containerd's CRI
  implementation where a user can exhaust memory on the host. In the CRI stream server, a goroutine
  is launched to handle terminal resize events if a TTY is requested. If the user's process
  fails to launch due to, for example, a faulty command, the goroutine will be stuck waiting
  to send without a receiver, resulting in a memory leak. Kubernetes and crictl can both be
  configured to use containerd's CRI implementation and the stream server is used for handling
  container IO. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.12 and 1.5.16.  Users should update
  to these versions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted
  images and commands are used and that only trusted users have permissions to execute commands
  in running containers.
