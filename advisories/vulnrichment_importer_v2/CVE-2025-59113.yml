summary: |
  Windu CMS implements weak client-side brute-force protection by using parameter loginError. Information about attempt count or timeout is not stored on the server, which allows a malicious attacker to bypass this brute-force protection by resetting this parameter.

  Only version 4.1 was tested and confirmed as vulnerable.
  This issue was fixed in version 4.1 build 2250.
