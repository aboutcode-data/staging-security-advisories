aliases: []
summary: NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0,
  the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to block sensitive cookies (e.g. session cookies)
  from being forwarded to backend services configured by the application developer. This could
  have led to sensitive cookies being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not
  see them. The patched version now blocks cookies from being forwarded by default. However
  developers can configure an allow-list of cookie names by using the `allowedCookies` config
  setting. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of
  `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being
  maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`
  instead.
