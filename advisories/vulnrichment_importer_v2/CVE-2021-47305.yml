  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  dma-buf/sync_file: Don't leak fences on merge failure

  Each add_fence() call does a dma_fence_get() on the relevant fence.  In
  the error path, we weren't calling dma_fence_put() so all those fences
  got leaked.  Also, in the krealloc_array failure case, we weren't
  freeing the fences array.  Instead, ensure that i and fences are always
  zero-initialized and dma_fence_put() all the fences and kfree(fences) on
  every error path.
