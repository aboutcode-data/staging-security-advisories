aliases: []
summary: wire-webapp is the web application for the open-source messaging service Wire. A change
  caused a regression resulting in sessions not being properly invalidated. A user that logged
  out of the Wire webapp, could have been automatically logged in again after re-opening the
  application. This does not happen when the user is logged in as a temporary user by selecting
  "This is a public computer" during login or the user selects "Delete all your personal information
  and conversations on this device" upon logout. The underlying issue has been fixed with wire-webapp
  version 2025-05-20-production.0. As a workaround, this behavior can be prevented by either
  deleting all information upon logout as well as logging in as a temporary client.
