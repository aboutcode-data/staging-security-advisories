aliases: []
summary: Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host prior to version 25.1.102 and
  Application prior to version 25.1.1413 (VA/SaaS deployments) contains a /api-gateway/identity/search-groups
  endpoint that does not require authentication. Requests to https://<tenant>.printercloud10.com/api-gateway/identity/search-groups
  and adjustments to the `Host` header allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to enumerate
  every group object stored for that tenant.  The response includes internal identifiers (group ID,
  source service ID, Azure AD object IDs, creation timestamps, and tenant IDs). This vulnerability
  has been confirmed to be remediated, but it is unclear as to when the patch was introduced.
