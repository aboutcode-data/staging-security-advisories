aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Local Packet Transport Services (LPTS) programming of the SNMP
  with the management plane protection feature of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to allow connections despite the management plane protection that is configured
  to deny access to the SNMP server of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to incorrect
  LPTS programming when using SNMP with management plane protection. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by connecting to an affected device using SNMP. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to connect to the device on the configured SNMP ports. Valid credentials
  are required to execute any of the SNMP requests.
