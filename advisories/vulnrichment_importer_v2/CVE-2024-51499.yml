aliases: []
summary: MarkUs is a web application for the submission and grading of student assignments.
  In versions prior to 2.4.8, an arbitrary file write vulnerability accessible via the update_files
  method of the SubmissionsController allows authenticated users (e.g. students) to write arbitrary
  files to any location on the web server MarkUs is running on (depending on the permissions
  of the underlying filesystem). e.g. This can lead to a delayed remote code execution in case
  an attacker is able to write a Ruby file into the config/initializers/ subfolder of the Ruby
  on Rails application. MarkUs v2.4.8 has addressed this issue. No known workarounds are available
  at the application level aside from upgrading.
