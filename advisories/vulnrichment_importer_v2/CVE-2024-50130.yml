  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  netfilter: bpf: must hold reference on net namespace

  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in __nf_unregister_net_hook+0x640/0x6b0
  Read of size 8 at addr ffff8880106fe400 by task repro/72=
  bpf_nf_link_release+0xda/0x1e0
  bpf_link_free+0x139/0x2d0
  bpf_link_release+0x68/0x80
  __fput+0x414/0xb60

  Eric says:
   It seems that bpf was able to defer the __nf_unregister_net_hook()
   after exit()/close() time.
   Perhaps a netns reference is missing, because the netns has been
   dismantled/freed already.
   bpf_nf_link_attach() does :
   link->net = net;
   But I do not see a reference being taken on net.

  Add such a reference and release it after hook unreg.
  Note that I was unable to get syzbot reproducer to work, so I
  do not know if this resolves this splat.
