aliases: []
summary: The LifterLMS – WP LMS for eLearning, Online Courses, & Quizzes plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Post Trashing due to a missing capability check on the delete_access_plan
  function and the related AJAX calls in all versions up to, and including, 8.0.1. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change status to "Trash" for every published
  post, therefore limiting the availability of the website's content.
