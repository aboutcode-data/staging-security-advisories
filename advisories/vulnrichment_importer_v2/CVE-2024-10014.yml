aliases: []
summary: The Flat UI Button plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the plugin's flatbtn shortcode in version 1.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and
  output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
  execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
