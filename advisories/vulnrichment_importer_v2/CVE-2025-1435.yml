aliases: []
summary: The bbPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all
  versions up to, and including, 2.6.11. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the bbp_user_add_role_on_register() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to elevate their privileges to that of a bbPress Keymaster via a forged request
  granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on
  a link. Rather than implementing a nonce check to provide protection against this vulnerability,
  which would break functionality, the plugin no longer makes it possible to select a role during
  registration.
