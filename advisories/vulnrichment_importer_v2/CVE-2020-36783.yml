  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  i2c: img-scb: fix reference leak when pm_runtime_get_sync fails

  The PM reference count is not expected to be incremented on
  return in functions img_i2c_xfer and img_i2c_init.

  However, pm_runtime_get_sync will increment the PM reference
  count even failed. Forgetting to putting operation will result
  in a reference leak here.

  Replace it with pm_runtime_resume_and_get to keep usage
  counter balanced.
