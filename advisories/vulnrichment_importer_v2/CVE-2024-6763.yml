aliases: []
summary: "Eclipse Jetty is a lightweight, highly scalable, Java-based web server and Servlet\
  \ engine . It includes a utility class, HttpURI, for URI/URL parsing.\n\nThe HttpURI class\
  \ does insufficient validation on the authority segment of a URI.  However the behaviour of\
  \ HttpURI\n differs from the common browsers in how it handles a URI that would be \nconsidered\
  \ invalid if fully validated against the RRC.  Specifically HttpURI\n and the browser may\
  \ differ on the value of the host extracted from an \ninvalid URI and thus a combination of\
  \ Jetty and a vulnerable browser may\n be vulnerable to a open redirect attack or to a SSRF\
  \ attack if the URI \nis used after passing validation checks."
