aliases: []
summary: veraPDF is an open source PDF/A validation library. Executing policy checks using custom
  schematron files via the CLI invokes an XSL transformation that may theoretically lead to
  a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability. This doesn't affect the standard validation and
  policy checks functionality, veraPDF's common use cases. Most veraPDF users don't insert any
  custom XSLT code into policy profiles, which are based on Schematron syntax rather than direct
  XSL transforms. For users who do, only load custom policy files from sources you trust. This
  issue has not yet been patched. Users are advised to be cautious of XSLT code until a patch
  is available.
