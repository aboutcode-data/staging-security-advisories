aliases: []
summary: The Custom Product Tabs For WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object
  Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.4 via deserialization of untrusted input
  from the 'wb_custom_tabs' parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
  Shop Manager-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present
  in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed
  on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive
  data, or execute code.
