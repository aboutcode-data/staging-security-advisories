aliases: []
summary: 'The Unlimited Elements For Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
  Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s Transparent Split Hero widget in all versions up to,
  and including, 1.5.140 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user
  supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses an injected page. Note: Since the widget code isn''t part of the code base, to apply
  the patch, the affected widget: Transparent Split Hero must be deleted and reinstalled manually.'
