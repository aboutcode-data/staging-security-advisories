aliases: []
summary: Nagios XI versions prior to 2024R1.4.2 configure some systemd unit files with permission
  sets that were too permissive. In particular, the nagios.service unit had executable permissions
  that were not required. Overly permissive permissions on service unit files can broaden local
  attack surface by enabling unintended execution behaviors or facilitating abuse of service
  operations when combined with other weaknesses.
