aliases: []
summary: The Ruckus vRIoT IoT Controller firmware versions prior to 3.0.0.0 (GA) expose a command
  execution service on TCP port 2004 running with root privileges. Authentication to this service
  relies on a hardcoded Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) secret and an embedded static token.
  An attacker who extracts these credentials from the appliance or a compromised device can
  generate valid authentication tokens and execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges,
  resulting in complete system compromise.
