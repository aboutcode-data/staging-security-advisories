aliases: []
summary: Neuron is a PHP framework for creating and orchestrating AI Agents. Versions 2.8.11
  and below use MySQLSelectTool, which is vulnerable to Read-Only Bypass.  MySQLSelectTool is
  intended to be a read-only SQL tool (e.g., for LLM agent querying, however, validation based
  on the first keyword (e.g., SELECT) and a forbidden-keyword list does not block file-writing
  constructs such as INTO OUTFILE / INTO DUMPFILE. As a result, an attacker who can influence
  the tool input (e.g., via prompt injection through a public agent endpoint) may write arbitrary
  files to the DB server if the MySQL/MariaDB account has the FILE privilege and server configuration
  permits writes to a useful location (e.g., a web-accessible directory). This issue is fixed
  in version 2.8.12.
