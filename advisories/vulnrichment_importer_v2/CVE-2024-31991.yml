aliases: []
summary: Mealie is a self hosted recipe manager and meal planner. Prior to 1.4.0, the safe_scrape_html
  function utilizes a user-controlled URL to issue a request to a remote server. Based on the
  content of the response, it will either parse the content or disregard it. This function,
  nor those that call it, add any restrictions on the URL that can be provided, nor is it restricted
  to being an FQDN (i.e., an IP address can be provided). As this function’s return will be
  handled differently by its caller depending on the response, it is possible for an attacker
  to use this functionality to positively identify HTTP(s) servers on the local network with
  any IP/port combination. This issue can result in any authenticated user being able to map
  HTTP servers on a local network that the Mealie service has access to. Note that by default
  any user can create an account on a Mealie server, and that the default changeme@example.com
  user is available with its hard-coded password. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.4.0.
