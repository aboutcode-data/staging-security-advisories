summary: The Gutenberg Blocks with AI by Kadence WP – Page Builder Features plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to DOM-based Stored Cross-Site Scripting via HTML data attributes in all versions
  up to, and including, 3.2.45 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on

  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses an injected page.
