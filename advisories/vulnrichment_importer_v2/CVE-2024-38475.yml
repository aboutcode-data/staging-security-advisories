aliases: []
summary: "Improper escaping of output in mod_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier\
  \ allows an attacker to map URLs to filesystem locations that are permitted to be served by\
  \ the server but are not intentionally/directly reachable by any URL, resulting in code execution\
  \ or source code disclosure. \n\nSubstitutions in server context that use a backreferences\
  \ or variables as the first segment of the substitution are affected.  Some unsafe RewiteRules\
  \ will be broken by this change and the rewrite flag \"UnsafePrefixStat\" can be used to opt\
  \ back in once ensuring the substitution is appropriately constrained."
