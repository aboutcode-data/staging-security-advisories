  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ALSA: hda: cs35l41: Possible null pointer dereference in cs35l41_hda_unbind()

  The cs35l41_hda_unbind() function clears the hda_component entry
  matching it's index and then dereferences the codec pointer held in the
  first element of the hda_component array, this is an issue when the
  device index was 0.

  Instead use the codec pointer stashed in the cs35l41_hda structure as it
  will still be valid.
