  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  spi: mchp-pci1xxx: Fix a possible null pointer dereference in pci1xxx_spi_probe

  In function pci1xxxx_spi_probe, there is a potential null pointer that
  may be caused by a failed memory allocation by the function devm_kzalloc.
  Hence, a null pointer check needs to be added to prevent null pointer
  dereferencing later in the code.

  To fix this issue, spi_bus->spi_int[iter] should be checked. The memory
  allocated by devm_kzalloc will be automatically released, so just directly
  return -ENOMEM without worrying about memory leaks.
