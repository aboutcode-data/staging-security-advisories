aliases: []
summary: The Appointment Hour Booking Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to CSV Injection in
  versions up to, and including, 1.3.72. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to embed untrusted input into content during booking creation that may be exported as a CSV
  file when a site's administrator exports booking details. This can result in code execution
  when these files are downloaded and opened on a local system with a vulnerable configuration.
