  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  md: Don't ignore suspended array in md_check_recovery()

  mddev_suspend() never stop sync_thread, hence it doesn't make sense to
  ignore suspended array in md_check_recovery(), which might cause
  sync_thread can't be unregistered.

  After commit f52f5c71f3d4 ("md: fix stopping sync thread"), following
  hang can be triggered by test shell/integrity-caching.sh:

  1) suspend the array:
  raid_postsuspend
   mddev_suspend

  2) stop the array:
  raid_dtr
   md_stop
    __md_stop_writes
     stop_sync_thread
      set_bit(MD_RECOVERY_INTR, &mddev->recovery);
      md_wakeup_thread_directly(mddev->sync_thread);
      wait_event(..., !test_bit(MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING, &mddev->recovery))

  3) sync thread done:
  md_do_sync
   set_bit(MD_RECOVERY_DONE, &mddev->recovery);
   md_wakeup_thread(mddev->thread);

  4) daemon thread can't unregister sync thread:
  md_check_recovery
   if (mddev->suspended)
     return; -> return directly
   md_read_sync_thread
   clear_bit(MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING, &mddev->recovery);
   -> MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING can't be cleared, hence step 2 hang;

  This problem is not just related to dm-raid, fix it by ignoring
  suspended array in md_check_recovery(). And follow up patches will
  improve dm-raid better to frozen sync thread during suspend.
