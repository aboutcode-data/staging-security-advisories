aliases: []
summary: 'python-jose thru 3.3.0 allows JWT tokens with ''alg=none'' to be decoded and accepted
  without any cryptographic signature verification. A malicious actor can craft a forged token
  with arbitrary claims (e.g., is_admin=true) and bypass authentication checks, leading to privilege
  escalation or unauthorized access in applications that rely on python-jose for token validation.
  This issue is exploitable unless developers explicitly reject ''alg=none'' tokens, which is
  not enforced by the library. NOTE: all parties agree that the issue is not relevant because
  it only occurs in a "verify_signature": False situation.'
