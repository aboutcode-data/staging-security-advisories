aliases: []
summary: Archery is an open source SQL audit platform. The Archery project contains multiple
  SQL injection vulnerabilities, that may allow an attacker to query the connected databases.
  Affected versions are subject to multiple SQL injections in the `sql_api/api_workflow.py`
  endpoint `ExecuteCheck`. User input coming from the `db_name` parameter value and the `full_sql`
  parameter value in the `api_workflow.py` `ExecuteCheck` endpoint is passed to the methods
  that follow in given SQL engine implementations, which concatenate user input unsafely into
  a SQL query and afterwards pass it to the `query` method of each database engine for execution.
  The affected methods are `execute_check` in `sql/engines/clickhouse.py` which concatenates
  input which is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/clickhouse.py` `query`
  method, `execute_check` in `sql/engines/goinception.py`which concatenates input which is passed
  to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/goinception.py` `query` method, `execute_check`
  in `sql/engines/oracle.py`which passes unsafe user input into the `object_name_check` method
  in `sql/engines/oracle.py` which in turn is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/oracle.py`
  `query` method. Each of these issues may be mitigated by escaping user input or by using prepared
  statements when executing SQL queries. This issue is also indexed as `GHSL-2022-102`.
