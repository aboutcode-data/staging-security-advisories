aliases: []
summary: Weblate is a web based localization tool. Prior to version 5.6.2, Weblate didn't correctly
  validate filenames when restoring project backup. It may be possible to gain unauthorized
  access to files on the server using a crafted ZIP file. This issue has been addressed in Weblate
  5.6.2. As a workaround, do not allow untrusted users to create projects.
