summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Data Center Network
  Manager (DCNM) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization
  on an affected device and access sensitive information that is related to the device. The
  vulnerability exists because the affected software allows users to access resources that are
  intended for administrators only. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting
  a crafted URL to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to add,
  delete, and edit certain network configurations in the same manner as a user with administrative
  privileges.
