summary: "A vulnerability in the cluster backup feature of Cisco Secure Firewall Management\
  \ Center (FMC) Software, formerly Firepower Management Center Software, could allow an authenticated,\
  \ remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.\r\n\r\n\
  This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user data that is supplied through\
  \ the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending\
  \ a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker\
  \ to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the affected device. To exploit this vulnerability,\
  \ an attacker would need valid credentials for a user account with at least the role of Network\
  \ Administrator. In addition, the attacker would need to persuade a legitimate user to initiate\
  \ a cluster backup on the affected device."
