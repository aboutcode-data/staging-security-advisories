aliases: []
summary: Activity Watch is a free and open-source automated time tracker. Versions prior to
  0.11.0 allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on any macOS machine with ActivityWatch
  running. The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by having the user visiting a website
  with the page title set to a malicious string. An attacker could use another application to
  accomplish the same, but the web browser is the most likely attack vector. This issue is patched
  in version 0.11.0. As a workaround, users can run the latest version of aw-watcher-window
  from source, or manually patch the `printAppTitle.scpt` file.
