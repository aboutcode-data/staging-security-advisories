aliases: []
summary: SuiteCRM is an open-source, enterprise-ready Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
  software application. Versions 7.14.7 and prior, 8.0.0-beta.1 through 8.9.0 allow a low-privileged
  user with a restrictive role to view and create work items through the Resource Calendar and
  project screens, even when the related modules (Projects, Project Tasks, Tasks, Leads, Accounts,
  Meetings, Calls) are explicitly set to Disabled/None in Role Management. This indicates inconsistent
  ACL/RBAC enforcement across modules and views, resulting in unauthorized data exposure and
  modification. This issue is fixed in versions 7.14.8 and 8.9.1.
