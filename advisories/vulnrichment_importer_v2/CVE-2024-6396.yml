aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the `_backup_run` function in aimhubio/aim version 3.19.3 allows
  remote attackers to overwrite any file on the host server and exfiltrate arbitrary data. The
  vulnerability arises due to improper handling of the `run_hash` and `repo.path` parameters,
  which can be manipulated to create and write to arbitrary file paths. This can lead to denial
  of service by overwriting critical system files, loss of private data, and potential remote
  code execution.
