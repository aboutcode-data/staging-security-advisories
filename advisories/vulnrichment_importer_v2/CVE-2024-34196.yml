summary: Totolink AC1200 Wireless Dual Band Gigabit Router A3002RU_V3 Firmware V3.0.0-B20230809.1615
  is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow. The "boa" program allows attackers to modify the value of
  the "vwlan_idx" field via "formMultiAP". This can lead to a stack overflow through the "formWlEncrypt"
  CGI function by constructing malicious HTTP requests and passing a WLAN SSID value exceeding
  the expected length, potentially resulting in command execution or denial of service attacks.
