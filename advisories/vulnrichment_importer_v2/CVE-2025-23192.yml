summary: SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence (BI Workspace) allows an unauthenticated
  attacker to craft and store malicious script within a workspace. When the victim accesses
  the workspace, the script will execute in their browser enabling the attacker to potentially
  access sensitive session information, modify or make browser information unavailable. This
  leads to a high impact on confidentiality and low impact on integrity, availability.
