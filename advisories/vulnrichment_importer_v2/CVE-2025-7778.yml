aliases: []
summary: The Icons Factory plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Deletion due
  to insufficient authorization and improper path validation within the delete_files() function
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.12. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution
  when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
