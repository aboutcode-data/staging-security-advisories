summary: 'Broken Authentication in Atlassian Connect Spring Boot (ACSB) from version 1.1.0 before
  version 2.1.3: Atlassian Connect Spring Boot is a Java Spring Boot package for building Atlassian
  Connect apps. Authentication between Atlassian products and the Atlassian Connect Spring Boot
  app occurs with a server-to-server JWT or a context JWT. Atlassian Connect Spring Boot versions
  from version 1.1.0 before version 2.1.3 erroneously accept context JWTs in lifecycle endpoints
  (such as installation) where only server-to-server JWTs should be accepted, permitting an
  attacker to send authenticated re-installation events to an app.'
