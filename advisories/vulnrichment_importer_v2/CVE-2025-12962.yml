aliases: []
summary: The Local Syndication plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.5a via the `url` parameter in the `[syndicate_local]`
  shortcode. This is due to the use of `wp_remote_get()` instead of `wp_safe_remote_get()` which
  lacks protections against requests to internal/private IP addresses and localhost. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to make
  web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application, which can be used
  to query and modify information from internal services, scan internal networks, and access
  resources that should not be accessible from external networks.
