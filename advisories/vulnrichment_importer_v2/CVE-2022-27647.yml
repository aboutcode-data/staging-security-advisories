aliases: []
summary: This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected
  installations of NETGEAR R6700v3 1.0.4.120_10.0.91 routers. Although authentication is required
  to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The
  specific flaw exists within the handling of the name or email field provided to libreadycloud.so.
  The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using
  it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in
  the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-15874.
