  Fix musl's CVE-2025-26519

  The musl project [announced CVE-2025-26519](https://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2025/02/13/1), which could result in out-of-bounds writes when calling the `iconv` function. There is no musl release available with the fixes at this point in time (and we're using an older version of musl anyway), so this PR applies the provided patches on top of the musl source tarball we download.
