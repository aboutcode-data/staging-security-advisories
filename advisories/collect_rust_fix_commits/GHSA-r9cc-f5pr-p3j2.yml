  7f306d5729fc11d18a88de6f7503b9c2883e250d:Rollup merge of #141832 - workingjubilee:explain-what-toctou-races-are, r=thomcc,ChrisDenton

  library: explain TOCTOU races in `fs::remove_dir_all`

  In the previous description it said there was a TOCTOU race but did not explain exactly what the problem was. I sat down with the CVE, reviewed its text, and created this explanation. This context should hopefully help people understand the actual risk as-such.

  Incidentally, it also fixes the capitalization on the name of Redox OS.
