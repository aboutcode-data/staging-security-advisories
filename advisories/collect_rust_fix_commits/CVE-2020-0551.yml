  Enable LVI hardening for x86_64-fortanix-unknown-sgx

  This implements mitigations for the Load Value Injection vulnerability (CVE-2020-0551) for the `x86_64-fortanix-unknown-sgx` target by enabling new LLVM passes. More information about LVI and mitigations may be found at https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/insights/deep-dive-load-value-injection.

  This PR unconditionally enables the mitigations for `x86_64-fortanix-unknown-sgx` since there is no available hardware that doesn't require the mitigations. This may be reconsidered in the future.
