  Rosetta-Flash JSONP Vulnerability
  This description taken from the pull request provided by Patrick Kettner.

  [Background from the vulnerabilty finder](http://miki.it/blog/2014/7/8/abusing-jsonp-with-rosetta-flash/)

  tl:dr - someone created a alphanum only swf converter, which means that they can in theory use it as a callback at a JSONP endpoint, and as a result, send data across domains.

  Prepending callbacks with an empty inline comment breaks the flash parser, and prevents the issue. This is a fairly common solution currently being implemented by Google, Facebook, and Github.
