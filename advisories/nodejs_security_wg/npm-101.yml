summary: "Sanitization bypass using HTML Entities\nmarked is an application that is meant to\
  \ parse and compile markdown.\n\nDue to the way that marked parses input, specifically HTML\
  \ entities, it's possible to bypass marked's content injection protection (`sanitize: true`)\
  \ to inject a `javascript:` URL.\n\nThis flaw exists because `&#xNNanything;` gets parsed\
  \ to what it could and leaves the rest behind, resulting in just `anything;` being left. \n\
  \nFor example:\n\nIf a malicious user could provide this input to the application `javascript&#x58document;alert&#40;1&#41;`\
  \ resulting in a valid link, that when a user clicked it would execute `alert(1)`."
