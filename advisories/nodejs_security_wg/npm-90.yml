summary: "Authentication Bypass\nconsole-io is a module that allows users to implement a web\
  \ console in their application. \n\nA malicious user could bypass the authentication and execute\
  \ any command that the user who is running the console-io application is able to run. This\
  \ means that if console-io was running from root, the attacker would have full access to the\
  \ system. \n\nThis vulnerability exists because the console-io application does not configure\
  \ socket.io to require authentication, which allows a malicious user to connect via a websocket\
  \ to send commands and receive the response."
