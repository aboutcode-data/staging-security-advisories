summary: |
  backbone is a module that adds in structure to a JavaScript heavy application through key-value pairs and custom events connecting to your RESTful API through JSON

  There exists a potential Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in the `Model#Escape` function if a user is able to supply input.

  This is due to the regex that's replacing things to miss the conversion of things such as `&#60;` to `<`.
