summary: "Improper Escaping of Bound Arrays\nsequalize is an Object-relational mapping, or a\
  \ middleman to convert things from Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server\
  \ into usable data for NodeJS\n\nIn Postgres, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server there is an\
  \ issue where arrays are treated as strings and improperly escaped.\n\nThis causes potential\
  \ SQL injection, where a malicious user could put `[\"test\", \"'); DELETE TestTable WHERE\
  \ Id = 1 --')\"]` inside of\n```\ndatabase.query('SELECT * FROM TestTable WHERE Name IN (:names)',\
  \ {\n  replacements: {\n    names: directCopyOfUserInput\n  }\n});\n``` and cause the SQL\
  \ statement to become `SELECT Id FROM Table WHERE Name IN ('test', '\\'); DELETE TestTable\
  \ WHERE Id = 1 --')`. \n\nIn Postgres, MSSQL, and SQLite, the backslash has no special meaning.\
  \ This causes the the statement to delete whichever Id has a value of 1 in the TestTable table."
