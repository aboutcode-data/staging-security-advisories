summary: |
  Deserialization Code Execution
  The JS-YAML module for Node.js contained a code execution vulnerability prior to version 2.0.5. The maintainers of JS-YAML have patched this vulnerability and, beginning in version 2.1.0, have provided a safeLoad method for parsing YAML. Developers that use this module should make sure they have upgraded and should strongly consider porting their code to use the new safeLoad method.

  ### Details
  The module allowed code execution due to a custom data-type that it defined and parsed called !!js/function. The way it would parse the data was to create a new Function object in JavaScript based on the input, which is equivalent to calling eval on the input:

  ```
  function resolveJavascriptFunction(object /*, explicit*/) {
    /*jslint evil:true*/
    var func;

    try {
      func = new Function('return ' + object);
      return func();
    } catch (error) {
      return NIL;
    }
  }
  ```
  That meant the code snippet below, when run, would execute code instead of simply defining a function:

  ```
  var yaml = require('js-yaml');

  x = "test: !!js/function > \n  \
  function f() { \n    \
  console.log(1); \n  \
  }();"

  yaml.load(x);
  ```
