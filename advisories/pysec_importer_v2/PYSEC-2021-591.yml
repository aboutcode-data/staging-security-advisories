summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected
  versions TensorFlow and Keras can be tricked to perform arbitrary code execution when deserializing
  a Keras model from YAML format. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/python/keras/saving/model_config.py#L66-L104)
  uses `yaml.unsafe_load` which can perform arbitrary code execution on the input. Given that
  YAML format support requires a significant amount of work, we have removed it for now. We
  have patched the issue in GitHub commit 23d6383eb6c14084a8fc3bdf164043b974818012. The fix
  will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1,
  TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported
  range.
