  - GHSA-hm45-mgqm-gjm4
summary: Red Discord Bot Dashboard is an easy-to-use interactive web dashboard to control your
  Redbot. In Red Discord Bot before version 0.1.7a an RCE exploit has been discovered. This
  exploit allows Discord users with specially crafted Server names and Usernames/Nicknames to
  inject code into the webserver front-end code. By abusing this exploit, it's possible to perform
  destructive actions and/or access sensitive information. This high severity exploit has been
  fixed on version 0.1.7a. There are no workarounds, bot owners must upgrade their relevant
  packages (Dashboard module and Dashboard webserver) in order to patch this issue.
