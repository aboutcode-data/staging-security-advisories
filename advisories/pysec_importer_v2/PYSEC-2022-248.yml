aliases:
  - CVE-2022-35918
  - GHSA-v4hr-4jpx-56gc
summary: 'Streamlit is a data oriented application development framework for python. Users hosting
  Streamlit app(s) that use custom components are vulnerable to a directory traversal attack
  that could leak data from their web server file-system such as: server logs, world readable
  files, and potentially other sensitive information. An attacker can craft a malicious URL
  with file paths and the streamlit server would process that URL and return the contents of
  that file or overwrite existing files on the web-server. This issue has been resolved in version
  1.11.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.'
