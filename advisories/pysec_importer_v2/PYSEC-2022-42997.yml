aliases:
  - CVE-2022-23472
  - GHSA-mhhf-vgwh-fw9h
summary: Passeo is an open source python password generator. Versions prior to 1.0.5 rely on
  the python `random` library for random value selection. The python `random` library warns
  that it should not be used for security purposes due to its reliance on a non-cryptographically
  secure random number generator. As a result a motivated attacker may be able to guess generated
  passwords. This issue has been addressed in version 1.0.5. Users are advised to upgrade. There
  are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
