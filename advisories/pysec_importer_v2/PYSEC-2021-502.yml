summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The implementation
  of `tf.raw_ops.MaxPool3DGradGrad` exhibits undefined behavior by dereferencing null pointers
  backing attacker-supplied empty tensors. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/72fe792967e7fd25234342068806707bbc116618/tensorflow/core/kernels/pooling_ops_3d.cc#L679-L703)
  fails to validate that the 3 tensor inputs are not empty. If any of them is empty, then accessing
  the elements in the tensor results in dereferencing a null pointer. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3,
  TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
