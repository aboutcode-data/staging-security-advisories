summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker
  can trigger a denial of service via a `CHECK`-fail in `tf.raw_ops.CTCGreedyDecoder`. This
  is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1615440b17b364b875eb06f43d087381f1460a65/tensorflow/core/kernels/ctc_decoder_ops.cc#L37-L50)
  has a `CHECK_LT` inserted to validate some invariants. When this condition is false, the program
  aborts, instead of returning a valid error to the user. This abnormal termination can be weaponized
  in denial of service attacks. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4,
  as these are also affected and still in supported range.
