summary: motionEye is an online interface for the software motion, a video surveillance program
  with motion detection. In versions 0.43.1b1 through 0.43.1b3, using a constructed (camera)
  device path with the `add`/`add_camera` motionEye web API allows an attacker with motionEye
  admin user credentials to execute any command within a non-interactive shell as motionEye
  run user, `motion` by default. The vulnerability has been patched with motionEye v0.43.1b4.
  As a workaround, apply the patch manually.
