  - CVE-2021-41124
  - GHSA-823f-cwm9-4g74
summary: Scrapy-splash is a library which provides Scrapy and JavaScript integration. In affected
  versions users who use [`HttpAuthMiddleware`](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#module-scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpauth)
  (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for Splash authentication will have
  any non-Splash request expose your credentials to the request target. This includes `robots.txt`
  requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`. Upgrade to scrapy-splash
  0.8.0 and use the new `SPLASH_USER` and `SPLASH_PASS` settings instead to set your Splash
  authentication credentials safely. If you cannot upgrade, set your Splash request credentials
  on a per-request basis, [using the `splash_headers` request parameter](https://github.com/scrapy-plugins/scrapy-splash/tree/0.8.x#http-basic-auth),
  instead of defining them globally using the [`HttpAuthMiddleware`](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#module-scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpauth).
  Alternatively, make sure all your requests go through Splash. That includes disabling the
  [robots.txt middleware](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#topics-dlmw-robots).
