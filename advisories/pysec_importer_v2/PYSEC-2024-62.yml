  - CVE-2024-21513
  - GHSA-cgcg-p68q-3w7v
summary: "Versions of the package langchain-experimental from 0.0.15 and before 0.0.21 are vulnerable\
  \ to Arbitrary Code Execution when retrieving values from the database, the code will attempt\
  \ to call 'eval' on all values. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability and execute arbitrary\
  \ python code if they can control the input prompt and the server is configured with VectorSQLDatabaseChain.\r\
  \r**Notes:**\r\rImpact on the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of the vulnerable\
  \ component:\r\rConfidentiality: Code execution happens within the impacted component, in\
  \ this case langchain-experimental, so all resources are necessarily accessible.\r\rIntegrity:\
  \ There is nothing protected by the impacted component inherently. Although anything returned\
  \ from the component counts as 'information' for which the trustworthiness can be compromised.\r\
  \rAvailability: The loss of availability isn't caused by the attack itself, but it happens\
  \ as a result during the attacker's post-exploitation steps.\r\r\rImpact on the Confidentiality,\
  \ Integrity and Availability of the subsequent system:\r\rAs a legitimate low-privileged user\
  \ of the package (PR:L) the attacker does not have more access to data owned by the package\
  \ as a result of this vulnerability than they did with normal usage (e.g. can query the DB).\
  \ The unintended action that one can perform by breaking out of the app environment and exfiltrating\
  \ files, making remote connections etc. happens during the post exploitation phase in the\
  \ subsequent system - in this case, the OS.\r\rAT:P: An attacker needs to be able to influence\
  \ the input prompt, whilst the server is configured with the VectorSQLDatabaseChain plugin."
