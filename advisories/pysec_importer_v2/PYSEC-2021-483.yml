summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker
  can cause a denial of service via a FPE runtime error in `tf.raw_ops.FusedBatchNorm`. This
  is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/828f346274841fa7505f7020e88ca36c22e557ab/tensorflow/core/kernels/fused_batch_norm_op.cc#L295-L297)
  performs a division based on the last dimension of the `x` tensor. Since this is controlled
  by the user, an attacker can trigger a denial of service. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow
  2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
