  - GHSA-fpm5-2wcj-vfr7
summary: "CodeChecker is an analyzer tooling, defect database and viewer extension for the Clang\
  \ Static Analyzer and Clang Tidy. \nAuthentication method confusion allows logging in as the\
  \ built-in root user from an external service. The built-in root user up until 6.24.1 is generated\
  \ in a weak manner, cannot be disabled, and has universal access.This vulnerability allows\
  \ an attacker who can create an account on an enabled external authentication service, to\
  \ log in as the root user, and access and control everything that can be controlled via the\
  \ web interface. The attacker needs to acquire the username of the root user to be successful.\n\
  \nThis issue affects CodeChecker: through 6.24.1."
