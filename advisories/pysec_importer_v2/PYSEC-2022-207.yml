  - CVE-2022-32563
  - GHSA-9266-j9v3-q4j5
summary: An issue was discovered in Couchbase Sync Gateway 3.x before 3.0.2. Admin credentials
  are not verified when using X.509 client-certificate authentication from Sync Gateway to Couchbase
  Server. When Sync Gateway is configured to authenticate with Couchbase Server using X.509
  client certificates, the admin credentials provided to the Admin REST API are ignored, resulting
  in privilege escalation for unauthenticated users. The Public REST API is not impacted by
  this issue. A workaround is to replace X.509 certificate based authentication with Username
  and Password authentication inside the bootstrap configuration.
