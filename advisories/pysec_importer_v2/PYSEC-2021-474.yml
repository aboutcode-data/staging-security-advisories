summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker
  can trigger an integer division by zero undefined behavior in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedBiasAdd`.
  This is because the implementation of the Eigen kernel(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/61bca8bd5ba8a68b2d97435ddfafcdf2b85672cd/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantization_utils.h#L812-L849)
  does a division by the number of elements of the smaller input (based on shape) without checking
  that this is not zero. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4,
  as these are also affected and still in supported range.
