summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. Incomplete validation
  in `SparseAdd` results in allowing attackers to exploit undefined behavior (dereferencing
  null pointers) as well as write outside of bounds of heap allocated data. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/656e7673b14acd7835dc778867f84916c6d1cac2/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_add_op.cc)
  has a large set of validation for the two sparse tensor inputs (6 tensors in total), but does
  not validate that the tensors are not empty or that the second dimension of `*_indices` matches
  the size of corresponding `*_shape`. This allows attackers to send tensor triples that represent
  invalid sparse tensors to abuse code assumptions that are not protected by validation. The
  fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range.
