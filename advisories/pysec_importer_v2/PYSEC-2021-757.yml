summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected
  versions the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams` is vulnerable to an integer overflow
  issue caused by converting a signed integer value to an unsigned one and then allocating memory
  based on this value. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/string_ngrams_op.cc#L184)
  calls `reserve` on a `tstring` with a value that sometimes can be negative if user supplies
  negative `ngram_widths`. The `reserve` method calls `TF_TString_Reserve` which has an `unsigned
  long` argument for the size of the buffer. Hence, the implicit conversion transforms the negative
  value to a large integer. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit c283e542a3f422420cfdb332414543b62fc4e4a5.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported
  range.
