aliases:
  - CVE-2020-12690
  - GHSA-6m8p-x4qw-gh5j
summary: An issue was discovered in OpenStack Keystone before 15.0.1, and 16.0.0. The list of
  roles provided for an OAuth1 access token is silently ignored. Thus, when an access token
  is used to request a keystone token, the keystone token contains every role assignment the
  creator had for the project. This results in the provided keystone token having more role
  assignments than the creator intended, possibly giving unintended escalated access.
