summary: Pillow is a Python imaging library. In versions 11.2.0 to before 11.3.0, there is a
  heap buffer overflow when writing a sufficiently large (>64k encoded with default settings)
  image in the DDS format due to writing into a buffer without checking for available space.
  This only affects users who save untrusted data as a compressed DDS image. This issue has
  been patched in version 11.3.0.
