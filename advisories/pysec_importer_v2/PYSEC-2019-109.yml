  - CVE-2019-12760
  - GHSA-22mf-97vh-x8rw
summary: '** DISPUTED ** A deserialization vulnerability exists in the way parso through 0.4.0
  handles grammar parsing from the cache. Cache loading relies on pickle and, provided that
  an evil pickle can be written to a cache grammar file and that its parsing can be triggered,
  this flaw leads to Arbitrary Code Execution. NOTE: This is disputed because "the cache directory
  is not under control of the attacker in any common configuration."'
