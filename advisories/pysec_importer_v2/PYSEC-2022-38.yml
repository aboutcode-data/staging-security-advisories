aliases:
  - CVE-2021-45083
  - GHSA-5946-mpw5-pqxx
summary: An issue was discovered in Cobbler before 3.3.1. Files in /etc/cobbler are world readable.
  Two of those files contain some sensitive information that can be exposed to a local user
  who has non-privileged access to the server. The users.digest file contains the sha2-512 digest
  of users in a Cobbler local installation. In the case of an easy-to-guess password, it's trivial
  to obtain the plaintext string. The settings.yaml file contains secrets such as the hashed
  default password.
