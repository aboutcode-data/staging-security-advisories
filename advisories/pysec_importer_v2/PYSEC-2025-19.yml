summary: picklescan before 0.0.22 only considers standard pickle file extensions in the scope
  for its vulnerability scan. An attacker could craft a malicious model that uses Pickle and
  include a malicious pickle file with a non-standard file extension. Because the malicious
  pickle file inclusion is not considered as part of the scope of picklescan, the file would
  pass security checks and appear to be safe, when it could instead prove to be problematic.
