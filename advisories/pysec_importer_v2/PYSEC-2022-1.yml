  - GHSA-53qw-q765-4fww
summary: An issue was discovered in Django 2.2 before 2.2.26, 3.2 before 3.2.11, and 4.0 before
  4.0.1. UserAttributeSimilarityValidator incurred significant overhead in evaluating a submitted
  password that was artificially large in relation to the comparison values. In a situation
  where access to user registration was unrestricted, this provided a potential vector for a
  denial-of-service attack.
