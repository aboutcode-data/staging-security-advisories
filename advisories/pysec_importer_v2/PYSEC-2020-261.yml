aliases:
  - CVE-2020-8897
  - GHSA-wqgp-vphw-hphf
summary: A weak robustness vulnerability exists in the AWS Encryption SDKs for Java, Python,
  C and Javalcript prior to versions 2.0.0. Due to the non-committing property of AES-GCM (and
  other AEAD ciphers such as AES-GCM-SIV or (X)ChaCha20Poly1305) used by the SDKs to encrypt
  messages, an attacker can craft a unique cyphertext which will decrypt to multiple different
  results, and becomes especially relevant in a multi-recipient setting. We recommend users
  update their SDK to 2.0.0 or later.
