summary: '** DISPUTED ** core.py in Mitogen before 0.2.8 has a typo that drops the unidirectional-routing
  protection mechanism in the case of a child that is initiated by another child. The Ansible
  extension is unaffected. NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue because it is exploitable only
  in conjunction with hypothetical other factors, i.e., an affected use case within a library
  caller, and a bug in the message receiver policy code that led to reliance on this extra protection
  mechanism.'
