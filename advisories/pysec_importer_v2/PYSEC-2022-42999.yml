  - CVE-2022-30284
  - GHSA-qwqv-j7jr-4hp6
summary: '** DISPUTED ** In the python-libnmap package through 0.7.2 for Python, remote command
  execution can occur (if used in a client application that does not validate arguments). NOTE:
  the vendor believes it would be unrealistic for an application to call NmapProcess with arguments
  taken from input data that arrived over an untrusted network, and thus the CVSS score corresponds
  to an unrealistic use case. None of the NmapProcess documentation implies that this is an
  expected use case.'
