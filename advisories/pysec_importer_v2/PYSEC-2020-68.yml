summary: 'OAuthenticator is an OAuth login mechanism for JupyterHub. In oauthenticator from
  version 0.12.0 and before 0.12.2, the deprecated (in jupyterhub 1.2) configuration `Authenticator.whitelist`,
  which should be transparently mapped to `Authenticator.allowed_users` with a warning, is instead
  ignored by OAuthenticator classes, resulting in the same behavior as if this configuration
  has not been set. If this is the only mechanism of authorization restriction (i.e. no group
  or team restrictions in configuration) then all authenticated users will be allowed. Provider-based
  restrictions, including deprecated values such as `GitHubOAuthenticator.org_whitelist` are
  **not** affected. All users of OAuthenticator 0.12.0 and 0.12.1 with JupyterHub 1.2 (JupyterHub
  Helm chart 0.10.0-0.10.5) who use the `admin.whitelist.users` configuration in the jupyterhub
  helm chart or the `c.Authenticator.whitelist` configuration directly. Users of other deprecated
  configuration, e.g. `c.GitHubOAuthenticator.team_whitelist` are **not** affected. If you see
  a log line like this and expect a specific list of allowed usernames: "[I 2020-11-27 16:51:54.528
  JupyterHub app:1717] Not using allowed_users. Any authenticated user will be allowed." you
  are likely affected. Updating oauthenticator to 0.12.2 is recommended. A workaround is to
  replace the deprecated `c.Authenticator.whitelist = ...` with `c.Authenticator.allowed_users
  = ...`. If any users have been authorized during this time who should not have been, they
  must be deleted via the API or admin interface, per the referenced documentation.'
