summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The implementation
  of the `BatchToSpaceNd` TFLite operator is vulnerable to a division by zero error(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/b5ed552fe55895aee8bd8b191f744a069957d18d/tensorflow/lite/kernels/batch_to_space_nd.cc#L81-L82).
  An attacker can craft a model such that one dimension of the `block` input is 0. Hence, the
  corresponding value in `block_shape` is 0. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We
  will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and
  TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
