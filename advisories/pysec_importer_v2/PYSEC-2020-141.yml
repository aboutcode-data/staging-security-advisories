summary: 'In TensorFlow release candidate versions 2.4.0rc*, the general implementation for
  matching filesystem paths to globbing pattern is vulnerable to an access out of bounds of
  the array holding the directories. There are multiple invariants and preconditions that are
  assumed by the parallel implementation of GetMatchingPaths but are not verified by the PRs
  introducing it (#40861 and #44310). Thus, we are completely rewriting the implementation to
  fully specify and validate these. This is patched in version 2.4.0. This issue only impacts
  master branch and the release candidates for TF version 2.4. The final release of the 2.4
  release will be patched.'
