  - CVE-2020-15271
  - GHSA-c84h-w6cr-5v8q
summary: In lookatme (python/pypi package) versions prior to 2.3.0, the package automatically
  loaded the built-in "terminal" and "file_loader" extensions. Users that use lookatme to render
  untrusted markdown may have malicious shell commands automatically run on their system. This
  is fixed in version 2.3.0. As a workaround, the `lookatme/contrib/terminal.py` and `lookatme/contrib/file_loader.py`
  files may be manually deleted. Additionally, it is always recommended to be aware of what
  is being rendered with lookatme.
