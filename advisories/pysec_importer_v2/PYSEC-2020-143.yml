  - GHSA-wvcv-832q-fjg7
summary: 'tlslite-ng is an open source python library that implements SSL and TLS cryptographic
  protocols. In tlslite-ng before versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39, the code that performs decryption
  and padding check in RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption is data dependant. In particular, the code
  has multiple ways in which it leaks information about the decrypted ciphertext. It aborts
  as soon as the plaintext doesn''t start with 0x00, 0x02. All TLS servers that enable RSA key
  exchange as well as applications that use the RSA decryption API directly are vulnerable.
  This is patched in versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39. Note: the patches depend on Python processing
  the individual bytes in side-channel free manner, this is known to not the case (see reference).
  As such, users that require side-channel resistance are recommended to use different TLS implementations,
  as stated in the security policy of tlslite-ng.'
