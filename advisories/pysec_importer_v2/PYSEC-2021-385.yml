  - CVE-2021-39182
  - GHSA-35m5-8cvj-8783
summary: EnroCrypt is a Python module for encryption and hashing. Prior to version 1.1.4, EnroCrypt
  used the MD5 hashing algorithm in the hashing file. Beginners who are unfamiliar with hashes
  can face problems as MD5 is considered an insecure hashing algorithm. The vulnerability is
  patched in v1.1.4 of the product. As a workaround, users can remove the `MD5` hashing function
  from the file `hashing.py`.
