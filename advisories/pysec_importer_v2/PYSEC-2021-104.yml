summary: 'Zope is an open-source web application server. This advisory extends the previous
  advisory at https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/security/advisories/GHSA-5pr9-v234-jw36
  with additional cases of TAL expression traversal vulnerabilities. Most Python modules are
  not available for using in TAL expressions that you can add through-the-web, for example in
  Zope Page Templates. This restriction avoids file system access, for example via the ''os''
  module. But some of the untrusted modules are available indirectly through Python modules
  that are available for direct use. By default, you need to have the Manager role to add or
  edit Zope Page Templates through the web. Only sites that allow untrusted users to add/edit
  Zope Page Templates through the web are at risk. The problem has been fixed in Zope 5.21 and
  4.6.1. The workaround is the same as for https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/security/advisories/GHSA-5pr9-v234-jw36:
  A site administrator can restrict adding/editing Zope Page Templates through the web using
  the standard Zope user/role permission mechanisms. Untrusted users should not be assigned
  the Zope Manager role and adding/editing Zope Page Templates through the web should be restricted
  to trusted users only.'
