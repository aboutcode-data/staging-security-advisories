aliases:
  - CVE-2020-35681
  - GHSA-v542-8q9x-cffc
summary: Django Channels 3.x before 3.0.3 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information
  from a different request scope. The legacy channels.http.AsgiHandler class, used for handling
  HTTP type requests in an ASGI environment prior to Django 3.0, did not correctly separate
  request scopes in Channels 3.0. In many cases this would result in a crash but, with correct
  timing, responses could be sent to the wrong client, resulting in potential leakage of session
  identifiers and other sensitive data. Note that this affects only the legacy Channels provided
  class, and not Django's similar ASGIHandler, available from Django 3.0.
