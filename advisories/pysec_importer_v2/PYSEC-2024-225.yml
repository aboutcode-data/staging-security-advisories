  - GHSA-6vqw-3v5j-54x4
summary: cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives and recipes to
  Python developers. Starting in version 38.0.0 and prior to version 42.0.4, if `pkcs12.serialize_key_and_certificates`
  is called with both a certificate whose public key did not match the provided private key
  and an `encryption_algorithm` with `hmac_hash` set (via `PrivateFormat.PKCS12.encryption_builder().hmac_hash(...)`,
  then a NULL pointer dereference would occur, crashing the Python process. This has been resolved
  in version 42.0.4, the first version in which a `ValueError` is properly raised.
