summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The implementation
  of `tf.raw_ops.FractionalMaxPoolGrad` triggers an undefined behavior if one of the input tensors
  is empty. The code is also vulnerable to a denial of service attack as a `CHECK` condition
  becomes false and aborts the process. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/169054888d50ce488dfde9ca55d91d6325efbd5b/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_max_pool_op.cc#L215)
  fails to validate that input and output tensors are not empty and are of the same rank. Each
  of these unchecked assumptions is responsible for the above issues. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3,
  TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
