  - GHSA-68vr-8f46-vc9f
summary: OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share files,
  host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. In affected versions it is possible
  to change the username to that of another chat participant with an additional space character
  at the end of the name string. An adversary with access to the chat environment can use the
  rename feature to impersonate other participants by adding whitespace characters at the end
  of the username.
