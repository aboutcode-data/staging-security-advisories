summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected
  versions the strided slice implementation in TFLite has a logic bug which can allow an attacker
  to trigger an infinite loop. This arises from newly introduced support for [ellipsis in axis
  definition](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/149562d49faa709ea80df1d99fc41d005b81082a/tensorflow/lite/kernels/strided_slice.cc#L103-L122).
  An attacker can craft a model such that `ellipsis_end_idx` is smaller than `i` (e.g., always
  negative). In this case, the inner loop does not increase `i` and the `continue` statement
  causes execution to skip over the preincrement at the end of the outer loop. We have patched
  the issue in GitHub commit dfa22b348b70bb89d6d6ec0ff53973bacb4f4695. TensorFlow 2.6.0 is the
  only affected version.
