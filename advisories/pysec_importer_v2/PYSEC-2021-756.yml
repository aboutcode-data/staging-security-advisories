summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected
  versions the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad` is vulnerable to an
  integer overflow issue caused by converting a signed integer value to an unsigned one and
  then allocating memory based on this value. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_and_dequantize_op.cc#L126)
  uses the `axis` value as the size argument to `absl::InlinedVector` constructor. But, the
  constructor uses an unsigned type for the argument, so the implicit conversion transforms
  the negative value to a large integer. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 96f364a1ca3009f98980021c4b32be5fdcca33a1.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.5.1, and TensorFlow 2.4.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
