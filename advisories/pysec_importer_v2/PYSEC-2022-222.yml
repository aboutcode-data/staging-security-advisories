  - GHSA-m43h-hfrq-x8wx
summary: The Security Team noticed that the termination condition of the for loop in the readExternal
  method is a controllable variable, which, if tampered with, may lead to CPU exhaustion. As
  a fix, we added an upper bound and termination condition in the read and write logic. We classify
  it as a "low-priority but useful improvement". SystemDS is a distributed system and needs
  to serialize/deserialize data but in many code paths (e.g., on Spark broadcast/shuffle or
  writing to sequence files) the byte stream is anyway protected by additional CRC fingerprints.
  In this particular case though, the number of decoders is upper-bounded by twice the number
  of columns, which means an attacker would need to modify two entries in the byte stream in
  a consistent manner. By adding these checks robustness was strictly improved with almost zero
  overhead. These code changes are available in versions higher than 2.2.1.
