  ecfab06cb20959219c9aadc2ef59507488e4fa99:SSL: adjusted session id context with dynamic certificates.

  Dynamic certificates re-introduce problem with incorrect session
  reuse (AKA "virtual host confusion", CVE-2014-3616), since there are
  no server certificates to generate session id context from.

  To prevent this, session id context is now generated from ssl_certificate
  directives as specified in the configuration.  This approach prevents
  incorrect session reuse in most cases, while still allowing sharing
  sessions across multiple machines with ssl_session_ticket_key set as
  long as configurations are identical.
