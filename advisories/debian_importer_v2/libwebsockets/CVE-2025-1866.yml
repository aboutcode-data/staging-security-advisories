summary: 'Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer vulnerability
  in warmcat libwebsockets allows Pointer Manipulation, potentially leading to out-of-bounds
  memory access. This issue affects libwebsockets before 4.3.4 and is present in code built
  specifically for the Win32 platform.  By default, the affected code is not executed unless
  one of the following conditions is met:  LWS_WITHOUT_EXTENSIONS (default ON) is manually set
  to OFF in CMake. LWS_WITH_HTTP_STREAM_COMPRESSION (default OFF) is manually set to ON in CMake.
  Despite these conditions, when triggered in affected configurations, this vulnerability may
  allow attackers to manipulate pointers, potentially leading to memory corruption or unexpected
  behavior.'
