  - CVE-2025-61912
summary: python-ldap is a lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) client API for Python.
  In versions prior to 3.4.5, ldap.dn.escape_dn_chars() escapes \x00 incorrectly by emitting
  a backslash followed by a literal NUL byte instead of the RFC-4514 hex form \00. Any application
  that uses this helper to construct DNs from untrusted input can be made to consistently fail
  before a request is sent to the LDAP server (e.g., AD), resulting in a client-side denial
  of service. Version 3.4.5 contains a patch for the issue.
