summary: python-ldap is a lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) client API for Python.
  In versions prior to 3.4.5, the sanitization method `ldap.filter.escape_filter_chars` can
  be tricked to skip escaping of special characters when a crafted `list` or `dict` is supplied
  as the `assertion_value` parameter, and the non-default `escape_mode=1` is configured. The
  method `ldap.filter.escape_filter_chars` supports 3 different escaping modes. `escape_mode=0`
  (default) and `escape_mode=2` happen to raise exceptions when a `list` or `dict` object is
  supplied as the `assertion_value` parameter. However, `escape_mode=1` computes without performing
  adequate logic to ensure a fully escaped return value. If an application relies on the vulnerable
  method in the `python-ldap` library to escape untrusted user input, an attacker might be able
  to abuse the vulnerability to launch ldap injection attacks which could potentially disclose
  or manipulate ldap data meant to be inaccessible to them. Version 3.4.5 fixes the issue by
  adding a type check at the start of the `ldap.filter.escape_filter_chars` method to raise
  an exception when the supplied `assertion_value` parameter is not of type `str`.
