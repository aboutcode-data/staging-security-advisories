aliases:
  - CVE-2007-4135
summary: The NFSv4 ID mapper (nfsidmap) before 0.17 does not properly handle return values from
  the getpwnam_r function when performing a username lookup, which can cause it to report a
  file as being owned by "root" instead of "nobody" if the file exists on the server but not
  on the client.
