  - CVE-2016-1000108
summary: yaws before 2.0.4 does not attempt to address RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 namespace conflicts
  and therefore does not protect CGI applications from the presence of untrusted client data
  in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to redirect a CGI
  application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header
  in an HTTP request, aka an "httpoxy" issue.
