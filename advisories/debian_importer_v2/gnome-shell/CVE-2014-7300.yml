  - CVE-2014-7300
summary: GNOME Shell 3.14.x before 3.14.1, when the Screen Lock feature is used, does not limit
  the aggregate memory consumption of all active PrtSc requests, which allows physically proximate
  attackers to execute arbitrary commands on an unattended workstation by making many PrtSc
  requests and leveraging a temporary lock outage, and the resulting temporary shell availability,
  caused by the Linux kernel OOM killer.
