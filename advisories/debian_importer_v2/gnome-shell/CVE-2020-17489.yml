summary: An issue was discovered in certain configurations of GNOME gnome-shell through 3.36.4.
  When logging out of an account, the password box from the login dialog reappears with the
  password still visible. If the user had decided to have the password shown in cleartext at
  login time, it is then visible for a brief moment upon a logout. (If the password were never
  shown in cleartext, only the password length is revealed.)
