  - CVE-2021-3982
summary: Linux distributions using CAP_SYS_NICE for gnome-shell may be exposed to a privilege
  escalation issue. An attacker, with low privilege permissions, may take advantage of the way
  CAP_SYS_NICE is currently implemented and eventually load code to increase its process scheduler
  priority leading to possible DoS of other services running in the same machine.
