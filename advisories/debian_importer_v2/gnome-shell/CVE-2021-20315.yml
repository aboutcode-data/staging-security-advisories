  - CVE-2021-20315
summary: A locking protection bypass flaw was found in some versions of gnome-shell as shipped
  within CentOS Stream 8, when the "Application menu" or "Window list" GNOME extensions are
  enabled. This flaw allows a physical attacker who has access to a locked system to kill existing
  applications and start new ones as the locked user, even if the session is still locked.
