  - CVE-2017-8288
summary: gnome-shell 3.22 through 3.24.1 mishandles extensions that fail to reload, which can
  lead to leaving extensions enabled in the lock screen. With these extensions, a bystander
  could launch applications (but not interact with them), see information from the extensions
  (e.g., what applications you have opened or what music you were playing), or even execute
  arbitrary commands. It all depends on what extensions a user has enabled. The problem is caused
  by lack of exception handling in js/ui/extensionSystem.js.
