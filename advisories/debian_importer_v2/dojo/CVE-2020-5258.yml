summary: In affected versions of dojo (NPM package), the deepCopy method is vulnerable to Prototype
  Pollution. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript
  language construct prototypes, such as objects. An attacker manipulates these attributes to
  overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting
  other values. This has been patched in versions 1.12.8, 1.13.7, 1.14.6, 1.15.3 and 1.16.2
