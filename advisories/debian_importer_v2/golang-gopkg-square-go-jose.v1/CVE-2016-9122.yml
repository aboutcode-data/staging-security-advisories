aliases:
  - CVE-2016-9122
summary: go-jose before 1.0.4 suffers from multiple signatures exploitation. The go-jose library
  supports messages with multiple signatures. However, when validating a signed message the
  API did not indicate which signature was valid, which could potentially lead to confusion.
  For example, users of the library might mistakenly read protected header values from an attached
  signature that was different from the one originally validated.
