  - CVE-2020-24240
summary: 'GNU Bison before 3.7.1 has a use-after-free in _obstack_free in lib/obstack.c (called
  from gram_lex) when a ''\0'' byte is encountered. NOTE: there is a risk only if Bison is used
  with untrusted input, and the observed bug happens to cause unsafe behavior with a specific
  compiler/architecture. The bug report was intended to show that a crash may occur in Bison
  itself, not that a crash may occur in code that is generated by Bison.'
