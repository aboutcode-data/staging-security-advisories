  - CVE-2020-14150
summary: 'GNU Bison before 3.5.4 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (application
  crash). NOTE: there is a risk only if Bison is used with untrusted input, and an observed
  bug happens to cause unsafe behavior with a specific compiler/architecture. The bug reports
  were intended to show that a crash may occur in Bison itself, not that a crash may occur in
  code that is generated by Bison.'
