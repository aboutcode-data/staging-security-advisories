aliases:
  - CVE-2009-1358
summary: apt-get in apt before 0.7.21 does not check for the correct error code from gpgv, which
  causes apt to treat a repository as valid even when it has been signed with a key that has
  been revoked or expired, which might allow remote attackers to trick apt into installing malicious
  repositories.
