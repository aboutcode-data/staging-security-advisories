  - CVE-2019-20175
summary: 'An issue was discovered in ide_dma_cb() in hw/ide/core.c in QEMU 2.4.0 through 4.2.0.
  The guest system can crash the QEMU process in the host system via a special SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND.
  It hits an assertion that implies that the size of successful DMA transfers there must be
  a multiple of 512 (the size of a sector). NOTE: a member of the QEMU security team disputes
  the significance of this issue because a "privileged guest user has many ways to cause similar
  DoS effect, without triggering this assert.'
