  - CVE-2023-1386
summary: A flaw was found in the 9p passthrough filesystem (9pfs) implementation in QEMU. When
  a local user in the guest writes an executable file with SUID or SGID, none of these privileged
  bits are correctly dropped. As a result, in rare circumstances, this flaw could be used by
  malicious users in the guest to elevate their privileges within the guest and help a host
  local user to elevate privileges on the host.
