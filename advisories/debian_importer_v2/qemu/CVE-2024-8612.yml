  - CVE-2024-8612
summary: A flaw was found in QEMU, in the virtio-scsi, virtio-blk, and virtio-crypto devices.
  The size for virtqueue_push as set in virtio_scsi_complete_req / virtio_blk_req_complete /
  virito_crypto_req_complete could be larger than the true size of the data which has been sent
  to guest. Once virtqueue_push() finally calls dma_memory_unmap to ummap the in_iov, it may
  call the address_space_write function to write back the data. Some uninitialized data may
  exist in the bounce.buffer, leading to an information leak.
