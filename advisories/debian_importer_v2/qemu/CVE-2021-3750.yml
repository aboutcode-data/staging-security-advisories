aliases:
  - CVE-2021-3750
summary: A DMA reentrancy issue was found in the USB EHCI controller emulation of QEMU. EHCI
  does not verify if the Buffer Pointer overlaps with its MMIO region when it transfers the
  USB packets. Crafted content may be written to the controller's registers and trigger undesirable
  actions (such as reset) while the device is still transferring packets. This can ultimately
  lead to a use-after-free issue. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process
  on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition, or potentially execute arbitrary
  code within the context of the QEMU process on the host. This flaw affects QEMU versions before
  7.0.0.
