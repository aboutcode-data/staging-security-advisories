  - CVE-2019-12928
summary: 'The QMP migrate command in QEMU version 4.0.0 and earlier is vulnerable to OS command
  injection, which allows the remote attacker to achieve code execution, denial of service,
  or information disclosure by sending a crafted QMP command to the listening server. Note:
  This has been disputed as a non-issue since QEMU''s -qmp interface is meant to be used by
  trusted users. If one is able to access this interface via a tcp socket open to the internet,
  then it is an insecure configuration issue'
