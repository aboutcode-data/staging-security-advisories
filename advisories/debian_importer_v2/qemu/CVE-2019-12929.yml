  - CVE-2019-12929
summary: 'The QMP guest_exec command in QEMU 4.0.0 and earlier is prone to OS command injection,
  which allows the attacker to achieve code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure
  by sending a crafted QMP command to the listening server. Note: This has been disputed as
  a non-issue since QEMU''s -qmp interface is meant to be used by trusted users. If one is able
  to access this interface via a tcp socket open to the internet, then it is an insecure configuration
  issue'
