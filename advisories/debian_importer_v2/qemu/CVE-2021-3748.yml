  - CVE-2021-3748
summary: A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the virtio-net device of QEMU. It could
  occur when the descriptor's address belongs to the non direct access region, due to num_buffers
  being set after the virtqueue elem has been unmapped. A malicious guest could use this flaw
  to crash QEMU, resulting in a denial of service condition, or potentially execute code on
  the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.
