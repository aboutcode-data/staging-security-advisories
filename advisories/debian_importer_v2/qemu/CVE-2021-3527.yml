aliases:
  - CVE-2021-3527
summary: A flaw was found in the USB redirector device (usb-redir) of QEMU. Small USB packets
  are combined into a single, large transfer request, to reduce the overhead and improve performance.
  The combined size of the bulk transfer is used to dynamically allocate a variable length array
  (VLA) on the stack without proper validation. Since the total size is not bounded, a malicious
  guest could use this flaw to influence the array length and cause the QEMU process to perform
  an excessive allocation on the stack, resulting in a denial of service.
