  - CVE-2021-20221
summary: An out-of-bounds heap buffer access issue was found in the ARM Generic Interrupt Controller
  emulator of QEMU up to and including qemu 4.2.0on aarch64 platform. The issue occurs because
  while writing an interrupt ID to the controller memory area, it is not masked to be 4 bits
  wide. It may lead to the said issue while updating controller state fields and their subsequent
  processing. A privileged guest user may use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host
  resulting in DoS scenario.
