  - CVE-2017-9228
summary: An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in Ruby through
  2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A heap out-of-bounds write occurs in bitset_set_range()
  during regular expression compilation due to an uninitialized variable from an incorrect state
  transition. An incorrect state transition in parse_char_class() could create an execution
  path that leaves a critical local variable uninitialized until it's used as an index, resulting
  in an out-of-bounds write memory corruption.
