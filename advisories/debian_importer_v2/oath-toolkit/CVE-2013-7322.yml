aliases:
  - CVE-2013-7322
summary: usersfile.c in liboath in OATH Toolkit before 2.4.1 does not properly handle lines
  containing an invalid one-time-password (OTP) type and a user name in /etc/users.oath, which
  causes the wrong line to be updated when invalidating an OTP and allows context-dependent
  attackers to conduct replay attacks, as demonstrated by a commented out line when using libpam-oath.
