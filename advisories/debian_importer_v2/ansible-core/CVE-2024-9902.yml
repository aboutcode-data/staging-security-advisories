aliases:
  - CVE-2024-9902
summary: A flaw was found in Ansible. The ansible-core `user` module can allow an unprivileged
  user to silently create or replace the contents of any file on any system path and take ownership
  of it when a privileged user executes the `user` module against the unprivileged user's home
  directory. If the unprivileged user has traversal permissions on the directory containing
  the exploited target file, they retain full control over the contents of the file as its owner.
