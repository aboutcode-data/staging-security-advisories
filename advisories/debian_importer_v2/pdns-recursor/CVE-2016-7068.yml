  - CVE-2016-7068
summary: An issue has been found in PowerDNS before 3.4.11 and 4.0.2, and PowerDNS recursor
  before 3.7.4 and 4.0.4, allowing a remote, unauthenticated attacker to cause an abnormal CPU
  usage load on the PowerDNS server by sending crafted DNS queries, which might result in a
  partial denial of service if the system becomes overloaded. This issue is based on the fact
  that the PowerDNS server parses all records present in a query regardless of whether they
  are needed or even legitimate. A specially crafted query containing a large number of records
  can be used to take advantage of that behaviour.
