  - CVE-2018-14644
summary: An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor from 4.0.0 up to and including 4.1.4.
  A remote attacker sending a DNS query for a meta-type like OPT can lead to a zone being wrongly
  cached as failing DNSSEC validation. It only arises if the parent zone is signed, and all
  the authoritative servers for that parent zone answer with FORMERR to a query for at least
  one of the meta-types. As a result, subsequent queries from clients requesting DNSSEC validation
  will be answered with a ServFail.
