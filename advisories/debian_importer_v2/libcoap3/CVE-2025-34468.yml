  - CVE-2025-34468
summary: libcoap versions up to and including 4.3.5, prior to commit 30db3ea, contain a stack-based
  buffer overflow in address resolution when attacker-controlled hostname data is copied into
  a fixed 256-byte stack buffer without proper bounds checking. A remote attacker can trigger
  a crash and potentially achieve remote code execution depending on compiler options and runtime
  memory protections. Exploitation requires the proxy logic to be enabled (i.e., the proxy request
  handling code path in an application using libcoap).
