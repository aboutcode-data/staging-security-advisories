summary: A memory disclosure vulnerability exists in libcoap's OSCORE configuration parser in
  libcoap before release-4.3.5-patches. An out-of-bounds read may occur when parsing certain
  configuration values, allowing an attacker to infer or read memory beyond string boundaries
  in the .rodata section. This could potentially lead to information disclosure or denial of
  service.
