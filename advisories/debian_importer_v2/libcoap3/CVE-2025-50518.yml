  - CVE-2025-50518
summary: 'A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the coap_delete_pdu_lkd function within coap_pdu.c
  of the libcoap library. This issue occurs due to improper handling of memory after the freeing
  of a PDU object, leading to potential memory corruption or the possibility of executing arbitrary
  code. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because it only occurs when an application uses
  libcoap incorrectly.'
