  - CVE-2011-4120
summary: Yubico PAM Module before 2.10 performed user authentication when 'use_first_pass' PAM
  configuration option was not used and the module was configured as 'sufficient' in the PAM
  configuration. A remote attacker could use this flaw to circumvent common authentication process
  and obtain access to the account in question by providing a NULL value (pressing Ctrl-D keyboard
  sequence) as the password string.
