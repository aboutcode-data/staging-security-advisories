  - CVE-2025-53103
summary: JUnit is a testing framework for Java and the JVM. From version 5.12.0 to 5.13.1, JUnit's
  support for writing Open Test Reporting XML files can leak Git credentials. The impact depends
  on the level of the access token exposed through the OpenTestReportGeneratingListener. If
  these test reports are published or stored anywhere public, then there is the possibility
  that a rouge attacker can steal the token and perform elevated actions by impersonating the
  user or app. This issue as been patched in version 5.13.2.
