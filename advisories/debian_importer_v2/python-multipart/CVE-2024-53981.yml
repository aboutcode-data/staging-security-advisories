  - CVE-2024-53981
summary: python-multipart is a streaming multipart parser for Python. When parsing form data,
  python-multipart skips line breaks (CR \r or LF \n) in front of the first boundary and any
  tailing bytes after the last boundary. This happens one byte at a time and emits a log event
  each time, which may cause excessive logging for certain inputs. An attacker could abuse this
  by sending a malicious request with lots of data before the first or after the last boundary,
  causing high CPU load and stalling the processing thread for a significant amount of time.
  In case of ASGI application, this could stall the event loop and prevent other requests from
  being processed, resulting in a denial of service (DoS). This vulnerability is fixed in 0.0.18.
