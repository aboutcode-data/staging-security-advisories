  - CVE-2026-24486
summary: Python-Multipart is a streaming multipart parser for Python. Prior to version 0.0.22,
  a Path Traversal vulnerability exists when using non-default configuration options `UPLOAD_DIR`
  and `UPLOAD_KEEP_FILENAME=True`. An attacker can write uploaded files to arbitrary locations
  on the filesystem by crafting a malicious filename. Users should upgrade to version 0.0.22
  to receive a patch or, as a workaround, avoid using `UPLOAD_KEEP_FILENAME=True` in project
  configurations.
