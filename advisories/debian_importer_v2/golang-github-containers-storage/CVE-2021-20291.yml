  - CVE-2021-20291
summary: A deadlock vulnerability was found in 'github.com/containers/storage' in versions before
  1.28.1. When a container image is processed, each layer is unpacked using `tar`. If one of
  those layers is not a valid `tar` archive this causes an error leading to an unexpected situation
  where the code indefinitely waits for the tar unpacked stream, which never finishes. An attacker
  could use this vulnerability to craft a malicious image, which when downloaded and stored
  by an application using containers/storage, would then cause a deadlock leading to a Denial
  of Service (DoS).
