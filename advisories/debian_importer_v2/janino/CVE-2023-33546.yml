summary: 'Janino 3.1.9 and earlier are subject to denial of service (DOS) attacks when using
  the expression evaluator.guess parameter name method. If the parser runs on user-supplied
  input, an attacker could supply content that causes the parser to crash due to a stack overflow.
  NOTE: this is disputed by multiple parties because Janino is not intended for use with untrusted
  input.'
