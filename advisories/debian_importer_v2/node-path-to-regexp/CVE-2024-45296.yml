  - CVE-2024-45296
summary: path-to-regexp turns path strings into a regular expressions. In certain cases, path-to-regexp
  will output a regular expression that can be exploited to cause poor performance. Because
  JavaScript is single threaded and regex matching runs on the main thread, poor performance
  will block the event loop and lead to a DoS. The bad regular expression is generated any time
  you have two parameters within a single segment, separated by something that is not a period
  (.). For users of 0.1, upgrade to 0.1.10. All other users should upgrade to 8.0.0.
