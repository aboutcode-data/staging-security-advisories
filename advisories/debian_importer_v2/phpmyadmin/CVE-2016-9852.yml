  - CVE-2016-9852
summary: An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin. By calling some scripts that are part of phpMyAdmin
  in an unexpected way, it is possible to trigger phpMyAdmin to display a PHP error message
  which contains the full path of the directory where phpMyAdmin is installed. During an execution
  timeout in the export functionality, the errors containing the full path of the directory
  of phpMyAdmin are written to the export file. All 4.6.x versions (prior to 4.6.5), and 4.4.x
  versions (prior to 4.4.15.9) are affected. This CVE is for the curl wrapper issue.
