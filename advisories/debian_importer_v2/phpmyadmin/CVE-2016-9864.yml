  - CVE-2016-9864
summary: An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin. With a crafted username or a table name, it
  was possible to inject SQL statements in the tracking functionality that would run with the
  privileges of the control user. This gives read and write access to the tables of the configuration
  storage database, and if the control user has the necessary privileges, read access to some
  tables of the MySQL database. All 4.6.x versions (prior to 4.6.5), 4.4.x versions (prior to
  4.4.15.9), and 4.0.x versions (prior to 4.0.10.18) are affected.
