  - CVE-2016-9847
summary: An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin. When the user does not specify a blowfish_secret
  key for encrypting cookies, phpMyAdmin generates one at runtime. A vulnerability was reported
  where the way this value is created uses a weak algorithm. This could allow an attacker to
  determine the user's blowfish_secret and potentially decrypt their cookies. All 4.6.x versions
  (prior to 4.6.5), 4.4.x versions (prior to 4.4.15.9), and 4.0.x versions (prior to 4.0.10.18)
  are affected.
