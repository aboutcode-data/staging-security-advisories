  - CVE-2018-12613
summary: An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin 4.8.x before 4.8.2, in which an attacker can
  include (view and potentially execute) files on the server. The vulnerability comes from a
  portion of code where pages are redirected and loaded within phpMyAdmin, and an improper test
  for whitelisted pages. An attacker must be authenticated, except in the "$cfg['AllowArbitraryServer']
  = true" case (where an attacker can specify any host he/she is already in control of, and
  execute arbitrary code on phpMyAdmin) and the "$cfg['ServerDefault'] = 0" case (which bypasses
  the login requirement and runs the vulnerable code without any authentication).
