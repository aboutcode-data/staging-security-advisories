  - CVE-2026-25765
summary: Faraday is an HTTP client library abstraction layer that provides a common interface
  over many adapters. Prior to 2.14.1, Faraday's build_exclusive_url method (in lib/faraday/connection.rb)
  uses Ruby's URI#merge to combine the connection's base URL with a user-supplied path. Per
  RFC 3986, protocol-relative URLs (e.g. //evil.com/path) are treated as network-path references
  that override the base URL's host/authority component. This means that if any application
  passes user-controlled input to Faraday's get(), post(), build_url(), or other request methods,
  an attacker can supply a protocol-relative URL like //attacker.com/endpoint to redirect the
  request to an arbitrary host, enabling Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). This vulnerability
  is fixed in 2.14.1.
