summary: 'Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. If an upload of a file that
  starts with CR or LF and then is followed by megabytes of data without these characters: all
  of these bytes are appended chunk by chunk into internal bytearray and lookup for boundary
  is performed on growing buffer. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending
  crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it. The amount of CPU time required
  can block worker processes from handling legitimate requests. This vulnerability has been
  patched in version 3.0.1.'
