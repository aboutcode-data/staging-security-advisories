  - CVE-2026-27199
summary: Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. Versions 3.1.5 and below,
  the safe_join function allows Windows device names as filenames if preceded by other path
  segments. This was previously reported as GHSA-hgf8-39gv-g3f2, but the added filtering failed
  to account for the fact that safe_join accepts paths with multiple segments, such as example/NUL.
  The function send_from_directory uses safe_join to safely serve files at user-specified paths
  under a directory. If the application is running on Windows, and the requested path ends with
  a special device name, the file will be opened successfully, but reading will hang indefinitely.
  This issue has been fixed in version 3.1.6.
