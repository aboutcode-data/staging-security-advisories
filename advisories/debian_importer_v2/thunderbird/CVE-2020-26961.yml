  - CVE-2020-26961
summary: When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and related IP ranges
  from the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoH resolver. However when an
  IPv4 address was mapped through IPv6, these addresses were erroneously let through, leading
  to a potential DNS Rebinding attack. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR
  < 78.5, and Thunderbird < 78.5.
