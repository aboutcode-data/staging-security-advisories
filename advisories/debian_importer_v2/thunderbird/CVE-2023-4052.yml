  - CVE-2023-4052
summary: The Firefox updater created a directory writable by non-privileged users. When uninstalling
  Firefox, any files in that directory would be recursively deleted with the permissions of
  the uninstalling user account. This could be combined with creation of a junction (a form
  of symbolic link) to allow arbitrary file deletion controlled by the non-privileged user.  *This
  bug only affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.* This vulnerability
  affects Firefox < 116, Firefox ESR < 115.1, and Thunderbird < 115.1.
