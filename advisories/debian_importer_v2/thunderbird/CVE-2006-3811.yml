  - CVE-2006-3811
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in Mozilla Firefox before 1.5.0.5, Thunderbird before 1.5.0.5,
  and SeaMonkey before 1.0.3 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and
  possibly execute arbitrary code via Javascript that leads to memory corruption, including
  (1) nsListControlFrame::FireMenuItemActiveEvent, (2) buffer overflows in the string class
  in out-of-memory conditions, (3) table row and column groups, (4) "anonymous box selectors
  outside of UA stylesheets," (5) stale references to "removed nodes," and (6) running the crypto.generateCRMFRequest
  callback on deleted context.
