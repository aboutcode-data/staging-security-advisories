  - CVE-2019-11743
summary: Navigation events were not fully adhering to the W3C's "Navigation-Timing Level 2"
  draft specification in some instances for the unload event, which restricts access to detailed
  timing attributes to only be same-origin. This resulted in potential cross-origin information
  exposure of history through timing side-channel attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox
  < 69, Thunderbird < 68.1, Thunderbird < 60.9, Firefox ESR < 60.9, and Firefox ESR < 68.1.
