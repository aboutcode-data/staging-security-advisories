summary: Set-Cookie response headers were being incorrectly honored in multipart HTTP responses.
  If an attacker could control the Content-Type response header, as well as control part of
  the response body, they could inject Set-Cookie response headers that would have been honored
  by the browser. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123, Firefox ESR < 115.8, and Thunderbird
  < 115.8.
