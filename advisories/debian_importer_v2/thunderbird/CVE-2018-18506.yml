aliases:
  - CVE-2018-18506
summary: When proxy auto-detection is enabled, if a web server serves a Proxy Auto-Configuration
  (PAC) file or if a PAC file is loaded locally, this PAC file can specify that requests to
  the localhost are to be sent through the proxy to another server. This behavior is disallowed
  by default when a proxy is manually configured, but when enabled could allow for attacks on
  services and tools that bind to the localhost for networked behavior if they are accessed
  through browsing. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 65.
