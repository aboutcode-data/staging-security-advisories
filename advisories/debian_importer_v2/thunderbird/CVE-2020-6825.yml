summary: Mozilla developers and community members Tyson Smith and Christian Holler reported
  memory safety bugs present in Firefox 74 and Firefox ESR 68.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence
  of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been
  exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.7.0, Firefox
  ESR < 68.7, and Firefox < 75.
