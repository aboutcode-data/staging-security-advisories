summary: The first time AirPods are connected to an iPhone, they become named after the user's
  name by default (e.g. Jane Doe's AirPods.) Websites with camera or microphone permission are
  able to enumerate device names, disclosing the user's name. To resolve this issue, Firefox
  added a special case that renames devices containing the substring 'AirPods' to simply 'AirPods'.
  This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.6, Firefox < 74, Firefox < ESR68.6, and Firefox
  ESR < 68.6.
