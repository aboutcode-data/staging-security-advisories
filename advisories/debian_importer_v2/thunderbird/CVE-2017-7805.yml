aliases:
  - CVE-2017-7805
summary: During TLS 1.2 exchanges, handshake hashes are generated which point to a message buffer.
  This saved data is used for later messages but in some cases, the handshake transcript can
  exceed the space available in the current buffer, causing the allocation of a new buffer.
  This leaves a pointer pointing to the old, freed buffer, resulting in a use-after-free when
  handshake hashes are then calculated afterwards. This can result in a potentially exploitable
  crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 56, Firefox ESR < 52.4, and Thunderbird < 52.4.
