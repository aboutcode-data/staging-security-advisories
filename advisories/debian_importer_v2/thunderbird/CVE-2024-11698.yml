summary: A flaw in handling fullscreen transitions may have inadvertently caused the application
  to become stuck in fullscreen mode when a modal dialog was opened during the transition. This
  issue left users unable to exit fullscreen mode using standard actions like pressing "Esc"
  or accessing right-click menus, resulting in a disrupted browsing experience until the browser
  is restarted.   *This bug only affects the application when running on macOS. Other operating
  systems are unaffected.* This vulnerability affects Firefox < 133, Firefox ESR < 128.5, Thunderbird
  < 133, and Thunderbird < 128.5.
