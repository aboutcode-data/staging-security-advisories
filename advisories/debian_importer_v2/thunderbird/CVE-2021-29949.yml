aliases:
  - CVE-2021-29949
summary: When loading the shared library that provides the OTR protocol implementation, Thunderbird
  will initially attempt to open it using a filename that isn't distributed by Thunderbird.
  If a computer has already been infected with a malicious library of the alternative filename,
  and the malicious library has been copied to a directory that is contained in the search path
  for executable libraries, then Thunderbird will load the incorrect library. This vulnerability
  affects Thunderbird < 78.9.1.
