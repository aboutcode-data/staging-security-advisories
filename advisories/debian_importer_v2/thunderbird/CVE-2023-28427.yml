  - CVE-2023-28427
summary: matrix-js-sdk is a Matrix messaging protocol Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. In versions
  prior to 24.0.0 events sent with special strings in key places can temporarily disrupt or
  impede the matrix-js-sdk from functioning properly, potentially impacting the consumer's ability
  to process data safely. Note that the matrix-js-sdk can appear to be operating normally but
  be excluding or corrupting runtime data presented to the consumer. This vulnerability is distinct
  from GHSA-rfv9-x7hh-xc32 which covers a similar issue. The issue has been patched in matrix-js-sdk
  24.0.0 and users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
