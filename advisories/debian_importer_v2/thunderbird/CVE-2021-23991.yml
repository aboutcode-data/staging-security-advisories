summary: If a Thunderbird user has previously imported Alice's OpenPGP key, and Alice has extended
  the validity period of her key, but Alice's updated key has not yet been imported, an attacker
  may send an email containing a crafted version of Alice's key with an invalid subkey, Thunderbird
  might subsequently attempt to use the invalid subkey, and will fail to send encrypted email
  to Alice. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.9.1.
