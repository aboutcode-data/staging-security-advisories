summary: 'Mozilla Network Security Service (NSS) library before 3.11.3, as used in Mozilla Firefox
  before 1.5.0.7, Thunderbird before 1.5.0.7, and SeaMonkey before 1.0.5, when using an RSA
  key with exponent 3, does not properly handle extra data in a signature, which allows remote
  attackers to forge signatures for SSL/TLS and email certificates, a similar vulnerability

  were not completely patched by MFSA2006-60. The newer fixes for 1.5.0.7 are covered by CVE-2006-5462.'
