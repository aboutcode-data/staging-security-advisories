aliases:
  - CVE-2020-6794
summary: If a user saved passwords before Thunderbird 60 and then later set a master password,
  an unencrypted copy of these passwords is still accessible. This is because the older stored
  password file was not deleted when the data was copied to a new format starting in Thunderbird
  60. The new master password is added only on the new file. This could allow the exposure of
  stored password data outside of user expectations. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird
  < 68.5.
