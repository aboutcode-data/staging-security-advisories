  - CVE-2019-11744
summary: Some HTML elements, such as &lt;title&gt; and &lt;textarea&gt;, can contain literal
  angle brackets without treating them as markup. It is possible to pass a literal closing tag
  to .innerHTML on these elements, and subsequent content after that will be parsed as if it
  were outside the tag. This can lead to XSS if a site does not filter user input as strictly
  for these elements as it does for other elements. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 69,
  Thunderbird < 68.1, Thunderbird < 60.9, Firefox ESR < 60.9, and Firefox ESR < 68.1.
