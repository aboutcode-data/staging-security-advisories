  - CVE-2021-29956
summary: OpenPGP secret keys that were imported using Thunderbird version 78.8.1 up to version
  78.10.1 were stored unencrypted on the user's local disk. The master password protection was
  inactive for those keys. Version 78.10.2 will restore the protection mechanism for newly imported
  keys, and will automatically protect keys that had been imported using affected Thunderbird
  versions. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.10.2.
