  - CVE-2022-24713
summary: regex is an implementation of regular expressions for the Rust language. The regex
  crate features built-in mitigations to prevent denial of service attacks caused by untrusted
  regexes, or untrusted input matched by trusted regexes. Those (tunable) mitigations already
  provide sane defaults to prevent attacks. This guarantee is documented and it's considered
  part of the crate's API. Unfortunately a bug was discovered in the mitigations designed to
  prevent untrusted regexes to take an arbitrary amount of time during parsing, and it's possible
  to craft regexes that bypass such mitigations. This makes it possible to perform denial of
  service attacks by sending specially crafted regexes to services accepting user-controlled,
  untrusted regexes. All versions of the regex crate before or equal to 1.5.4 are affected by
  this issue. The fix is include starting from regex 1.5.5. All users accepting user-controlled
  regexes are recommended to upgrade immediately to the latest version of the regex crate. Unfortunately
  there is no fixed set of problematic regexes, as there are practically infinite regexes that
  could be crafted to exploit this vulnerability. Because of this, it us not recommend to deny
  known problematic regexes.
