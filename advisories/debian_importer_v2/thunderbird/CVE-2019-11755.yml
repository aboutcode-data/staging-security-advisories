aliases:
  - CVE-2019-11755
summary: A crafted S/MIME message consisting of an inner encryption layer and an outer SignedData
  layer was shown as having a valid digital signature, although the signer might have had no
  access to the contents of the encrypted message, and might have stripped a different signature
  from the encrypted message. Previous versions had only suppressed showing a digital signature
  for messages with an outer multipart/signed layer. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird
  < 68.1.1.
