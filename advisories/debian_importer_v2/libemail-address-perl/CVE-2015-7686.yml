summary: 'Algorithmic complexity vulnerability in Address.pm in the Email-Address module 1.908
  and earlier for Perl allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption)
  via a crafted string containing a list of e-mail addresses in conjunction with parenthesis
  characters that can be associated with nested comments. NOTE: the default configuration in
  1.908 mitigates this vulnerability but misparses certain realistic comments.'
