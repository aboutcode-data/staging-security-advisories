  - CVE-2019-7148
summary: 'An attempted excessive memory allocation was discovered in the function read_long_names
  in elf_begin.c in libelf in elfutils 0.174. Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability
  to cause a denial-of-service via crafted elf input, which leads to an out-of-memory exception.
  NOTE: The maintainers believe this is not a real issue, but instead a "warning caused by ASAN
  because the allocation is big. By setting ASAN_OPTIONS=allocator_may_return_null=1 and running
  the reproducer, nothing happens."'
