  - CVE-2018-12520
summary: An issue was discovered in ntopng 3.4 before 3.4.180617. The PRNG involved in the generation
  of session IDs is not seeded at program startup. This results in deterministic session IDs
  being allocated for active user sessions. An attacker with foreknowledge of the operating
  system and standard library in use by the host running the service and the username of the
  user whose session they're targeting can abuse the deterministic random number generation
  in order to hijack the user's session, thus escalating their access.
