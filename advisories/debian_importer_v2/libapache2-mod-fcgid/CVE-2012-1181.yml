aliases:
  - CVE-2012-1181
summary: fcgid_spawn_ctl.c in the mod_fcgid module 2.3.6 for the Apache HTTP Server does not
  recognize the FcgidMaxProcessesPerClass directive for a virtual host, which makes it easier
  for remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a series of HTTP
  requests that triggers a process count higher than the intended limit.
