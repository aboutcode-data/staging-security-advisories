aliases:
  - CVE-2011-4675
summary: The pathname canonicalization functionality in io/filesystem/filesystem.cc in Widelands
  before 15.1 expands leading ~ (tilde) characters to home-directory pathnames but does not
  restrict use of these characters in strings received from the network, which might allow remote
  attackers to conduct absolute path traversal attacks and overwrite arbitrary files via a ~
  in a pathname that is used for a file transfer in an Internet game, a different vulnerability
  than CVE-2011-1932.
