  - CVE-2024-1019
summary: ModSecurity / libModSecurity 3.0.0 to 3.0.11 is affected by a WAF bypass for path-based
  payloads submitted via specially crafted request URLs. ModSecurity v3 decodes percent-encoded
  characters present in request URLs before it separates the URL path component from the optional
  query string component. This results in an impedance mismatch versus RFC compliant back-end
  applications. The vulnerability hides an attack payload in the path component of the URL from
  WAF rules inspecting it. A back-end may be vulnerable if it uses the path component of request
  URLs to construct queries. Integrators and users are advised to upgrade to 3.0.12. The ModSecurity
  v2 release line is not affected by this vulnerability.
