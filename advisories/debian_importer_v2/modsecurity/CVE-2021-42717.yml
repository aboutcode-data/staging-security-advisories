summary: 'ModSecurity 3.x through 3.0.5 mishandles excessively nested JSON objects. Crafted
  JSON objects with nesting tens-of-thousands deep could result in the web server being unable
  to service legitimate requests. Even a moderately large (e.g., 300KB) HTTP request can occupy
  one of the limited NGINX worker processes for minutes and consume almost all of the available
  CPU on the machine. Modsecurity 2 is similarly vulnerable: the affected versions include 2.8.0
  through 2.9.4.'
