aliases:
  - CVE-2025-5372
summary: A flaw was found in libssh versions built with OpenSSL versions older than 3.0, specifically
  in the ssh_kdf() function responsible for key derivation. Due to inconsistent interpretation
  of return values where OpenSSL uses 0 to indicate failure and libssh uses 0 for success—the
  function may mistakenly return a success status even when key derivation fails. This results
  in uninitialized cryptographic key buffers being used in subsequent communication, potentially
  compromising SSH sessions' confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
