aliases:
  - CVE-2025-8277
summary: A flaw was found in libssh's handling of key exchange (KEX) processes when a client
  repeatedly sends incorrect KEX guesses. The library fails to free memory during these rekey
  operations, which can gradually exhaust system memory. This issue can lead to crashes on the
  client side, particularly when using libgcrypt, which impacts application stability and availability.
