  - CVE-2023-3603
summary: "A missing allocation check in sftp server processing read requests may cause a NULL\
  \ dereference on low-memory conditions. The malicious client can request up to 4GB SFTP reads,\
  \ causing allocation of up to 4GB buffers, which was not being checked for failure. This will\
  \ likely crash the authenticated user's sftp server connection (if implemented as forking\
  \ as recommended). For thread-based servers, this might also cause DoS for legitimate users.\r\
  \ \r Given this code is not in any released versions, no security releases have been issued."
