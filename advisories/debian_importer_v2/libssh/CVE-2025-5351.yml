aliases:
  - CVE-2025-5351
summary: A flaw was found in the key export functionality of libssh. The issue occurs in the
  internal function responsible for converting cryptographic keys into serialized formats. During
  error handling, a memory structure is freed but not cleared, leading to a potential double
  free issue if an additional failure occurs later in the function. This condition may result
  in heap corruption or application instability in low-memory scenarios, posing a risk to system
  reliability where key export operations are performed.
