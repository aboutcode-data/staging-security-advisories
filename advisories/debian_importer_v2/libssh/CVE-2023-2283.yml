  - CVE-2023-2283
summary: A vulnerability was found in libssh, where the authentication check of the connecting
  client can be bypassed in the`pki_verify_data_signature` function in memory allocation problems.
  This issue may happen if there is insufficient memory or the memory usage is limited. The
  problem is caused by the return value `rc,` which is initialized to SSH_ERROR and later rewritten
  to save the return value of the function call `pki_key_check_hash_compatible.` The value of
  the variable is not changed between this point and the cryptographic verification. Therefore
  any error between them calls `goto error` returning SSH_OK.
