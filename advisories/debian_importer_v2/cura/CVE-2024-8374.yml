  - CVE-2024-8374
summary: UltiMaker Cura slicer versions 5.7.0-beta.1 through 5.7.2 are vulnerable to code injection
  via the 3MF format reader (/plugins/ThreeMFReader.py). The vulnerability arises from improper
  handling of the drop_to_buildplate property within 3MF files, which are ZIP archives containing
  the model data. When a 3MF file is loaded in Cura, the value of the drop_to_buildplate property
  is passed to the Python eval() function without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker
  to execute arbitrary code by crafting a malicious 3MF file. This vulnerability poses a significant
  risk as 3MF files are commonly shared via 3D model databases.
