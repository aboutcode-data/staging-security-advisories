  - CVE-2023-2804
summary: A heap-based buffer overflow issue was discovered in libjpeg-turbo in h2v2_merged_upsample_internal()
  function of jdmrgext.c file. The vulnerability can only be exploited with 12-bit data precision
  for which the range of the sample data type exceeds the valid sample range, hence, an attacker
  could craft a 12-bit lossless JPEG image that contains out-of-range 12-bit samples. An application
  attempting to decompress such image using merged upsampling would lead to segmentation fault
  or buffer overflows, causing an application to crash.
