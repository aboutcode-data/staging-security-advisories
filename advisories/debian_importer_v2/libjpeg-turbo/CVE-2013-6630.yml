  - CVE-2013-6630
summary: The get_dht function in jdmarker.c in libjpeg-turbo through 1.3.0, as used in Google
  Chrome before 31.0.1650.48 and other products, does not set all elements of a certain Huffman
  value array during the reading of segments that follow Define Huffman Table (DHT) JPEG markers,
  which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from uninitialized memory locations
  via a crafted JPEG image.
