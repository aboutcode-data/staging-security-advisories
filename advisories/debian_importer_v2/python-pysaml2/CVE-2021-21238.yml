  - CVE-2021-21238
summary: PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before
  6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. All users of
  pysaml2 that need to validate signed SAML documents are impacted. The vulnerability is a variant
  of XML Signature wrapping because it did not validate the SAML document against an XML schema.
  This allowed invalid XML documents to be processed and such a document can trick pysaml2 with
  a wrapped signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.
