aliases:
  - CVE-2020-5390
summary: PySAML2 before 5.0.0 does not check that the signature in a SAML document is enveloped
  and thus signature wrapping is effective, i.e., it is affected by XML Signature Wrapping (XSW).
  The signature information and the node/object that is signed can be in different places and
  thus the signature verification will succeed, but the wrong data will be used. This specifically
  affects the verification of assertion that have been signed.
