aliases:
  - CVE-2005-2531
summary: OpenVPN before 2.0.1, when running with "verb 0" and without TLS authentication, does
  not properly flush the OpenSSL error queue when a client fails certificate authentication
  to the server and causes the error to be processed by the wrong client, which allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service (client disconnection) via a large number of failed
  authentication attempts.
