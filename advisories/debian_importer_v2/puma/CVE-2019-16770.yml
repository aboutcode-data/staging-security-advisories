  - CVE-2019-16770
summary: In Puma before versions 3.12.2 and 4.3.1, a poorly-behaved client could use keepalive
  requests to monopolize Puma's reactor and create a denial of service attack. If more keepalive
  connections to Puma are opened than there are threads available, additional connections will
  wait permanently if the attacker sends requests frequently enough. This vulnerability is patched
  in Puma 4.3.1 and 3.12.2.
