  - CVE-2020-11077
summary: In Puma (RubyGem) before 4.3.5 and 3.12.6, a client could smuggle a request through
  a proxy, causing the proxy to send a response back to another unknown client. If the proxy
  uses persistent connections and the client adds another request in via HTTP pipelining, the
  proxy may mistake it as the first request's body. Puma, however, would see it as two requests,
  and when processing the second request, send back a response that the proxy does not expect.
  If the proxy has reused the persistent connection to Puma to send another request for a different
  client, the second response from the first client will be sent to the second client. This
  is a similar but different vulnerability from CVE-2020-11076. The problem has been fixed in
  Puma 3.12.6 and Puma 4.3.5.
