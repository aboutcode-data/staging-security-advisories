aliases:
  - CVE-2020-5247
summary: In Puma (RubyGem) before 4.3.2 and before 3.12.3, if an application using Puma allows
  untrusted input in a response header, an attacker can use newline characters (i.e. `CR`, `LF`
  or`/r`, `/n`) to end the header and inject malicious content, such as additional headers or
  an entirely new response body. This vulnerability is known as HTTP Response Splitting. While
  not an attack in itself, response splitting is a vector for several other attacks, such as
  cross-site scripting (XSS). This is related to CVE-2019-16254, which fixed this vulnerability
  for the WEBrick Ruby web server. This has been fixed in versions 4.3.2 and 3.12.3 by checking
  all headers for line endings and rejecting headers with those characters.
