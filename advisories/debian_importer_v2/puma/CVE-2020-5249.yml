aliases:
  - CVE-2020-5249
summary: In Puma (RubyGem) before 4.3.3 and 3.12.4, if an application using Puma allows untrusted
  input in an early-hints header, an attacker can use a carriage return character to end the
  header and inject malicious content, such as additional headers or an entirely new response
  body. This vulnerability is known as HTTP Response Splitting. While not an attack in itself,
  response splitting is a vector for several other attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS).
  This is related to CVE-2020-5247, which fixed this vulnerability but only for regular responses.
  This has been fixed in 4.3.3 and 3.12.4.
