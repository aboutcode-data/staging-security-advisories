  - CVE-2022-24790
summary: 'Puma is a simple, fast, multi-threaded, parallel HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack applications.
  When using Puma behind a proxy that does not properly validate that the incoming HTTP request
  matches the RFC7230 standard, Puma and the frontend proxy may disagree on where a request
  starts and ends. This would allow requests to be smuggled via the front-end proxy to Puma.
  The vulnerability has been fixed in 5.6.4 and 4.3.12. Users are advised to upgrade as soon
  as possible. Workaround: when deploying a proxy in front of Puma, turning on any and all functionality
  to make sure that the request matches the RFC7230 standard.'
