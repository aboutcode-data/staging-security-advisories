  - CVE-2020-17354
summary: 'LilyPond before 2.24 allows attackers to bypass the -dsafe protection mechanism via
  output-def-lookup or output-def-scope, as demonstrated by dangerous Scheme code in a .ly file
  that causes arbitrary code execution during conversion to a different file format. NOTE: in
  2.24 and later versions, safe mode is removed, and the product no longer tries to block code
  execution when external files are used.'
