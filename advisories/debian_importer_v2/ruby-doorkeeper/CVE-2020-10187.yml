  - CVE-2020-10187
summary: Doorkeeper version 5.0.0 and later contains an information disclosure vulnerability
  that allows an attacker to retrieve the client secret only intended for the OAuth application
  owner. After authorizing the application and allowing access, the attacker simply needs to
  request the list of their authorized applications in a JSON format (usually GET /oauth/authorized_applications.json).
  An application is vulnerable if the authorized applications controller is enabled.
