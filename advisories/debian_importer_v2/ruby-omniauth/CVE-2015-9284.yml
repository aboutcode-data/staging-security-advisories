  - CVE-2015-9284
summary: The request phase of the OmniAuth Ruby gem (1.9.1 and earlier) is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery when used as part of the Ruby on Rails framework, allowing accounts to be
  connected without user intent, user interaction, or feedback to the user. This permits a secondary
  account to be able to sign into the web application as the primary account.
