  - CVE-2019-10143
summary: 'It was discovered freeradius up to and including version 3.0.19 does not correctly
  configure logrotate, allowing a local attacker who already has control of the radiusd user
  to escalate his privileges to root, by tricking logrotate into writing a radiusd-writable
  file to a directory normally inaccessible by the radiusd user. NOTE: the upstream software
  maintainer has stated "there is simply no way for anyone to gain privileges through this alleged
  issue."'
