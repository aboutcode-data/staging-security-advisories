  - CVE-2005-4744
summary: 'Off-by-one error in the sql_error function in sql_unixodbc.c in FreeRADIUS 1.0.2.5-5,
  and possibly other versions including 1.0.4, might allow remote attackers to cause a denial
  of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code by causing the external database query
  to fail.  NOTE: this single issue is part of a larger-scale disclosure, originally by SUSE,
  which reported multiple issues that were disputed by FreeRADIUS.  Disputed issues included
  file descriptor leaks, memory disclosure, LDAP injection, and other issues.  Without additional
  information, the most recent FreeRADIUS report is being regarded as the authoritative source
  for this CVE identifier.'
