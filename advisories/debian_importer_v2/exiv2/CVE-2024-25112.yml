  - CVE-2024-25112
summary: 'Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and
  modifying the metadata of image files. A denial-of-service was found in Exiv2 version v0.28.1:
  an unbounded recursion can cause Exiv2 to crash by exhausting the stack. The vulnerable function,
  `QuickTimeVideo::multipleEntriesDecoder`, was new in v0.28.0, so Exiv2 versions before v0.28
  are _not_ affected. The denial-of-service is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata
  of a crafted video file. This bug is fixed in version v0.28.2. Users are advised to upgrade.
  There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.'
