  - CVE-2021-37620
summary: Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and
  modifying the metadata of image files. An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.4
  and earlier. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of
  a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial
  of service, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. The bug
  is fixed in version v0.27.5.
