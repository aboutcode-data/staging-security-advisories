aliases:
  - CVE-2020-8927
summary: A buffer overflow exists in the Brotli library versions prior to 1.0.8 where an attacker
  controlling the input length of a "one-shot" decompression request to a script can trigger
  a crash, which happens when copying over chunks of data larger than 2 GiB. It is recommended
  to update your Brotli library to 1.0.8 or later. If one cannot update, we recommend to use
  the "streaming" API as opposed to the "one-shot" API, and impose chunk size limits.
