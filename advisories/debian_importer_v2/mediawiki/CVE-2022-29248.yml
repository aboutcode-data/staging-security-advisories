  - CVE-2022-29248
summary: Guzzle is a PHP HTTP client. Guzzle prior to versions 6.5.6 and 7.4.3 contains a vulnerability
  with the cookie middleware. The vulnerability is that it is not checked if the cookie domain
  equals the domain of the server which sets the cookie via the Set-Cookie header, allowing
  a malicious server to set cookies for unrelated domains. The cookie middleware is disabled
  by default, so most library consumers will not be affected by this issue. Only those who manually
  add the cookie middleware to the handler stack or construct the client with ['cookies' =>
  true] are affected. Moreover, those who do not use the same Guzzle client to call multiple
  domains and have disabled redirect forwarding are not affected by this vulnerability. Guzzle
  versions 6.5.6 and 7.4.3 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, turn off the cookie
  middleware.
