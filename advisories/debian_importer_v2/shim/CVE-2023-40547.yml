  - CVE-2023-40547
summary: A remote code execution vulnerability was found in Shim. The Shim boot support trusts
  attacker-controlled values when parsing an HTTP response. This flaw allows an attacker to
  craft a specific malicious HTTP request, leading to a completely controlled out-of-bounds
  write primitive and complete system compromise. This flaw is only exploitable during the early
  boot phase, an attacker needs to perform a Man-in-the-Middle or compromise the boot server
  to be able to exploit this vulnerability successfully.
