aliases:
  - CVE-2020-35492
summary: A flaw was found in cairo's image-compositor.c in all versions prior to 1.17.4. This
  flaw allows an attacker who can provide a crafted input file to cairo's image-compositor (for
  example, by convincing a user to open a file in an application using cairo, or if an application
  uses cairo on untrusted input) to cause a stack buffer overflow -> out-of-bounds WRITE. The
  highest impact from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system
  availability.
