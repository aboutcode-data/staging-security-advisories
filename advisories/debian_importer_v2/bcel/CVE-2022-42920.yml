  - CVE-2022-42920
summary: Apache Commons BCEL has a number of APIs that would normally only allow changing specific
  class characteristics. However, due to an out-of-bounds writing issue, these APIs can be used
  to produce arbitrary bytecode. This could be abused in applications that pass attacker-controllable
  data to those APIs, giving the attacker more control over the resulting bytecode than otherwise
  expected. Update to Apache Commons BCEL 6.6.0.
