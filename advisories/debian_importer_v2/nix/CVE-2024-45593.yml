  - CVE-2024-45593
summary: Nix is a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. A bug in Nix 2.24 prior
  to 2.24.6 allows a substituter or malicious user to craft a NAR that, when unpacked by Nix,
  causes Nix to write to arbitrary file system locations to which the Nix process has access.
  This will be with root permissions when using the Nix daemon. This issue is fixed in Nix 2.24.6.
