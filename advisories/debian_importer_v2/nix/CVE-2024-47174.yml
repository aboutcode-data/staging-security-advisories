summary: Nix is a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. Starting in version 1.11
  and prior to versions 2.18.8 and 2.24.8, `<nix/fetchurl.nix>` did not verify TLS certificates
  on HTTPS connections. This could lead to connection details such as full URLs or credentials
  leaking in case of a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. `<nix/fetchurl.nix>` is also known as
  the builtin derivation builder `builtin:fetchurl`. It's not to be confused with the evaluation-time
  function `builtins.fetchurl`, which was not affected by this issue. A user may be affected
  by the risk of leaking credentials if they have a `netrc` file for authentication, or rely
  on derivations with `impureEnvVars` set to use credentials from the environment. In addition,
  the commonplace trust-on-first-use (TOFU) technique of updating dependencies by specifying
  an invalid hash and obtaining it from a remote  store was also vulnerable to a MITM injecting
  arbitrary store objects. This also applied to the impure derivations experimental feature.
  Note that this may also happen when using Nixpkgs fetchers to obtain new hashes when not using
  the fake hash method, although that mechanism is not implemented in Nix itself but rather
  in Nixpkgs using a fixed-output derivation. The behavior was introduced in version 1.11 to
  make it consistent with the Nixpkgs `pkgs.fetchurl` and to make `<nix/fetchurl.nix>` work
  in the derivation builder sandbox, which back then did not have access to the CA bundles by
  default. Nowadays, CA bundles are bind-mounted on Linux. This issue has been fixed in Nix
  2.18.8 and 2.24.8. As a workaround, implement (authenticated) fetching with `pkgs.fetchurl`
  from Nixpkgs, using `impureEnvVars` and `curlOpts` as needed.
