  - CVE-2022-1471
summary: SnakeYaml's Constructor() class does not restrict types which can be instantiated during
  deserialization. Deserializing yaml content provided by an attacker can lead to remote code
  execution. We recommend using SnakeYaml's SafeConsturctor when parsing untrusted content to
  restrict deserialization. We recommend upgrading to version 2.0 and beyond.
