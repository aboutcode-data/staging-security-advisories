  - CVE-2020-14382
summary: A vulnerability was found in upstream release cryptsetup-2.2.0 where, there's a bug
  in LUKS2 format validation code, that is effectively invoked on every device/image presenting
  itself as LUKS2 container. The bug is in segments validation code in file 'lib/luks2/luks2_json_metadata.c'
  in function hdr_validate_segments(struct crypt_device *cd, json_object *hdr_jobj) where the
  code does not check for possible overflow on memory allocation used for intervals array (see
  statement "intervals = malloc(first_backup * sizeof(*intervals));"). Due to the bug, library
  can be *tricked* to expect such allocation was successful but for far less memory then originally
  expected. Later it may read data FROM image crafted by an attacker and actually write such
  data BEYOND allocated memory.
