summary: 'yasm 1.3.0.55.g101bc has a segmentation violation in the function delete_Token at
  modules/preprocs/nasm/nasm-pp.c. NOTE: although a libyasm application could become unavailable
  if this were exploited, the vendor''s position is that there is no security relevance because
  there is either supposed to be input validation before data reaches libyasm, or a sandbox
  in which the application runs.'
