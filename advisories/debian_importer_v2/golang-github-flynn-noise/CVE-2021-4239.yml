  - CVE-2021-4239
summary: The Noise protocol implementation suffers from weakened cryptographic security after
  encrypting 2^64 messages, and a potential denial of service attack. After 2^64 (~18.4 quintillion)
  messages are encrypted with the Encrypt function, the nonce counter will wrap around, causing
  multiple messages to be encrypted with the same key and nonce. In a separate issue, the Decrypt
  function increments the nonce state even when it fails to decrypt a message. If an attacker
  can provide an invalid input to the Decrypt function, this will cause the nonce state to desynchronize
  between the peers, resulting in a failure to encrypt all subsequent messages.
