  - CVE-2022-46175
summary: JSON5 is an extension to the popular JSON file format that aims to be easier to write
  and maintain by hand (e.g. for config files). The `parse` method of the JSON5 library before
  and including versions 1.0.1 and 2.2.1 does not restrict parsing of keys named `__proto__`,
  allowing specially crafted strings to pollute the prototype of the resulting object. This
  vulnerability pollutes the prototype of the object returned by `JSON5.parse` and not the global
  Object prototype, which is the commonly understood definition of Prototype Pollution. However,
  polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application
  if the object is later used in trusted operations. This vulnerability could allow an attacker
  to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual
  impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted
  keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and
  in extreme cases, remote code execution. `JSON5.parse` should restrict parsing of `__proto__`
  keys when parsing JSON strings to objects. As a point of reference, the `JSON.parse` method
  included in JavaScript ignores `__proto__` keys. Simply changing `JSON5.parse` to `JSON.parse`
  in the examples above mitigates this vulnerability. This vulnerability is patched in json5
  versions 1.0.2, 2.2.2, and later.
