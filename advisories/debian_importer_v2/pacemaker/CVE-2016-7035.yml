  - CVE-2016-7035
summary: An authorization flaw was found in Pacemaker before 1.1.16, where it did not properly
  guard its IPC interface. An attacker with an unprivileged account on a Pacemaker node could
  use this flaw to, for example, force the Local Resource Manager daemon to execute a script
  as root and thereby gain root access on the machine.
