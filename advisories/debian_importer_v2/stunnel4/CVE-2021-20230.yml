  - CVE-2021-20230
summary: A flaw was found in stunnel before 5.57, where it improperly validates client certificates
  when it is configured to use both redirect and verifyChain options. This flaw allows an attacker
  with a certificate signed by a Certificate Authority, which is not the one accepted by the
  stunnel server, to access the tunneled service instead of being redirected to the address
  specified in the redirect option. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.
