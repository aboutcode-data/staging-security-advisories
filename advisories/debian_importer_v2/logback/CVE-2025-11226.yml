  - CVE-2025-11226
summary: ACE vulnerability in conditional configuration file processing  by QOS.CH logback-core
  up to and including version 1.5.18 in Java applications, allows an attacker to execute arbitrary
  code by compromising an existing logback configuration file or by injecting an environment
  variable before program execution.    A successful attack requires the presence of Janino
  library and Spring Framework to be present on the user's class path. In addition, the attacker
  must  have write access to a  configuration file. Alternatively, the attacker could inject
  a malicious  environment variable pointing to a malicious configuration file. In both  cases,
  the attack requires existing privilege.
