  - CVE-2026-1225
summary: ACE vulnerability in configuration file processing  by QOS.CH logback-core up to and
  including version 1.5.24 in Java applications, allows an attacker to instantiate classes already
  present on the class path by compromising an existing logback configuration file.     The
  instantiation of a potentially malicious Java class requires that said class is present on
  the user's class-path. In addition, the attacker must  have write access to a  configuration
  file. However, after successful instantiation, the instance is very likely to be discarded
  with no further ado.
