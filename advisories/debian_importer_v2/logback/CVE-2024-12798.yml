summary: ACE vulnerability in JaninoEventEvaluator  by QOS.CH logback-core       upto including
  version 0.1 to 1.3.14 and 1.4.0 to 1.5.12 in Java applications allows       attacker to execute
  arbitrary code by compromising an existing       logback configuration file or by injecting
  an environment variable       before program execution.      Malicious logback configuration
  files can allow the attacker to execute  arbitrary code using the JaninoEventEvaluator extension.    A
  successful attack requires the user to have write access to a  configuration file. Alternatively,
  the attacker could inject a malicious  environment variable pointing to a malicious configuration
  file. In both  cases, the attack requires existing privilege.
