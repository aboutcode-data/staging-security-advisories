  - CVE-2023-1370
summary: '[Json-smart](https://netplex.github.io/json-smart/) is a performance focused, JSON
  processor lib.  When reaching a ‘[‘ or ‘{‘ character in the JSON input, the code parses an
  array or an object respectively.  It was discovered that the code does not have any limit
  to the nesting of such arrays or objects. Since the parsing of nested arrays and objects is
  done recursively, nesting too many of them can cause a stack exhaustion (stack overflow) and
  crash the software.'
