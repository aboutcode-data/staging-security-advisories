aliases:
  - CVE-2024-47175
summary: CUPS is a standards-based, open-source printing system, and `libppd` can be used for
  legacy PPD file support. The `libppd` function `ppdCreatePPDFromIPP2` does not sanitize IPP
  attributes when creating the PPD buffer. When used in combination with other functions such
  as `cfGetPrinterAttributes5`, can result in user controlled input and ultimately code execution
  via Foomatic. This vulnerability can be part of an exploit chain leading to remote code execution
  (RCE), as described in CVE-2024-47176.
