aliases:
  - CVE-2025-1390
summary: The PAM module pam_cap.so of libcap configuration supports group names starting with
  “@”, during actual parsing, configurations not starting with “@” are incorrectly recognized
  as group names. This may result in nonintended users being granted an inherited capability
  set, potentially leading to security risks. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to achieve
  local privilege escalation on systems where /etc/security/capability.conf is used to configure
  user inherited privileges by constructing specific usernames.
