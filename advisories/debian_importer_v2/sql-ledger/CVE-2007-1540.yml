summary: 'Directory traversal vulnerability in am.pl in (1) SQL-Ledger 2.6.27 and earlier, and
  (2) LedgerSMB before 1.2.0, allows remote attackers to run arbitrary executables and bypass
  authentication via a .. (dot dot) sequence and trailing NULL (%00) in the login parameter.  NOTE:
  this issue was reportedly addressed in SQL-Ledger 2.6.27, however third-party researchers
  claim that the file is still executed even though an error is generated.'
