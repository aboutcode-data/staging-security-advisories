aliases:
  - CVE-2025-21613
summary: go-git is a highly extensible git implementation library written in pure Go. An argument
  injection vulnerability was discovered in go-git versions prior to v5.13. Successful exploitation
  of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary values to git-upload-pack flags.
  This only happens when the file transport protocol is being used, as that is the only protocol
  that shells out to git binaries. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.13.0.
