  - CVE-2002-1347
summary: Multiple buffer overflows in Cyrus SASL library 2.1.9 and earlier allow remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via (1) long inputs during
  user name canonicalization, (2) characters that need to be escaped during LDAP authentication
  using saslauthd, or (3) an off-by-one error in the log writer, which does not allocate space
  for the null character that terminates a string.
