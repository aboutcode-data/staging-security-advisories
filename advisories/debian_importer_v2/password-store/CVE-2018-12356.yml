aliases:
  - CVE-2018-12356
summary: An issue was discovered in password-store.sh in pass in Simple Password Store 1.7.x
  before 1.7.2. The signature verification routine parses the output of GnuPG with an incomplete
  regular expression, which allows remote attackers to spoof file signatures on configuration
  files and extension scripts. Modifying the configuration file allows the attacker to inject
  additional encryption keys under their control, thereby disclosing passwords to the attacker.
  Modifying the extension scripts allows the attacker arbitrary code execution.
