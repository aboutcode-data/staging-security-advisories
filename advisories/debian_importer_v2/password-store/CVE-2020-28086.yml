  - CVE-2020-28086
summary: 'pass through 1.7.3 has a possibility of using a password for an unintended resource.
  For exploitation to occur, the user must do a git pull, decrypt a password, and log into a
  remote service with the password. If an attacker controls the central Git server or one of
  the other members'' machines, and also controls one of the services already in the password
  store, they can rename one of the password files in the Git repository to something else:
  pass doesn''t correctly verify that the content of a file matches the filename, so a user
  might be tricked into decrypting the wrong password and sending that to a service that the
  attacker controls. NOTE: for environments in which this threat model is of concern, signing
  commits can be a solution.'
