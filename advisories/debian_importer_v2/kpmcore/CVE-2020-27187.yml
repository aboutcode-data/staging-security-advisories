aliases:
  - CVE-2020-27187
summary: An issue was discovered in KDE Partition Manager 4.1.0 before 4.2.0. The kpmcore_externalcommand
  helper contains a logic flaw in which the service invoking D-Bus is not properly checked.
  An attacker on the local machine can replace /etc/fstab, and execute mount and other partitioning
  related commands, while KDE Partition Manager is running. the mount command can then be used
  to gain full root privileges.
