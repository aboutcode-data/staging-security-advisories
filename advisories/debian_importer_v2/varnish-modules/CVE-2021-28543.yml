  - CVE-2021-28543
summary: Varnish varnish-modules before 0.17.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
  service (daemon restart) in some configurations. This does not affect organizations that only
  install the Varnish Cache product; however, it is common to install both Varnish Cache and
  varnish-modules. Specifically, an assertion failure or NULL pointer dereference can be triggered
  in Varnish Cache through the varnish-modules header.append() and header.copy() functions.
  For some Varnish Configuration Language (VCL) files, this gives remote clients an opportunity
  to cause a Varnish Cache restart. A restart reduces overall availability and performance due
  to an increased number of cache misses, and may cause higher load on backend servers.
