  - CVE-2026-22701
summary: filelock is a platform-independent file lock for Python. Prior to version 3.20.3, a
  TOCTOU race condition vulnerability exists in the SoftFileLock implementation of the filelock
  package. An attacker with local filesystem access and permission to create symlinks can exploit
  a race condition between the permission validation and file creation to cause lock operations
  to fail or behave unexpectedly. The vulnerability occurs in the _acquire() method between
  raise_on_not_writable_file() (permission check) and os.open() (file creation). During this
  race window, an attacker can create a symlink at the lock file path, potentially causing the
  lock to operate on an unintended target file or leading to denial of service. This issue has
  been patched in version 3.20.3.
