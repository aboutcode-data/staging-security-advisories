  - CVE-2022-24884
summary: 'ecdsautils is a tiny collection of programs used for ECDSA (keygen, sign, verify).
  `ecdsa_verify_[prepare_]legacy()` does not check whether the signature values `r` and `s`
  are non-zero. A signature consisting only of zeroes is always considered valid, making it
  trivial to forge signatures. Requiring multiple signatures from different public keys does
  not mitigate the issue: `ecdsa_verify_list_legacy()` will accept an arbitrary number of such
  forged signatures. Both the `ecdsautil verify` CLI command and the libecdsautil library are
  affected. The issue has been fixed in ecdsautils 0.4.1. All older versions of ecdsautils (including
  versions before the split into a library and a CLI utility) are vulnerable.'
