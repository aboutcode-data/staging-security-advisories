summary: A vulnerability was found in OpenImageIO, where a heap buffer overflow exists in the
  src/gif.imageio/gifinput.cpp file. This flaw allows a remote attacker to pass a specially
  crafted file to the application, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow and could cause
  a crash, leading to a denial of service.
