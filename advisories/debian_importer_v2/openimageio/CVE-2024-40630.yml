  - CVE-2024-40630
summary: OpenImageIO is a toolset for reading, writing, and manipulating image files of any
  image file format relevant to VFX / animation via a format-agnostic API with a feature set,
  scalability, and robustness needed for feature film production. In affected versions there
  is a bug in the heif input functionality of OpenImageIO. Specifically, in `HeifInput::seek_subimage()`.  In
  the worst case, this can lead to an information disclosure vulnerability, particularly for
  programs that directly use the `ImageInput` APIs. This bug has been addressed in commit `0a2dcb4c`
  which is included in the 2.5.13.1 release. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
  workarounds for this issue.
