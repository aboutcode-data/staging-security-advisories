  - CVE-2014-7272
summary: Simple Desktop Display Manager (SDDM) before 0.10.0 allows local users to gain root
  privileges because code running as root performs write operations within a user home directory,
  and this user may have created links in advance (exploitation requires the user to win a race
  condition in the ~/.Xauthority chown case, but not other cases).
