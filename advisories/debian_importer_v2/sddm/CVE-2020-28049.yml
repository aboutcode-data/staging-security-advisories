  - CVE-2020-28049
summary: An issue was discovered in SDDM before 0.19.0. It incorrectly starts the X server in
  a way that - for a short time period - allows local unprivileged users to create a connection
  to the X server without providing proper authentication. A local attacker can thus access
  X server display contents and, for example, intercept keystrokes or access the clipboard.
  This is caused by a race condition during Xauthority file creation.
