  - CVE-2022-3560
summary: A flaw was found in pesign. The pesign package provides a systemd service used to start
  the pesign daemon. This service unit runs a script to set ACLs for /etc/pki/pesign and /run/pesign
  directories to grant access privileges to users in the 'pesign' group. However, the script
  doesn't check for symbolic links. This could allow an attacker to gain access to privileged
  files and directories via a path traversal attack.
