  - CVE-2022-1249
summary: A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in pesign's cms_set_pw_data() function of
  the cms_common.c file. The function fails to handle the NULL pwdata invocation from daemon.c,
  which leads to an explicit NULL dereference and crash on all attempts to daemonize pesign.
