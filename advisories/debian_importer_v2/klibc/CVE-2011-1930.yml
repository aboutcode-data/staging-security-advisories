  - CVE-2011-1930
summary: In klibc 1.5.20 and 1.5.21, the DHCP options written by ipconfig to /tmp/net-$DEVICE.conf
  are not properly escaped. This may allow a remote attacker to send a specially crafted DHCP
  reply which could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of any process which sources
  DHCP options.
