  - CVE-2013-7397
summary: Async Http Client (aka AHC or async-http-client) before 1.9.0 skips X.509 certificate
  verification unless both a keyStore location and a trustStore location are explicitly set,
  which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof HTTPS servers by presenting an arbitrary
  certificate during use of a typical AHC configuration, as demonstrated by a configuration
  that does not send client certificates.
