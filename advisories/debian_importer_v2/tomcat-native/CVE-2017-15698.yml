aliases:
  - CVE-2017-15698
summary: When parsing the AIA-Extension field of a client certificate, Apache Tomcat Native
  Connector 1.2.0 to 1.2.14 and 1.1.23 to 1.1.34 did not correctly handle fields longer than
  127 bytes. The result of the parsing error was to skip the OCSP check. It was therefore possible
  for client certificates that should have been rejected (if the OCSP check had been made) to
  be accepted. Users not using OCSP checks are not affected by this vulnerability.
