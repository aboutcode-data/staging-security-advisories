aliases:
  - CVE-2018-8019
summary: When using an OCSP responder Apache Tomcat Native 1.2.0 to 1.2.16 and 1.1.23 to 1.1.34
  did not correctly handle invalid responses. This allowed for revoked client certificates to
  be incorrectly identified. It was therefore possible for users to authenticate with revoked
  certificates when using mutual TLS. Users not using OCSP checks are not affected by this vulnerability.
