  - CVE-2021-44225
summary: In Keepalived through 2.2.4, the D-Bus policy does not sufficiently restrict the message
  destination, allowing any user to inspect and manipulate any property. This leads to access-control
  bypass in some situations in which an unrelated D-Bus system service has a settable (writable)
  property
