  - CVE-2018-19044
summary: keepalived 2.0.8 didn't check for pathnames with symlinks when writing data to a temporary
  file upon a call to PrintData or PrintStats. This allowed local users to overwrite arbitrary
  files if fs.protected_symlinks is set to 0, as demonstrated by a symlink from /tmp/keepalived.data
  or /tmp/keepalived.stats to /etc/passwd.
