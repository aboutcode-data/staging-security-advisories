  - CVE-2024-41909
summary: Like many other SSH implementations, Apache MINA SSHD suffered from the issue that
  is more widely known as CVE-2023-48795. An attacker that can intercept traffic between client
  and server could drop certain packets from the stream, potentially causing client and server
  to consequently end up with a connection for which  some security features have been downgraded
  or disabled, aka a Terrapin  attack  The mitigations to prevent this type of attack were implemented
  in Apache MINA SSHD 2.12.0, both client and server side. Users are recommended to upgrade
  to at least this version. Note that both the client and the server implementation must have
  mitigations applied against this issue, otherwise the connection may still be affected.
