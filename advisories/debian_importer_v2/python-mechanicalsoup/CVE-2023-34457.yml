summary: MechanicalSoup is a Python library for automating interaction with websites. Starting
  in version 0.2.0 and prior to version 1.3.0, a malicious web server can read arbitrary files
  on the client using a `<input type="file" ...>` inside HTML form. All users of MechanicalSoup's
  form submission are affected, unless they took very specific (and manual) steps to reset HTML
  form field values. Version 1.3.0 contains a patch for this issue.
