  - CVE-2019-14870
summary: All Samba versions 4.x.x before 4.9.17, 4.10.x before 4.10.11 and 4.11.x before 4.11.3
  have an issue, where the S4U (MS-SFU) Kerberos delegation model includes a feature allowing
  for a subset of clients to be opted out of constrained delegation in any way, either S4U2Self
  or regular Kerberos authentication, by forcing all tickets for these clients to be non-forwardable.
  In AD this is implemented by a user attribute delegation_not_allowed (aka not-delegated),
  which translates to disallow-forwardable. However the Samba AD DC does not do that for S4U2Self
  and does set the forwardable flag even if the impersonated client has the not-delegated flag
  set.
