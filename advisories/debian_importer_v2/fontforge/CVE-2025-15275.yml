summary: FontForge SFD File Parsing Heap-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.
  This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations
  of FontForge. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
  must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the
  parsing of SFD files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of
  user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this
  vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user. Was ZDI-CAN-28543.
