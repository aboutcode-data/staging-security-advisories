summary: FontForge GUtils SGI File Parsing Heap-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution
  Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected
  installations of FontForge. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in
  that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists
  within the parsing of scanlines within SGI files. The issue results from the lack of proper
  validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer.
  An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current
  process. Was ZDI-CAN-27920.
