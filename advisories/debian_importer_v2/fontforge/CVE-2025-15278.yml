summary: FontForge GUtils XBM File Parsing Integer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.
  This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations
  of FontForge. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
  must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the
  parsing of pixels within XBM files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of
  user-supplied data, which can result in an integer overflow before allocating a buffer. An
  attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.
