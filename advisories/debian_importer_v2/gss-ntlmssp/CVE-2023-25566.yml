summary: GSS-NTLMSSP is a mechglue plugin for the GSSAPI library that implements NTLM authentication.
  Prior to version 1.2.0, a memory leak can be triggered when parsing usernames which can trigger
  a denial-of-service. The domain portion of a username may be overridden causing an allocated
  memory area the size of the domain name to be leaked. An attacker can leak memory via the
  main `gss_accept_sec_context` entry point, potentially causing a denial-of-service. This issue
  is fixed in version 1.2.0.
