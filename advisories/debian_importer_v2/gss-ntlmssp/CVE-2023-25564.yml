summary: GSS-NTLMSSP is a mechglue plugin for the GSSAPI library that implements NTLM authentication.
  Prior to version 1.2.0, memory corruption can be triggered when decoding UTF16 strings. The
  variable `outlen` was not initialized and could cause writing a zero to an arbitrary place
  in memory if `ntlm_str_convert()` were to fail, which would leave `outlen` uninitialized.
  This can lead to a denial of service if the write hits unmapped memory or randomly corrupts
  a byte in the application memory space. This vulnerability can trigger an out-of-bounds write,
  leading to memory corruption. This vulnerability can be triggered via the main `gss_accept_sec_context`
  entry point. This issue is fixed in version 1.2.0.
