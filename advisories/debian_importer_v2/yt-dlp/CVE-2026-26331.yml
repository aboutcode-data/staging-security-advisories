  - CVE-2026-26331
summary: yt-dlp is a command-line audio/video downloader. Starting in version 2023.06.21 and
  prior to version 2026.02.21, when yt-dlp's `--netrc-cmd` command-line option (or `netrc_cmd`
  Python API parameter) is used, an attacker could achieve arbitrary command injection on the
  user's system with a maliciously crafted URL. yt-dlp maintainers assume the impact of this
  vulnerability to be high for anyone who uses `--netrc-cmd` in their command/configuration
  or `netrc_cmd` in their Python scripts. Even though the maliciously crafted URL itself will
  look very suspicious to many users, it would be trivial for a maliciously crafted webpage
  with an inconspicuous URL to covertly exploit this vulnerability via HTTP redirect. Users
  without `--netrc-cmd` in their arguments or `netrc_cmd` in their scripts are unaffected. No
  evidence has been found of this exploit being used in the wild. yt-dlp version 2026.02.21
  fixes this issue by validating all netrc "machine" values and raising an error upon unexpected
  input. As a workaround, users who are unable to upgrade should avoid using the `--netrc-cmd`
  command-line option (or `netrc_cmd` Python API parameter), or they should at least not pass
  a placeholder (`{}`) in their `--netrc-cmd` argument.
