  - CVE-2018-12029
summary: A race condition in the nginx module in Phusion Passenger 3.x through 5.x before 5.3.2
  allows local escalation of privileges when a non-standard passenger_instance_registry_dir
  with insufficiently strict permissions is configured. Replacing a file with a symlink after
  the file was created, but before it was chowned, leads to the target of the link being chowned
  via the path. Targeting sensitive files such as root's crontab file allows privilege escalation.
