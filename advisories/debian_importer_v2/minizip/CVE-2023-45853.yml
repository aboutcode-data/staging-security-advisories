summary: 'MiniZip in zlib through 1.3 has an integer overflow and resultant heap-based buffer
  overflow in zipOpenNewFileInZip4_64 via a long filename, comment, or extra field. NOTE: MiniZip
  is not a supported part of the zlib product. NOTE: pyminizip through 0.2.6 is also vulnerable
  because it bundles an affected zlib version, and exposes the applicable MiniZip code through
  its compress API.'
