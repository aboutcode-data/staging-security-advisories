  - CVE-2019-15847
summary: The POWER9 backend in GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) before version 10 could optimize
  multiple calls of the __builtin_darn intrinsic into a single call, thus reducing the entropy
  of the random number generator. This occurred because a volatile operation was not specified.
  For example, within a single execution of a program, the output of every __builtin_darn()
  call may be the same.
