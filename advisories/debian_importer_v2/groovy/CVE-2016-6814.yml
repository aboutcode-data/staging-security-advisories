aliases:
  - CVE-2016-6814
summary: When an application with unsupported Codehaus versions of Groovy from 1.7.0 to 2.4.3,
  Apache Groovy 2.4.4 to 2.4.7 on classpath uses standard Java serialization mechanisms, e.g.
  to communicate between servers or to store local data, it was possible for an attacker to
  bake a special serialized object that will execute code directly when deserialized. All applications
  which rely on serialization and do not isolate the code which deserializes objects were subject
  to this vulnerability.
