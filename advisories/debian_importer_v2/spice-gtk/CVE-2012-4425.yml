  - CVE-2012-4425
summary: 'libgio, when used in setuid or other privileged programs in spice-gtk and possibly
  other products, allows local users to gain privileges and execute arbitrary code via the DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS
  environment variable.  NOTE: it could be argued that this is a vulnerability in the applications
  that do not cleanse environment variables, not in libgio itself.'
