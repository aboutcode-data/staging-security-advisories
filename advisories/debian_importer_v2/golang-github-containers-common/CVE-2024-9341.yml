  - CVE-2024-9341
summary: A flaw was found in Go. When FIPS mode is enabled on a system, container runtimes may
  incorrectly handle certain file paths due to improper validation in the containers/common
  Go library. This flaw allows an attacker to exploit symbolic links and trick the system into
  mounting sensitive host directories inside a container. This issue also allows attackers to
  access critical host files, bypassing the intended isolation between containers and the host
  system.
