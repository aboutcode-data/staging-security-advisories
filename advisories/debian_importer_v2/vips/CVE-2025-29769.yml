  - CVE-2025-29769
summary: libvips is a demand-driven, horizontally threaded image processing library.  The heifsave
  operation could incorrectly determine the presence of an alpha channel in an input when it
  was not possible to determine the colour interpretation, known internally within libvips as
  "multiband". There aren't many ways to create a "multiband" input, but it is possible with
  a well-crafted TIFF image. If a "multiband" TIFF input image had 4 channels and HEIF-based
  output was requested, this led to libvips creating a 3 channel HEIF image without an alpha
  channel but then attempting to write 4 channels of data. This caused a heap buffer overflow,
  which could crash the process. This vulnerability is fixed in 8.16.1.
