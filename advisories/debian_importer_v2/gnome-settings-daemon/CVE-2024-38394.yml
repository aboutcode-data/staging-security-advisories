  - CVE-2024-38394
summary: 'Mismatches in interpreting USB authorization policy between GNOME Settings Daemon
  (GSD) through 46.0 and the Linux kernel''s underlying device matching logic allow a physically
  proximate attacker to access some unintended Linux kernel USB functionality, such as USB device-specific
  kernel modules and filesystem implementations. NOTE: the GSD supplier indicates that consideration
  of a mitigation for this within GSD would be in the context of "a new feature, not a CVE."'
