summary: 'Heap-based buffer overflow in the doInterval function in regexcmp.cpp in libicu in
  International Components for Unicode (ICU) 3.8.1 and earlier allows context-dependent attackers

  via a regular expression that writes a large amount of data to the backtracking stack.  NOTE:
  some of these details are obtained from third party information.'
