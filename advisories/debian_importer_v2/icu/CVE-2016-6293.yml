aliases:
  - CVE-2016-6293
summary: The uloc_acceptLanguageFromHTTP function in common/uloc.cpp in International Components
  for Unicode (ICU) through 57.1 for C/C++ does not ensure that there is a '\0' character at
  the end of a certain temporary array, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (out-of-bounds read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a call with a long httpAcceptLanguage
  argument.
