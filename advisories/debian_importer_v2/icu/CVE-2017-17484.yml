  - CVE-2017-17484
summary: The ucnv_UTF8FromUTF8 function in ucnv_u8.cpp in International Components for Unicode
  (ICU) for C/C++ through 60.1 mishandles ucnv_convertEx calls for UTF-8 to UTF-8 conversion,
  which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow and
  application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted string, as demonstrated
  by ZNC.
