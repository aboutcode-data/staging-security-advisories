summary: 'jsdiff is a JavaScript text differencing implementation. Prior to versions 8.0.3,
  5.2.2, 4.0.4, and 3.5.1, attempting to parse a patch whose filename headers contain the line
  break characters `\r`, `\u2028`, or `\u2029` can cause the `parsePatch` method to enter an
  infinite loop. It then consumes memory without limit until the process crashes due to running
  out of memory. Applications are therefore likely to be vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack
  if they call `parsePatch` with a user-provided patch as input. A large payload is not needed
  to trigger the vulnerability, so size limits on user input do not provide any protection.
  Furthermore, some applications may be vulnerable even when calling `parsePatch` on a patch
  generated by the application itself if the user is nonetheless able to control the filename
  headers (e.g. by directly providing the filenames of the files to be diffed). The `applyPatch`
  method is similarly affected if (and only if) called with a string representation of a patch
  as an argument, since under the hood it parses that string using `parsePatch`. Other methods
  of the library are unaffected. Finally, a second and lesser interdependent bug - a ReDOS -
  also exhibits when those same line break characters are present in a patch''s *patch* header
  (also known as its "leading garbage"). A maliciously-crafted patch header of length *n* can
  take `parsePatch` O(*n*³) time to parse. Versions 8.0.3, 5.2.2, 4.0.4, and 3.5.1 contain a
  fix. As a workaround, do not attempt to parse patches that contain any of these characters:
  `\r`, `\u2028`, or `\u2029`.'
