  - CVE-2012-0024
summary: MaraDNS before 1.3.07.12 and 1.4.x before 1.4.08 computes hash values for DNS data
  without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by sending many crafted queries with
  the Recursion Desired (RD) bit set.
