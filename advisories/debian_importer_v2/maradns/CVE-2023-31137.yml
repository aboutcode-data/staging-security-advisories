  - CVE-2023-31137
summary: MaraDNS is open-source software that implements the Domain Name System (DNS). In version
  3.5.0024 and prior, a remotely exploitable integer underflow vulnerability in the DNS packet
  decompression function allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service by triggering an abnormal
  program termination.  The vulnerability exists in the `decomp_get_rddata` function within
  the `Decompress.c` file. When handling a DNS packet with an Answer RR of qtype 16 (TXT record)
  and any qclass, if the `rdlength` is smaller than `rdata`, the result of the line `Decompress.c:886`
  is a negative number `len = rdlength - total;`. This value is then passed to the `decomp_append_bytes`
  function without proper validation, causing the program to attempt to allocate a massive chunk
  of memory that is impossible to allocate. Consequently, the program exits with an error code
  of 64, causing a Denial of Service.  One proposed fix for this vulnerability is to patch `Decompress.c:887`
  by breaking `if(len <= 0)`, which has been incorporated in version 3.5.0036 via commit bab062bde40b2ae8a91eecd522e84d8b993bab58.
