  - CVE-2011-5055
summary: 'MaraDNS 1.3.07.12 and 1.4.08 computes hash values for DNS data without properly restricting
  the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows remote attackers to cause
  a denial of service (CPU consumption) by sending many crafted queries with the Recursion Desired
  (RD) bit set.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-0024.'
