aliases:
  - CVE-2011-0520
summary: The compress_add_dlabel_points function in dns/Compress.c in MaraDNS 1.4.03, 1.4.05,
  and probably other versions allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation
  fault) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long DNS hostname with a large number of
  labels, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
