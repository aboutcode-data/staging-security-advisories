aliases:
  - CVE-2012-1570
summary: The resolver in MaraDNS before 1.3.0.7.15 and 1.4.x before 1.4.12 overwrites cached
  server names and TTL values in NS records during the processing of a response to an A record
  query, which allows remote attackers to trigger continued resolvability of revoked domain
  names via a "ghost domain names" attack.
