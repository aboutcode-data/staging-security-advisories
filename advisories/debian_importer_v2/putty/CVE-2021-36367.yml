aliases:
  - CVE-2021-36367
summary: PuTTY through 0.75 proceeds with establishing an SSH session even if it has never sent
  a substantive authentication response. This makes it easier for an attacker-controlled SSH
  server to present a later spoofed authentication prompt (that the attacker can use to capture
  credential data, and use that data for purposes that are undesired by the client user).
