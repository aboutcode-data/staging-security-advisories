  - CVE-2021-33500
summary: 'PuTTY before 0.75 on Windows allows remote servers to cause a denial of service (Windows
  GUI hang) by telling the PuTTY window to change its title repeatedly at high speed, which
  results in many SetWindowTextA or SetWindowTextW calls. NOTE: the same attack methodology
  may affect some OS-level GUIs on Linux or other platforms for similar reasons.'
