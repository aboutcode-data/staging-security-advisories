  - CVE-2023-29529
summary: matrix-js-sdk is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript and TypeScript. An attacker
  present in a room where an MSC3401 group call is taking place can eavesdrop on the video and
  audio of participants using matrix-js-sdk, without their knowledge. To affected matrix-js-sdk
  users, the attacker will not appear to be participating in the call. This attack is possible
  because matrix-js-sdk's group call implementation accepts incoming direct calls from other
  users, even if they have not yet declared intent to participate in the group call, as a means
  of resolving a race condition in call setup. Affected versions do not restrict access to the
  user's outbound media in this case. Legacy 1:1 calls are unaffected. This is fixed in matrix-js-sdk
  24.1.0. As a workaround, users may hold group calls in private rooms where only the exact
  users who are expected to participate in the call are present.
