summary: Matrix Javascript SDK is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. Starting with
  version 17.1.0-rc.1, improperly formed beacon events can disrupt or impede the matrix-js-sdk
  from functioning properly, potentially impacting the consumer's ability to process data safely.
  Note that the matrix-js-sdk can appear to be operating normally but be excluding or corrupting
  runtime data presented to the consumer. This is patched in matrix-js-sdk v19.7.0. Redacting
  applicable events, waiting for the sync processor to store data, and restarting the client
  are possible workarounds. Alternatively, redacting the applicable events and clearing all
  storage will fix the further perceived issues. Downgrading to an unaffected version, noting
  that such a version may be subject to other vulnerabilities, will additionally resolve the
  issue.
