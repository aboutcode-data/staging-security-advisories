summary: Matrix JavaScript SDK is a Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript and TypeScript.
  matrix-js-sdk before 38.2.0 has insufficient validation of room predecessor links in MatrixClient::getJoinedRooms,
  allowing a remote attacker to attempt to replace a tombstoned room with an unrelated attacker-supplied
  room. The issue has been patched and users should upgrade to 38.2.0. A workaround is to avoid
  using MatrixClient::getJoinedRooms in favor of getRooms() and filtering upgraded rooms separately.
