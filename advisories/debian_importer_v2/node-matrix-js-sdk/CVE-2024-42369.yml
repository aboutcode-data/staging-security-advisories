  - CVE-2024-42369
summary: matrix-js-sdk is a Matrix messaging protocol Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. A malicious
  homeserver can craft a room or room structure such that the predecessors form a cycle. The
  matrix-js-sdk's getRoomUpgradeHistory function will infinitely recurse in this case, causing
  the code to hang. This method is public but also called by the 'leaveRoomChain()' method,
  so leaving a room will also trigger the bug. This was patched in matrix-js-sdk 34.3.1.
