  - CVE-2011-1488
summary: A memory leak in rsyslog before 5.7.6 was found in the way deamon processed log messages
  are logged when $RepeatedMsgReduction was enabled. A local attacker could use this flaw to
  cause a denial of the rsyslogd daemon service by crashing the service via a sequence of repeated
  log messages sent within short periods of time.
