summary: An issue was discovered in Rsyslog v8.1908.0. contrib/pmaixforwardedfrom/pmaixforwardedfrom.c
  has a heap overflow in the parser for AIX log messages. The parser tries to locate a log message
  delimiter (in this case, a space or a colon) but fails to account for strings that do not
  satisfy this constraint. If the string does not match, then the variable lenMsg will reach
  the value zero and will skip the sanity check that detects invalid log messages. The message
  will then be considered valid, and the parser will eat up the nonexistent colon delimiter.
  In doing so, it will decrement lenMsg, a signed integer, whose value was zero and now becomes
  minus one. The following step in the parser is to shift left the contents of the message.
  To do this, it will call memmove with the right pointers to the target and destination strings,
  but the lenMsg will now be interpreted as a huge value, causing a heap overflow.
