  - CVE-2023-29197
summary: guzzlehttp/psr7 is a PSR-7 HTTP message library implementation in PHP. Affected versions
  are subject to improper header parsing. An attacker could sneak in a newline (\n) into both
  the header names and values. While the specification states that \r\n\r\n is used to terminate
  the header list, many servers in the wild will also accept \n\n. This is a follow-up to CVE-2022-24775
  where the fix was incomplete. The issue has been patched in versions 1.9.1 and 2.4.5. There
  are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade.
