  - CVE-2017-14604
summary: GNOME Nautilus before 3.23.90 allows attackers to spoof a file type by using the .desktop
  file extension, as demonstrated by an attack in which a .desktop file's Name field ends in
  .pdf but this file's Exec field launches a malicious "sh -c" command. In other words, Nautilus
  provides no UI indication that a file actually has the potentially unsafe .desktop extension;
  instead, the UI only shows the .pdf extension. One (slightly) mitigating factor is that an
  attack requires the .desktop file to have execute permission. The solution is to ask the user
  to confirm that the file is supposed to be treated as a .desktop file, and then remember the
  user's answer in the metadata::trusted field.
