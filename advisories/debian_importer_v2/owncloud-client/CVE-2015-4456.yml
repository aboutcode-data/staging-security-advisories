  - CVE-2015-4456
summary: ownCloud Desktop Client before 1.8.2 does not call QNetworkReply::ignoreSslErrors with
  the list of errors to be ignored, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to bypass the user's
  certificate distrust decision and obtain sensitive information by leveraging a self-signed
  certificate and a connection to a server using its own self-signed certificate.
