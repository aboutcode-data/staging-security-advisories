aliases:
  - CVE-2019-7628
summary: Pagure 5.2 leaks API keys by e-mailing them to users. Few e-mail servers validate TLS
  certificates, so it is easy for man-in-the-middle attackers to read these e-mails and gain
  access to Pagure on behalf of other users. This issue is found in the API token expiration
  reminder cron job in files/api_key_expire_mail.py; disabling that job is also a viable solution.
  (E-mailing a substring of the API key was an attempted, but rejected, solution.)
