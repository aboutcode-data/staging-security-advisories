  - CVE-2026-25639
summary: Axios is a promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. Prior to versions
  0.30.3 and 1.13.5, the mergeConfig function in axios crashes with a TypeError when processing
  configuration objects containing __proto__ as an own property. An attacker can trigger this
  by providing a malicious configuration object created via JSON.parse(), causing complete denial
  of service. This vulnerability is fixed in versions 0.30.3 and 1.13.5.
