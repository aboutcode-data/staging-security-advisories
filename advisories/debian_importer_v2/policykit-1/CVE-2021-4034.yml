  - CVE-2021-4034
summary: A local privilege escalation vulnerability was found on polkit's pkexec utility. The
  pkexec application is a setuid tool designed to allow unprivileged users to run commands as
  privileged users according predefined policies. The current version of pkexec doesn't handle
  the calling parameters count correctly and ends trying to execute environment variables as
  commands. An attacker can leverage this by crafting environment variables in such a way it'll
  induce pkexec to execute arbitrary code. When successfully executed the attack can cause a
  local privilege escalation given unprivileged users administrative rights on the target machine.
