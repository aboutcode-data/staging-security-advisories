summary: Exim AUTH Out-Of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability
  allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Exim. Authentication
  is not required to exploit this vulnerability.   The specific flaw exists within the smtp
  service, which listens on TCP port 25 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper
  validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of a buffer. An
  attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the service account.
