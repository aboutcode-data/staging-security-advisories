  - CVE-2020-28008
summary: Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Execution with Unnecessary Privileges. Because Exim operates
  as root in the spool directory (owned by a non-root user), an attacker can write to a /var/spool/exim4/input
  spool header file, in which a crafted recipient address can indirectly lead to command execution.
