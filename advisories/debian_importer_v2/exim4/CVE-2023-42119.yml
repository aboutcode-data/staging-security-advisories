  - CVE-2023-42119
summary: Exim dnsdb Out-Of-Bounds Read Information Disclosure Vulnerability. This vulnerability
  allows network-adjacent attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations
  of Exim. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw
  exists within the smtp service, which listens on TCP port 25 by default. The issue results
  from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past
  the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities
  to execute arbitrary code in the context of the service account. . Was ZDI-CAN-17643.
