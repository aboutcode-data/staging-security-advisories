summary: Exim SMTP Challenge Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.
  This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations
  of Exim. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw
  exists within the handling of NTLM challenge requests. The issue results from the lack of
  proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length
  stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context
  of the service account. . Was ZDI-CAN-17515.
