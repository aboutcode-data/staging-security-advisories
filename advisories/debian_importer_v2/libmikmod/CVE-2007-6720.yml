aliases:
  - CVE-2007-6720
summary: libmikmod 3.1.9 through 3.2.0, as used by MikMod, SDL-mixer, and possibly other products,
  relies on the channel count of the last loaded song, rather than the currently playing song,
  for certain playback calculations, which allows user-assisted attackers to cause a denial
  of service (application crash) by loading multiple songs (aka MOD files) with different numbers
  of channels.
