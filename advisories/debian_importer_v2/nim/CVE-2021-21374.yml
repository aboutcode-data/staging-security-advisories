  - CVE-2021-21374
summary: Nimble is a package manager for the Nim programming language. In Nim release versions
  before versions 1.2.10 and 1.4.4, "nimble refresh" fetches a list of Nimble packages over
  HTTPS without full verification of the SSL/TLS certificate due to the default setting of httpClient.
  An attacker able to perform MitM can deliver a modified package list containing malicious
  software packages. If the packages are installed and used the attack escalates to untrusted
  code execution.
