aliases:
  - CVE-2019-12210
summary: In Yubico pam-u2f 1.0.7, when configured with debug and a custom debug log file is
  set using debug_file, that file descriptor is not closed when a new process is spawned. This
  leads to the file descriptor being inherited into the child process; the child process can
  then read from and write to it. This can leak sensitive information and also, if written to,
  be used to fill the disk or plant misinformation.
