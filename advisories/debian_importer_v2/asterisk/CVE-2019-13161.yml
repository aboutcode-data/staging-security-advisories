aliases:
  - CVE-2019-13161
summary: An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source through 13.27.0, 14.x and 15.x through
  15.7.2, and 16.x through 16.4.0, and Certified Asterisk through 13.21-cert3. A pointer dereference
  in chan_sip while handling SDP negotiation allows an attacker to crash Asterisk when handling
  an SDP answer to an outgoing T.38 re-invite. To exploit this vulnerability an attacker must
  cause the chan_sip module to send a T.38 re-invite request to them. Upon receipt, the attacker
  must send an SDP answer containing both a T.38 UDPTL stream and another media stream containing
  only a codec (which is not permitted according to the chan_sip configuration).
