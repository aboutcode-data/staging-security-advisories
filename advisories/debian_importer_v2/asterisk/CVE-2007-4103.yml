  - CVE-2007-4103
summary: The IAX2 channel driver (chan_iax2) in Asterisk Open 1.2.x before 1.2.23, 1.4.x before
  1.4.9, and Asterisk Appliance Developer Kit before 0.6.0, when configured to allow unauthenticated
  calls, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion) via a flood
  of calls that do not complete a 3-way handshake, which causes an ast_channel to be allocated
  but not released.
