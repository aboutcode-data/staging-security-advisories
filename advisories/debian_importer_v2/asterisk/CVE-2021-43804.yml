  - CVE-2021-43804
summary: PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C language
  implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In affected
  versions if the incoming RTCP BYE message contains a reason's length, this declared length
  is not checked against the actual received packet size, potentially resulting in an out-of-bound
  read access. This issue affects all users that use PJMEDIA and RTCP. A malicious actor can
  send a RTCP BYE message with an invalid reason length. Users are advised to upgrade as soon
  as possible. There are no known workarounds.
