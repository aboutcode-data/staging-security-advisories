summary: PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C language
  implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In versions
  2.11.1 and prior, parsing an incoming SIP message that contains a malformed multipart can
  potentially cause out-of-bound read access. This issue affects all PJSIP users that accept
  SIP multipart. The patch is available as commit in the `master` branch. There are no known
  workarounds.
