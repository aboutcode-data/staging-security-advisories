  - CVE-2025-47780
summary: Asterisk is an open-source private branch exchange (PBX). Prior to versions 18.26.2,
  20.14.1, 21.9.1, and 22.4.1 of Asterisk and versions 18.9-cert14 and 20.7-cert5 of certified-asterisk,
  trying to disallow shell commands to be run via the Asterisk command line interface (CLI)
  by configuring `cli_permissions.conf` (e.g. with the config line `deny=!*`) does not work
  which could lead to a security risk. If an administrator running an Asterisk instance relies
  on the `cli_permissions.conf` file to work and expects it to deny all attempts to execute
  shell commands, then this could lead to a security vulnerability. Versions 18.26.2, 20.14.1,
  21.9.1, and 22.4.1 of Asterisk and versions 18.9-cert14 and 20.7-cert5 of certified-asterisk
  fix the issue.
