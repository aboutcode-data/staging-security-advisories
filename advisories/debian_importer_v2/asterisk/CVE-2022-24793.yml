  - CVE-2022-24793
summary: PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C. A buffer
  overflow vulnerability in versions 2.12 and prior affects applications that use PJSIP DNS
  resolution. It doesn't affect PJSIP users who utilize an external resolver. This vulnerability
  is related to CVE-2023-27585. The difference is that this issue is in parsing the query record
  `parse_rr()`, while the issue in CVE-2023-27585 is in `parse_query()`. A patch is available
  in the `master` branch of the `pjsip/pjproject` GitHub repository. A workaround is to disable
  DNS resolution in PJSIP config (by setting `nameserver_count` to zero) or use an external
  resolver instead.
