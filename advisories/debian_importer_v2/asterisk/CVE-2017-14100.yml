  - CVE-2017-14100
summary: In Asterisk 11.x before 11.25.2, 13.x before 13.17.1, and 14.x before 14.6.1 and Certified
  Asterisk 11.x before 11.6-cert17 and 13.x before 13.13-cert5, unauthorized command execution
  is possible. The app_minivm module has an "externnotify" program configuration option that
  is executed by the MinivmNotify dialplan application. The application uses the caller-id name
  and number as part of a built string passed to the OS shell for interpretation and execution.
  Since the caller-id name and number can come from an untrusted source, a crafted caller-id
  name or number allows an arbitrary shell command injection.
