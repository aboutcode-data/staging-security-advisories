summary: 'The IAX2 channel driver (chan_iax2) for Asterisk 1.2.x before 1.2.9 and 1.0.x before
  1.0.11 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and execute arbitrary
  code via truncated IAX 2 (IAX2) video frames, which bypasses a length check and leads to a
  buffer overflow involving negative length check.  NOTE: the vendor advisory claims that only
  a DoS is possible, but the original researcher is reliable.'
