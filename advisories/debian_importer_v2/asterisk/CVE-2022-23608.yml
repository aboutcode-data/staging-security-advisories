  - CVE-2022-23608
summary: PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C language
  implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In versions
  up to and including 2.11.1 when in a dialog set (or forking) scenario, a hash key shared by
  multiple UAC dialogs can potentially be prematurely freed when one of the dialogs is destroyed
  . The issue may cause a dialog set to be registered in the hash table multiple times (with
  different hash keys) leading to undefined behavior such as dialog list collision which eventually
  leading to endless loop. A patch is available in commit db3235953baa56d2fb0e276ca510fefca751643f
  which will be included in the next release. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
