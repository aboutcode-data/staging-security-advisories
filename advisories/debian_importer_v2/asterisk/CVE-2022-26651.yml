  - CVE-2022-26651
summary: An issue was discovered in Asterisk through 19.x and Certified Asterisk through 16.8-cert13.
  The func_odbc module provides possibly inadequate escaping functionality for backslash characters
  in SQL queries, resulting in user-provided data creating a broken SQL query or possibly a
  SQL injection. This is fixed in 16.25.2, 18.11.2, and 19.3.2, and 16.8-cert14.
