summary: The IAX2 channel driver (chan_iax2) in Asterisk 1.2 before revision 72630 and 1.4 before
  revision 65679, when configured to allow unauthenticated calls, sends "early audio" to an
  unverified source IP address of a NEW message, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
  of service (traffic amplification) via a spoofed NEW message.
