summary: Asterisk is an open source private branch exchange and telephony toolkit. Prior to
  versions 20.7-cert9, 20.18.2, 21.12.1, 22.8.2, and 23.2.2, when ast_coredumper writes its
  gdb init and output files to a directory that is world-writable (for example /tmp), an attacker
  with write permission(which is all users on a linux system) to that directory can cause root
  to execute arbitrary commands or overwrite arbitrary files by controlling the gdb init file
  and output paths. This issue has been patched in versions 20.7-cert9, 20.18.2, 21.12.1, 22.8.2,
  and 23.2.2.
