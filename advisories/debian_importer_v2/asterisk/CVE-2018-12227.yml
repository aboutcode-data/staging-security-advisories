  - CVE-2018-12227
summary: An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 13.x before 13.21.1, 14.x before 14.7.7,
  and 15.x before 15.4.1 and Certified Asterisk 13.18-cert before 13.18-cert4 and 13.21-cert
  before 13.21-cert2. When endpoint specific ACL rules block a SIP request, they respond with
  a 403 forbidden. However, if an endpoint is not identified, then a 401 unauthorized response
  is sent. This vulnerability just discloses which requests hit a defined endpoint. The ACL
  rules cannot be bypassed to gain access to the disclosed endpoints.
