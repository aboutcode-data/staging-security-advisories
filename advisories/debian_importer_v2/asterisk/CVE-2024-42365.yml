  - CVE-2024-42365
summary: Asterisk is an open source private branch exchange (PBX) and telephony toolkit. Prior
  to asterisk versions 18.24.2, 20.9.2, and 21.4.2 and certified-asterisk versions 18.9-cert11
  and 20.7-cert2, an AMI user with `write=originate` may change all configuration files in the
  `/etc/asterisk/` directory. This occurs because they are able to curl remote files and write
  them to disk, but are also able to append to existing files using the `FILE` function inside
  the `SET` application. This issue may result in privilege escalation, remote code execution
  and/or blind server-side request forgery with arbitrary protocol. Asterisk versions 18.24.2,
  20.9.2, and 21.4.2 and certified-asterisk versions 18.9-cert11 and 20.7-cert2 contain a fix
  for this issue.
