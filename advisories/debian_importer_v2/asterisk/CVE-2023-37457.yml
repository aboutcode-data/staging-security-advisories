  - CVE-2023-37457
summary: Asterisk is an open source private branch exchange and telephony toolkit. In Asterisk
  versions 18.20.0 and prior, 20.5.0 and prior, and 21.0.0; as well as ceritifed-asterisk 18.9-cert5
  and prior, the 'update' functionality of the PJSIP_HEADER dialplan function can exceed the
  available buffer space for storing the new value of a header. By doing so this can overwrite
  memory or cause a crash. This is not externally exploitable, unless dialplan is explicitly
  written to update a header based on data from an outside source. If the 'update' functionality
  is not used the vulnerability does not occur. A patch is available at commit a1ca0268254374b515fa5992f01340f7717113fa.
