  - CVE-2026-23741
summary: Asterisk is an open source private branch exchange and telephony toolkit. Prior to
  versions 20.7-cert9, 20.18.2, 21.12.1, 22.8.2, and 23.2.2, the asterisk/contrib/scripts/ast_coredumper
  runs as root, as noted by the NOTES tag on line 689 of the ast_coredumper file. The script
  will source the contents of /etc/asterisk/ast_debug_tools.conf, which resides in a folder
  that is writeable by the asterisk user:group. Due to the /etc/asterisk/ast_debug_tools.conf
  file following bash semantics and it being loaded; an attacker with write permissions may
  add or modify the file such that when the root ast_coredumper is run; it would source and
  thereby execute arbitrary bash code found in the /etc/asterisk/ast_debug_tools.conf. This
  issue has been patched in versions 20.7-cert9, 20.18.2, 21.12.1, 22.8.2, and 23.2.2.
