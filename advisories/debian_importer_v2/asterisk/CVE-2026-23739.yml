summary: Asterisk is an open source private branch exchange and telephony toolkit. Prior to
  versions 20.7-cert9, 20.18.2, 21.12.1, 22.8.2, and 23.2.2, the ast_xml_open() function in
  xml.c parses XML documents using libxml with unsafe parsing options that enable entity expansion
  and XInclude processing. Specifically, it invokes xmlReadFile() with the XML_PARSE_NOENT flag
  and later processes XIncludes via xmlXIncludeProcess().If any untrusted or user-supplied XML
  file is passed to this function, it can allow an attacker to trigger XML External Entity (XXE)
  or XInclude-based local file disclosure, potentially exposing sensitive files from the host
  system. This can also be triggered in other cases in which the user is able to supply input
  in xml format that triggers the asterisk process to parse it. This issue has been patched
  in versions 20.7-cert9, 20.18.2, 21.12.1, 22.8.2, and 23.2.2.
