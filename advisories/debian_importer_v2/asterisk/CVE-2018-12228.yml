aliases:
  - CVE-2018-12228
summary: An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 15.x before 15.4.1. When connected
  to Asterisk via TCP/TLS, if the client abruptly disconnects, or sends a specially crafted
  message, then Asterisk gets caught in an infinite loop while trying to read the data stream.
  This renders the system unusable.
