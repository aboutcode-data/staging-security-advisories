summary: 'Asterisk is an open-source private branch exchange (PBX). Prior to versions 18.24.3,
  20.9.3, and 21.4.3 of Asterisk and versions 18.9-cert12 and 20.7-cert2 of certified-asterisk,
  if Asterisk attempts to send a SIP request to a URI whose host portion starts with `.1` or
  `[.1]`, and res_resolver_unbound is loaded, Asterisk will crash with a SEGV. To receive a
  patch, users should upgrade to one of the following versions: 18.24.3, 20.9.3, 21.4.3, certified-18.9-cert12,
  certified-20.7-cert2. Two workarounds are available. Disable res_resolver_unbound by setting
  `noload = res_resolver_unbound.so` in modules.conf, or set `rewrite_contact = yes` on all
  PJSIP endpoints. NOTE: This may not be appropriate for all Asterisk configurations.'
