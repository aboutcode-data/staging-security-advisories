  - CVE-2023-27585
summary: PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C. A buffer
  overflow vulnerability in versions 2.13 and prior affects applications that use PJSIP DNS
  resolver. It doesn't affect PJSIP users who do not utilise PJSIP DNS resolver. This vulnerability
  is related to CVE-2022-24793. The difference is that this issue is in parsing the query record
  `parse_query()`, while the issue in CVE-2022-24793 is in `parse_rr()`. A patch is available
  as commit `d1c5e4d` in the `master` branch. A workaround is to disable DNS resolution in PJSIP
  config (by setting `nameserver_count` to zero) or use an external resolver implementation
  instead.
