  - CVE-2025-66412
summary: 'Angular is a development platform for building mobile and desktop web applications
  using TypeScript/JavaScript and other languages. Prior to 21.0.2, 20.3.15, and 19.2.17, A
  Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in the Angular Template
  Compiler. It occurs because the compiler''s internal security schema is incomplete, allowing
  attackers to bypass Angular''s built-in security sanitization. Specifically, the schema fails
  to classify certain URL-holding attributes (e.g., those that could contain javascript: URLs)
  as requiring strict URL security, enabling the injection of malicious scripts. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 21.0.2, 20.3.15, and 19.2.17.'
