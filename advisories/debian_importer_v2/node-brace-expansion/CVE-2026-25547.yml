  - CVE-2026-25547
summary: '@isaacs/brace-expansion is a hybrid CJS/ESM TypeScript fork of brace-expansion. Prior
  to version 5.0.1, @isaacs/brace-expansion is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) issue
  caused by unbounded brace range expansion. When an attacker provides a pattern containing
  repeated numeric brace ranges, the library attempts to eagerly generate every possible combination
  synchronously. Because the expansion grows exponentially, even a small input can consume excessive
  CPU and memory and may crash the Node.js process. This issue has been patched in version 5.0.1.'
