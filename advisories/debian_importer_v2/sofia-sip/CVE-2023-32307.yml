summary: Sofia-SIP is an open-source SIP User-Agent library, compliant with the IETF RFC3261
  specification. Referring to [GHSA-8599-x7rq-fr54](https://github.com/freeswitch/sofia-sip/security/advisories/GHSA-8599-x7rq-fr54),
  several other potential heap-over-flow and integer-overflow in stun_parse_attr_error_code
  and stun_parse_attr_uint32 were found because the lack of attributes length check when Sofia-SIP
  handles STUN packets. The previous patch of [GHSA-8599-x7rq-fr54](https://github.com/freeswitch/sofia-sip/security/advisories/GHSA-8599-x7rq-fr54)
  fixed the vulnerability when attr_type did not match the enum value, but there are also vulnerabilities
  in the handling of other valid cases. The OOB read and integer-overflow made by attacker may
  lead to crash, high consumption of memory or even other more serious consequences. These issue
  have been addressed in version 1.13.15. Users are advised to upgrade.
