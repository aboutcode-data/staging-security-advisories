  - CVE-2022-30636
summary: httpTokenCacheKey uses path.Base to extract the expected HTTP-01 token value to lookup
  in the DirCache implementation. On Windows, path.Base acts differently to filepath.Base, since
  Windows uses a different path separator (\ vs. /), allowing a user to provide a relative path,
  i.e. .well-known/acme-challenge/..\..\asd becomes ..\..\asd. The extracted path is then suffixed
  with +http-01, joined with the cache directory, and opened. Since the controlled path is suffixed
  with +http-01 before opening, the impact of this is significantly limited, since it only allows
  reading arbitrary files on the system if and only if they have this suffix.
