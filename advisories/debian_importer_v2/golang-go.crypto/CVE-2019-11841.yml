  - CVE-2019-11841
summary: A message-forgery issue was discovered in crypto/openpgp/clearsign/clearsign.go in
  supplementary Go cryptography libraries 2019-03-25. According to the OpenPGP Message Format
  specification in RFC 4880 chapter 7, a cleartext signed message can contain one or more optional
  "Hash" Armor Headers. The "Hash" Armor Header specifies the message digest algorithm(s) used
  for the signature. However, the Go clearsign package ignores the value of this header, which
  allows an attacker to spoof it. Consequently, an attacker can lead a victim to believe the
  signature was generated using a different message digest algorithm than what was actually
  used. Moreover, since the library skips Armor Header parsing in general, an attacker can not
  only embed arbitrary Armor Headers, but also prepend arbitrary text to cleartext messages
  without invalidating the signatures.
