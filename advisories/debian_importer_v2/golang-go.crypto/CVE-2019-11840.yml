  - CVE-2019-11840
summary: An issue was discovered in the supplementary Go cryptography library, golang.org/x/crypto,
  before v0.0.0-20190320223903-b7391e95e576. A flaw was found in the amd64 implementation of
  the golang.org/x/crypto/salsa20 and golang.org/x/crypto/salsa20/salsa packages. If more than
  256 GiB of keystream is generated, or if the counter otherwise grows greater than 32 bits,
  the amd64 implementation will first generate incorrect output, and then cycle back to previously
  generated keystream. Repeated keystream bytes can lead to loss of confidentiality in encryption
  applications, or to predictability in CSPRNG applications.
