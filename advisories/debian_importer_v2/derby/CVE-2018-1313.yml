  - CVE-2018-1313
summary: In Apache Derby 10.3.1.4 to 10.14.1.0, a specially-crafted network packet can be used
  to request the Derby Network Server to boot a database whose location and contents are under
  the user's control. If the Derby Network Server is not running with a Java Security Manager
  policy file, the attack is successful. If the server is using a policy file, the policy file
  must permit the database location to be read for the attack to work. The default Derby Network
  Server policy file distributed with the affected releases includes a permissive policy as
  the default Network Server policy, which allows the attack to work.
