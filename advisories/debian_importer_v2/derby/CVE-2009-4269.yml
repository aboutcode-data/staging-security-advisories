  - CVE-2009-4269
summary: The password hash generation algorithm in the BUILTIN authentication functionality
  for Apache Derby before 10.6.1.0 performs a transformation that reduces the size of the set
  of inputs to SHA-1, which produces a small search space that makes it easier for local and
  possibly remote attackers to crack passwords by generating hash collisions, related to password
  substitution.
