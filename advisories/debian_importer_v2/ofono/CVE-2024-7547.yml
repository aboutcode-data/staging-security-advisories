aliases:
  - CVE-2024-7547
summary: oFono SMS Decoder Stack-based Buffer Overflow Privilege Escalation Vulnerability. This
  vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of
  oFono. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute code on the target modem in order
  to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of SMS PDUs. The
  issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior
  to copying it to a stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute
  code in the context of the service account. Was ZDI-CAN-23460.
