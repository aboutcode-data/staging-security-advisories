summary: oFono QMI SMS Handling Out-Of-Bounds Read Information Disclosure Vulnerability. This
  vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations
  of oFono. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw
  exists within the processing of SMS message lists. The issue results from the lack of proper
  validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated
  buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute
  arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-23157.
