summary: oFono AT CMT Command Uninitialized Variable Information Disclosure Vulnerability. This
  vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations
  of oFono. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute code on the target modem in
  order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of responses
  from AT+CMT commands. The issue results from the lack of proper initialization of memory prior
  to accessing it. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to
  execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-23308.
