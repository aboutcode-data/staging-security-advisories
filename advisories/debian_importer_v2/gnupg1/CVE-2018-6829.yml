aliases:
  - CVE-2018-6829
summary: cipher/elgamal.c in Libgcrypt through 1.8.2, when used to encrypt messages directly,
  improperly encodes plaintexts, which allows attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading
  ciphertext data (i.e., it does not have semantic security in face of a ciphertext-only attack).
  The Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption does not hold for Libgcrypt's ElGamal implementation.
