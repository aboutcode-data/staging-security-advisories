aliases:
  - CVE-2017-7526
summary: libgcrypt before version 1.7.8 is vulnerable to a cache side-channel attack resulting
  into a complete break of RSA-1024 while using the left-to-right method for computing the sliding-window
  expansion. The same attack is believed to work on RSA-2048 with moderately more computation.
  This side-channel requires that attacker can run arbitrary software on the hardware where
  the private RSA key is used.
