summary: 'unp 1.0.12, and other versions before 1.0.14, does not properly escape file names,
  which might allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters
  in a filename argument. NOTE: this might only be a vulnerability when unp is invoked by a
  third party product.'
