summary: In Apache MINA, a specifically crafted, malformed HTTP request may cause the HTTP Header
  decoder to loop indefinitely. The decoder assumed that the HTTP Header begins at the beginning
  of the buffer and loops if there is more data than expected. Please update MINA to 2.1.5 or
  greater.
