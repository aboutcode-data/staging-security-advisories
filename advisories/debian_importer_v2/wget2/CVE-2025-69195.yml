aliases:
  - CVE-2025-69195
summary: A flaw was found in GNU Wget2. This vulnerability, a stack-based buffer overflow, occurs
  in the filename sanitization logic when processing attacker-controlled URL paths, particularly
  when filename restriction options are active. A remote attacker can exploit this by providing
  a specially crafted URL, which, upon user interaction with wget2, can lead to memory corruption.
  This can cause the application to crash and potentially allow for further malicious activities.
