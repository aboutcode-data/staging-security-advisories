summary: ntpd in ntp before 4.2.8p14 and 4.3.x before 4.3.100 allows remote attackers to cause
  a denial of service (daemon exit or system time change) by predicting transmit timestamps
  for use in spoofed packets. The victim must be relying on unauthenticated IPv4 time sources.
  There must be an off-path attacker who can query time from the victim's ntpd instance.
