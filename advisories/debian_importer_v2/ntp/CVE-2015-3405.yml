  - CVE-2015-3405
summary: 'ntp-keygen in ntp 4.2.8px before 4.2.8p2-RC2 and 4.3.x before 4.3.12 does not generate
  MD5 keys with sufficient entropy on big endian machines when the lowest order byte of the
  temp variable is between 0x20 and 0x7f and not #, which might allow remote attackers to obtain
  the value of generated MD5 keys via a brute force attack with the 93 possible keys.'
