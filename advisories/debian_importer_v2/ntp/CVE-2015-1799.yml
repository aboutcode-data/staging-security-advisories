  - CVE-2015-1799
summary: The symmetric-key feature in the receive function in ntp_proto.c in ntpd in NTP 3.x
  and 4.x before 4.2.8p2 performs state-variable updates upon receiving certain invalid packets,
  which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to cause a denial of service (synchronization
  loss) by spoofing the source IP address of a peer.
