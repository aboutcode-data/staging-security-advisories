  - CVE-2016-1548
summary: An attacker can spoof a packet from a legitimate ntpd server with an origin timestamp
  that matches the peer->dst timestamp recorded for that server. After making this switch, the
  client in NTP 4.2.8p4 and earlier and NTPSec aa48d001683e5b791a743ec9c575aaf7d867a2b0c will
  reject all future legitimate server responses. It is possible to force the victim client to
  move time after the mode has been changed. ntpq gives no indication that the mode has been
  switched.
