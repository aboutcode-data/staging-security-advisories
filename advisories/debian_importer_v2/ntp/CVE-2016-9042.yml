aliases:
  - CVE-2016-9042
summary: An exploitable denial of service vulnerability exists in the origin timestamp check
  functionality of ntpd 4.2.8p9. A specially crafted unauthenticated network packet can be used
  to reset the expected origin timestamp for target peers. Legitimate replies from targeted
  peers will fail the origin timestamp check (TEST2) causing the reply to be dropped and creating
  a denial of service condition.
