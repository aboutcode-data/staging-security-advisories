  - CVE-2025-6297
summary: It was discovered that dpkg-deb does not properly sanitize directory permissions when
  extracting a control member into a temporary directory, which is documented as being a safe
  operation even on untrusted data. This may result in leaving temporary files behind on cleanup.
  Given automated and repeated execution of dpkg-deb commands on adversarial .deb packages or
  with well compressible files, placed inside a directory with permissions not allowing removal
  by a non-root user, this can end up in a DoS scenario due to causing disk quota exhaustion
  or disk full conditions.
