aliases:
  - CVE-2014-3127
summary: 'dpkg 1.15.9 on Debian squeeze introduces support for the "C-style encoded filenames"
  feature without recognizing that the squeeze patch program lacks this feature, which triggers
  an interaction error that allows remote attackers to conduct directory traversal attacks and
  modify files outside of the intended directories via a crafted source package.  NOTE: this
  can be considered a release engineering problem in the effort to fix CVE-2014-0471.'
