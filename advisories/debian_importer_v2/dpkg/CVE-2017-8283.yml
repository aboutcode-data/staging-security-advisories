aliases:
  - CVE-2017-8283
summary: dpkg-source in dpkg 1.3.0 through 1.18.23 is able to use a non-GNU patch program and
  does not offer a protection mechanism for blank-indented diff hunks, which allows remote attackers
  to conduct directory traversal attacks via a crafted Debian source package, as demonstrated
  by use of dpkg-source on NetBSD.
