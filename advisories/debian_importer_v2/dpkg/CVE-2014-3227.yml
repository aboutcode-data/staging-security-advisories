  - CVE-2014-3227
summary: 'dpkg 1.15.9, 1.16.x before 1.16.14, and 1.17.x before 1.17.9 expect the patch program
  to be compliant with a need for the "C-style encoded filenames" feature, but is supported
  in environments with noncompliant patch programs, which triggers an interaction error that
  allows remote attackers to conduct directory traversal attacks and modify files outside of
  the intended directories via a crafted source package. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because
  of reliance on unrealistic constraints on the behavior of an external program.'
