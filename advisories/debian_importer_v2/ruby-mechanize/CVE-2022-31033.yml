summary: The Mechanize library is used for automating interaction with websites. Mechanize automatically
  stores and sends cookies, follows redirects, and can follow links and submit forms. In versions
  prior to 2.8.5 the Authorization header is leaked after a redirect to a different port on
  the same site. Users are advised to upgrade to Mechanize v2.8.5 or later. There are no known
  workarounds for this issue.
