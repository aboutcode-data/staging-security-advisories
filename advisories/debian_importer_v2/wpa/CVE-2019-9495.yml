aliases:
  - CVE-2019-9495
summary: The implementations of EAP-PWD in hostapd and wpa_supplicant are vulnerable to side-channel
  attacks as a result of cache access patterns. All versions of hostapd and wpa_supplicant with
  EAP-PWD support are vulnerable. The ability to install and execute applications is necessary
  for a successful attack. Memory access patterns are visible in a shared cache. Weak passwords
  may be cracked. Versions of hostapd/wpa_supplicant 2.7 and newer, are not vulnerable to the
  timing attack described in CVE-2019-9494. Both hostapd with EAP-pwd support and wpa_supplicant
  with EAP-pwd support prior to and including version 2.7 are affected.
