aliases:
  - CVE-2019-5061
summary: An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the hostapd 2.6, where an
  attacker could trigger AP to send IAPP location updates for stations, before the required
  authentication process has completed. This could lead to different denial of service scenarios,
  either by causing CAM table attacks, or by leading to traffic flapping if faking already existing
  clients in other nearby Aps of the same wireless infrastructure. An attacker can forge Authentication
  and Association Request packets to trigger this vulnerability.
