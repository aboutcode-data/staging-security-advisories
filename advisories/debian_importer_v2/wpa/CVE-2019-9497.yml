  - CVE-2019-9497
summary: The implementations of EAP-PWD in hostapd EAP Server and wpa_supplicant EAP Peer do
  not validate the scalar and element values in EAP-pwd-Commit. This vulnerability may allow
  an attacker to complete EAP-PWD authentication without knowing the password. However, unless
  the crypto library does not implement additional checks for the EC point, the attacker will
  not be able to derive the session key or complete the key exchange. Both hostapd with SAE
  support and wpa_supplicant with SAE support prior to and including version 2.4 are affected.
  Both hostapd with EAP-pwd support and wpa_supplicant with EAP-pwd support prior to and including
  version 2.7 are affected.
