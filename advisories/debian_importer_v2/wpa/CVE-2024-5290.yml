aliases:
  - CVE-2024-5290
summary: An issue was discovered in Ubuntu wpa_supplicant that resulted in loading of arbitrary
  shared objects, which allows a local unprivileged attacker to escalate privileges to the user
  that wpa_supplicant runs as (usually root).     Membership in the netdev group or access to
  the dbus interface of wpa_supplicant allow an unprivileged user to specify an arbitrary path
  to a module to be loaded by the wpa_supplicant process; other escalation paths might exist.
