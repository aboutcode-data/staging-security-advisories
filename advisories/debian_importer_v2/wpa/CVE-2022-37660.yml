  - CVE-2022-37660
summary: In hostapd 2.10 and earlier, the PKEX code remains active even after a successful PKEX
  association. An attacker that successfully bootstrapped public keys with another entity using
  PKEX in the past, will be able to subvert a future bootstrapping by passively observing public
  keys, re-using the encrypting element Qi and subtracting it from the captured message M (X
  = M - Qi). This will result in the public ephemeral key X; the only element required to subvert
  the PKEX association.
