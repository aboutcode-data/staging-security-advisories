aliases:
  - CVE-2019-16275
summary: hostapd before 2.10 and wpa_supplicant before 2.10 allow an incorrect indication of
  disconnection in certain situations because source address validation is mishandled. This
  is a denial of service that should have been prevented by PMF (aka management frame protection).
  The attacker must send a crafted 802.11 frame from a location that is within the 802.11 communications
  range.
