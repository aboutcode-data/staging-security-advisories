aliases:
  - CVE-2015-5314
summary: The eap_pwd_process function in eap_server/eap_server_pwd.c in hostapd 2.x before 2.6
  does not validate that the reassembly buffer is large enough for the final fragment when used
  with (1) an internal EAP server or (2) a RADIUS server and EAP-pwd is enabled in a runtime
  configuration, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (process termination)
  via a large final fragment in an EAP-pwd message.
