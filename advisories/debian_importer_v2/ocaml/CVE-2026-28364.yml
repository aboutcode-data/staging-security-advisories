  - CVE-2026-28364
summary: In OCaml before 4.14.3 and 5.x before 5.4.1, a buffer over-read in Marshal deserialization
  (runtime/intern.c) enables remote code execution through a multi-phase attack chain. The vulnerability
  stems from missing bounds validation in the readblock() function, which performs unbounded
  memcpy() operations using attacker-controlled lengths from crafted Marshal data.
