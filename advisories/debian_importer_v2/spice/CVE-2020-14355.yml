  - CVE-2020-14355
summary: Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities were found in the QUIC image decoding process
  of the SPICE remote display system, before spice-0.14.2-1. Both the SPICE client (spice-gtk)
  and server are affected by these flaws. These flaws allow a malicious client or server to
  send specially crafted messages that, when processed by the QUIC image compression algorithm,
  result in a process crash or potential code execution.
