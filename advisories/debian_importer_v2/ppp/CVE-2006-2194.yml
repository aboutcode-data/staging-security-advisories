  - CVE-2006-2194
summary: The winbind plugin in pppd for ppp 2.4.4 and earlier does not check the return code
  from the setuid function call, which might allow local users to gain privileges by causing
  setuid to fail, such as exceeding PAM limits for the maximum number of user processes, which
  prevents the winbind NTLM authentication helper from dropping privileges.
