  - CVE-2022-1122
summary: A flaw was found in the opj2_decompress program in openjpeg2 2.4.0 in the way it handles
  an input directory with a large number of files. When it fails to allocate a buffer to store
  the filenames of the input directory, it calls free() on an uninitialized pointer, leading
  to a segmentation fault and a denial of service.
