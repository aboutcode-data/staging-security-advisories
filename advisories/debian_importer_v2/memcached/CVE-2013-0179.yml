aliases:
  - CVE-2013-0179
summary: The process_bin_delete function in memcached.c in memcached 1.4.4 and other versions
  before 1.4.17, when running in verbose mode, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
  service (segmentation fault) via a request to delete a key, which does not account for the
  lack of a null terminator in the key and triggers a buffer over-read when printing to stderr.
