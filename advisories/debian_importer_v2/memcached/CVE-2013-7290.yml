aliases:
  - CVE-2013-7290
summary: The do_item_get function in items.c in memcached 1.4.4 and other versions before 1.4.17,
  when running in verbose mode, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation
  fault) via a request to delete a key, which does not account for the lack of a null terminator
  in the key and triggers a buffer over-read when printing to stderr, a different vulnerability
  than CVE-2013-0179.
