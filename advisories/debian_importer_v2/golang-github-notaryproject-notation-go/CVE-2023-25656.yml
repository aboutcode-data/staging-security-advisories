aliases:
  - CVE-2023-25656
summary: notation-go is a collection of libraries for supporting Notation sign, verify, push,
  and pull of oci artifacts. Prior to version 1.0.0-rc.3, notation-go users will find their
  application using excessive memory when verifying signatures. The application will be killed,
  and thus availability is impacted. The problem has been patched in the release v1.0.0-rc.3.
  Some workarounds are available. Users can review their own trust policy file and check if
  the identity string contains `=#`. Meanwhile, users should only put trusted certificates in
  their trust stores referenced by their own trust policy files, and make sure the `authenticity`
  validation is set to `enforce`.
