summary: OpenEXR provides the specification and reference implementation of the EXR file format,
  an image storage format for the motion picture industry. In versions 3.3.0 through 3.3.6 and
  3.4.0 through 3.4.4, a heap-buffer-overflow (OOB read) occurs in the `istream_nonparallel_read`
  function in `ImfContextInit.cpp` when parsing a malformed EXR file through a memory-mapped
  `IStream`. A signed integer subtraction produces a negative value that is implicitly converted
  to `size_t`, resulting in a massive length being passed to `memcpy`. Versions 3.3.7 and 3.4.5
  contain a patch.
