summary: Academy Software Foundation OpenEXR EXR File Parsing Heap-based Buffer Overflow Remote
  Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
  code on affected installations of Academy Software Foundation OpenEXR. User interaction is
  required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open
  a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of EXR files. The issue results
  from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it
  to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the
  context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-27947.
