summary: OpenEXR provides the specification and reference implementation of the EXR file format,
  an image storage format for the motion picture industry. In version 3.3.2, when reading a
  deep scanline image with a large sample count in reduceMemory mode, it is possible to crash
  a target application with a NULL pointer dereference in a write operation. This is fixed in
  version 3.3.3.
