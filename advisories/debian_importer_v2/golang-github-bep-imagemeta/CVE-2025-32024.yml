  - CVE-2025-32024
summary: bep/imagemeta is a Go library for reading EXIF, IPTC and XMP image meta data from JPEG,
  TIFF, PNG, and WebP files. The EXIF data format allows for defining excessively large data
  structures in relatively small payloads. Before v0.10.0, If you didn't trust the input images,
  this could be abused to construct denial-of-service attacks. v0.10.0 added LimitNumTags (default
  5000) and LimitTagSize (default 10000) options.
