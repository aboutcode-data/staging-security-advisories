summary: 'Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name vulnerability in Apache Shiro.  This issue
  affects Apache Shiro: before 2.0.7.  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.0.7, which
  fixes the issue.  The issue only effects static files. If static files are served from a case-insensitive
  filesystem, such as default macOS setup, static files may be accessed by varying the case
  of the filename in the request. If only lower-case (common default) filters are present in
  Shiro, they may be bypassed this way.  Shiro 2.0.7 and later has a new parameters to remediate
  this issue shiro.ini: filterChainResolver.caseInsensitive = true application.propertie: shiro.caseInsensitive=true  Shiro
  3.0.0 and later (upcoming) makes this the default.'
