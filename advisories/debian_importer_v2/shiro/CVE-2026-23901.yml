  - CVE-2026-23901
summary: 'Observable Timing Discrepancy vulnerability in Apache Shiro.  This issue affects Apache
  Shiro: from 1.*, 2.* before 2.0.7.  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.0.7 or later,
  which fixes the issue.  Prior to Shiro 2.0.7, code paths for non-existent vs. existing users
  are different enough, that a brute-force attack may be able to tell, by timing the requests
  only, determine if the request failed because of a non-existent user vs. wrong password.  The
  most likely attack vector is a local attack only. Shiro security model  https://shiro.apache.org/security-model.html#username_enumeration
   discusses this as well.  Typically, brute force attack can be mitigated at the infrastructure
  level.'
