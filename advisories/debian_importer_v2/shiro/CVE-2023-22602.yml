summary: 'When using Apache Shiro before 1.11.0 together with Spring Boot 2.6+, a specially
  crafted HTTP request may cause an authentication bypass.  The authentication bypass occurs
  when Shiro and Spring Boot are using different pattern-matching techniques. Both Shiro and
  Spring Boot < 2.6 default to Ant style pattern matching. Mitigation: Update to Apache Shiro
  1.11.0, or set the following Spring Boot configuration value:  `spring.mvc.pathmatch.matching-strategy
  = ant_path_matcher`'
