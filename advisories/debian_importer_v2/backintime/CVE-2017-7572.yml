aliases:
  - CVE-2017-7572
summary: The _checkPolkitPrivilege function in serviceHelper.py in Back In Time (aka backintime)
  1.1.18 and earlier uses a deprecated polkit authorization method (unix-process) that is subject
  to a race condition (time of check, time of use). With this authorization method, the owner
  of a process requesting a polkit operation is checked by polkitd via /proc/<pid>/status, by
  which time the requesting process may have been replaced by a different process with the same
  PID that has different privileges then the original requester.
