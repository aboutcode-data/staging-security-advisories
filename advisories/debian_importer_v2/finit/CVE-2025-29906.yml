summary: Finit is a fast init for Linux systems. Versions starting from 3.0-rc1 and prior to
  version 4.11 bundle an implementation of getty for the `tty` configuration directive that
  can bypass `/bin/login`, i.e., a user can log in as any user without authentication. This
  issue has been patched in version 4.11.
