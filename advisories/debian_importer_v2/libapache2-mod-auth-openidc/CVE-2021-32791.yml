  - CVE-2021-32791
summary: mod_auth_openidc is an authentication/authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP
  server that functions as an OpenID Connect Relying Party, authenticating users against an
  OpenID Connect Provider. In mod_auth_openidc before version 2.4.9, the AES GCM encryption
  in mod_auth_openidc uses a static IV and AAD. It is important to fix because this creates
  a static nonce and since aes-gcm is a stream cipher, this can lead to known cryptographic
  issues, since the same key is being reused. From 2.4.9 onwards this has been patched to use
  dynamic values through usage of cjose AES encryption routines.
