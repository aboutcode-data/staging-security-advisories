  - CVE-2024-24814
summary: mod_auth_openidc is an OpenID Certified™ authentication and authorization module for
  the Apache 2.x HTTP server that implements the OpenID Connect Relying Party functionality.
  In affected versions missing input validation on mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie value
  makes the server vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. An internal security audit
  has been conducted and the reviewers found that if they manipulated the value of the mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks
  cookie to a very large integer, like 99999999, the server struggles with the request for a
  long time and finally gets back with a 500 error. Making a few requests of this kind caused
  our server to become unresponsive. Attackers can craft requests that would make the server
  work very hard (and possibly become unresponsive) and/or crash with minimal effort. This issue
  has been addressed in version 2.4.15.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
  for this vulnerability.
