aliases:
  - CVE-2020-36846
summary: A buffer overflow, as described in CVE-2020-8927, exists in the embedded Brotli library. 
  Versions of IO::Compress::Brotli prior to 0.007 included a version of the brotli library prior
  to version 1.0.8, where an attacker controlling the input length of a "one-shot" decompression
  request to a script can trigger a crash, which happens when copying over chunks of data larger
  than 2 GiB. It is recommended to update your IO::Compress::Brotli module to 0.007 or later.
  If one cannot update, we recommend to use the "streaming" API as opposed to the "one-shot"
  API, and impose chunk size limits.
