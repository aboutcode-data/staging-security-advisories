aliases:
  - CVE-2020-15530
summary: An issue was discovered in Valve Steam Client 2.10.91.91. The installer allows local
  users to gain NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges because some parts of %PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\Steam
  and/or %COMMONPROGRAMFILES(X86)%\Steam have weak permissions during a critical time window.
  An attacker can make this time window arbitrarily long by using opportunistic locks.
