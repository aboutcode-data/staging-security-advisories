aliases:
  - CVE-2021-20305
summary: A flaw was found in Nettle in versions before 3.7.2, where several Nettle signature
  verification functions (GOST DSA, EDDSA & ECDSA) result in the Elliptic Curve Cryptography
  point (ECC) multiply function being called with out-of-range scalers, possibly resulting in
  incorrect results. This flaw allows an attacker to force an invalid signature, causing an
  assertion failure or possible validation. The highest threat to this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
  integrity, as well as system availability.
