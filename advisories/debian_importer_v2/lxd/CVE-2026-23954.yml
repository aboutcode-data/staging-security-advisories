summary: Incus is a system container and virtual machine manager. Versions 6.21.0 and below
  allow a user with the ability to launch a container with a custom image (e.g a member of the
  ‘incus’ group) to use directory traversal or symbolic links in the templating functionality
  to achieve host arbitrary file read, and host arbitrary file write. This ultimately results
  in arbitrary command execution on the host. When using an image with a metadata.yaml containing
  templates, both the source and target paths are not checked for symbolic links or directory
  traversal. This can also be exploited in IncusOS. A fix is planned for versions 6.0.6 and
  6.21.0, but they have not been released at the time of publication.
