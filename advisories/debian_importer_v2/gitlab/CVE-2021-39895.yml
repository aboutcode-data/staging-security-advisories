  - CVE-2021-39895
summary: In all versions of GitLab CE/EE since version 8.0, an attacker can set the pipeline
  schedules to be active in a project export so when an unsuspecting owner imports that project,
  pipelines are active by default on that project. Under specialized conditions, this may lead
  to information disclosure if the project is imported from an untrusted source.
