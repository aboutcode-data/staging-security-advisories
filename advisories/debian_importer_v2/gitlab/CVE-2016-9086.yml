summary: GitLab versions 8.9.x and above contain a critical security flaw in the "import/export
  project" feature of GitLab. Added in GitLab 8.9, this feature allows a user to export and
  then re-import their projects as tape archive files (tar). All GitLab versions prior to 8.13.0
  restricted this feature to administrators only. Starting with version 8.13.0 this feature
  was made available to all users. This feature did not properly check for symbolic links in
  user-provided archives and therefore it was possible for an authenticated user to retrieve
  the contents of any file accessible to the GitLab service account. This included sensitive
  files such as those that contain secret tokens used by the GitLab service to authenticate
  users. GitLab CE and EE versions 8.13.0 through 8.13.2, 8.12.0 through 8.12.7, 8.11.0 through
  8.11.10, 8.10.0 through 8.10.12, and 8.9.0 through 8.9.11 are affected.
