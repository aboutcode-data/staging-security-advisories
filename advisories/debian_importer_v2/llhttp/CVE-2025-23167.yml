  - CVE-2025-23167
summary: 'A flaw in Node.js 20''s HTTP parser allows improper termination of HTTP/1 headers
  using `\r\n\rX` instead of the required `\r\n\r\n`. This inconsistency enables request smuggling,
  allowing attackers to bypass proxy-based access controls and submit unauthorized requests.  The
  issue was resolved by upgrading `llhttp` to version 9, which enforces correct header termination.  Impact:
  * This vulnerability affects only Node.js 20.x users prior to the `llhttp` v9 upgrade.'
