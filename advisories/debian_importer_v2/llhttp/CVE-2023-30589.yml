  - CVE-2023-30589
summary: "The llhttp parser in the http module in Node v20.2.0 does not strictly use the CRLF\
  \ sequence to delimit HTTP requests. This can lead to HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS).\r \r The\
  \ CR character (without LF) is sufficient to delimit HTTP header fields in the llhttp parser.\
  \ According to RFC7230 section 3, only the CRLF sequence should delimit each header-field.\
  \ This impacts all Node.js active versions: v16, v18, and, v20"
