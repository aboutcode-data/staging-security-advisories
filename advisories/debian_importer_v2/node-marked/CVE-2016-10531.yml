  - CVE-2016-10531
summary: 'marked is an application that is meant to parse and compile markdown. Due to the way
  that marked 0.3.5 and earlier parses input, specifically HTML entities, it''s possible to
  bypass marked''s content injection protection (`sanitize: true`) to inject a `javascript:`
  URL. This flaw exists because `&#xNNanything;` gets parsed to what it could and leaves the
  rest behind, resulting in just `anything;` being left.'
