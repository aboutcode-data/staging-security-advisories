  - CVE-2018-25110
summary: Marked prior to version 0.3.17 is vulnerable to a Regular Expression Denial of Service
  (ReDoS) attack due to catastrophic backtracking in several regular expressions used for parsing
  HTML tags and markdown links. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing specially
  crafted markdown input, such as deeply nested or repetitively structured brackets or tag attributes,
  which cause the parser to hang and lead to a Denial of Service.
