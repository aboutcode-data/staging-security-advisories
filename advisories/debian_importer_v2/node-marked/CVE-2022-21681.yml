  - CVE-2022-21681
summary: Marked is a markdown parser and compiler. Prior to version 4.0.10, the regular expression
  `inline.reflinkSearch` may cause catastrophic backtracking against some strings and lead to
  a denial of service (DoS). Anyone who runs untrusted markdown through a vulnerable version
  of marked and does not use a worker with a time limit may be affected. This issue is patched
  in version 4.0.10. As a workaround, avoid running untrusted markdown through marked or run
  marked on a worker thread and set a reasonable time limit to prevent draining resources.
