summary: pypdf is a free and open-source pure-python PDF library. Prior to version 6.1.3, an
  attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop. This
  requires parsing the content stream of a page which has an inline image using the DCTDecode
  filter. This has been fixed in pypdf version 6.1.3.
