  - CVE-2023-36464
summary: 'pypdf is an open source, pure-python PDF library. In affected versions an attacker
  may craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop if `__parse_content_stream` is executed. That
  is, for example, the case if the user extracted text from such a PDF. This issue was introduced
  in pull request #969 and resolved in pull request #1828. Users are advised to upgrade. Users
  unable to upgrade may modify the line `while peek not in (b"\r", b"\n")` in `pypdf/generic/_data_structures.py`
  to `while peek not in (b"\r", b"\n", b"")`.'
