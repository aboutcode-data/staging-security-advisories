  - CVE-2025-55197
summary: pypdf is a free and open-source pure-python PDF library. Prior to version 6.0.0, an
  attacker can craft a PDF which leads to the RAM being exhausted. This requires just reading
  the file if a series of FlateDecode filters is used on a malicious cross-reference stream.
  Other content streams are affected on explicit access. This issue has been fixed in 6.0.0.
  If an update is not possible, a workaround involves including the fixed code from pypdf.filters.decompress
  into the existing filters file.
