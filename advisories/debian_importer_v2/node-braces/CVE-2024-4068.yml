aliases:
  - CVE-2024-4068
summary: The NPM package `braces`, versions prior to 3.0.3, fails to limit the number of characters
  it can handle, which could lead to Memory Exhaustion. In `lib/parse.js,` if a malicious user
  sends "imbalanced braces" as input, the parsing will enter a loop, which will cause the program
  to start allocating heap memory without freeing it at any moment of the loop. Eventually,
  the JavaScript heap limit is reached, and the program will crash.
