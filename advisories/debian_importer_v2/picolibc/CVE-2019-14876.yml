summary: In the __lshift function of the newlib libc library, all versions prior to 3.3.0 (see
  newlib/libc/stdlib/mprec.c), Balloc is used to allocate a big integer, however no check is
  performed to verify if the allocation succeeded or not. The access to b1 will trigger a null
  pointer dereference bug in case of a memory allocation failure.
