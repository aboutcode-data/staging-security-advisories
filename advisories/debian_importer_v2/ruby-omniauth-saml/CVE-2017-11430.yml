summary: OmniAuth OmnitAuth-SAML 1.9.0 and earlier may incorrectly utilize the results of XML
  DOM traversal and canonicalization APIs in such a way that an attacker may be able to manipulate
  the SAML data without invalidating the cryptographic signature, allowing the attack to potentially
  bypass authentication to SAML service providers.
