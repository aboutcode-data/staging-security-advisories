  - CVE-2023-46046
summary: 'An issue in MiniZinc before 2.8.0 allows a NULL pointer dereference via ti_expr in
  a crafted .mzn file. NOTE: this is disputed because there is no common libminizinc use case
  in which an unattended process is supposed to run forever to process a series of atttacker-controlled
  .mzn files.'
