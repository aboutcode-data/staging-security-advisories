  - CVE-2018-1063
summary: Context relabeling of filesystems is vulnerable to symbolic link attack, allowing a
  local, unprivileged malicious entity to change the SELinux context of an arbitrary file to
  a context with few restrictions. This only happens when the relabeling process is done, usually
  when taking SELinux state from disabled to enable (permissive or enforcing). The issue was
  found in policycoreutils 2.5-11.
