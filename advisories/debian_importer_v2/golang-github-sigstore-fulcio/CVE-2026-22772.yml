  - CVE-2026-22772
summary: Fulcio is a certificate authority for issuing code signing certificates for an OpenID
  Connect (OIDC) identity. Prior to 1.8.5, Fulcio's metaRegex() function uses unanchored regex,
  allowing attackers to bypass MetaIssuer URL validation and trigger SSRF to arbitrary internal
  services. Since the SSRF only can trigger GET requests, the request cannot mutate state. The
  response from the GET request is not returned to the caller so data exfiltration is not possible.
  A malicious actor could attempt to probe an internal network through Blind SSRF. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 1.8.5.
