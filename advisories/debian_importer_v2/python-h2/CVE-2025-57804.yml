  - CVE-2025-57804
summary: h2 is a pure-Python implementation of a HTTP/2 protocol stack. Prior to version 4.3.0,
  an HTTP/2 request splitting vulnerability allows attackers to perform request smuggling attacks
  by injecting CRLF characters into headers. This occurs when servers downgrade HTTP/2 requests
  to HTTP/1.1 without properly validating header names/values, enabling attackers to manipulate
  request boundaries and bypass security controls. This issue has been patched in version 4.3.0.
