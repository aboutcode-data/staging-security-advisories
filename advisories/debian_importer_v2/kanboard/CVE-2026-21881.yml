  - CVE-2026-21881
summary: Kanboard is project management software focused on Kanban methodology. Versions 1.2.48
  and below is vulnerable to a critical authentication bypass when REVERSE_PROXY_AUTH is enabled.
  The application blindly trusts HTTP headers for user authentication without verifying the
  request originated from a trusted reverse proxy. An attacker can impersonate any user, including
  administrators, by simply sending a spoofed HTTP header. This issue is fixed in version 1.2.49.
