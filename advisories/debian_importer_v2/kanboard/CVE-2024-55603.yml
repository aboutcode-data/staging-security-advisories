  - CVE-2024-55603
summary: 'Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology. In
  affected versions sessions are still usable even though their lifetime has exceeded. Kanboard
  implements a cutom session handler (`app/Core/Session/SessionHandler.php`), to store the session
  data in a database. Therefore, when a `session_id` is given, kanboard queries the data from
  the `sessions` sql table. At this point, it does not correctly verify, if a given `session_id`
  has already exceeded its lifetime (`expires_at`). Thus, a session which''s lifetime is already
  `> time()`, is still queried from the database and hence a valid login. The implemented **SessionHandlerInterface::gc**
  function, that does remove invalid sessions, is called only **with a certain probability**
  (_Cleans up expired sessions. Called by `session_start()`, based on `session.gc_divisor`,
  `session.gc_probability` and `session.gc_maxlifetime` settings_) accordingly to the php documentation.
  In the official Kanboard docker image these values default to: session.gc_probability=1, session.gc_divisor=1000.
  Thus, an expired session is only terminated with probability 1/1000. This issue has been addressed
  in release 1.2.43 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for
  this vulnerability.'
