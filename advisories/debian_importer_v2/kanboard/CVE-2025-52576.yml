summary: Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology. Prior
  to version 1.2.46, Kanboard is vulnerable to username enumeration and IP spoofing-based brute-force
  protection bypass. By analyzing login behavior and abusing trusted HTTP headers, an attacker
  can determine valid usernames and circumvent rate-limiting or blocking mechanisms. Any organization
  running a publicly accessible Kanboard instance is affected, especially if relying on IP-based
  protections like Fail2Ban or CAPTCHA for login rate-limiting. Attackers with access to the
  login page can exploit this flaw to enumerate valid usernames and bypass IP-based blocking
  mechanisms, putting all user accounts at higher risk of brute-force or credential stuffing
  attacks. Version 1.2.46 contains a patch for the issue.
