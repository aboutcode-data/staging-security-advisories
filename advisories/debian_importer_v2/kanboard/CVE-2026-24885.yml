summary: Kanboard is project management software focused on Kanban methodology. Prior to 1.2.50,
  a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the ProjectPermissionController
  within the Kanboard application. The application fails to strictly enforce the application/json
  Content-Type for the changeUserRole action. Although the request body is JSON, the server
  accepts text/plain, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious form using the text/plain attribute.
  Which allows unauthorized modification of project user roles if an authenticated admin visits
  a malicious site This vulnerability is fixed in 1.2.50.
