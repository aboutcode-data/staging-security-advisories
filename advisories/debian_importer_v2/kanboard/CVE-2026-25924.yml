  - CVE-2026-25924
summary: Kanboard is project management software focused on Kanban methodology. Prior to 1.2.50,
  a security control bypass vulnerability in Kanboard allows an authenticated administrator
  to achieve full Remote Code Execution (RCE). Although the application correctly hides the
  plugin installation interface when the PLUGIN_INSTALLER configuration is set to false, the
  underlying backend endpoint fails to verify this security setting. An attacker can exploit
  this oversight to force the server to download and install a malicious plugin, leading to
  arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.2.50.
