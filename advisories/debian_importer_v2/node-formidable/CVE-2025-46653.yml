  - CVE-2025-46653
summary: 'Formidable (aka node-formidable) 2.1.0 through 3.x before 3.5.3 relies on hexoid to
  prevent guessing of filenames for untrusted executable content; however, hexoid is documented
  as not "cryptographically secure." (Also, there is a scenario in which only the last two characters
  of a hexoid string need to be guessed, but this is not often relevant.) NOTE: this does not
  imply that, in a typical use case, attackers will be able to exploit any hexoid behavior to
  upload and execute their own content.'
