  - CVE-2016-7126
summary: The imagetruecolortopalette function in ext/gd/gd.c in PHP before 5.6.25 and 7.x before
  7.0.10 does not properly validate the number of colors, which allows remote attackers to cause
  a denial of service (select_colors allocation error and out-of-bounds write) or possibly have
  unspecified other impact via a large value in the third argument.
