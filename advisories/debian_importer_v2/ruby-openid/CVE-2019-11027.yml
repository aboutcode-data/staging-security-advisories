  - CVE-2019-11027
summary: Ruby OpenID (aka ruby-openid) through 2.8.0 has a remotely exploitable flaw. This library
  is used by Rails web applications to integrate with OpenID Providers. Severity can range from
  medium to critical, depending on how a web application developer chose to employ the ruby-openid
  library. Developers who based their OpenID integration heavily on the "example app" provided
  by the project are at highest risk.
