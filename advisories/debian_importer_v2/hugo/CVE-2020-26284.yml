  - CVE-2020-26284
summary: Hugo is a fast and Flexible Static Site Generator built in Go. Hugo depends on Go's
  `os/exec` for certain features, e.g. for rendering of Pandoc documents if these binaries are
  found in the system `%PATH%` on Windows. In Hugo before version 0.79.1, if a malicious file
  with the same name (`exe` or `bat`) is found in the current working directory at the time
  of running `hugo`, the malicious command will be invoked instead of the system one. Windows
  users who run `hugo` inside untrusted Hugo sites are affected. Users should upgrade to Hugo
  v0.79.1. Other than avoiding untrusted Hugo sites, there is no workaround.
