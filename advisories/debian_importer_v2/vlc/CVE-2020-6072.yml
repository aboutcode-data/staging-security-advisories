  - CVE-2020-6072
summary: An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the label-parsing functionality
  of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When parsing compressed labels in mDNS messages, the rr_decode
  function's return value is not checked, leading to a double free that could be exploited to
  execute arbitrary code. An attacker can send an mDNS message to trigger this vulnerability.
