  - CVE-2020-6080
summary: An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the resource allocation handling
  of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When encountering errors while parsing mDNS messages, some
  allocated data is not freed, possibly leading to a denial-of-service condition via resource
  exhaustion. An attacker can send one mDNS message repeatedly to trigger this vulnerability
  through the function rr_read_RR [5] reads the current resource record, except for the RDATA
  section. This is read by the loop at in rr_read. For each RR type, a different function is
  called. When the RR type is 0x10, the function rr_read_TXT is called at [6].
