aliases:
  - CVE-2020-6078
summary: An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the message-parsing functionality
  of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When parsing mDNS messages in mdns_recv, the return value
  of the mdns_read_header function is not checked, leading to an uninitialized variable usage
  that eventually results in a null pointer dereference, leading to service crash. An attacker
  can send a series of mDNS messages to trigger this vulnerability.
