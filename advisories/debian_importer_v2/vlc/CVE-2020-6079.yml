  - CVE-2020-6079
summary: An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the resource allocation handling
  of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When encountering errors while parsing mDNS messages, some
  allocated data is not freed, possibly leading to a denial-of-service condition via resource
  exhaustion. An attacker can send one mDNS message repeatedly to trigger this vulnerability
  through decoding of the domain name performed by rr_decode.
