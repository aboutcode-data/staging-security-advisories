summary: The Jupyter Server provides the backend for Jupyter web applications. Jupyter Server
  on Windows has a vulnerability that lets unauthenticated attackers leak the NTLMv2 password
  hash of the Windows user running the Jupyter server. An attacker can crack this password to
  gain access to the Windows machine hosting the Jupyter server, or access other network-accessible
  machines or 3rd party services using that credential. Or an attacker perform an NTLM relay
  attack without cracking the credential to gain access to other network-accessible machines.
  This vulnerability is fixed in 2.14.1.
