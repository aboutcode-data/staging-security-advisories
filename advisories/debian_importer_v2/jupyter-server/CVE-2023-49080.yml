  - CVE-2023-49080
summary: The Jupyter Server provides the backend (i.e. the core services, APIs, and REST endpoints)
  for Jupyter web applications like Jupyter notebook, JupyterLab, and Voila. Unhandled errors
  in API requests coming from an authenticated user include traceback information, which can
  include path information. There is no known mechanism by which to trigger these errors without
  authentication, so the paths revealed are not considered particularly sensitive, given that
  the requesting user has arbitrary execution permissions already in the same environment. A
  fix has been introduced in commit `0056c3aa52` which no longer includes traceback information
  in JSON error responses. For compatibility, the traceback field is present, but always empty.
  This commit has been included in version 2.11.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no
  known workarounds for this vulnerability.
