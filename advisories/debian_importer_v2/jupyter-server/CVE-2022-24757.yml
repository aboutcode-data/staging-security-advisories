summary: The Jupyter Server provides the backend (i.e. the core services, APIs, and REST endpoints)
  for Jupyter web applications. Prior to version 1.15.4, unauthorized actors can access sensitive
  information from server logs. Anytime a 5xx error is triggered, the auth cookie and other
  header values are recorded in Jupyter Server logs by default. Considering these logs do not
  require root access, an attacker can monitor these logs, steal sensitive auth/cookie information,
  and gain access to the Jupyter server. Jupyter Server version 1.15.4 contains a patch for
  this issue. There are currently no known workarounds.
