  - CVE-2020-26232
summary: Jupyter Server before version 1.0.6 has an Open redirect vulnerability. A maliciously
  crafted link to a jupyter server could redirect the browser to a different website. All jupyter
  servers are technically affected, however, these maliciously crafted links can only be reasonably
  made for known jupyter server hosts. A link to your jupyter server may appear safe, but ultimately
  redirect to a spoofed server on the public internet.
