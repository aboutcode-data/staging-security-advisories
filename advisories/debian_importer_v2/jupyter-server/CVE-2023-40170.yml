  - CVE-2023-40170
summary: jupyter-server is the backend for Jupyter web applications. Improper cross-site credential
  checks on `/files/` URLs could allow exposure of certain file contents, or accessing files
  when opening untrusted files via  "Open image in new tab". This issue has been addressed in
  commit `87a49272728` which has been included in release `2.7.2`. Users are advised to upgrade.
  Users unable to upgrade may use the lower performance `--ContentsManager.files_handler_class=jupyter_server.files.handlers.FilesHandler`,
  which implements the correct checks.
