  - CVE-2024-45237
summary: An issue was discovered in Fort before 1.6.3. A malicious RPKI repository that descends
  from a (trusted) Trust Anchor can serve (via rsync or RRDP) a resource certificate containing
  a Key Usage extension composed of more than two bytes of data. Fort writes this string into
  a 2-byte buffer without properly sanitizing its length, leading to a buffer overflow.
