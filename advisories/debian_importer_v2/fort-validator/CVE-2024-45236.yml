aliases:
  - CVE-2024-45236
summary: An issue was discovered in Fort before 1.6.3. A malicious RPKI repository that descends
  from a (trusted) Trust Anchor can serve (via rsync or RRDP) a signed object containing an
  empty signedAttributes field. Fort accesses the set's elements without sanitizing it first.
  Because Fort is an RPKI Relying Party, a crash can lead to Route Origin Validation unavailability,
  which can lead to compromised routing.
