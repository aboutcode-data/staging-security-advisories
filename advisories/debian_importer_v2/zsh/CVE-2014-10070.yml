  - CVE-2014-10070
summary: zsh before 5.0.7 allows evaluation of the initial values of integer variables imported
  from the environment (instead of treating them as literal numbers). That could allow local
  privilege escalation, under some specific and atypical conditions where zsh is being invoked
  in privilege-elevation contexts when the environment has not been properly sanitized, such
  as when zsh is invoked by sudo on systems where "env_reset" has been disabled.
