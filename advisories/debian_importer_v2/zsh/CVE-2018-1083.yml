  - CVE-2018-1083
summary: Zsh before version 5.4.2-test-1 is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the shell autocomplete
  functionality. A local unprivileged user can create a specially crafted directory path which
  leads to code execution in the context of the user who tries to use autocomplete to traverse
  the before mentioned path. If the user affected is privileged, this leads to privilege escalation.
