  - CVE-2023-6516
summary: 'To keep its cache database efficient, `named` running as a recursive resolver occasionally
  attempts to clean up the database. It uses several methods, including some that are asynchronous:
  a small chunk of memory pointing to the cache element that can be cleaned up is first allocated
  and then queued for later processing. It was discovered that if the resolver is continuously
  processing query patterns triggering this type of cache-database maintenance, `named` may
  not be able to handle the cleanup events in a timely manner. This in turn enables the list
  of queued cleanup events to grow infinitely large over time, allowing the configured `max-cache-size`
  limit to be significantly exceeded. This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.16.0 through 9.16.45
  and 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.45-S1.'
