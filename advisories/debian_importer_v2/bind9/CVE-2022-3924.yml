  - CVE-2022-3924
summary: This issue can affect BIND 9 resolvers with `stale-answer-enable yes;` that also make
  use of the option `stale-answer-client-timeout`, configured with a value greater than zero.  If
  the resolver receives many queries that require recursion, there will be a corresponding increase
  in the number of clients that are waiting for recursion to complete. If there are sufficient
  clients already waiting when a new client query is received so that it is necessary to SERVFAIL
  the longest waiting client (see BIND 9 ARM `recursive-clients` limit and soft quota), then
  it is possible for a race to occur between providing a stale answer to this older client and
  sending an early timeout SERVFAIL, which may cause an assertion failure. This issue affects
  BIND 9 versions 9.16.12 through 9.16.36, 9.18.0 through 9.18.10, 9.19.0 through 9.19.8, and
  9.16.12-S1 through 9.16.36-S1.
