  - CVE-2018-5737
summary: A problem with the implementation of the new serve-stale feature in BIND 9.12 can lead
  to an assertion failure in rbtdb.c, even when stale-answer-enable is off. Additionally, problematic
  interaction between the serve-stale feature and NSEC aggressive negative caching can in some
  cases cause undesirable behavior from named, such as a recursion loop or excessive logging.
  Deliberate exploitation of this condition could cause operational problems depending on the
  particular manifestation -- either degradation or denial of service. Affects BIND 9.12.0 and
  9.12.1.
