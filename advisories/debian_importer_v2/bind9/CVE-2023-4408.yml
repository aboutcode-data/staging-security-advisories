  - CVE-2023-4408
summary: The DNS message parsing code in `named` includes a section whose computational complexity
  is overly high. It does not cause problems for typical DNS traffic, but crafted queries and
  responses may cause excessive CPU load on the affected `named` instance by exploiting this
  flaw. This issue affects both authoritative servers and recursive resolvers. This issue affects
  BIND 9 versions 9.0.0 through 9.16.45, 9.18.0 through 9.18.21, 9.19.0 through 9.19.19, 9.9.3-S1
  through 9.11.37-S1, 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.45-S1, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.21-S1.
