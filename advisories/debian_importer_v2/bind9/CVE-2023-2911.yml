  - CVE-2023-2911
summary: If the `recursive-clients` quota is reached on a BIND 9 resolver configured with both
  `stale-answer-enable yes;` and `stale-answer-client-timeout 0;`, a sequence of serve-stale-related
  lookups could cause `named` to loop and terminate unexpectedly due to a stack overflow. This
  issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.16.33 through 9.16.41, 9.18.7 through 9.18.15, 9.16.33-S1
  through 9.16.41-S1, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.15-S1.
