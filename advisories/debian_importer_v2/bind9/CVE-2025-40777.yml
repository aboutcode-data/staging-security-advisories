  - CVE-2025-40777
summary: If a `named` caching resolver is configured with `serve-stale-enable` `yes`, and with
  `stale-answer-client-timeout` set to `0` (the only allowable value other than `disabled`),
  and if the resolver, in the process of resolving a query, encounters a CNAME chain involving
  a specific combination of cached or authoritative records, the daemon will abort with an assertion
  failure. This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.20.0 through 9.20.10, 9.21.0 through 9.21.9,
  and 9.20.9-S1 through 9.20.10-S1.
