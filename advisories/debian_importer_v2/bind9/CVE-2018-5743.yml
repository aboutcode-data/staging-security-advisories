  - CVE-2018-5743
summary: 'By design, BIND is intended to limit the number of TCP clients that can be connected
  at any given time. The number of allowed connections is a tunable parameter which, if unset,
  defaults to a conservative value for most servers. Unfortunately, the code which was intended
  to limit the number of simultaneous connections contained an error which could be exploited
  to grow the number of simultaneous connections beyond this limit. Versions affected: BIND
  9.9.0 -> 9.10.8-P1, 9.11.0 -> 9.11.6, 9.12.0 -> 9.12.4, 9.14.0. BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition
  versions 9.9.3-S1 -> 9.11.5-S3, and 9.11.5-S5. Versions 9.13.0 -> 9.13.7 of the 9.13 development
  branch are also affected. Versions prior to BIND 9.9.0 have not been evaluated for vulnerability
  to CVE-2018-5743.'
