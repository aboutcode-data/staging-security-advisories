summary: 'A programming error in the nxdomain-redirect feature can cause an assertion failure
  in query.c if the alternate namespace used by nxdomain-redirect is a descendant of a zone
  that is served locally. The most likely scenario where this might occur is if the server,
  in addition to performing NXDOMAIN redirection for recursive clients, is also serving a local
  copy of the root zone or using mirroring to provide the root zone, although other configurations
  are also possible. Versions affected: BIND 9.12.0-> 9.12.4, 9.14.0. Also affects all releases
  in the 9.13 development branch.'
