  - CVE-2023-2828
summary: Every `named` instance configured to run as a recursive resolver maintains a cache
  database holding the responses to the queries it has recently sent to authoritative servers.
  The size limit for that cache database can be configured using the `max-cache-size` statement
  in the configuration file; it defaults to 90% of the total amount of memory available on the
  host. When the size of the cache reaches 7/8 of the configured limit, a cache-cleaning algorithm
  starts to remove expired and/or least-recently used RRsets from the cache, to keep memory
  use below the configured limit.  It has been discovered that the effectiveness of the cache-cleaning
  algorithm used in `named` can be severely diminished by querying the resolver for specific
  RRsets in a certain order, effectively allowing the configured `max-cache-size` limit to be
  significantly exceeded. This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.11.0 through 9.16.41, 9.18.0
  through 9.18.15, 9.19.0 through 9.19.13, 9.11.3-S1 through 9.16.41-S1, and 9.18.11-S1 through
  9.18.15-S1.
