  - CVE-2019-6477
summary: With pipelining enabled each incoming query on a TCP connection requires a similar
  resource allocation to a query received via UDP or via TCP without pipelining enabled. A client
  using a TCP-pipelined connection to a server could consume more resources than the server
  has been provisioned to handle. When a TCP connection with a large number of pipelined queries
  is closed, the load on the server releasing these multiple resources can cause it to become
  unresponsive, even for queries that can be answered authoritatively or from cache. (This is
  most likely to be perceived as an intermittent server problem).
