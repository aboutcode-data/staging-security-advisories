summary: 'In ISC BIND9 versions BIND 9.11.14 -> 9.11.19, BIND 9.14.9 -> 9.14.12, BIND 9.16.0
  -> 9.16.3, BIND Supported Preview Edition 9.11.14-S1 -> 9.11.19-S1: Unless a nameserver is
  providing authoritative service for one or more zones and at least one zone contains an empty
  non-terminal entry containing an asterisk ("*") character, this defect cannot be encountered.
  A would-be attacker who is allowed to change zone content could theoretically introduce such
  a record in order to exploit this condition to cause denial of service, though we consider
  the use of this vector unlikely because any such attack would require a significant privilege
  level and be easily traceable.'
