summary: 'To provide fine-grained controls over the ability to use Dynamic DNS (DDNS) to update
  records in a zone, BIND 9 provides a feature called update-policy. Various rules can be configured
  to limit the types of updates that can be performed by a client, depending on the key used
  when sending the update request. Unfortunately, some rule types were not initially documented,
  and when documentation for them was added to the Administrator Reference Manual (ARM) in change
  #3112, the language that was added to the ARM at that time incorrectly described the behavior
  of two rule types, krb5-subdomain and ms-subdomain. This incorrect documentation could mislead
  operators into believing that policies they had configured were more restrictive than they
  actually were. This affects BIND versions prior to BIND 9.11.5 and BIND 9.12.3.'
