  - CVE-2020-8625
summary: 'BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version and are configured
  to use GSS-TSIG features. In a configuration which uses BIND''s default settings the vulnerable
  code path is not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting valid
  values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credentialconfiguration options. Although
  the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where
  BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers
  with Active Directory domain controllers. The most likely outcome of a successful exploitation
  of the vulnerability is a crash of the named process. However, remote code execution, while
  unproven, is theoretically possible. Affects: BIND 9.5.0 -> 9.11.27, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.11, and
  versions BIND 9.11.3-S1 -> 9.11.27-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.11-S1 of BIND Supported Preview
  Edition. Also release versions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.1 of the BIND 9.17 development branch'
