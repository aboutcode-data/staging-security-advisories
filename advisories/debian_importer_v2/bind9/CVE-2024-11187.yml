  - CVE-2024-11187
summary: It is possible to construct a zone such that some queries to it will generate responses
  containing numerous records in the Additional section. An attacker sending many such queries
  can cause either the authoritative server itself or an independent resolver to use disproportionate
  resources processing the queries. Zones will usually need to have been deliberately crafted
  to attack this exposure. This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.11.0 through 9.11.37, 9.16.0
  through 9.16.50, 9.18.0 through 9.18.32, 9.20.0 through 9.20.4, 9.21.0 through 9.21.3, 9.11.3-S1
  through 9.11.37-S1, 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.50-S1, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.32-S1.
