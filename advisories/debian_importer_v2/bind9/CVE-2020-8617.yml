  - CVE-2020-8617
summary: Using a specially-crafted message, an attacker may potentially cause a BIND server
  to reach an inconsistent state if the attacker knows (or successfully guesses) the name of
  a TSIG key used by the server. Since BIND, by default, configures a local session key even
  on servers whose configuration does not otherwise make use of it, almost all current BIND
  servers are vulnerable. In releases of BIND dating from March 2018 and after, an assertion
  check in tsig.c detects this inconsistent state and deliberately exits. Prior to the introduction
  of the check the server would continue operating in an inconsistent state, with potentially
  harmful results.
