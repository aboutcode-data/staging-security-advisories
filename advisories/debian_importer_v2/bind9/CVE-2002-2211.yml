aliases:
  - CVE-2002-2211
summary: BIND 4 and BIND 8, when resolving recursive DNS queries for arbitrary hosts, allows
  remote attackers to conduct DNS cache poisoning via a birthday attack that uses a large number
  of open queries for the same resource record (RR) combined with spoofed responses, which increases
  the possibility of successfully spoofing a response in a way that is more efficient than brute
  force methods.
