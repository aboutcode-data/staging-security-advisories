summary: 'An error in handling certain queries can cause an assertion failure when a server
  is using the nxdomain-redirect feature to cover a zone for which it is also providing authoritative
  service. A vulnerable server could be intentionally stopped by an attacker if it was using
  a configuration that met the criteria for the vulnerability and if the attacker could cause
  it to accept a query that possessed the required attributes. Please note: This vulnerability
  affects the "nxdomain-redirect" feature, which is one of two methods of handling NXDOMAIN
  redirection, and is only available in certain versions of BIND. Redirection using zones of
  type "redirect" is not affected by this vulnerability. Affects BIND 9.9.8-S1 -> 9.9.8-S3,
  9.9.9-S1 -> 9.9.9-S6, 9.11.0-9.11.0-P1.'
