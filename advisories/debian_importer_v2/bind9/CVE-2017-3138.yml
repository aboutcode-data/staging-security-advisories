summary: named contains a feature which allows operators to issue commands to a running server
  by communicating with the server process over a control channel, using a utility program such
  as rndc. A regression introduced in a recent feature change has created a situation under
  which some versions of named can be caused to exit with a REQUIRE assertion failure if they
  are sent a null command string. Affects BIND 9.9.9->9.9.9-P7, 9.9.10b1->9.9.10rc2, 9.10.4->9.10.4-P7,
  9.10.5b1->9.10.5rc2, 9.11.0->9.11.0-P4, 9.11.1b1->9.11.1rc2, 9.9.9-S1->9.9.9-S9.
