aliases:
  - CVE-2004-0994
summary: 'Multiple integer overflows in xzgv 0.8 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute
  arbitrary code via images with large width and height values, which trigger a heap-based buffer
  overflow, as demonstrated in the read_prf_file function in readprf.c.  NOTE: CVE-2004-0994
  and CVE-2004-1095 identify sets of bugs that only partially overlap, despite having the same
  developer.  Therefore, they should be regarded as distinct.'
