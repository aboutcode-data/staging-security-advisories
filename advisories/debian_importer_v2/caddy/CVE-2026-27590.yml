  - CVE-2026-27590
summary: Caddy is an extensible server platform that uses TLS by default. Prior to version 2.11.1,
  Caddy's FastCGI path splitting logic computes the split index on a lowercased copy of the
  request path and then uses that byte index to slice the original path. This is unsafe for
  Unicode because `strings.ToLower()` can change UTF-8 byte length for some characters. As a
  result, Caddy can derive an incorrect `SCRIPT_NAME`/`SCRIPT_FILENAME` and `PATH_INFO`, potentially
  causing a request that contains `.php` to execute a different on-disk file than intended (path
  confusion). In setups where an attacker can control file contents (e.g., upload features),
  this can lead to unintended PHP execution of non-.php files (potential RCE depending on deployment).
  Version 2.11.1 fixes the issue.
