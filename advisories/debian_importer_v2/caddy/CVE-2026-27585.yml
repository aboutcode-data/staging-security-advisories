  - CVE-2026-27585
summary: Caddy is an extensible server platform that uses TLS by default. Prior to version 2.11.1,
  the path sanitization routine in file matcher doesn't sanitize backslashes which can lead
  to bypassing path related security protections. It affects users with specific Caddy and environment
  configurations. Version 2.11.1 fixes the issue.
