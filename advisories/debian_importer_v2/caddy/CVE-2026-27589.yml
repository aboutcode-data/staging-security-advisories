  - CVE-2026-27589
summary: Caddy is an extensible server platform that uses TLS by default. Prior to version 2.11.1,
  the local caddy admin API (default listen `127.0.0.1:2019`) exposes a state-changing `POST
  /load` endpoint that replaces the entire running configuration. When origin enforcement is
  not enabled (`enforce_origin` not configured), the admin endpoint accepts cross-origin requests
  (e.g., from attacker-controlled web content in a victim browser) and applies an attacker-supplied
  JSON config. This can change the admin listener settings and alter HTTP server behavior without
  user intent. Version 2.11.1 contains a fix for the issue.
