  - CVE-2022-39028
summary: 'telnetd in GNU Inetutils through 2.3, MIT krb5-appl through 1.0.3, and derivative
  works has a NULL pointer dereference via 0xff 0xf7 or 0xff 0xf8. In a typical installation,
  the telnetd application would crash but the telnet service would remain available through
  inetd. However, if the telnetd application has many crashes within a short time interval,
  the telnet service would become unavailable after inetd logs a "telnet/tcp server failing
  (looping), service terminated" error. NOTE: MIT krb5-appl is not supported upstream but is
  shipped by a few Linux distributions. The affected code was removed from the supported MIT
  Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) product many years ago, at version 1.8.'
