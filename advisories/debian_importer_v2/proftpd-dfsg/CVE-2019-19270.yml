  - CVE-2019-19270
summary: An issue was discovered in tls_verify_crl in ProFTPD through 1.3.6b. Failure to check
  for the appropriate field of a CRL entry (checking twice for subject, rather than once for
  subject and once for issuer) prevents some valid CRLs from being taken into account, and can
  allow clients whose certificates have been revoked to proceed with a connection to the server.
