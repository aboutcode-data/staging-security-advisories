summary: An issue was discovered in tls_verify_crl in ProFTPD before 1.3.6. A wrong iteration
  variable, used when checking a client certificate against CRL entries (installed by a system
  administrator), can cause some CRL entries to be ignored, and can allow clients whose certificates
  have been revoked to proceed with a connection to the server.
