  - CVE-2021-4456
summary: Net::CIDR versions before 0.24 for Perl mishandle leading zeros in IP CIDR addresses,
  which may have unspecified impact.  The functions `addr2cidr` and `cidrlookup` may return
  leading zeros in a CIDR string, which may in turn be parsed as octal numbers by subsequent
  users. In some cases an attacker may be able to leverage this to bypass access controls based
  on IP addresses.  The documentation advises validating untrusted CIDR strings with the `cidrvalidate`
  function. However, this mitigation is optional and not enforced by default. In practice, users
  may call `addr2cidr` or `cidrlookup` with untrusted input and without validation, incorrectly
  assuming that this is safe.
