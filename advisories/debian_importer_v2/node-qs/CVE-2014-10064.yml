  - CVE-2014-10064
summary: The qs module before 1.0.0 does not have an option or default for specifying object
  depth and when parsing a string representing a deeply nested object will block the event loop
  for long periods of time. An attacker could leverage this to cause a temporary denial-of-service
  condition, for example, in a web application, other requests would not be processed while
  this blocking is occurring.
