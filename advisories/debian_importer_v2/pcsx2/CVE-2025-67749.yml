  - CVE-2025-67749
summary: PCSX2 is a free and open-source PlayStation 2 (PS2) emulator. In versions 2.5.377 and
  below, an unchecked offset and size used in a memcpy operation inside PCSX2's CDVD SCMD 0x91
  and SCMD 0x8F handlers allow a specially crafted disc image or ELF to cause an out-of-bounds
  read from emulator memory. Because the offset and size is controlled through MG header fields,
  a specially crafted ELF can read data beyond the bounds of mg_buffer and have it reflected
  back into emulated memory. This issue is fixed in version 2.5.378.
