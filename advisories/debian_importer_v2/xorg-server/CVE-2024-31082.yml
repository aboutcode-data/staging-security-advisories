  - CVE-2024-31082
summary: A heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability was found in the X.org server's ProcAppleDRICreatePixmap()
  function. This issue occurs when byte-swapped length values are used in replies, potentially
  leading to memory leakage and segmentation faults, particularly when triggered by a client
  with a different endianness. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to cause
  the X server to read heap memory values and then transmit them back to the client until encountering
  an unmapped page, resulting in a crash. Despite the attacker's inability to control the specific
  memory copied into the replies, the small length values typically stored in a 32-bit integer
  can result in significant attempted out-of-bounds reads.
