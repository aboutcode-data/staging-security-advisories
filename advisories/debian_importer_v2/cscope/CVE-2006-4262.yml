  - CVE-2006-4262
summary: Multiple buffer overflows in cscope 15.5 and earlier allow user-assisted attackers
  to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via multiple vectors
  including (1) a long pathname that is not properly handled during file list parsing, (2) long
  pathnames that result from path variable expansion such as tilde expansion for the HOME environment
  variable, and (3) a long -f (aka reffile) command line argument.
