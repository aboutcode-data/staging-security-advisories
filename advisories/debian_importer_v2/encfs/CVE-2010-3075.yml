aliases:
  - CVE-2010-3075
summary: EncFS before 1.7.0 encrypts multiple blocks by means of the CFB cipher mode with the
  same initialization vector, which makes it easier for local users to obtain sensitive information
  via calculations involving recovery of XORed data, as demonstrated by an attack on encrypted
  data in which the last block contains only one byte.
