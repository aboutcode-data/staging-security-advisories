  - CVE-2025-61594
summary: URI is a module providing classes to handle Uniform Resource Identifiers. In versions
  prior to 0.12.5, 0.13.3, and 1.0.4, a bypass exists for the fix to CVE-2025-27221 that can
  expose user credentials. When using the `+` operator to combine URIs, sensitive information
  like passwords from the original URI can be leaked, violating RFC3986 and making applications
  vulnerable to credential exposure. Versions 0.12.5, 0.13.3, and 1.0.4 fix the issue.
