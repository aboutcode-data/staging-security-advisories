summary: In the CGI gem before 0.4.2 for Ruby, the CGI::Cookie.parse method in the CGI library
  contains a potential Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability. The method does not impose any
  limit on the length of the raw cookie value it processes. This oversight can lead to excessive
  resource consumption when parsing extremely large cookies.
