summary: QGIS is a free, open source, cross platform geographical information system (GIS) The
  repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow called "pre-commit checks" that, before commit
  76a693cd91650f9b4e83edac525e5e4f90d954e9, was vulnerable to remote code execution and repository
  compromise because it used the `pull_request_target` trigger and then checked out and executed
  untrusted pull request code in a privileged context. Workflows triggered by `pull_request_target`
  ran with the base repository's credentials and access to secrets. If these workflows then
  checked out and executed code from the head of an external pull request (which could have
  been attacker controlled), the attacker could have executed arbitrary commands with elevated
  privileges. This insecure pattern has been documented as a security risk by GitHub and security
  researchers. Commit 76a693cd91650f9b4e83edac525e5e4f90d954e9 removed the vulnerable code.
