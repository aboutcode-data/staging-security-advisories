summary: The Python standard library functions `urllib.parse.urlsplit` and `urlparse` accepted
  domain names that included square brackets which isn't valid according to RFC 3986. Square
  brackets are only meant to be used as delimiters for specifying IPv6 and IPvFuture hosts in
  URLs. This could result in differential parsing across the Python URL parser and other specification-compliant
  URL parsers.
