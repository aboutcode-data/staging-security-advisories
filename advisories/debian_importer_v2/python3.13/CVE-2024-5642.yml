aliases:
  - CVE-2024-5642
summary: CPython 3.9 and earlier doesn't disallow configuring an empty list ("[]") for SSLContext.set_npn_protocols()
  which is an invalid value for the underlying OpenSSL API. This results in a buffer over-read
  when NPN is used (see CVE-2024-5535 for OpenSSL). This vulnerability is of low severity due
  to NPN being not widely used and specifying an empty list likely being uncommon in-practice
  (typically a protocol name would be configured).
