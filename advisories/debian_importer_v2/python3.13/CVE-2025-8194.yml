  - CVE-2025-8194
summary: There is a defect in the CPython “tarfile” module affecting the “TarFile” extraction
  and entry enumeration APIs. The tar implementation would process tar archives with negative
  offsets without error, resulting in an infinite loop and deadlock during the parsing of maliciously
  crafted tar archives.   This vulnerability can be mitigated by including the following patch
  after importing the “tarfile” module:  https://gist.github.com/sethmlarson/1716ac5b82b73dbcbf23ad2eff8b33e1
