  - CVE-2024-12718
summary: Allows modifying some file metadata (e.g. last modified) with filter="data" or file
  permissions (chmod) with filter="tar" of files outside the extraction directory. You are affected
  by this vulnerability if using the tarfile module to extract untrusted tar archives using
  TarFile.extractall() or TarFile.extract() using the filter= parameter with a value of "data" or
  "tar". See the tarfile  extraction filters documentation https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile-extraction-filter
   for more information. Only Python versions 3.12 or later are affected by these vulnerabilities,
  earlier versions don't include the extraction filter feature.  Note that for Python 3.14 or
  later the default value of filter= changed from "no filtering" to `"data", so if you are relying
  on this new default behavior then your usage is also affected.  Note that none of these vulnerabilities
  significantly affect the installation of source distributions which are tar archives as source
  distributions already allow arbitrary code execution during the build process. However when
  evaluating source distributions it's important to avoid installing source distributions with
  suspicious links.
