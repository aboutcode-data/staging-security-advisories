  - CVE-2024-4032
summary: The “ipaddress” module contained incorrect information about whether certain IPv4 and
  IPv6 addresses were designated as “globally reachable” or “private”. This affected the is_private
  and is_global properties of the ipaddress.IPv4Address, ipaddress.IPv4Network, ipaddress.IPv6Address,
  and ipaddress.IPv6Network classes, where values wouldn’t be returned in accordance with the
  latest information from the IANA Special-Purpose Address Registries.  CPython 3.12.4 and 3.13.0a6
  contain updated information from these registries and thus have the intended behavior.
