  - CVE-2024-8088
summary: There is a HIGH severity vulnerability affecting the CPython "zipfile" module affecting
  "zipfile.Path". Note that the more common API "zipfile.ZipFile" class is unaffected.      When
  iterating over names of entries in a zip archive (for example, methods of "zipfile.Path" like
  "namelist()", "iterdir()", etc) the process can be put into an infinite loop with a maliciously
  crafted zip archive. This defect applies when reading only metadata or extracting the contents
  of the zip archive. Programs that are not handling user-controlled zip archives are not affected.
