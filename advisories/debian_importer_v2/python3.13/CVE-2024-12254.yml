  - CVE-2024-12254
summary: Starting in Python 3.12.0, the asyncio._SelectorSocketTransport.writelines()  method
  would not "pause" writing and signal to the Protocol to drain  the buffer to the wire once
  the write buffer reached the "high-water  mark". Because of this, Protocols would not periodically
  drain the write  buffer potentially leading to memory exhaustion.      This  vulnerability
  likely impacts a small number of users, you must be using  Python 3.12.0 or later, on macOS
  or Linux, using the asyncio module  with protocols, and using .writelines() method which had
  new  zero-copy-on-write behavior in Python 3.12.0 and later. If not all of  these factors
  are true then your usage of Python is unaffected.
