  - CVE-2025-68161
summary: 'The Socket Appender in Apache Log4j Core versions 2.0-beta9 through 2.25.2 does not
  perform TLS hostname verification of the peer certificate, even when the  verifyHostName https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/appenders/network.html#SslConfiguration-attr-verifyHostName  configuration
  attribute or the  log4j2.sslVerifyHostName https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/systemproperties.html#log4j2.sslVerifyHostName  system
  property is set to true.  This issue may allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to intercept or
  redirect log traffic under the following conditions:    *  The attacker is able to intercept
  or redirect network traffic between the client and the log receiver.   *  The attacker can
  present a server certificate issued by a certification authority trusted by the Socket Appender’s
  configured trust store (or by the default Java trust store if no custom trust store is configured).   Users
  are advised to upgrade to Apache Log4j Core version 2.25.3, which addresses this issue.  As
  an alternative mitigation, the Socket Appender may be configured to use a private or restricted
  trust root to limit the set of trusted certificates.'
