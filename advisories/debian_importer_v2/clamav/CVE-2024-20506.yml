  - CVE-2024-20506
summary: "A vulnerability in the ClamD service module of Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) versions 1.4.0,\
  \ 1.3.2 and prior versions, all 1.2.x versions, 1.0.6 and prior versions, all 0.105.x versions,\
  \ all 0.104.x versions, and 0.103.11 and all prior versions could allow an authenticated,\
  \ local attacker to corrupt critical system files.\r \r The vulnerability is due to allowing\
  \ the ClamD process to write to its log file while privileged without checking if the logfile\
  \ has been replaced with a symbolic link. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability if\
  \ they replace the ClamD log file with a symlink to a critical system file and then find a\
  \ way to restart the ClamD process. An exploit could allow the attacker to corrupt a critical\
  \ system file by appending ClamD log messages after restart."
