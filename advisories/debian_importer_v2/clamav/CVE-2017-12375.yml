  - CVE-2017-12375
summary: The ClamAV AntiVirus software versions 0.99.2 and prior contain a vulnerability that
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition
  on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation checking mechanisms
  during certain mail parsing functions (the rfc2047 function in mbox.c). An unauthenticated,
  remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted email to the affected
  device. This action could cause a buffer overflow condition when ClamAV scans the malicious
  email, allowing the attacker to potentially cause a DoS condition on an affected device.
