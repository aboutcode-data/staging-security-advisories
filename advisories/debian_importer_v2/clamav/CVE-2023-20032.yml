summary: "On Feb 15, 2023, the following vulnerability in the ClamAV scanning library was disclosed:\r\
  \ \r \r A vulnerability in the HFS+ partition file parser of ClamAV versions 1.0.0 and earlier,\
  \ 0.105.1 and earlier, and 0.103.7 and earlier could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker\
  \ to execute arbitrary code.\r \r \r This vulnerability is due to a missing buffer size check\
  \ that may result in a heap buffer overflow write. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by submitting a crafted HFS+ partition file to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device.\
  \ A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges\
  \ of the ClamAV scanning process, or else crash the process, resulting in a denial of service\
  \ (DoS) condition.\r \r For a description of this vulnerability, see the ClamAV blog [\"https://blog.clamav.net/\"\
  ]."
