  - CVE-2017-12376
summary: ClamAV AntiVirus software versions 0.99.2 and prior contain a vulnerability that could
  allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition or
  potentially execute arbitrary code on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper
  input validation checking mechanisms when handling Portable Document Format (.pdf) files sent
  to an affected device. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a crafted .pdf file to an affected device. This action could cause a handle_pdfname
  (in pdf.c) buffer overflow when ClamAV scans the malicious file, allowing the attacker to
  cause a DoS condition or potentially execute arbitrary code.
