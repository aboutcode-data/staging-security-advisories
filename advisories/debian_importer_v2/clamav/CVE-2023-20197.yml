  - CVE-2023-20197
summary: "A vulnerability in the filesystem image parser for Hierarchical File System Plus (HFS+)\
  \ of ClamAV could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS)\
  \ condition on an affected device.\r \r This vulnerability is due to an incorrect check for\
  \ completion when a file is decompressed, which may result in a loop condition that could\
  \ cause the affected software to stop responding. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by submitting a crafted HFS+ filesystem image to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device.\
  \ A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to stop\
  \ responding, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected software and consuming available\
  \ system resources.\r \r For a description of this vulnerability, see the ClamAV blog ."
