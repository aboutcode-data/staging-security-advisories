summary: "A vulnerability in the HTML parser of ClamAV could allow an unauthenticated, remote\
  \ attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r The vulnerability\
  \ is due to an issue in the C to Rust foreign function interface. An attacker could exploit\
  \ this vulnerability by submitting a crafted file containing HTML content to be scanned by\
  \ ClamAV on an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning\
  \ process to terminate, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected software."
