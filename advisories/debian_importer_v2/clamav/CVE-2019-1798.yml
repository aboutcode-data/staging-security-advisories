  - CVE-2019-1798
summary: A vulnerability in the Portable Executable (PE) file scanning functionality of Clam
  AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.101.1 and prior could allow an unauthenticated, remote
  attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is
  due to a lack of proper input and validation checking mechanisms for PE files sent an affected
  device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed PE files to the
  device running an affected version ClamAV Software. An exploit could allow the attacker to
  cause an out-of-bounds read condition, resulting in a crash that could result in a denial
  of service condition on an affected device.
