  - CVE-2022-20792
summary: A vulnerability in the regex module used by the signature database load module of Clam
  AntiVirus (ClamAV) versions 0.104.0 through 0.104.2 and LTS version 0.103.5 and prior versions
  could allow an authenticated, local attacker to crash ClamAV at database load time, and possibly
  gain code execution. The vulnerability is due to improper bounds checking that may result
  in a multi-byte heap buffer overwflow write. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by placing a crafted CDB ClamAV signature database file in the ClamAV database directory.
  An exploit could allow the attacker to run code as the clamav user.
