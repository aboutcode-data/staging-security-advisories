  - CVE-2019-1785
summary: A vulnerability in the RAR file scanning functionality of Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software
  versions 0.101.1 and 0.101.0 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial
  of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper error-handling
  mechanisms when processing nested RAR files sent to an affected device. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted RAR file to an affected device. An exploit
  could allow the attacker to view or create arbitrary files on the targeted system.
