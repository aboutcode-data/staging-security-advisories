summary: "On Feb 15, 2023, the following vulnerability in the ClamAV scanning library was disclosed:\r\
  \ \r \r A vulnerability in the DMG file parser of ClamAV versions 1.0.0 and earlier, 0.105.1\
  \ and earlier, and 0.103.7 and earlier could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to\
  \ access sensitive information on an affected device.\r \r \r This vulnerability is due to\
  \ enabling XML entity substitution that may result in XML external entity injection. An attacker\
  \ could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted DMG file to be scanned by ClamAV\
  \ on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to leak bytes from\
  \ any file that may be read by the ClamAV scanning process."
