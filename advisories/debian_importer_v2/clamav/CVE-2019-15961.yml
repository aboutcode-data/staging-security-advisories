  - CVE-2019-15961
summary: A vulnerability in the email parsing module Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions
  0.102.0, 0.101.4 and prior could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial
  of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to inefficient MIME parsing
  routines that result in extremely long scan times of specially formatted email files. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted email file to an affected device. An
  exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to scan the crafted
  email file indefinitely, resulting in a denial of service condition.
