summary: "A vulnerability in the AutoIt module of ClamAV could allow an unauthenticated, remote\
  \ attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. \r \r This\
  \ vulnerability is due to a logic error in the memory management of an affected device. An\
  \ attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted AutoIt file to be scanned\
  \ by ClamAV on the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause\
  \ the ClamAV scanning process to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition."
