summary: A vulnerability in the OOXML parsing module in Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software version
  0.104.1 and LTS version 0.103.4 and prior versions could allow an unauthenticated, remote
  attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is
  due to improper checks that may result in an invalid pointer read. An attacker could exploit
