  - CVE-2024-31228
summary: Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. Authenticated users
  can trigger a denial-of-service by using specially crafted, long string match patterns on
  supported commands such as `KEYS`, `SCAN`, `PSUBSCRIBE`, `FUNCTION LIST`, `COMMAND LIST` and
  ACL definitions. Matching of extremely long patterns may result in unbounded recursion, leading
  to stack overflow and process crash. This problem has been fixed in Redis versions 6.2.16,
  7.2.6, and 7.4.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
