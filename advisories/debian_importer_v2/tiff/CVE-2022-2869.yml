  - CVE-2022-2869
summary: libtiff's tiffcrop tool has a uint32_t underflow which leads to out of bounds read
  and write in the extractContigSamples8bits routine. An attacker who supplies a crafted file
  to tiffcrop could trigger this flaw, most likely by tricking a user into opening the crafted
  file with tiffcrop. Triggering this flaw could cause a crash or potentially further exploitation.
