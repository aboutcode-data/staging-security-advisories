summary: 'Stack-based buffer overflow in the tiffsplit command in libtiff 3.8.2 and earlier
  might might allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long filename.  NOTE: tiffsplit
  is not setuid.  If there is not a common scenario under which tiffsplit is called with attacker-controlled
  command line arguments, then perhaps this issue should not be included in CVE.'
