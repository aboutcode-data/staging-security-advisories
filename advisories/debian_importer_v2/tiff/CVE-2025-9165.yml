  - CVE-2025-9165
summary: A flaw has been found in LibTIFF 4.7.0. This affects the function _TIFFmallocExt/_TIFFCheckRealloc/TIFFHashSetNew/InitCCITTFax3
  of the file tools/tiffcmp.c of the component tiffcmp. Executing manipulation can lead to memory
  leak. The attack is restricted to local execution. This attack is characterized by high complexity.
  It is indicated that the exploitability is difficult. The exploit has been published and may
  be used. There is ongoing doubt regarding the real existence of this vulnerability. This patch
  is called ed141286a37f6e5ddafb5069347ff5d587e7a4e0. It is best practice to apply a patch to
  resolve this issue. A researcher disputes the security impact of this issue, because "this
  is a memory leak on a command line tool that is about to exit anyway". In the reply the project
  maintainer declares this issue as "a simple 'bug' when leaving the command line tool and (...)
  not a security issue at all".
