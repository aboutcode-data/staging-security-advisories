aliases:
  - CVE-2017-11613
summary: In LibTIFF 4.0.8, there is a denial of service vulnerability in the TIFFOpen function.
  A crafted input will lead to a denial of service attack. During the TIFFOpen process, td_imagelength
  is not checked. The value of td_imagelength can be directly controlled by an input file. In
  the ChopUpSingleUncompressedStrip function, the _TIFFCheckMalloc function is called based
  on td_imagelength. If we set the value of td_imagelength close to the amount of system memory,
  it will hang the system or trigger the OOM killer.
