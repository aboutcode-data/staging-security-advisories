aliases:
  - CVE-2025-9900
summary: A flaw was found in Libtiff. This vulnerability is a "write-what-where" condition,
  triggered when the library processes a specially crafted TIFF image file.  By providing an
  abnormally large image height value in the file's metadata, an attacker can trick the library
  into writing attacker-controlled color data to an arbitrary memory location. This memory corruption
  can be exploited to cause a denial of service (application crash) or to achieve arbitrary
  code execution with the permissions of the user.
