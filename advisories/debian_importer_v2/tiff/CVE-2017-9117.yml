aliases:
  - CVE-2017-9117
summary: 'In LibTIFF 4.0.6 and possibly other versions, the program processes BMP images without
  verifying that biWidth and biHeight in the bitmap-information header match the actual input,
  as demonstrated by a heap-based buffer over-read in bmp2tiff. NOTE: mentioning bmp2tiff does
  not imply that the activation point is in the bmp2tiff.c file (which was removed before the
  4.0.7 release).'
