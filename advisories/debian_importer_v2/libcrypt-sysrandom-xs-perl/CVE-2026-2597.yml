summary: Crypt::SysRandom::XS versions before 0.010 for Perl is vulnerable to a heap buffer
  overflow in the XS function random_bytes().  The function does not validate that the length
  parameter is non-negative. If a negative value (e.g. -1) is supplied, the expression length
  + 1u causes an integer wraparound, resulting in a zero-byte allocation. The subsequent call
  to chosen random function (e.g. getrandom) passes the original negative value, which is implicitly
  converted to a large unsigned value (typically SIZE_MAX). This can result in writes beyond
  the allocated buffer, leading to heap memory corruption and application crash (denial of service).  In
  common usage, the length argument is typically hardcoded by the caller, which reduces the
  likelihood of attacker-controlled exploitation. Applications that pass untrusted input to
  this parameter may be affected.
