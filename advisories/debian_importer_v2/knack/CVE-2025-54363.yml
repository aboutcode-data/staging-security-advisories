summary: 'Microsoft Knack 0.12.0 allows Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the
  knack.introspection module. extract_full_summary_from_signature employs an inefficient regular
  expression pattern: "\s(:param)\s+(.+?)\s:(.*)" that is susceptible to catastrophic backtracking
  when processing crafted docstrings containing a large volume of whitespace without a terminating
  colon. An attacker who can control or inject docstring content into affected applications
  can trigger excessive CPU consumption. This software is used by Azure CLI.'
