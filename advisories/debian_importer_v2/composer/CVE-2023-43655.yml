  - CVE-2023-43655
summary: Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. Users publishing a composer.phar to a public
  web-accessible server where the composer.phar can be executed as a php file may be subject
  to a remote code execution vulnerability if PHP also has `register_argc_argv` enabled in php.ini.
  Versions 2.6.4, 2.2.22 and 1.10.27 patch this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade.
  Users unable to upgrade should make sure `register_argc_argv` is disabled in php.ini, and
  avoid publishing composer.phar to the web as this is not best practice.
