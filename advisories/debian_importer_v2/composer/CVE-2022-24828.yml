  - CVE-2022-24828
summary: Composer is a dependency manager for the PHP programming language. Integrators using
  Composer code to call `VcsDriver::getFileContent` can have a code injection vulnerability
  if the user can control the `$file` or `$identifier` argument. This leads to a vulnerability
  on packagist.org for example where the composer.json's `readme` field can be used as a vector
  for injecting parameters into hg/Mercurial via the `$file` argument, or git via the `$identifier`
  argument if you allow arbitrary data there (Packagist does not, but maybe other integrators
  do). Composer itself should not be affected by the vulnerability as it does not call `getFileContent`
  with arbitrary data into `$file`/`$identifier`. To the best of our knowledge this was not
  abused, and the vulnerability has been patched on packagist.org and Private Packagist within
  a day of the vulnerability report.
