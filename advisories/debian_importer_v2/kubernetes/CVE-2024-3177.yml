  - CVE-2024-3177
summary: A security issue was discovered in Kubernetes where users may be able to launch containers
  that bypass the mountable secrets policy enforced by the ServiceAccount admission plugin when
  using containers, init containers, and ephemeral containers with the envFrom field populated.
  The policy ensures pods running with a service account may only reference secrets specified
  in the service account’s secrets field. Kubernetes clusters are only affected if the ServiceAccount
  admission plugin and the kubernetes.io/enforce-mountable-secrets annotation are used together
  with containers, init containers, and ephemeral containers with the envFrom field populated.
