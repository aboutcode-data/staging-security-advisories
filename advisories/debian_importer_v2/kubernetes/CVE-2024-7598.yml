aliases:
  - CVE-2024-7598
summary: A security issue was discovered in Kubernetes where a malicious or compromised pod
  could bypass network restrictions enforced by network policies during namespace deletion.
  The order in which objects are deleted during namespace termination is not defined, and it
  is possible for network policies to be deleted before the pods that they protect. This can
  lead to a brief period in which the pods are running, but network policies that should apply
  to connections to and from the pods are not enforced.
