aliases:
  - CVE-2020-8562
summary: As mitigations to a report from 2019 and CVE-2020-8555, Kubernetes attempts to prevent
  proxied connections from accessing link-local or localhost networks when making user-driven
  connections to Services, Pods, Nodes, or StorageClass service providers. As part of this mitigation
  Kubernetes does a DNS name resolution check and validates that response IPs are not in the
  link-local (169.254.0.0/16) or localhost (127.0.0.0/8) range. Kubernetes then performs a second
  DNS resolution without validation for the actual connection. If a non-standard DNS server
  returns different non-cached responses, a user may be able to bypass the proxy IP restriction
  and access private networks on the control plane.
