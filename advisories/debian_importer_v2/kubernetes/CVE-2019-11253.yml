aliases:
  - CVE-2019-11253
summary: Improper input validation in the Kubernetes API server in versions v1.0-1.12 and versions
  prior to v1.13.12, v1.14.8, v1.15.5, and v1.16.2 allows authorized users to send malicious
  YAML or JSON payloads, causing the API server to consume excessive CPU or memory, potentially
  crashing and becoming unavailable. Prior to v1.14.0, default RBAC policy authorized anonymous
  users to submit requests that could trigger this vulnerability. Clusters upgraded from a version
  prior to v1.14.0 keep the more permissive policy by default for backwards compatibility.
