aliases:
  - CVE-2020-8557
summary: The Kubernetes kubelet component in versions 1.1-1.16.12, 1.17.0-1.17.8 and 1.18.0-1.18.5
  do not account for disk usage by a pod which writes to its own /etc/hosts file. The /etc/hosts
  file mounted in a pod by kubelet is not included by the kubelet eviction manager when calculating
  ephemeral storage usage by a pod. If a pod writes a large amount of data to the /etc/hosts
  file, it could fill the storage space of the node and cause the node to fail.
