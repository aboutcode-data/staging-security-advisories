summary: A security issue was discovered in Kubernetes where actors that control the responses
  of MutatingWebhookConfiguration or ValidatingWebhookConfiguration requests are able to redirect

  logs when the log level is set to 10, they can view the redirected responses and headers in
  the logs.
