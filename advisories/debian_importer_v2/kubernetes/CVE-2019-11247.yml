summary: The Kubernetes kube-apiserver mistakenly allows access to a cluster-scoped custom resource
  if the request is made as if the resource were namespaced. Authorizations for the resource
  accessed in this manner are enforced using roles and role bindings within the namespace, meaning
  that a user with access only to a resource in one namespace could create, view update or delete
  the cluster-scoped resource (according to their namespace role privileges). Kubernetes affected
  versions include versions prior to 1.13.9, versions prior to 1.14.5, versions prior to 1.15.2,
  and versions 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12.
