  - CVE-2021-32823
summary: In the bindata RubyGem before version 2.4.10 there is a potential denial-of-service
  vulnerability. In affected versions it is very slow for certain classes in BinData to be created.
  For example BinData::Bit100000, BinData::Bit100001, BinData::Bit100002, BinData::Bit<N>. In
  combination with <user_input>.constantize there is a potential for a CPU-based DoS. In version
  2.4.10 bindata improved the creation time of Bits and Integers.
