summary: openCryptoki is a PKCS#11 library and tools for Linux and AIX. In 3.25.0 and 3.26.0,
  there is a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in the CKM_ECDH_AES_KEY_WRAP implementation

  supplying a compressed EC public key and invoking C_WrapKey. This can lead to heap corruption,
  or denial-of-service.
