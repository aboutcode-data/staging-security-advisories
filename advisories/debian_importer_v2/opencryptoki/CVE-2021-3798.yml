aliases:
  - CVE-2021-3798
summary: A flaw was found in openCryptoki. The openCryptoki Soft token does not check if an
  EC key is valid when an EC key is created via C_CreateObject, nor when C_DeriveKey is used
  with ECDH public data. This may allow a malicious user to extract the private key by performing
  an invalid curve attack.
