  - CVE-2025-61774
summary: PyVista provides 3D plotting and mesh analysis through an interface for the Visualization
  Toolkit (VTK). Version 0.46.3 of the PyVista Project is vulnerable to remote code execution
  via dependency confusion. Two pieces of code use`--extra-index-url`. But when `--extra-index-url`
  is used, pip always checks for the PyPI index first, and then the external index. One package
  listed in the code is not published in PyPI. If an attacker publishes a package with higher
  version in PyPI, the malicious code from the attacker controlled package may be pulled, leading
  to remote code execution and a supply chain attack. As of time of publication, a patched version
  is unavailable.
