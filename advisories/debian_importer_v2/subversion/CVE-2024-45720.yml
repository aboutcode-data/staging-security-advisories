  - CVE-2024-45720
summary: On Windows platforms, a "best fit" character encoding conversion of command line arguments
  to Subversion's executables (e.g., svn.exe, etc.) may lead to unexpected command line argument
  interpretation, including argument injection and execution of other programs, if a specially
  crafted command line argument string is processed.  All versions of Subversion up to and including
  Subversion 1.14.3 are affected on Windows platforms only. Users are recommended to upgrade
  to version Subversion 1.14.4, which fixes this issue.  Subversion is not affected on UNIX-like
  platforms.
