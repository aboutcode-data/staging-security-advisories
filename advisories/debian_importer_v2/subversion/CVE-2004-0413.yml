  - CVE-2004-0413
summary: libsvn_ra_svn in Subversion 1.0.4 trusts the length field of (1) svn://, (2) svn+ssh://,
  and (3) other svn protocol URL strings, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
  service (memory consumption) and possibly execute arbitrary code via an integer overflow that
  leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.
