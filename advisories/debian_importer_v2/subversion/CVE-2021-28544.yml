  - CVE-2021-28544
summary: Apache Subversion SVN authz protected copyfrom paths regression Subversion servers
  reveal 'copyfrom' paths that should be hidden according to configured path-based authorization
  (authz) rules. When a node has been copied from a protected location, users with access to
  the copy can see the 'copyfrom' path of the original. This also reveals the fact that the
  node was copied. Only the 'copyfrom' path is revealed; not its contents. Both httpd and svnserve
  servers are vulnerable.
