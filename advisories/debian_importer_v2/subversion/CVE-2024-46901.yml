summary: Insufficient validation of filenames against control characters in Apache Subversion
  repositories served via mod_dav_svn allows authenticated users with commit access to commit
  a corrupted revision, leading to disruption for users of the repository.  All versions of
  Subversion up to and including Subversion 1.14.4 are affected if serving repositories via
  mod_dav_svn. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.14.5, which fixes this issue.  Repositories
  served via other access methods are not affected.
