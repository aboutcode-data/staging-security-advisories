summary: Subversion's mod_dav_svn is vulnerable to memory corruption. While looking up path-based
  authorization rules, mod_dav_svn servers may attempt to use memory which has already been
  freed. Affected Subversion mod_dav_svn servers 1.10.0 through 1.14.1 (inclusive). Servers
  that do not use mod_dav_svn are not affected.
