aliases:
  - CVE-2022-24772
summary: Forge (also called `node-forge`) is a native implementation of Transport Layer Security
  in JavaScript. Prior to version 1.3.0, RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification code does not
  check for tailing garbage bytes after decoding a `DigestInfo` ASN.1 structure. This can allow
  padding bytes to be removed and garbage data added to forge a signature when a low public
  exponent is being used. The issue has been addressed in `node-forge` version 1.3.0. There
  are currently no known workarounds.
