  - CVE-2022-24773
summary: Forge (also called `node-forge`) is a native implementation of Transport Layer Security
  in JavaScript. Prior to version 1.3.0, RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification code does not
  properly check `DigestInfo` for a proper ASN.1 structure. This can lead to successful verification
  with signatures that contain invalid structures but a valid digest. The issue has been addressed
  in `node-forge` version 1.3.0. There are currently no known workarounds.
