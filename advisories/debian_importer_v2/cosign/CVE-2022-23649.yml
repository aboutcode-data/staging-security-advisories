  - CVE-2022-23649
summary: Cosign provides container signing, verification, and storage in an OCI registry for
  the sigstore project. Prior to version 1.5.2, Cosign can be manipulated to claim that an entry
  for a signature exists in the Rekor transparency log even if it doesn't. This requires the
  attacker to have pull and push permissions for the signature in OCI. This can happen with
  both standard signing with a keypair and "keyless signing" with Fulcio. If an attacker has
  access to the signature in OCI, they can manipulate cosign into believing the entry was stored
  in Rekor even though it wasn't. The vulnerability has been patched in v1.5.2 of Cosign. The
  `signature` in the `signedEntryTimestamp` provided by Rekor is now compared to the `signature`
  that is being verified. If these don't match, then an error is returned. If a valid bundle
  is copied to a different signature, verification should fail. Cosign output now only informs
  the user that certificates were verified if a certificate was in fact verified. There is currently
  no known workaround.
