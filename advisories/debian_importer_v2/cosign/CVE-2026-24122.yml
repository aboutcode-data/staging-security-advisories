  - CVE-2026-24122
summary: Cosign provides code signing and transparency for containers and binaries. In versions
  3.0.4 and below, an issuing certificate with a validity that expires before the leaf certificate
  will be considered valid during verification even if the provided timestamp would mean the
  issuing certificate should be considered expired. When verifying artifact signatures using
  a certificate, Cosign first verifies the certificate chain using the leaf certificate's "not
  before" timestamp and later checks expiry of the leaf certificate using either a signed timestamp
  provided by the Rekor transparency log or from a timestamp authority, or using the current
  time. The root and all issuing certificates are assumed to be valid during the leaf certificate's
  validity. There is no impact to users of the public Sigstore infrastructure. This may affect
  private deployments with customized PKIs. This issue has been fixed in version 3.0.5.
