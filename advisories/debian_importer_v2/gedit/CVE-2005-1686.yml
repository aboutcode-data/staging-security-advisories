summary: 'Format string vulnerability in gedit 2.10.2 may allow attackers to cause a denial
  of service (application crash) via a bin file with format string specifiers in the filename.  NOTE:
  while this issue is triggered on the command line by the gedit user, it has been reported
  that web browsers and email clients could be configured to provide a file name as an argument
  to gedit, so there is a valid attack that crosses security boundaries.'
