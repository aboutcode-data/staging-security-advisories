  - CVE-2022-36944
summary: Scala 2.13.x before 2.13.9 has a Java deserialization chain in its JAR file. On its
  own, it cannot be exploited. There is only a risk in conjunction with Java object deserialization
  within an application. In such situations, it allows attackers to erase contents of arbitrary
  files, make network connections, or possibly run arbitrary code (specifically, Function0 functions)
  via a gadget chain.
