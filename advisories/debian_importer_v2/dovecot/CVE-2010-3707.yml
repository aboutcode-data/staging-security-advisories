summary: plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.5
  interprets an ACL entry as a directive to add to the permissions granted by another ACL entry,
  instead of a directive to replace the permissions granted by another ACL entry, in certain
  circumstances involving more specific entries that occur after less specific entries, which
