  - CVE-2022-30550
summary: An issue was discovered in the auth component in Dovecot 2.2 and 2.3 before 2.3.20.
  When two passdb configuration entries exist with the same driver and args settings, incorrect
  username_filter and mechanism settings can be applied to passdb definitions. These incorrectly
  applied settings can lead to an unintended security configuration and can permit privilege
  escalation in certain configurations. The documentation does not advise against the use of
  passdb definitions that have the same driver and args settings. One such configuration would
  be where an administrator wishes to use the same PAM configuration or passwd file for both
  normal and master users but use the username_filter setting to restrict which of the users
  is able to be a master user.
