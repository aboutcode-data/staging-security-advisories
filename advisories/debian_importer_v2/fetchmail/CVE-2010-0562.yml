aliases:
  - CVE-2010-0562
summary: The sdump function in sdump.c in fetchmail 6.3.11, 6.3.12, and 6.3.13, when running
  in verbose mode on platforms for which char is signed, allows remote attackers to cause a
  denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via an SSL X.509
  certificate containing non-printable characters with the high bit set, which triggers a heap-based
  buffer overflow during escaping.
