  - CVE-2008-1693
summary: The CairoFont::create function in CairoFontEngine.cc in Poppler, possibly before 0.8.0,
  as used in Xpdf, Evince, ePDFview, KWord, and other applications, does not properly handle
  embedded fonts in PDF files, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a
  crafted font object, related to dereferencing a function pointer associated with the type
  of this font object.
