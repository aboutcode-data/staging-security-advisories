  - CVE-2025-13470
summary: 'In RNP version 0.18.0 a refactoring regression causes the symmetric  session key used
  for Public-Key Encrypted Session Key (PKESK) packets to  be left uninitialized except for
  zeroing, resulting in it always being  an all-zero byte array.  Any data encrypted using public-key
  encryption  in this release can be decrypted trivially by supplying an all-zero  session key,
  fully compromising confidentiality.  The vulnerability affects only public key encryption
  (PKESK packets).  Passphrase-based encryption (SKESK packets) is not affected.  Root cause:
  Vulnerable session key buffer used in PKESK packet generation.    The defect was introduced
  in commit `7bd9a8dc356aae756b40755be76d36205b6b161a` where initialization  logic inside `encrypted_build_skesk()`
  only randomized the key for the  SKESK path and omitted it for the PKESK path.'
