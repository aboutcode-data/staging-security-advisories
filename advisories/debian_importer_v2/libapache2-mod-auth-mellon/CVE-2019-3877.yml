aliases:
  - CVE-2019-3877
summary: A vulnerability was found in mod_auth_mellon before v0.14.2. An open redirect in the
  logout URL allows requests with backslashes to pass through by assuming that it is a relative
  URL, while the browsers silently convert backslash characters into forward slashes treating
  them as an absolute URL. This mismatch allows an attacker to bypass the redirect URL validation
  logic in apr_uri_parse function.
