summary: An issue was discovered in RubyGems 2.6 and later through 3.0.2. A crafted gem with
  a multi-line name is not handled correctly. Therefore, an attacker could inject arbitrary
  code to the stub line of gemspec, which is eval-ed by code in ensure_loadable_spec during
  the preinstall check.
