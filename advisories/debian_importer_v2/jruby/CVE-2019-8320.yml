  - CVE-2019-8320
summary: A Directory Traversal issue was discovered in RubyGems 2.7.6 and later through 3.0.2.
  Before making new directories or touching files (which now include path-checking code for
  symlinks), it would delete the target destination. If that destination was hidden behind a
  symlink, a malicious gem could delete arbitrary files on the user's machine, presuming the
  attacker could guess at paths. Given how frequently gem is run as sudo, and how predictable
  paths are on modern systems (/tmp, /usr, etc.), this could likely lead to data loss or an
  unusable system.
