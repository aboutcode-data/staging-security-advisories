summary: An issue was discovered in Ruby through 2.6.7, 2.7.x through 2.7.3, and 3.x through
  3.0.1. Net::IMAP does not raise an exception when StartTLS fails with an an unknown response,
  which might allow man-in-the-middle attackers to bypass the TLS protections by leveraging
  a network position between the client and the registry to block the StartTLS command, aka
  a "StartTLS stripping attack."
