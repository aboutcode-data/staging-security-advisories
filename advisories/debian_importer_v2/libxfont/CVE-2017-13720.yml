  - CVE-2017-13720
summary: In the PatternMatch function in fontfile/fontdir.c in libXfont through 1.5.2 and 2.x
  before 2.0.2, an attacker with access to an X connection can cause a buffer over-read during
  pattern matching of fonts, leading to information disclosure or a crash (denial of service).
  This occurs because '\0' characters are incorrectly skipped in situations involving ? characters.
