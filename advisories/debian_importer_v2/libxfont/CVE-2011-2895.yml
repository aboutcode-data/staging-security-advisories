aliases:
  - CVE-2011-2895
summary: The LZW decompressor in (1) the BufCompressedFill function in fontfile/decompress.c
  in X.Org libXfont before 1.4.4 and (2) compress/compress.c in 4.3BSD, as used in zopen.c in
  OpenBSD before 3.8, FreeBSD, NetBSD 4.0.x and 5.0.x before 5.0.3 and 5.1.x before 5.1.1, FreeType
  2.1.9, and other products, does not properly handle code words that are absent from the decompression
  table when encountered, which allows context-dependent attackers to trigger an infinite loop
  or a heap-based buffer overflow, and possibly execute arbitrary code, via a crafted compressed
  stream, a related issue to CVE-2006-1168 and CVE-2011-2896.
