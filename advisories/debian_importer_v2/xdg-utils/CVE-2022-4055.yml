summary: When xdg-mail is configured to use thunderbird for mailto URLs, improper parsing of
  the URL can lead to additional headers being passed to thunderbird that should not be included
  per RFC 2368. An attacker can use this method to create a mailto URL that looks safe to users,
  but will actually attach files when clicked.
