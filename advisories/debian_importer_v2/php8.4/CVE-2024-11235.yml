  - CVE-2024-11235
summary: In PHP versions 8.3.* before 8.3.19 and 8.4.* before 8.4.5, a code sequence involving
  __set handler or ??=  operator and exceptions can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability.
  If the third party can control the memory layout leading to this, for example by supplying
  specially crafted inputs to the script, it could lead to remote code execution.
