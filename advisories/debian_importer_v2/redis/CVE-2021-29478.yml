  - CVE-2021-29478
summary: Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database,
  cache, and message broker. An integer overflow bug in Redis 6.2 before 6.2.3 could be exploited
  to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. Redis 6.0 and earlier
  are not directly affected by this issue. The problem is fixed in version 6.2.3. An additional
  workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the `redis-server` executable is to prevent
  users from modifying the `set-max-intset-entries` configuration parameter. This can be done
  using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the `CONFIG SET` command.
