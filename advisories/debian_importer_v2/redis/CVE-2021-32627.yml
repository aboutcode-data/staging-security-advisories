  - CVE-2021-32627
summary: Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. In affected versions
  an integer overflow bug in Redis can be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result
  with remote code execution. The vulnerability involves changing the default proto-max-bulk-len
  and client-query-buffer-limit configuration parameters to very large values and constructing
  specially crafted very large stream elements. The problem is fixed in Redis 6.2.6, 6.0.16
  and 5.0.14. For users unable to upgrade an additional workaround to mitigate the problem without
  patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from modifying the proto-max-bulk-len
  configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using
  the CONFIG SET command.
