  - CVE-2021-32626
summary: Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. In affected versions
  specially crafted Lua scripts executing in Redis can cause the heap-based Lua stack to be
  overflowed, due to incomplete checks for this condition. This can result with heap corruption
  and potentially remote code execution. This problem exists in all versions of Redis with Lua
  scripting support, starting from 2.6. The problem is fixed in versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14.
  For users unable to update an additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching
  the redis-server executable is to prevent users from executing Lua scripts. This can be done
  using ACL to restrict EVAL and EVALSHA commands.
