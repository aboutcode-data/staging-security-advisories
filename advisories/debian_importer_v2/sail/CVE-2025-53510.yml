aliases:
  - CVE-2025-53510
summary: A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the PSD Image Decoding functionality of
  the SAIL Image Decoding Library v0.9.8. When loading a specially crafted .psd file, an integer
  overflow can be made to occur when calculating the stride for decoding. Afterwards, this will
  cause a heap-based buffer to overflow when decoding the image which can lead to remote code
  execution. An attacker will need to convince the library to read a file to trigger this vulnerability.
