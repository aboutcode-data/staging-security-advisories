  - CVE-2025-52930
summary: A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the BMPv3 RLE Decoding functionality of
  the SAIL Image Decoding Library v0.9.8. When decompressing the image data from a specially
  crafted .bmp file, a heap-based buffer overflow can occur which allows for remote code execution.
  An attacker will need to convince the library to read a file to trigger this vulnerability.
