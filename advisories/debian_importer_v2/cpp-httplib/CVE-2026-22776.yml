summary: 'cpp-httplib is a C++11 single-file header-only cross platform HTTP/HTTPS library.
  Prior to version 0.30.1, a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in cpp-httplib due
  to the unsafe handling of compressed HTTP request bodies (Content-Encoding: gzip, br, etc.).
  The library validates the payload_max_length against the compressed data size received from
  the network, but does not limit the size of the decompressed data stored in memory.'
