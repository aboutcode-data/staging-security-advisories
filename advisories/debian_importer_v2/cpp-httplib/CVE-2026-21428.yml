  - CVE-2026-21428
summary: cpp-httplib is a C++11 single-file header-only cross platform HTTP/HTTPS library. Prior
  to version 0.30.0, the ``write_headers`` function does not check for CR & LF characters in
  user supplied headers, allowing untrusted header value to escape header lines. This vulnerability
  allows attackers to add extra headers, modify request body unexpectedly & trigger an SSRF
  attack. When combined with a server that supports http1.1 pipelining (springboot, python twisted
  etc), this can be used for server side request forgery (SSRF). Version 0.30.0 fixes this issue.
