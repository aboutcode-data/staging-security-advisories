  - CVE-2025-66577
summary: cpp-httplib is a C++11 single-file header-only cross platform HTTP/HTTPS library. Prior
  to 0.27.0, a vulnerability allows attacker-controlled HTTP headers to influence server-visible
  metadata, logging, and authorization decisions. An attacker can supply X-Forwarded-For or
  X-Real-IP headers which get accepted unconditionally by get_client_ip() in docker/main.cc,
  causing access and error logs (nginx_access_logger / nginx_error_logger) to record spoofed
  client IPs (log poisoning / audit evasion). This vulnerability is fixed in 0.27.0.
