  - CVE-2025-52887
summary: cpp-httplib is a C++11 single-file header-only cross platform HTTP/HTTPS library. In
  version 0.21.0, when many http headers fields are passed in, the library does not limit the
  number of headers, and the memory associated with the headers will not be released when the
  connection is disconnected. This leads to potential exhaustion of system memory and results
  in a server crash or unresponsiveness. Version 0.22.0 contains a patch for the issue.
