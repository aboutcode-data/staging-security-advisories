  - CVE-2018-20681
summary: mate-screensaver before 1.20.2 in MATE Desktop Environment allows physically proximate
  attackers to view screen content and possibly control applications. By unplugging and re-plugging
  or power-cycling external output devices (such as additionally attached graphical outputs
  via HDMI, VGA, DVI, etc.) the content of a screensaver-locked session can be revealed. In
  some scenarios, the attacker can execute applications, such as by clicking with a mouse.
