  - CVE-2010-3616
summary: ISC DHCP server 4.2 before 4.2.0-P2, when configured to use failover partnerships,
  allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (communications-interrupted state and
  DHCP client service loss) by connecting to a port that is only intended for a failover peer,
  as demonstrated by a Nagios check_tcp process check to TCP port 520.
