summary: 'Heap-based buffer overflow in the open_man_file function in callbacks.c in gmanedit
  0.4.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted man page, which is not
  properly handled during utf8 conversion.  NOTE: another overflow was reported using a configuration
  file, but that vector does not have a scenario that crosses privilege boundaries.'
