aliases:
  - CVE-2025-2814
summary: Crypt::CBC versions between 1.21 and 3.05 for Perl may use the rand() function as the
  default source of entropy, which is not cryptographically secure, for cryptographic functions.  This
  issue affects operating systems where "/dev/urandom'" is unavailable.  In that case, Crypt::CBC
  will fallback to use the insecure rand() function.
