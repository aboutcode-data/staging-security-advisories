  - CVE-2023-42811
summary: aes-gcm is a pure Rust implementation of the AES-GCM. Starting in version 0.10.0 and
  prior to version 0.10.3, in the AES GCM implementation of decrypt_in_place_detached, the decrypted
  ciphertext (i.e. the correct plaintext) is exposed even if tag verification fails. If a program
  using the `aes-gcm` crate's `decrypt_in_place*` APIs accesses the buffer after decryption
  failure, it will contain a decryption of an unauthenticated input. Depending on the specific
  nature of the program this may enable Chosen Ciphertext Attacks (CCAs) which can cause a catastrophic
  breakage of the cipher including full plaintext recovery. Version 0.10.3 contains a fix for
  this issue.
