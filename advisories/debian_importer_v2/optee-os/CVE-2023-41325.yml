  - CVE-2023-41325
summary: OP-TEE is a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) designed as companion to a non-secure
  Linux kernel running on Arm; Cortex-A cores using the TrustZone technology. Starting in version
  3.20 and prior to version 3.22, `shdr_verify_signature` can make a double free. `shdr_verify_signature`
  used to verify a TA binary before it is loaded. To verify a signature of it, allocate a memory
  for RSA key. RSA key allocate function (`sw_crypto_acipher_alloc_rsa_public_key`) will try
  to allocate a memory (which is optee’s heap memory). RSA key is consist of exponent and modulus
  (represent as variable `e`, `n`) and it allocation is not atomic way, so it may succeed in
  `e` but fail in `n`. In this case sw_crypto_acipher_alloc_rsa_public_key` will free on `e`
  and return as it is failed but variable ‘e’ is remained as already freed memory address .
  `shdr_verify_signature` will free again that memory (which is `e`) even it is freed when it
  failed allocate RSA key. A patch is available in version 3.22. No known workarounds are available.
