aliases:
  - CVE-2024-32487
summary: less through 653 allows OS command execution via a newline character in the name of
  a file, because quoting is mishandled in filename.c. Exploitation typically requires use with
  attacker-controlled file names, such as the files extracted from an untrusted archive. Exploitation
  also requires the LESSOPEN environment variable, but this is set by default in many common
  cases.
