  - CVE-2021-32715
summary: 'hyper is an HTTP library for rust. hyper''s HTTP/1 server code had a flaw that incorrectly
  parses and accepts requests with a `Content-Length` header with a prefixed plus sign, when
  it should have been rejected as illegal. This combined with an upstream HTTP proxy that doesn''t
  parse such `Content-Length` headers, but forwards them, can result in "request smuggling"
  or "desync attacks". The flaw exists in all prior versions of hyper prior to 0.14.10, if built
  with `rustc` v1.5.0 or newer. The vulnerability is patched in hyper version 0.14.10. Two workarounds
  exist: One may reject requests manually that contain a plus sign prefix in the `Content-Length`
  header or ensure any upstream proxy handles `Content-Length` headers with a plus sign prefix.'
