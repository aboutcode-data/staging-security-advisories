  - CVE-2019-25225
summary: '`sanitize-html` prior to version 2.0.0-beta is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting
  (XSS). The `sanitizeHtml()` function in `index.js` does not sanitize content when using the
  custom `transformTags` option, which is intended to convert attribute values into text. As
  a result, malicious input can be transformed into executable code.'
