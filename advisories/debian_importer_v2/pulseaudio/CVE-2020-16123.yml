  - CVE-2020-16123
summary: An Ubuntu-specific patch in PulseAudio created a race condition where the snap policy
  module would fail to identify a client connection from a snap as coming from a snap if SCM_CREDENTIALS
  were missing, allowing the snap to connect to PulseAudio without proper confinement. This
  could be exploited by an attacker to expose sensitive information. Fixed in 1:13.99.3-1ubuntu2,
  1:13.99.2-1ubuntu2.1, 1:13.99.1-1ubuntu3.8, 1:11.1-1ubuntu7.11, and 1:8.0-0ubuntu3.15.
