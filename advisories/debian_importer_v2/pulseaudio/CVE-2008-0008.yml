aliases:
  - CVE-2008-0008
summary: The pa_drop_root function in PulseAudio 0.9.8, and a certain 0.9.9 build, does not
  check return values from (1) setresuid, (2) setreuid, (3) setuid, and (4) seteuid calls when
  attempting to drop privileges, which might allow local users to gain privileges by causing
  those calls to fail via attacks such as resource exhaustion.
