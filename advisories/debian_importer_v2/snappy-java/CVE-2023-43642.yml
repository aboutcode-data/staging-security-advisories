  - CVE-2023-43642
summary: snappy-java is a Java port of the snappy, a fast C++ compresser/decompresser developed
  by Google. The SnappyInputStream was found to be vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
  when decompressing data with a too large chunk size. Due to missing upper bound check on chunk
  length, an unrecoverable fatal error can occur. All versions of snappy-java including the
  latest released version 1.1.10.3 are vulnerable to this issue. A fix has been introduced in
  commit `9f8c3cf74` which will be included in the 1.1.10.4 release. Users are advised to upgrade.
  Users unable to upgrade should only accept compressed data from trusted sources.
