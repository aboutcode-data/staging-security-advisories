  - CVE-2019-12408
summary: It was discovered that the C++ implementation (which underlies the R, Python and Ruby
  implementations) of Apache Arrow 0.14.0 to 0.14.1 had a uninitialized memory bug when building
  arrays with null values in some cases. This can lead to uninitialized memory being unintentionally
  shared if Arrow Arrays are transmitted over the wire (for instance with Flight) or persisted
  in the streaming IPC and file formats.
