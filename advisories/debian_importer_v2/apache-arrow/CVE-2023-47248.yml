  - CVE-2023-47248
summary: Deserialization of untrusted data in IPC and Parquet readers in PyArrow versions 0.14.0
  to 14.0.0 allows arbitrary code execution. An application is vulnerable if it reads Arrow
  IPC, Feather or Parquet data from untrusted sources (for example user-supplied input files).  This
  vulnerability only affects PyArrow, not other Apache Arrow implementations or bindings.  It
  is recommended that users of PyArrow upgrade to 14.0.1. Similarly, it is recommended that
  downstream libraries upgrade their dependency requirements to PyArrow 14.0.1 or later. PyPI
  packages are already available, and we hope that conda-forge packages will be available soon.  If
  it is not possible to upgrade, we provide a separate package `pyarrow-hotfix` that disables
  the vulnerability on older PyArrow versions. See  https://pypi.org/project/pyarrow-hotfix/  for
  instructions.
