  - CVE-2024-21633
summary: Apktool is a tool for reverse engineering Android APK files. In versions 2.9.1 and
  prior, Apktool infers resource files' output path according to their resource names which
  can be manipulated by attacker to place files at desired location on the system Apktool runs
  on. Affected environments are those in which an attacker may write/overwrite any file that
  user has write access, and either user name is known or cwd is under user folder. Commit d348c43b24a9de350ff6e5bd610545a10c1fc712
  contains a patch for this issue.
