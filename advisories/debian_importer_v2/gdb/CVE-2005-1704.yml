  - CVE-2005-1704
summary: Integer overflow in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library for gdb before 6.3, binutils,
  elfutils, and possibly other packages, allows user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary
  code via a crafted object file that specifies a large number of section headers, leading to
  a heap-based buffer overflow.
