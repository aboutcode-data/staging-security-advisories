  - CVE-2021-22881
summary: The Host Authorization middleware in Action Pack before 6.1.2.1, 6.0.3.5 suffers from
  an open redirect vulnerability. Specially crafted `Host` headers in combination with certain
  "allowed host" formats can cause the Host Authorization middleware in Action Pack to redirect
  users to a malicious website. Impacted applications will have allowed hosts with a leading
  dot. When an allowed host contains a leading dot, a specially crafted `Host` header can be
  used to redirect to a malicious website.
