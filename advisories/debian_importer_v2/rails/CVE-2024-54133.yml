  - CVE-2024-54133
summary: Action Pack is a framework for handling and responding to web requests. There is a
  possible Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability  in the `content_security_policy` helper
  starting in version 5.2.0 of Action Pack and prior to versions 7.0.8.7, 7.1.5.1, 7.2.2.1,
  and 8.0.0.1. Applications which set Content-Security-Policy (CSP) headers dynamically from
  untrusted user input may be vulnerable to carefully crafted inputs being able to inject new
  directives into the CSP. This could lead to a bypass of the CSP and its protection against
  XSS and other attacks. Versions 7.0.8.7, 7.1.5.1, 7.2.2.1, and 8.0.0.1 contain a fix. As a
  workaround, applications can avoid setting CSP headers dynamically from untrusted input, or
  can validate/sanitize that input.
