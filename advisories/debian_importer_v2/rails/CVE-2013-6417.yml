  - CVE-2013-6417
summary: 'actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/http/request.rb in Ruby on Rails before 3.2.16 and
  4.x before 4.0.2 does not properly consider differences in parameter handling between the
  Active Record component and the JSON implementation, which allows remote attackers to bypass
  intended database-query restrictions and perform NULL checks or trigger missing WHERE clauses
  via a crafted request that leverages (1) third-party Rack middleware or (2) custom Rack middleware.  NOTE:
  this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-0155.'
