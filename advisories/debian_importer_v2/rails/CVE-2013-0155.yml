aliases:
  - CVE-2013-0155
summary: Ruby on Rails 3.0.x before 3.0.19, 3.1.x before 3.1.10, and 3.2.x before 3.2.11 does
  not properly consider differences in parameter handling between the Active Record component
  and the JSON implementation, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended database-query
  restrictions and perform NULL checks or trigger missing WHERE clauses via a crafted request,
  as demonstrated by certain "[nil]" values, a related issue to CVE-2012-2660 and CVE-2012-2694.
