  - CVE-2022-23633
summary: Action Pack is a framework for handling and responding to web requests. Under certain
  circumstances response bodies will not be closed. In the event a response is *not* notified
  of a `close`, `ActionDispatch::Executor` will not know to reset thread local state for the
  next request. This can lead to data being leaked to subsequent requests.This has been fixed
  in Rails 7.0.2.1, 6.1.4.5, 6.0.4.5, and 5.2.6.1. Upgrading is highly recommended, but to work
  around this problem a middleware described in GHSA-wh98-p28r-vrc9 can be used.
