  - CVE-2021-22880
summary: The PostgreSQL adapter in Active Record before 6.1.2.1, 6.0.3.5, 5.2.4.5 suffers from
  a regular expression denial of service (REDoS) vulnerability. Carefully crafted input can
  cause the input validation in the `money` type of the PostgreSQL adapter in Active Record
  to spend too much time in a regular expression, resulting in the potential for a DoS attack.
  This only impacts Rails applications that are using PostgreSQL along with money type columns
  that take user input.
