  - CVE-2023-22795
summary: A regular expression based DoS vulnerability in Action Dispatch <6.1.7.1 and <7.0.4.1
  related to the If-None-Match header. A specially crafted HTTP If-None-Match header can cause
  the regular expression engine to enter a state of catastrophic backtracking, when on a version
  of Ruby below 3.2.0. This can cause the process to use large amounts of CPU and memory, leading
  to a possible DoS vulnerability All users running an affected release should either upgrade
  or use one of the workarounds immediately.
