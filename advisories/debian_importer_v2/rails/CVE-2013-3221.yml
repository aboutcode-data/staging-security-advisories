  - CVE-2013-3221
summary: The Active Record component in Ruby on Rails 2.3.x, 3.0.x, 3.1.x, and 3.2.x does not
  ensure that the declared data type of a database column is used during comparisons of input
  values to stored values in that column, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct
  data-type injection attacks against Ruby on Rails applications via a crafted value, as demonstrated
  by unintended interaction between the "typed XML" feature and a MySQL database.
