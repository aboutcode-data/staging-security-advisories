summary: "ActiveSupport::EncryptedFile writes contents that will be encrypted to a\r temporary\
  \ file.  The temporary file's permissions are defaulted to the user's\r current `umask` settings,\
  \ meaning that it's possible for other users on the\r same system to read the contents of\
  \ the temporary file.\r \r Attackers that have access to the file system could possibly read\
  \ the contents\r of this temporary file while a user is editing it.\r \r All users running\
  \ an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the\r workarounds immediately."
