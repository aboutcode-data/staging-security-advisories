  - CVE-2021-22903
summary: The actionpack ruby gem before 6.1.3.2 suffers from a possible open redirect vulnerability.
  Specially crafted Host headers in combination with certain "allowed host" formats can cause
  the Host Authorization middleware in Action Pack to redirect users to a malicious website.
  This is similar to CVE-2021-22881. Strings in config.hosts that do not have a leading dot
  are converted to regular expressions without proper escaping. This causes, for example, `config.hosts
  << "sub.example.com"` to permit a request with a Host header value of `sub-example.com`.
