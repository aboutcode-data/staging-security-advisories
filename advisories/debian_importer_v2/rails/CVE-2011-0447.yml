  - CVE-2011-0447
summary: Ruby on Rails 2.1.x, 2.2.x, and 2.3.x before 2.3.11, and 3.x before 3.0.4, does not
  properly validate HTTP requests that contain an X-Requested-With header, which makes it easier
  for remote attackers to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks via forged (1) AJAX
  or (2) API requests that leverage "combinations of browser plugins and HTTP redirects," a
  related issue to CVE-2011-0696.
