  - CVE-2020-6077
summary: An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the message-parsing functionality
  of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When parsing mDNS messages, the implementation does not properly
  keep track of the available data in the message, possibly leading to an out-of-bounds read
  that would result in a denial of service. An attacker can send an mDNS message to trigger
  this vulnerability.
