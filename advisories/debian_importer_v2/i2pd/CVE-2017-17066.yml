  - CVE-2017-17066
summary: The (1) i2pd before 2.17 and (2) kovri pre-alpha implementations of the I2P routing
  protocol do not properly handle Garlic DeliveryTypeTunnel packets, which allows remote attackers
  to obtain sensitive information from process memory via crafted packets that trigger a buffer
  over-read, as demonstrated by reading sensitive router memory, aka the GarlicRust bug.
