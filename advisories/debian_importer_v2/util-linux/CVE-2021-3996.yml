  - CVE-2021-3996
summary: A logic error was found in the libmount library of util-linux in the function that
  allows an unprivileged user to unmount a FUSE filesystem. This flaw allows a local user on
  a vulnerable system to unmount other users' filesystems that are either world-writable themselves
  (like /tmp) or mounted in a world-writable directory. An attacker may use this flaw to cause
  a denial of service to applications that use the affected filesystems.
