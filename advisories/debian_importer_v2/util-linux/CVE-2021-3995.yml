  - CVE-2021-3995
summary: A logic error was found in the libmount library of util-linux in the function that
  allows an unprivileged user to unmount a FUSE filesystem. This flaw allows an unprivileged
  local attacker to unmount FUSE filesystems that belong to certain other users who have a UID
  that is a prefix of the UID of the attacker in its string form. An attacker may use this flaw
  to cause a denial of service to applications that use the affected filesystems.
