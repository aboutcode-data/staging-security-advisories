summary: wall in util-linux through 2.40, often installed with setgid tty permissions, allows
  escape sequences to be sent to other users' terminals through argv. (Specifically, escape
  sequences received from stdin are blocked, but escape sequences received from argv are not
  blocked.) There may be plausible scenarios where this leads to account takeover.
