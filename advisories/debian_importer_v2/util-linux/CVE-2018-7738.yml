summary: In util-linux before 2.32-rc1, bash-completion/umount allows local users to gain privileges
  by embedding shell commands in a mountpoint name, which is mishandled during a umount command
  (within Bash) by a different user, as demonstrated by logging in as root and entering umount
  followed by a tab character for autocompletion.
