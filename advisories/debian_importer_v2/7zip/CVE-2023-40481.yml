summary: 7-Zip SquashFS File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.
  This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations
  of 7-Zip. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must
  visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing
  of SQFS files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data,
  which can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage
  this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-18589.
