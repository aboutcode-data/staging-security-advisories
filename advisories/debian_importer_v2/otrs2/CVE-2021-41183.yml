  - CVE-2021-41183
summary: jQuery-UI is the official jQuery user interface library. Prior to version 1.13.0, accepting
  the value of various `*Text` options of the Datepicker widget from untrusted sources may execute
  untrusted code. The issue is fixed in jQuery UI 1.13.0. The values passed to various `*Text`
  options are now always treated as pure text, not HTML. A workaround is to not accept the value
  of the `*Text` options from untrusted sources.
