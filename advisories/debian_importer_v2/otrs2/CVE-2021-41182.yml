  - CVE-2021-41182
summary: jQuery-UI is the official jQuery user interface library. Prior to version 1.13.0, accepting
  the value of the `altField` option of the Datepicker widget from untrusted sources may execute
  untrusted code. The issue is fixed in jQuery UI 1.13.0. Any string value passed to the `altField`
  option is now treated as a CSS selector. A workaround is to not accept the value of the `altField`
  option from untrusted sources.
