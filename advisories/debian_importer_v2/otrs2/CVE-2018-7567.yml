  - CVE-2018-7567
summary: 'In the Admin Package Manager in Open Ticket Request System (OTRS) 5.0.0 through 5.0.24
  and 6.0.0 through 6.0.1, authenticated admins are able to exploit a Blind Remote Code Execution
  vulnerability by loading a crafted opm file with an embedded CodeInstall element to execute
  a command on the server during package installation.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue
  stating "the behaviour is as designed and needed for different packages to be installed",
  "there is a security warning if the package is not verified by OTRS Group", and "there is
  the possibility and responsibility of an admin to check packages before installation which
  is possible as they are not binary.'
