aliases:
  - CVE-2008-7278
summary: The S/MIME feature in Open Ticket Request System (OTRS) before 2.2.5, and 2.3.x before
  2.3.0-beta1, does not properly configure the RANDFILE environment variable for OpenSSL, which
  might make it easier for remote attackers to decrypt e-mail messages that had lower than intended
  entropy available for cryptographic operations, related to inability to write to the seeding
  file.
