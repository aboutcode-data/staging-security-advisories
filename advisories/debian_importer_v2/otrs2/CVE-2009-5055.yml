  - CVE-2009-5055
summary: Open Ticket Request System (OTRS) before 2.4.4 grants ticket access on the basis of
  single-digit substrings of the CustomerID value, which allows remote authenticated users to
  bypass intended access restrictions in opportunistic circumstances by visiting a ticket, as
  demonstrated by leveraging the CustomerID 12 account to read tickets that should be available
  only to CustomerID 1 or CustomerID 2.
