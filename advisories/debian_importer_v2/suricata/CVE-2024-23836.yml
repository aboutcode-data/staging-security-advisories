  - CVE-2024-23836
summary: Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention System and Network
  Security Monitoring engine. Prior to versions 6.0.16 and 7.0.3, an attacker can craft traffic
  to cause Suricata to use far more CPU and memory for processing the traffic than needed, which
  can lead to extreme slow downs and denial of service.  This vulnerability is patched in 6.0.16
  or 7.0.3.  Workarounds include disabling the affected protocol app-layer parser in the yaml
  and reducing the `stream.reassembly.depth` value helps reduce the severity of the issue.
