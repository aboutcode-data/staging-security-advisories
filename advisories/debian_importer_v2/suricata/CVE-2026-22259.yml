  - CVE-2026-22259
summary: Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine. Prior to versions 8.0.3 and 7.0.14,
  specially crafted traffic can cause Suricata to consume large amounts of memory while parsing
  DNP3 traffic. This can lead to the process slowing down and running out of memory, potentially
  leading to it getting killed by the OOM killer. Versions 8.0.3 or 7.0.14 contain a patch.
  As a workaround, disable the DNP3 parser in the suricata yaml (disabled by default).
