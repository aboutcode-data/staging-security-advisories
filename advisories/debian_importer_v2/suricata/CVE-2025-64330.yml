  - CVE-2025-64330
summary: Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open Information
  Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. Prior to versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2, a single
  byte read heap overflow when logging the verdict in eve.alert and eve.drop records can lead
  to crashes. This requires the per packet alert queue to be filled with alerts and then followed
  by a pass rule. This issue has been patched in versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2. To reduce the likelihood
  of this issue occurring, the alert queue size a should be increased (packet-alert-max in suricata.yaml)
  if verdict is enabled.
