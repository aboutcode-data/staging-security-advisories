aliases:
  - CVE-2023-35852
summary: In Suricata before 6.0.13 (when there is an adversary who controls an external source
  of rules), a dataset filename, that comes from a rule, may trigger absolute or relative directory
  traversal, and lead to write access to a local filesystem. This is addressed in 6.0.13 by
  requiring allow-absolute-filenames and allow-write (in the datasets rules configuration section)
  if an installation requires traversal/writing in this situation.
