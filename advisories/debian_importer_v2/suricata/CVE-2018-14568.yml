  - CVE-2018-14568
summary: Suricata before 4.0.5 stops TCP stream inspection upon a TCP RST from a server. This
  allows detection bypass because Windows TCP clients proceed with normal processing of TCP
  data that arrives shortly after an RST (i.e., they act as if the RST had not yet been received).
