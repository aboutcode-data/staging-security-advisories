  - CVE-2026-22261
summary: Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine. Prior to versions 8.0.3 and 7.0.14,
  various inefficiencies in xff handling, especially for alerts not triggered in a tx, can lead
  to severe slowdowns. Versions 8.0.3 and 7.0.14 contain a patch. As a workaround, disable XFF
  support in the eve configuration. The setting is disabled by default.
