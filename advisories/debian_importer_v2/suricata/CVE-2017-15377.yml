aliases:
  - CVE-2017-15377
summary: In Suricata before 4.x, it was possible to trigger lots of redundant checks on the
  content of crafted network traffic with a certain signature, because of DetectEngineContentInspection
  in detect-engine-content-inspection.c. The search engine doesn't stop when it should after
  no match is found; instead, it stops only upon reaching inspection-recursion-limit (3000 by
  default).
