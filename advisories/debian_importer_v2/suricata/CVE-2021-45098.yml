  - CVE-2021-45098
summary: An issue was discovered in Suricata before 6.0.4. It is possible to bypass/evade any
  HTTP-based signature by faking an RST TCP packet with random TCP options of the md5header
  from the client side. After the three-way handshake, it's possible to inject an RST ACK with
  a random TCP md5header option. Then, the client can send an HTTP GET request with a forbidden
  URL. The server will ignore the RST ACK and send the response HTTP packet for the client's
  request. These packets will not trigger a Suricata reject action.
