  - CVE-2025-59147
summary: Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open Information
  Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. Versions 7.0.11 and below, as well as 8.0.0,
  are vulnerable to detection bypass when crafted traffic sends multiple SYN packets with different
  sequence numbers within the same flow tuple, which can cause Suricata to fail to pick up the
  TCP session. In IDS mode this can lead to a detection and logging bypass. In IPS mode this
  will lead to the flow getting blocked. This issue is fixed in versions 7.0.12 and 8.0.1.
