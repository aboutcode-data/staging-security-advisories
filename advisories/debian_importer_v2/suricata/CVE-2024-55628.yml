  - CVE-2024-55628
summary: Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention System and Network
  Security Monitoring engine. Prior to version 7.0.8, DNS resource name compression can lead
  to small DNS messages containing very large hostnames which can be costly to decode, and lead
  to very large DNS log records. While there are limits in place, they were too generous. The
  issue has been addressed in Suricata 7.0.8.
