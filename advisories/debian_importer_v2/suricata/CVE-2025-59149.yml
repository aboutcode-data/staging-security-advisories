  - CVE-2025-59149
summary: Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open Information
  Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. In version 8.0.0, rules using keyword ldap.responses.attribute_type
  (which is long) with transforms can lead to a stack buffer overflow during Suricata startup
  or during a rule reload. This issue is fixed in version 8.0.1. To workaround this issue, users
  can disable rules with ldap.responses.attribute_type and transforms.
