  - CVE-2019-10053
summary: An issue was discovered in Suricata 4.1.x before 4.1.4. If the input of the function
  SSHParseBanner is composed only of a \n character, then the program runs into a heap-based
  buffer over-read. This occurs because the erroneous search for \r results in an integer underflow.
