  - CVE-2016-10728
summary: An issue was discovered in Suricata before 3.1.2. If an ICMPv4 error packet is received
  as the first packet on a flow in the to_client direction, it confuses the rule grouping lookup
  logic. The toclient inspection will then continue with the wrong rule group. This can lead
  to missed detection.
