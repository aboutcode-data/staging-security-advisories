aliases:
  - CVE-2020-25632
summary: A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. The rmmod implementation allows
  the unloading of a module used as a dependency without checking if any other dependent module
  is still loaded leading to a use-after-free scenario. This could allow arbitrary code to be
  executed or a bypass of Secure Boot protections. The highest threat from this vulnerability
  is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.
