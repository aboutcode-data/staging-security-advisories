  - CVE-2022-3775
summary: When rendering certain unicode sequences, grub2's font code doesn't proper validate
  if the informed glyph's width and height is constrained within bitmap size. As consequence
  an attacker can craft an input which will lead to a out-of-bounds write into grub2's heap,
  leading to memory corruption and availability issues. Although complex, arbitrary code execution
  could not be discarded.
