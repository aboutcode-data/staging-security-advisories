  - CVE-2021-3981
summary: A flaw in grub2 was found where its configuration file, known as grub.cfg, is being
  created with the wrong permission set allowing non privileged users to read its content. This
  represents a low severity confidentiality issue, as those users can eventually read any encrypted
  passwords present in grub.cfg. This flaw affects grub2 2.06 and previous versions. This issue
  has been fixed in grub upstream but no version with the fix is currently released.
