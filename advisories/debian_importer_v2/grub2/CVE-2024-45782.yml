  - CVE-2024-45782
summary: A flaw was found in the HFS filesystem. When reading an HFS volume's name at grub_fs_mount(),
  the HFS filesystem driver performs a strcpy() using the user-provided volume name as input
  without properly validating the volume name's length. This issue may read to a heap-based
  out-of-bounds writer, impacting grub's sensitive data integrity and eventually leading to
  a secure boot protection bypass.
