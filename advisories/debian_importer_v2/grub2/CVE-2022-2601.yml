  - CVE-2022-2601
summary: A buffer overflow was found in grub_font_construct_glyph(). A malicious crafted pf2
  font can lead to an overflow when calculating the max_glyph_size value, allocating a smaller
  than needed buffer for the glyph, this further leads to a buffer overflow and a heap based
  out-of-bounds write. An attacker may use this vulnerability to circumvent the secure boot
  mechanism.
