aliases:
  - CVE-2021-3695
summary: A crafted 16-bit grayscale PNG image may lead to a out-of-bounds write in the heap
  area. An attacker may take advantage of that to cause heap data corruption or eventually arbitrary
  code execution and circumvent secure boot protections. This issue has a high complexity to
  be exploited as an attacker needs to perform some triage over the heap layout to achieve signifcant
  results, also the values written into the memory are repeated three times in a row making
  difficult to produce valid payloads. This flaw affects grub2 versions prior grub-2.12.
