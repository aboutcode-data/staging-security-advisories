aliases:
  - CVE-2024-45780
summary: A flaw was found in grub2. When reading tar files, grub2 allocates an internal buffer
  for the file name. However, it fails to properly verify the allocation against possible integer
  overflows. It's possible to cause the allocation length to overflow with a crafted tar file,
  leading to a heap out-of-bounds write. This flaw eventually allows an attacker to circumvent
  secure boot protections.
