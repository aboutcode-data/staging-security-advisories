aliases:
  - CVE-2025-61664
summary: A vulnerability in the GRUB2 bootloader has been identified in the normal module. This
  flaw, a memory Use After Free issue, occurs because the normal_exit command is not properly
  unregistered when its related module is unloaded. An attacker can exploit this condition by
  invoking the command after the module has been removed, causing the system to improperly access
  a previously freed memory location. This leads to a system crash or possible impacts in data
  confidentiality and integrity.
