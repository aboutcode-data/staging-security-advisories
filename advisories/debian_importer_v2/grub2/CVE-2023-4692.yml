  - CVE-2023-4692
summary: An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in grub2's NTFS filesystem driver. This issue
  may allow an attacker to present a specially crafted NTFS filesystem image, leading to grub's
  heap metadata corruption. In some circumstances, the attack may also corrupt the UEFI firmware
  heap metadata. As a result, arbitrary code execution and secure boot protection bypass may
  be achieved.
