  - CVE-2025-0685
summary: A flaw was found in grub2. When reading data from a jfs filesystem, grub's jfs filesystem
  module uses user-controlled parameters from the filesystem geometry to determine the internal
  buffer size, however, it improperly checks for integer overflows. A maliciouly crafted filesystem
  may lead some of those buffer size calculations to overflow, causing it to perform a grub_malloc()
  operation with a smaller size than expected. As a result, the grub_jfs_lookup_symlink() function
  will write past the internal buffer length during grub_jfs_read_file(). This issue can be
  leveraged to corrupt grub's internal critical data and may result in arbitrary code execution,
  by-passing secure boot protections.
