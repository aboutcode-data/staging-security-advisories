  - CVE-2025-4382
summary: A flaw was found in systems utilizing LUKS-encrypted disks with GRUB configured for
  TPM-based auto-decryption. When GRUB is set to automatically decrypt disks using keys stored
  in the TPM, it reads the decryption key into system memory. If an attacker with physical access
  can corrupt the underlying filesystem superblock, GRUB will fail to locate a valid filesystem
  and enter rescue mode. At this point, the disk is already decrypted, and the decryption key
  remains loaded in system memory. This scenario may allow an attacker with physical access
  to access the unencrypted data without any further authentication, thereby compromising data
  confidentiality. Furthermore, the ability to force this state through filesystem corruption
  also presents a data integrity concern.
