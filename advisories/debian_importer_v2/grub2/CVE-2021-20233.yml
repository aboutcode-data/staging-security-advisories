aliases:
  - CVE-2021-20233
summary: A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. Setparam_prefix() in the menu
  rendering code performs a length calculation on the assumption that expressing a quoted single
  quote will require 3 characters, while it actually requires 4 characters which allows an attacker
  to corrupt memory by one byte for each quote in the input. The highest threat from this vulnerability
  is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.
