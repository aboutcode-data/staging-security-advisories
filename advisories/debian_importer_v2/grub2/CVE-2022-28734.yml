summary: Out-of-bounds write when handling split HTTP headers; When handling split HTTP headers,
  GRUB2 HTTP code accidentally moves its internal data buffer point by one position. This can
  lead to a out-of-bound write further when parsing the HTTP request, writing a NULL byte past
  the buffer. It's conceivable that an attacker controlled set of packets can lead to corruption
  of the GRUB2's internal memory metadata.
