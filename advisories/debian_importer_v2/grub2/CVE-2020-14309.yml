  - CVE-2020-14309
summary: There's an issue with grub2 in all versions before 2.06 when handling squashfs filesystems
  containing a symbolic link with name length of UINT32 bytes in size. The name size leads to
  an arithmetic overflow leading to a zero-size allocation further causing a heap-based buffer
  overflow with attacker controlled data.
