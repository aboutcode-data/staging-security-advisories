  - CVE-2020-14372
summary: A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06, where it incorrectly enables the
  usage of the ACPI command when Secure Boot is enabled. This flaw allows an attacker with privileged
  access to craft a Secondary System Description Table (SSDT) containing code to overwrite the
  Linux kernel lockdown variable content directly into memory. The table is further loaded and
  executed by the kernel, defeating its Secure Boot lockdown and allowing the attacker to load
  unsigned code. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity,
  as well as system availability.
