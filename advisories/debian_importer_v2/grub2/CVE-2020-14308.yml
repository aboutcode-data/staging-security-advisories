summary: In grub2 versions before 2.06 the grub memory allocator doesn't check for possible
  arithmetic overflows on the requested allocation size. This leads the function to return invalid
  memory allocations which can be further used to cause possible integrity, confidentiality
  and availability impacts during the boot process.
