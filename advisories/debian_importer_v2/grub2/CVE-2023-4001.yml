  - CVE-2023-4001
summary: An authentication bypass flaw was found in GRUB due to the way that GRUB uses the UUID
  of a device to search for the configuration file that contains the password hash for the GRUB
  password protection feature. An attacker capable of attaching an external drive such as a
  USB stick containing a file system with a duplicate UUID (the same as in the "/boot/" file
  system) can bypass the GRUB password protection feature on UEFI systems, which enumerate removable
  drives before non-removable ones. This issue was introduced in a downstream patch in Red Hat's
  version of grub2 and does not affect the upstream package.
