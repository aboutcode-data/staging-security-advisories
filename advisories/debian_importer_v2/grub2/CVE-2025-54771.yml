  - CVE-2025-54771
summary: A use-after-free vulnerability has been identified in the GNU GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader).
  The flaw occurs because the file-closing process incorrectly retains a memory pointer, leaving
  an invalid reference to a file system structure. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  to cause grub to crash, leading to a Denial of Service. Possible data integrity or confidentiality
  compromise is not discarded.
