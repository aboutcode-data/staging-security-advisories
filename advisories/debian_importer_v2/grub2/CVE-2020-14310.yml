  - CVE-2020-14310
summary: There is an issue on grub2 before version 2.06 at function read_section_as_string().
  It expects a font name to be at max UINT32_MAX - 1 length in bytes but it doesn't verify it
  before proceed with buffer allocation to read the value from the font value. An attacker may
  leverage that by crafting a malicious font file which has a name with UINT32_MAX, leading
  to read_section_as_string() to an arithmetic overflow, zero-sized allocation and further heap-based
  buffer overflow.
