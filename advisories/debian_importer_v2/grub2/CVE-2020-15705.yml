  - CVE-2020-15705
summary: GRUB2 fails to validate kernel signature when booted directly without shim, allowing
  secure boot to be bypassed. This only affects systems where the kernel signing certificate
  has been imported directly into the secure boot database and the GRUB image is booted directly
  without the use of shim. This issue affects GRUB2 version 2.04 and prior versions.
