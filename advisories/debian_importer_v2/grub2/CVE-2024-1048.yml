aliases:
  - CVE-2024-1048
summary: A flaw was found in the grub2-set-bootflag utility of grub2. After the fix of CVE-2019-14865,
  grub2-set-bootflag will create a temporary file with the new grubenv content and rename it
  to the original grubenv file. If the program is killed before the rename operation, the temporary
  file will not be removed and may fill the filesystem when invoked multiple times, resulting
  in a filesystem out of free inodes or blocks.
