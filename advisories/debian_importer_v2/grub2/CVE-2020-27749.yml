  - CVE-2020-27749
summary: A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. Variable names present are expanded
  in the supplied command line into their corresponding variable contents, using a 1kB stack
  buffer for temporary storage, without sufficient bounds checking. If the function is called
  with a command line that references a variable with a sufficiently large payload, it is possible
  to overflow the stack buffer, corrupt the stack frame and control execution which could also
  circumvent Secure Boot protections. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data
  confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.
