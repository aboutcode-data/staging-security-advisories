summary: A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. The cutmem command does not honor
  secure boot locking allowing an privileged attacker to remove address ranges from memory creating
  an opportunity to circumvent SecureBoot protections after proper triage about grub's memory
  layout. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity
  as well as system availability.
