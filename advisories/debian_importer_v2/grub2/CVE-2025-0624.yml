aliases:
  - CVE-2025-0624
summary: A flaw was found in grub2. During the network boot process, when trying to search for
  the configuration file, grub copies data from a user controlled environment variable into
  an internal buffer using the grub_strcpy() function. During this step, it fails to consider
  the environment variable length when allocating the internal buffer, resulting in an out-of-bounds
  write. If correctly exploited, this issue may result in remote code execution through the
  same network segment grub is searching for the boot information, which can be used to by-pass
  secure boot protections.
