aliases:
  - CVE-2020-27751
summary: A flaw was found in ImageMagick in MagickCore/quantum-export.c. An attacker who submits
  a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form
  of values outside the range of type `unsigned long long` as well as a shift exponent that
  is too large for 64-bit type. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability,
  but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior. This flaw affects
  ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.
