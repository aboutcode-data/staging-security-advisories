  - CVE-2026-25898
summary: ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital
  images. Prior to versions 7.1.2-15 and 6.9.13-40, the UIL and XPM image encoder do not validate
  the pixel index value returned by `GetPixelIndex()` before using it as an array subscript.
  In HDRI builds, `Quantum` is a floating-point type, so pixel index values can be negative.
  An attacker can craft an image with negative pixel index values to trigger a global buffer
  overflow read during conversion, leading to information disclosure or a process crash. Versions
  7.1.2-15 and 6.9.13-40 contain a patch.
