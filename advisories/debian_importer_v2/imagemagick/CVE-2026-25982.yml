  - CVE-2026-25982
summary: ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital
  images. Prior to versions 7.1.2-15 and 6.9.13-40, a heap out-of-bounds read vulnerability
  exists in the `coders/dcm.c` module. When processing DICOM files with a specific configuration,
  the decoder loop incorrectly reads bytes per iteration. This causes the function to read past
  the end of the allocated buffer, potentially leading to a Denial of Service (crash) or Information
  Disclosure (leaking heap memory into the image). Versions 7.1.2-15 and 6.9.13-40 contain a
  patch.
