summary: ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital
  images. Prior to versions 7.1.2-15 and 6.9.13-40, sometimes msl.c fails to update the stack
  index, so an image is stored in the wrong slot and never freed on error, causing leaks. Versions
  7.1.2-15 and 6.9.13-40 contain a patch.
