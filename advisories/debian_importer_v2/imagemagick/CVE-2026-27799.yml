  - CVE-2026-27799
summary: ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital
  images. Prior to versions 7.1.2-15 and 6.9.13-40, a heap buffer over-read vulnerability exists
  in the DJVU image format handler. The vulnerability occurs due to integer truncation when
  calculating the stride (row size) for pixel buffer allocation. The stride calculation overflows
  a 32-bit signed integer, resulting in an out-of-bounds memory reads. Versions 7.1.2-15 and
  6.9.13-40 contain a patch.
