  - CVE-2026-24485
summary: ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital
  images. Prior to versions 7.1.2-15 and 6.9.13-40, when a PCD file does not contain a valid
  Sync marker, the DecodeImage() function becomes trapped in an infinite loop while searching
  for the Sync marker, causing the program to become unresponsive and continuously consume CPU
  resources, ultimately leading to system resource exhaustion and denial of service. Versions
  7.1.2-15 and 6.9.13-40 contain a patch.
