  - CVE-2026-25795
summary: ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital
  images. Prior to versions 7.1.2-15 and 6.9.13-40, in `ReadSFWImage()` (`coders/sfw.c`), when
  temporary file creation fails, `read_info` is destroyed before its `filename` member is accessed,
  causing a NULL pointer dereference and crash. Versions 7.1.2-15 and 6.9.13-40 contain a patch.
