summary: ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital
  images. Prior to versions 7.1.2-15 and 6.9.13-40, a signed integer overflow vulnerability
  in ImageMagick's SIXEL decoder allows an attacker to trigger memory corruption and denial
  of service when processing a maliciously crafted SIXEL image file. The vulnerability occurs
  during buffer reallocation operations where pointer arithmetic using signed 32-bit integers
  overflows. Versions 7.1.2-15 and 6.9.13-40 contain a patch.
