  - CVE-2026-25797
summary: ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital
  images. Prior to versions 7.1.2-15 and 6.9.13-40, the ps coders, responsible for writing PostScript
  files, fails to sanitize the input before writing it into the PostScript header.  An attacker
  can provide a malicous file and inject arbitrary PostScript code. When the resulting file
  is processed by a printer or a viewer (like Ghostscript), the injected code is interpreted
  and executed. The html encoder does not properly escape strings that are written to in the
  html document. An attacker can provide a malicious file and injection arbitrary html code.
  Versions 7.1.2-15 and 6.9.13-40 contain a patch.
