aliases:
  - CVE-2020-27759
summary: In IntensityCompare() of /MagickCore/quantize.c, a double value was being casted to
  int and returned, which in some cases caused a value outside the range of type `int` to be
  returned. The flaw could be triggered by a crafted input file under certain conditions when
  processed by ImageMagick. Red Hat Product Security marked this as Low severity because although
  it could potentially lead to an impact to application availability, no specific impact was
  shown in this case. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.8-68.
