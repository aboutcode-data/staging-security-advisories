  - CVE-2026-25799
summary: ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital
  images. Prior to versions 7.1.2-15 and 6.9.13-40, a logic error in YUV sampling factor validation
  allows an invalid sampling factor to bypass checks and trigger a division-by-zero during image
  loading, resulting in a reliable denial-of-service. Versions 7.1.2-15 and 6.9.13-40 contain
  a patch.
