  - CVE-2026-25966
summary: ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital
  images. The shipped "secure" security policy includes a rule intended to prevent reading/writing
  from standard streams. However, ImageMagick also supports fd:<n> pseudo-filenames (e.g., fd:0,
  fd:1). Prior to versions 7.1.2-15 and 6.9.13-40, this path form is not blocked by the secure
  policy templates, and therefore bypasses the protection goal of "no stdin/stdout." Versions
  7.1.2-15 and 6.9.13-40 contain a patch by including a change to the more secure policies by
  default. As a workaround, add the change to one's security policy manually.
