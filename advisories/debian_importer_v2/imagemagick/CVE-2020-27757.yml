summary: A floating point math calculation in ScaleAnyToQuantum() of /MagickCore/quantum-private.h
  could lead to undefined behavior in the form of a value outside the range of type unsigned
  long long. The flaw could be triggered by a crafted input file under certain conditions when
  it is processed by ImageMagick. Red Hat Product Security marked this as Low because although
  it could potentially lead to an impact to application availability, no specific impact was
  shown in this case. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.8-68.
