  - CVE-2026-25794
summary: ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital
  images. `WriteUHDRImage` in `coders/uhdr.c` uses `int` arithmetic to compute the pixel buffer
  size. Prior to version 7.1.2-15, when image dimensions are large, the multiplication overflows
  32-bit `int`, causing an undersized heap allocation followed by an out-of-bounds write. This
  can crash the process or potentially lead to an out of bounds heap write. Version 7.1.2-15
  contains a patch.
