  - CVE-2020-27771
summary: In RestoreMSCWarning() of /coders/pdf.c there are several areas where calls to GetPixelIndex()
  could result in values outside the range of representable for the unsigned char type. The
  patch casts the return value of GetPixelIndex() to ssize_t type to avoid this bug. This undefined
  behavior could be triggered when ImageMagick processes a crafted pdf file. Red Hat Product
  Security marked this as Low severity because although it could potentially lead to an impact
  to application availability, no specific impact was demonstrated in this case. This flaw affects
  ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.
