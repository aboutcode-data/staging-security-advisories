  - CVE-2026-24481
summary: ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital
  images. Prior to versions 7.1.2-15 and 6.9.13-40, a heap information disclosure vulnerability
  exists in ImageMagick's PSD (Adobe Photoshop) format handler. When processing a maliciously
  crafted PSD file containing ZIP-compressed layer data that decompresses to less than the expected
  size, uninitialized heap memory is leaked into the output image. Versions 7.1.2-15 and 6.9.13-40
  contain a patch.
