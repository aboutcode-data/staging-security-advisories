  - CVE-2020-25676
summary: In CatromWeights(), MeshInterpolate(), InterpolatePixelChannel(), InterpolatePixelChannels(),
  and InterpolatePixelInfo(), which are all functions in /MagickCore/pixel.c, there were multiple
  unconstrained pixel offset calculations which were being used with the floor() function. These
  calculations produced undefined behavior in the form of out-of-range and integer overflows,
  as identified by UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer. These instances of undefined behavior could be
  triggered by an attacker who is able to supply a crafted input file to be processed by ImageMagick.
  These issues could impact application availability or potentially cause other problems related
  to undefined behavior. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.
