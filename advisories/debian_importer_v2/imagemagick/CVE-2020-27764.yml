aliases:
  - CVE-2020-27764
summary: In /MagickCore/statistic.c, there are several areas in ApplyEvaluateOperator() where
  a size_t cast should have been a ssize_t cast, which causes out-of-range values under some
  circumstances when a crafted input file is processed by ImageMagick. Red Hat Product Security
  marked this as Low severity because although it could potentially lead to an impact to application
  availability, no specific impact was shown in this case. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions
  prior to 6.9.10-69.
