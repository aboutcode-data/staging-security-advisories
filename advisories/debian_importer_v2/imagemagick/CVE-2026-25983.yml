  - CVE-2026-25983
summary: ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital
  images. Prior to versions 7.1.2-15 and 6.9.13-40, a crafted MSL script triggers a heap-use-after-free.
  The operation element handler replaces and frees the image while the parser continues reading
  from it, leading to a UAF in ReadBlobString during further parsing. Versions 7.1.2-15 and
  6.9.13-40 contain a patch.
