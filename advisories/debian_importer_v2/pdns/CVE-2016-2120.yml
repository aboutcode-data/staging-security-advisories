aliases:
  - CVE-2016-2120
summary: An issue has been found in PowerDNS Authoritative Server versions up to and including
  3.4.10, 4.0.1 allowing an authorized user to crash the server by inserting a specially crafted
  record in a zone under their control then sending a DNS query for that record. The issue is
  due to an integer overflow when checking if the content of the record matches the expected
  size, allowing an attacker to cause a read past the buffer boundary.
