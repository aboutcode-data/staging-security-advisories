  - CVE-2016-7073
summary: An issue has been found in PowerDNS before 3.4.11 and 4.0.2, and PowerDNS recursor
  before 4.0.4, allowing an attacker in position of man-in-the-middle to alter the content of
  an AXFR because of insufficient validation of TSIG signatures. A missing check of the TSIG
  time and fudge values was found in AXFRRetriever, leading to a possible replay attack.
