  - CVE-2017-15091
summary: An issue has been found in the API component of PowerDNS Authoritative 4.x up to and
  including 4.0.4 and 3.x up to and including 3.4.11, where some operations that have an impact
  on the state of the server are still allowed even though the API has been configured as read-only
  via the api-readonly keyword. This missing check allows an attacker with valid API credentials
  to flush the cache, trigger a zone transfer or send a NOTIFY.
