summary: On Windows, The IsLocal function does not correctly detect reserved device names in
  some cases. Reserved names followed by spaces, such as "COM1 ", and reserved names "COM" and
  "LPT" followed by superscript 1, 2, or 3, are incorrectly reported as local. With fix, IsLocal
  now correctly reports these names as non-local.
