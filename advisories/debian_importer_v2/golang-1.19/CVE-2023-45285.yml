  - CVE-2023-45285
summary: Using go get to fetch a module with the ".git" suffix may unexpectedly fallback to
  the insecure "git://" protocol if the module is unavailable via the secure "https://" and
  "git+ssh://" protocols, even if GOINSECURE is not set for said module. This only affects users
  who are not using the module proxy and are fetching modules directly (i.e. GOPROXY=off).
