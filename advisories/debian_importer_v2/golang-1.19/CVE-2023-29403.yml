  - CVE-2023-29403
summary: On Unix platforms, the Go runtime does not behave differently when a binary is run
  with the setuid/setgid bits. This can be dangerous in certain cases, such as when dumping
  memory state, or assuming the status of standard i/o file descriptors. If a setuid/setgid
  binary is executed with standard I/O file descriptors closed, opening any files can result
  in unexpected content being read or written with elevated privileges. Similarly, if a setuid/setgid
  program is terminated, either via panic or signal, it may leak the contents of its registers.
