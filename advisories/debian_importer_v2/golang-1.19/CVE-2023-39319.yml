  - CVE-2023-39319
summary: The html/template package does not apply the proper rules for handling occurrences
  of "<script", "<!--", and "</script" within JS literals in <script> contexts. This may cause
  the template parser to improperly consider script contexts to be terminated early, causing
  actions to be improperly escaped. This could be leveraged to perform an XSS attack.
