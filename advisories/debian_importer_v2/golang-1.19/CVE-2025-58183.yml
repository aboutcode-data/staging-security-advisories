summary: tar.Reader does not set a maximum size on the number of sparse region data blocks in
  GNU tar pax 1.0 sparse files. A maliciously-crafted archive containing a large number of sparse
  regions can cause a Reader to read an unbounded amount of data from the archive into memory.
  When reading from a compressed source, a small compressed input can result in large allocations.
