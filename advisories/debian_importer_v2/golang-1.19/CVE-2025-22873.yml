  - CVE-2025-22873
summary: It was possible to improperly access the parent directory of an os.Root by opening
  a filename ending in "../". For example, Root.Open("../") would open the parent directory
  of the Root. This escape only permits opening the parent directory itself, not ancestors of
  the parent or files contained within the parent.
