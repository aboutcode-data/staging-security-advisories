  - CVE-2023-24531
summary: Command go env is documented as outputting a shell script containing the Go environment.
  However, go env doesn't sanitize values, so executing its output as a shell script can cause
  various bad bahaviors, including executing arbitrary commands or inserting new environment
  variables. This issue is relatively minor because, in general, if an attacker can set arbitrary
  environment variables on a system, they have better attack vectors than making "go env" print
  them out.
