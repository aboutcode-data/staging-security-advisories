summary: Requests forwarded by ReverseProxy include the raw query parameters from the inbound
  request, including unparsable parameters rejected by net/http. This could permit query parameter
  smuggling when a Go proxy forwards a parameter with an unparsable value. After fix, ReverseProxy
  sanitizes the query parameters in the forwarded query when the outbound request's Form field
  is set after the ReverseProxy. Director function returns, indicating that the proxy has parsed
  the query parameters. Proxies which do not parse query parameters continue to forward the
  original query parameters unchanged.
