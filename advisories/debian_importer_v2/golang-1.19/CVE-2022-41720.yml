summary: On Windows, restricted files can be accessed via os.DirFS and http.Dir. The os.DirFS
  function and http.Dir type provide access to a tree of files rooted at a given directory.
  These functions permit access to Windows device files under that root. For example, os.DirFS("C:/tmp").Open("COM1")
  opens the COM1 device. Both os.DirFS and http.Dir only provide read-only filesystem access.
  In addition, on Windows, an os.DirFS for the directory (the root of the current drive) can
  permit a maliciously crafted path to escape from the drive and access any path on the system.
  With fix applied, the behavior of os.DirFS("") has changed. Previously, an empty root was
  treated equivalently to "/", so os.DirFS("").Open("tmp") would open the path "/tmp". This
  now returns an error.
