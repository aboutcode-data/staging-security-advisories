summary: When parsing a multipart form (either explicitly with Request.ParseMultipartForm or
  implicitly with Request.FormValue, Request.PostFormValue, or Request.FormFile), limits on
  the total size of the parsed form were not applied to the memory consumed while reading a
  single form line. This permits a maliciously crafted input containing very long lines to cause
  allocation of arbitrarily large amounts of memory, potentially leading to memory exhaustion.
  With fix, the ParseMultipartForm function now correctly limits the maximum size of form lines.
