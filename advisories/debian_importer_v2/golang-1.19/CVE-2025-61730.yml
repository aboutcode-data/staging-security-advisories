  - CVE-2025-61730
summary: During the TLS 1.3 handshake if multiple messages are sent in records that span encryption
  level boundaries (for instance the Client Hello and Encrypted Extensions messages), the subsequent
  messages may be processed before the encryption level changes. This can cause some minor information
  disclosure if a network-local attacker can inject messages during the handshake.
