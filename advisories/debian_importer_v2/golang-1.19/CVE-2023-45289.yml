  - CVE-2023-45289
summary: When following an HTTP redirect to a domain which is not a subdomain match or exact
  match of the initial domain, an http.Client does not forward sensitive headers such as "Authorization"
  or "Cookie". For example, a redirect from foo.com to www.foo.com will forward the Authorization
  header, but a redirect to bar.com will not. A maliciously crafted HTTP redirect could cause
  sensitive headers to be unexpectedly forwarded.
