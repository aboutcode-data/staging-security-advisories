  - CVE-2018-10237
summary: Unbounded memory allocation in Google Guava 11.0 through 24.x before 24.1.1 allows
  remote attackers to conduct denial of service attacks against servers that depend on this
  library and deserialize attacker-provided data, because the AtomicDoubleArray class (when
  serialized with Java serialization) and the CompoundOrdering class (when serialized with GWT
  serialization) perform eager allocation without appropriate checks on what a client has sent
  and whether the data size is reasonable.
