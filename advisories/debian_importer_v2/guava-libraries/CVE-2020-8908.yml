  - CVE-2020-8908
summary: A temp directory creation vulnerability exists in all versions of Guava, allowing an
  attacker with access to the machine to potentially access data in a temporary directory created
  by the Guava API com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir(). By default, on unix-like systems,
  the created directory is world-readable (readable by an attacker with access to the system).
  The method in question has been marked @Deprecated in versions 30.0 and later and should not
  be used. For Android developers, we recommend choosing a temporary directory API provided
  by Android, such as context.getCacheDir(). For other Java developers, we recommend migrating
  to the Java 7 API java.nio.file.Files.createTempDirectory() which explicitly configures permissions
  of 700, or configuring the Java runtime's java.io.tmpdir system property to point to a location
  whose permissions are appropriately configured.
