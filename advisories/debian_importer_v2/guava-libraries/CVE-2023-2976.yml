aliases:
  - CVE-2023-2976
summary: Use of Java's default temporary directory for file creation in `FileBackedOutputStream`
  in Google Guava versions 1.0 to 31.1 on Unix systems and Android Ice Cream Sandwich allows
  other users and apps on the machine with access to the default Java temporary directory to
  be able to access the files created by the class.  Even though the security vulnerability
  is fixed in version 32.0.0, we recommend using version 32.0.1 as version 32.0.0 breaks some
  functionality under Windows.
