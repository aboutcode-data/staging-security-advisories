  - CVE-2017-15650
summary: musl libc before 1.1.17 has a buffer overflow via crafted DNS replies because dns_parse_callback
  in network/lookup_name.c does not restrict the number of addresses, and thus an attacker can
  provide an unexpected number by sending A records in a reply to an AAAA query.
