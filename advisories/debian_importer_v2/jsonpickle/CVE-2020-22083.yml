summary: 'jsonpickle through 1.4.1 allows remote code execution during deserialization of a
  malicious payload through the decode() function. Note: It has been argued that this is expected
  and clearly documented behaviour. pickle is known to be capable of causing arbitrary code
  execution, and must not be used with un-trusted data'
