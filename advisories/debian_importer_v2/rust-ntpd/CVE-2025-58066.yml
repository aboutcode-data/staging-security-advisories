summary: nptd-rs is a tool for synchronizing your computer's clock, implementing the NTP and
  NTS protocols. In versions between 1.2.0 and 1.6.1 inclusive servers which allow non-NTS traffic
  are affected by a denial of service vulnerability, where an attacker can induce a message
  storm between two NTP servers running ntpd-rs. Client-only configurations are not affected.
  Affected users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.6.2 as soon as possible.
