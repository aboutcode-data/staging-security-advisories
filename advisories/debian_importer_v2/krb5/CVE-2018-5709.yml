  - CVE-2018-5709
summary: An issue was discovered in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.16. There is a variable
  "dbentry->n_key_data" in kadmin/dbutil/dump.c that can store 16-bit data but unknowingly the
  developer has assigned a "u4" variable to it, which is for 32-bit data. An attacker can use
  this vulnerability to affect other artifacts of the database as we know that a Kerberos database
  dump file contains trusted data.
