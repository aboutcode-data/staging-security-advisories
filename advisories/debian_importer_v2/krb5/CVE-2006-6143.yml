summary: The RPC library in Kerberos 5 1.4 through 1.4.4, and 1.5 through 1.5.1, as used in
  Kerberos administration daemon (kadmind) and other products that use this library, calls an
  uninitialized function pointer in freed memory, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
  of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.
