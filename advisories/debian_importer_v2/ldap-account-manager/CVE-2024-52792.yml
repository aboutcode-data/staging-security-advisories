  - CVE-2024-52792
summary: 'LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a php webfrontend for managing entries (e.g. users,
  groups, DHCP settings) stored in an LDAP directory. In affected versions LAM does not properly
  sanitize configuration values, that are set via `mainmanage.php` and `confmain.php`. This
  allows setting arbitrary config values and thus effectively bypassing `mitigation` of CVE-2024-23333/GHSA-fm9w-7m7v-wxqv.
  Configuration values for the main config or server profiles are set via `mainmanage.php` and
  `confmain.php`. The values are written to `config.cfg` or `serverprofile.conf` in the format
  of `settingsName: settingsValue` line-by-line. An attacker can smuggle arbitrary config values
  in a config file, by inserting a newline into certain config fields, followed by the value.
  This vulnerability has been addressed in version 9.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There
  are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.'
