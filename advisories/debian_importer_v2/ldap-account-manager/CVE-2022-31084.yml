  - CVE-2022-31084
summary: LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g. users, groups,
  DHCP settings) stored in an LDAP directory. In versions prior to 8.0 There are cases where
  LAM instantiates objects from arbitrary classes. An attacker can inject the first constructor
  argument. This can lead to code execution if non-LAM classes are instantiated that execute
  code during object creation. This issue has been fixed in version 8.0.
