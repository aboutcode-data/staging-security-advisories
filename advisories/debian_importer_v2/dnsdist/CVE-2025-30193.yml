  - CVE-2025-30193
summary: 'In some circumstances, when DNSdist is configured to allow an unlimited number of
  queries on a single, incoming TCP connection from a client, an attacker can cause a denial
  of service by crafting a TCP exchange that triggers an exhaustion of the stack and a crash
  of DNSdist, causing a denial of service.  The remedy is: upgrade to the patched 1.9.10 version.  A
  workaround is to restrict the maximum number of queries on incoming TCP connections to a safe
  value, like 50, via the setMaxTCPQueriesPerConnection setting.  We would like to thank Renaud
  Allard for bringing this issue to our attention.'
