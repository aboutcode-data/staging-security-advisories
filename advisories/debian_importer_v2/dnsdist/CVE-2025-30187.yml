aliases:
  - CVE-2025-30187
summary: In some circumstances, when DNSdist is configured to use the nghttp2 library to process
  incoming DNS over HTTPS queries, an attacker might be able to cause a denial of service by
  crafting a DoH exchange that triggers an unbounded I/O read loop, causing an unexpected consumption
  of CPU resources.
