aliases:
  - CVE-2016-7069
summary: An issue has been found in dnsdist before 1.2.0 in the way EDNS0 OPT records are handled
  when parsing responses from a backend. When dnsdist is configured to add EDNS Client Subnet
  to a query, the response may contain an EDNS0 OPT record that has to be removed before forwarding
  the response to the initial client. On a 32-bit system, the pointer arithmetic used when parsing
  the received response to remove that record might trigger an undefined behavior leading to
  a crash.
