  - CVE-2025-69873
summary: 'ajv (Another JSON Schema Validator) through version 8.17.1 is vulnerable to Regular
  Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) when the $data option is enabled. The pattern keyword
  accepts runtime data via JSON Pointer syntax ($data reference), which is passed directly to
  the JavaScript RegExp() constructor without validation. An attacker can inject a malicious
  regex pattern (e.g., "^(a|a)*$") combined with crafted input to cause catastrophic backtracking.
  A 31-character payload causes approximately 44 seconds of CPU blocking, with each additional
  character doubling execution time. This enables complete denial of service with a single HTTP
  request against any API using ajv with $data: true for dynamic schema validation.'
