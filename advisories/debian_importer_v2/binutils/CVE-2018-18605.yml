  - CVE-2018-18605
summary: A heap-based buffer over-read issue was discovered in the function sec_merge_hash_lookup
  in merge.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU
  Binutils 2.31, because _bfd_add_merge_section mishandles section merges when size is not a
  multiple of entsize. A specially crafted ELF allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
  service, as demonstrated by ld.
