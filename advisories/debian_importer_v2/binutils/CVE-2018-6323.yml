  - CVE-2018-6323
summary: The elf_object_p function in elfcode.h in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library
  (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.29.1, has an unsigned integer overflow because
  bfd_size_type multiplication is not used. A crafted ELF file allows remote attackers to cause
  a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact.
