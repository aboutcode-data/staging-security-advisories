summary: The assign_file_positions_for_non_load_sections function in elf.c in the Binary File
  Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.30, allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via
  an ELF file with a RELRO segment that lacks a matching LOAD segment, as demonstrated by objcopy.
