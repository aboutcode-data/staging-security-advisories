aliases:
  - CVE-2018-10535
summary: The ignore_section_sym function in elf.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library
  (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.30, does not validate the output_section pointer
  in the case of a symtab entry with a "SECTION" type that has a "0" value, which allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via
  a crafted file, as demonstrated by objcopy.
