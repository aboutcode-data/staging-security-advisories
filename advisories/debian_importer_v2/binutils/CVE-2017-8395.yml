aliases:
  - CVE-2017-8395
summary: The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils
  2.28, is vulnerable to an invalid write of size 8 because of missing a malloc() return-value
  check to see if memory had actually been allocated in the _bfd_generic_get_section_contents
  function. This vulnerability causes programs that conduct an analysis of binary programs using
  the libbfd library, such as objcopy, to crash.
