  - CVE-2017-15022
summary: dwarf2.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in
  GNU Binutils 2.29, does not validate the DW_AT_name data type, which allows remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service (bfd_hash_hash NULL pointer dereference, or out-of-bounds access,
  and application crash) via a crafted ELF file, related to scan_unit_for_symbols and parse_comp_unit.
