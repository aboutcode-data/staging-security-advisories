  - CVE-2006-0646
summary: ld in SUSE Linux 9.1 through 10.0, and SLES 9, in certain circumstances when linking
  binaries, can leave an empty RPATH or RUNPATH, which allows local attackers to execute arbitrary
  code as other users via by running an ld-linked application from the current directory, which
  could contain an attacker-controlled library file.
