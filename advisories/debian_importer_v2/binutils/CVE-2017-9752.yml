  - CVE-2017-9752
summary: bfd/vms-alpha.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed
  in GNU Binutils 2.28, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow
  and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted binary file,
  as demonstrated by mishandling of this file in the _bfd_vms_get_value and _bfd_vms_slurp_etir
  functions during "objdump -D" execution.
