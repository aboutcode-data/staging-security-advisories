aliases:
  - CVE-2017-14745
summary: The *_get_synthetic_symtab functions in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka
  libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.29, interpret a -1 value as a sorting count instead
  of an error flag, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (integer overflow
  and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted ELF file, related
  to elf32-i386.c and elf64-x86-64.c.
