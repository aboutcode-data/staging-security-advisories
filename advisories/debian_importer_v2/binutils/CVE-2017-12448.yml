aliases:
  - CVE-2017-12448
summary: The bfd_cache_close function in bfd/cache.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library
  (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.29 and earlier, allows remote attackers to
  cause a heap use after free and possibly achieve code execution via a crafted nested archive
  file. This issue occurs because incorrect functions are called during an attempt to release
  memory. The issue can be addressed by better input validation in the bfd_generic_archive_p
  function in bfd/archive.c.
