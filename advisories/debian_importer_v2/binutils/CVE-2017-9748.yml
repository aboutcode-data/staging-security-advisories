  - CVE-2017-9748
summary: 'The ieee_object_p function in bfd/ieee.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library
  (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, might allow remote attackers to cause a
  denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other
  impact via a crafted binary file, as demonstrated by mishandling of this file during "objdump
  -D" execution. NOTE: this may be related to a compiler bug.'
