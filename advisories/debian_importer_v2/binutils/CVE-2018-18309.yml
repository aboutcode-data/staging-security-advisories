  - CVE-2018-18309
summary: An issue was discovered in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as
  distributed in GNU Binutils 2.31. An invalid memory address dereference was discovered in
  read_reloc in reloc.c. The vulnerability causes a segmentation fault and application crash,
  which leads to denial of service, as demonstrated by objdump, because of missing _bfd_clear_contents
  bounds checking.
