aliases:
  - CVE-2017-14729
summary: The *_get_synthetic_symtab functions in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka
  libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.29, do not ensure a unique PLT entry for a symbol,
  which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow and
  application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted ELF file, related
  to elf32-i386.c and elf64-x86-64.c.
