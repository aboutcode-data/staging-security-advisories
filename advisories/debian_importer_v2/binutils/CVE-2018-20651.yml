  - CVE-2018-20651
summary: A NULL pointer dereference was discovered in elf_link_add_object_symbols in elflink.c
  in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.31.1.
  This occurs for a crafted ET_DYN with no program headers. A specially crafted ELF file allows
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service, as demonstrated by ld.
