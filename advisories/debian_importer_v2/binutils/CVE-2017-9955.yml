  - CVE-2017-9955
summary: The get_build_id function in opncls.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka
  libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
  service (heap-based buffer over-read and application crash) via a crafted file in which a
  certain size field is larger than a corresponding data field, as demonstrated by mishandling
  within the objdump program.
