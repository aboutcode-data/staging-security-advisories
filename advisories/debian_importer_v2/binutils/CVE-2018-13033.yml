  - CVE-2018-13033
summary: The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils
  2.30, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (excessive memory allocation and
  application crash) via a crafted ELF file, as demonstrated by _bfd_elf_parse_attributes in
  elf-attrs.c and bfd_malloc in libbfd.c. This can occur during execution of nm.
