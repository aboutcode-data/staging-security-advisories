summary: There is an open race window when writing output in the following utilities in GNU
  binutils version 2.35 and earlier:ar, objcopy, strip, ranlib. When these utilities are run
  as a privileged user (presumably as part of a script updating binaries across different users),
  an unprivileged user can trick these utilities into getting ownership of arbitrary files through
  a symlink.
