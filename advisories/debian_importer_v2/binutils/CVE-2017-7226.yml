aliases:
  - CVE-2017-7226
summary: The pe_ILF_object_p function in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd),
  as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer over-read of size
  4049 because it uses the strlen function instead of strnlen, leading to program crashes in
  several utilities such as addr2line, size, and strings. It could lead to information disclosure
  as well.
