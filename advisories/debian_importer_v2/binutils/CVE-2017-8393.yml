aliases:
  - CVE-2017-8393
summary: The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils
  2.28, is vulnerable to a global buffer over-read error because of an assumption made by code
  that runs for objcopy and strip, that SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections are always named starting
  with a .rel/.rela prefix. This vulnerability causes programs that conduct an analysis of binary
  programs using the libbfd library, such as objcopy and strip, to crash.
