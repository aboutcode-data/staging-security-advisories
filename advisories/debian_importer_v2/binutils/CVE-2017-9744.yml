  - CVE-2017-9744
summary: The sh_elf_set_mach_from_flags function in bfd/elf32-sh.c in the Binary File Descriptor
  (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, allows remote attackers to
  cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified
  other impact via a crafted binary file, as demonstrated by mishandling of this file during
  "objdump -D" execution.
