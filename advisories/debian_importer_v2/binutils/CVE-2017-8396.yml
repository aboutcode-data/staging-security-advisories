aliases:
  - CVE-2017-8396
summary: The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils
  2.28, is vulnerable to an invalid read of size 1 because the existing reloc offset range tests
  didn't catch small negative offsets less than the size of the reloc field. This vulnerability
  causes programs that conduct an analysis of binary programs using the libbfd library, such
  as objdump, to crash.
