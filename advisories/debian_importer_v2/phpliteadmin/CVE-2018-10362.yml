  - CVE-2018-10362
summary: An issue was discovered in phpLiteAdmin 1.9.5 through 1.9.7.1. Due to loose comparison
  with '==' instead of '===' in classes/Authorization.php for the user-provided login password,
  it is possible to login with a simpler password if the password has the form of a power in
  scientific notation (like '2e2' for '200' or '0e1234' for '0'). This is possible because,
  in the loose comparison case, PHP interprets the string as a number in scientific notation,
  and thus converts it to a number. After that, the comparison with '==' casts the user input
  (e.g., the string '200' or '0') to a number, too. Hence the attacker can login with just a
  '0' or a simple number he has to brute force. Strong comparison with '===' prevents the cast
  into numbers.
