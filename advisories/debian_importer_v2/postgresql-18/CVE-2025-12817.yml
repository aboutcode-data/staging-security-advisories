summary: Missing authorization in PostgreSQL CREATE STATISTICS command allows a table owner
  to achieve denial of service against other CREATE STATISTICS users by creating in any schema.  A
  later CREATE STATISTICS for the same name, from a user having the CREATE privilege, would
  then fail.  Versions before PostgreSQL 18.1, 17.7, 16.11, 15.15, 14.20, and 13.23 are affected.
