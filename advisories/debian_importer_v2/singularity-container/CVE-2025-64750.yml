  - CVE-2025-64750
summary: SingularityCE and SingularityPRO are open source container platforms. Prior to SingularityCE
  4.3.5 and SingularityPRO 4.1.11 and 4.3.5, if a user relies on LSM restrictions to prevent
  malicious operations then, under certain circumstances, an attacker can redirect the LSM label
  write operation so that it is ineffective. The attacker must cause the user to run a malicious
  container image that redirects the mount of /proc to the destination of a shared mount, either
  known to be configured on the target system, or that will be specified by the user when running
  the container. The attacker must also control the content of the shared mount, for example
  through another malicious container which also binds it, or as a user with relevant permissions
  on the host system it is bound from. This vulnerability is fixed in SingularityCE 4.3.5 and
  SingularityPRO 4.1.11 and 4.3.5.
