summary: Singularity (an open source container platform) from version 3.1.1 through 3.6.3 has
  a vulnerability. Due to insecure handling of path traversal and the lack of path sanitization
  within `unsquashfs`, it is possible to overwrite/create any files on the host filesystem during
  the extraction with a crafted squashfs filesystem. The extraction occurs automatically for
  unprivileged (either installation or with `allow setuid = no`) run of Singularity when a user
  attempt to run an image which is a local SIF image or a single file containing a squashfs
  filesystem and is coming from remote sources `library://` or `shub://`. Image build is also
  impacted in a more serious way as it can be used by a root user, allowing an attacker to overwrite/create
  files leading to a system compromise, so far bootstrap methods `library`, `shub` and `localimage`
  are triggering the squashfs extraction. This issue is addressed in Singularity 3.6.4. All
  users are advised to upgrade to 3.6.4 especially if they use Singularity mainly for building
  image as root user. There is no solid workaround except to temporary avoid to use unprivileged
  mode with single file images in favor of sandbox images instead. Regarding image build, temporary
  avoid to build from `library` and `shub` sources and as much as possible use `--fakeroot`
  or a VM for that.
