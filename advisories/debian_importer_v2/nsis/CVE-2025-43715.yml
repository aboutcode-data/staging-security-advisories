aliases:
  - CVE-2025-43715
summary: Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) before 3.11 on Windows allows local users
  to escalate privileges to SYSTEM during an installation, because the temporary plugins directory
  is created under %WINDIR%\temp and unprivileged users can place a crafted executable file
  by winning a race condition. This occurs because EW_CREATEDIR does not always set the CreateRestrictedDirectory
  error flag.
