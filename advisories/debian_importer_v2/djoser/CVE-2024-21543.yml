aliases:
  - CVE-2024-21543
summary: Versions of the package djoser before 2.3.0 are vulnerable to Authentication Bypass
  when the authenticate() function fails. This is because the system falls back to querying
  the database directly, granting access to users with valid credentials, and eventually bypassing
  custom authentication checks such as two-factor authentication, LDAP validations, or requirements
  from configured AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS.
