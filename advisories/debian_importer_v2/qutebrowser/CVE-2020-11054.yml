summary: In qutebrowser versions less than 1.11.1, reloading a page with certificate errors
  shows a green URL. After a certificate error was overridden by the user, qutebrowser displays
  the URL as yellow (colors.statusbar.url.warn.fg). However, when the affected website was subsequently
  loaded again, the URL was mistakenly displayed as green (colors.statusbar.url.success_https).
  While the user already has seen a certificate error prompt at this point (or set content.ssl_strict
  to false, which is not recommended), this could still provide a false sense of security. This
  has been fixed in 1.11.1 and 1.12.0. All versions of qutebrowser are believed to be affected,
  though versions before v0.11.x couldn't be tested. Backported patches for older versions (greater
  than or equal to 1.4.0 and less than or equal to 1.10.2) are available, but no further releases
  are planned.
