summary: Samba 3.x and 4.x before 4.1.22, 4.2.x before 4.2.7, and 4.3.x before 4.3.3 supports
  connections that are encrypted but unsigned, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to conduct
  encrypted-to-unencrypted downgrade attacks by modifying the client-server data stream, related
  to clidfs.c, libsmb_server.c, and smbXcli_base.c.
