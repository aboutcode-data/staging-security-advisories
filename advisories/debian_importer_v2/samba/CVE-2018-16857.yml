aliases:
  - CVE-2018-16857
summary: Samba from version 4.9.0 and before version 4.9.3 that have AD DC configurations watching
  for bad passwords (to restrict brute forcing of passwords) in a window of more than 3 minutes
  may not watch for bad passwords at all. The primary risk from this issue is with regards to
  domains that have been upgraded from Samba 4.8 and earlier. In these cases the manual testing
  done to confirm an organisation's password policies apply as expected may not have been re-done
  after the upgrade.
