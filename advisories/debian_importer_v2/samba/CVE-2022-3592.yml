  - CVE-2022-3592
summary: A symlink following vulnerability was found in Samba, where a user can create a symbolic
  link that will make 'smbd' escape the configured share path. This flaw allows a remote user
  with access to the exported part of the file system under a share via SMB1 unix extensions
  or NFS to create symlinks to files outside the 'smbd' configured share path and gain access
  to another restricted server's filesystem.
