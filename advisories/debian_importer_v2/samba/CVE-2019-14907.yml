aliases:
  - CVE-2019-14907
summary: All samba versions 4.9.x before 4.9.18, 4.10.x before 4.10.12 and 4.11.x before 4.11.5
  have an issue where if it is set with "log level = 3" (or above) then the string obtained
  from the client, after a failed character conversion, is printed. Such strings can be provided
  during the NTLMSSP authentication exchange. In the Samba AD DC in particular, this may cause
  a long-lived process(such as the RPC server) to terminate. (In the file server case, the most
  likely target, smbd, operates as process-per-client and so a crash there is harmless).
