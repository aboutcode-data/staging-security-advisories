  - CVE-2018-16853
summary: Samba from version 4.7.0 has a vulnerability that allows a user in a Samba AD domain
  to crash the KDC when Samba is built in the non-default MIT Kerberos configuration. With this
  advisory the Samba Team clarify that the MIT Kerberos build of the Samba AD DC is considered
  experimental. Therefore the Samba Team will not issue security patches for this configuration.
  Additionally, Samba 4.7.12, 4.8.7 and 4.9.3 have been issued as security releases to prevent
  building of the AD DC with MIT Kerberos unless --with-experimental-mit-ad-dc is specified
  to the configure command.
