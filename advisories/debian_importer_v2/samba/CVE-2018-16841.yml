  - CVE-2018-16841
summary: Samba from version 4.3.0 and before versions 4.7.12, 4.8.7 and 4.9.3 are vulnerable
  to a denial of service. When configured to accept smart-card authentication, Samba's KDC will
  call talloc_free() twice on the same memory if the principal in a validly signed certificate
  does not match the principal in the AS-REQ. This is only possible after authentication with
  a trusted certificate. talloc is robust against further corruption from a double-free with
  talloc_free() and directly calls abort(), terminating the KDC process.
