  - CVE-2018-16851
summary: Samba from version 4.0.0 and before versions 4.7.12, 4.8.7, 4.9.3 is vulnerable to
  a denial of service. During the processing of an LDAP search before Samba's AD DC returns
  the LDAP entries to the client, the entries are cached in a single memory object with a maximum
  size of 256MB. When this size is reached, the Samba process providing the LDAP service will
  follow the NULL pointer, terminating the process. There is no further vulnerability associated
  with this issue, merely a denial of service.
