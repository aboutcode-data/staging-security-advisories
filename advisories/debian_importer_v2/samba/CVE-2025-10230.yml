  - CVE-2025-10230
summary: 'A flaw was found in Samba, in the front-end WINS hook handling: NetBIOS names from
  registration packets are passed to a shell without proper validation or escaping. Unsanitized
  NetBIOS name data from WINS registration packets are inserted into a shell command and executed
  by the Samba Active Directory Domain Controller’s wins hook, allowing an unauthenticated network
  attacker to achieve remote command execution as the Samba process.'
