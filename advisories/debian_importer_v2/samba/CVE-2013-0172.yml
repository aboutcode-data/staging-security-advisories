  - CVE-2013-0172
summary: Samba 4.0.x before 4.0.1, in certain Active Directory domain-controller configurations,
  does not properly interpret Access Control Entries that are based on an objectClass, which
  allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended restrictions on modifying LDAP directory
  objects by leveraging (1) objectClass access by a user, (2) objectClass access by a group,
  or (3) write access to an attribute.
