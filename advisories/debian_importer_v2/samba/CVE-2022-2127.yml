aliases:
  - CVE-2022-2127
summary: An out-of-bounds read vulnerability was found in Samba due to insufficient length checks
  in winbindd_pam_auth_crap.c. When performing NTLM authentication, the client replies to cryptographic
  challenges back to the server. These replies have variable lengths, and Winbind fails to check
  the lan manager response length. When Winbind is used for NTLM authentication, a maliciously
  crafted request can trigger an out-of-bounds read in Winbind, possibly resulting in a crash.
