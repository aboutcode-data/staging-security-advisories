  - CVE-2023-34967
summary: A Type Confusion vulnerability was found in Samba's mdssvc RPC service for Spotlight.
  When parsing Spotlight mdssvc RPC packets, one encoded data structure is a key-value style
  dictionary where the keys are character strings, and the values can be any of the supported
  types in the mdssvc protocol. Due to a lack of type checking in callers of the dalloc_value_for_key()
  function, which returns the object associated with a key, a caller may trigger a crash in
  talloc_get_size() when talloc detects that the passed-in pointer is not a valid talloc pointer.
  With an RPC worker process shared among multiple client connections, a malicious client or
  attacker can trigger a process crash in a shared RPC mdssvc worker process, affecting all
  other clients this worker serves.
