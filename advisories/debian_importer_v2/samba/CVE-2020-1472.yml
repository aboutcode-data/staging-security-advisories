aliases:
  - CVE-2020-1472
summary: An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when an attacker establishes a vulnerable
  Netlogon secure channel connection to a domain controller, using the Netlogon Remote Protocol
  (MS-NRPC). An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run a specially
  crafted application on a device on the network. To exploit the vulnerability, an unauthenticated
  attacker would be required to use MS-NRPC to connect to a domain controller to obtain domain
  administrator access. Microsoft is addressing the vulnerability in a phased two-part rollout.
  These updates address the vulnerability by modifying how Netlogon handles the usage of Netlogon
  secure channels. For guidelines on how to manage the changes required for this vulnerability
  and more information on the phased rollout, see  How to manage the changes in Netlogon secure
  channel connections associated with CVE-2020-1472 (updated September 28, 2020). When the second
  phase of Windows updates become available in Q1 2021, customers will be notified via a revision
  to this security vulnerability. If you wish to be notified when these updates are released,
  we recommend that you register for the security notifications mailer to be alerted of content
  changes to this advisory. See Microsoft Technical Security Notifications.
