  - CVE-2017-11103
summary: 'Heimdal before 7.4 allows remote attackers to impersonate services with Orpheus''
  Lyre attacks because it obtains service-principal names in a way that violates the Kerberos
  5 protocol specification. In _krb5_extract_ticket() the KDC-REP service name must be obtained
  from the encrypted version stored in ''enc_part'' instead of the unencrypted version stored
  in ''ticket''. Use of the unencrypted version provides an opportunity for successful server
  impersonation and other attacks. NOTE: this CVE is only for Heimdal and other products that
  embed Heimdal code; it does not apply to other instances in which this part of the Kerberos
  5 protocol specification is violated.'
