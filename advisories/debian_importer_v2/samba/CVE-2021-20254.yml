aliases:
  - CVE-2021-20254
summary: A flaw was found in samba. The Samba smbd file server must map Windows group identities
  (SIDs) into unix group ids (gids). The code that performs this had a flaw that could allow
  it to read data beyond the end of the array in the case where a negative cache entry had been
  added to the mapping cache. This could cause the calling code to return those values into
  the process token that stores the group membership for a user. The highest threat from this
  vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.
