  - CVE-2023-3961
summary: A path traversal vulnerability was identified in Samba when processing client pipe
  names connecting to Unix domain sockets within a private directory. Samba typically uses this
  mechanism to connect SMB clients to remote procedure call (RPC) services like SAMR LSA or
  SPOOLSS, which Samba initiates on demand. However, due to inadequate sanitization of incoming
  client pipe names, allowing a client to send a pipe name containing Unix directory traversal
  characters (../). This could result in SMB clients connecting as root to Unix domain sockets
  outside the private directory. If an attacker or client managed to send a pipe name resolving
  to an external service using an existing Unix domain socket, it could potentially lead to
  unauthorized access to the service and consequential adverse events, including compromise
  or service crashes.
