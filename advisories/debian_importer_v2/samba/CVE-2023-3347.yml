aliases:
  - CVE-2023-3347
summary: A vulnerability was found in Samba's SMB2 packet signing mechanism. The SMB2 packet
  signing is not enforced if an admin configured "server signing = required" or for SMB2 connections
  to Domain Controllers where SMB2 packet signing is mandatory. This flaw allows an attacker
  to perform attacks, such as a man-in-the-middle attack, by intercepting the network traffic
  and modifying the SMB2 messages between client and server, affecting the integrity of the
  data.
