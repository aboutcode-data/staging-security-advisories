  - CVE-2022-42898
summary: PAC parsing in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.19.4 and 1.20.x before 1.20.1 has
  integer overflows that may lead to remote code execution (in KDC, kadmind, or a GSS or Kerberos
  application server) on 32-bit platforms (which have a resultant heap-based buffer overflow),
  and cause a denial of service on other platforms. This occurs in krb5_pac_parse in lib/krb5/krb/pac.c.
  Heimdal before 7.7.1 has "a similar bug."
