aliases:
  - CVE-2023-4091
summary: A vulnerability was discovered in Samba, where the flaw allows SMB clients to truncate
  files, even with read-only permissions when the Samba VFS module "acl_xattr" is configured
  with "acl_xattr:ignore system acls = yes". The SMB protocol allows opening files when the
  client requests read-only access but then implicitly truncates the opened file to 0 bytes
  if the client specifies a separate OVERWRITE create disposition request. The issue arises
  in configurations that bypass kernel file system permissions checks, relying solely on Samba's
  permissions.
