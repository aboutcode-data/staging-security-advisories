aliases:
  - CVE-2022-3437
summary: A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in Samba within the GSSAPI unwrap_des()
  and unwrap_des3() routines of Heimdal. The DES and Triple-DES decryption routines in the Heimdal
  GSSAPI library allow a length-limited write buffer overflow on malloc() allocated memory when
  presented with a maliciously small packet. This flaw allows a remote user to send specially
  crafted malicious data to the application, possibly resulting in a denial of service (DoS)
  attack.
