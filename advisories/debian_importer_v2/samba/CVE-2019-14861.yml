  - CVE-2019-14861
summary: All Samba versions 4.x.x before 4.9.17, 4.10.x before 4.10.11 and 4.11.x before 4.11.3
  have an issue, where the (poorly named) dnsserver RPC pipe provides administrative facilities
  to modify DNS records and zones. Samba, when acting as an AD DC, stores DNS records in LDAP.
  In AD, the default permissions on the DNS partition allow creation of new records by authenticated
  users. This is used for example to allow machines to self-register in DNS. If a DNS record
  was created that case-insensitively matched the name of the zone, the ldb_qsort() and dns_name_compare()
  routines could be confused into reading memory prior to the list of DNS entries when responding
  to DnssrvEnumRecords() or DnssrvEnumRecords2() and so following invalid memory as a pointer.
