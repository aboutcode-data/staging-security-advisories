  - CVE-2023-34966
summary: An infinite loop vulnerability was found in Samba's mdssvc RPC service for Spotlight.
  When parsing Spotlight mdssvc RPC packets sent by the client, the core unmarshalling function
  sl_unpack_loop() did not validate a field in the network packet that contains the count of
  elements in an array-like structure. By passing 0 as the count value, the attacked function
  will run in an endless loop consuming 100% CPU. This flaw allows an attacker to issue a malformed
  RPC request, triggering an infinite loop, resulting in a denial of service condition.
