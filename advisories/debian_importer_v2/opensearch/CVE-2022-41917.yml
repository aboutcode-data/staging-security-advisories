summary: OpenSearch is a community-driven, open source fork of Elasticsearch and Kibana. OpenSearch
  allows users to specify a local file when defining text analyzers to process data for text
  analysis. An issue in the implementation of this feature allows certain specially crafted
  queries to return a response containing the first line of text from arbitrary files. The list
  of potentially impacted files is limited to text files with read permissions allowed in the
  Java Security Manager policy configuration. OpenSearch version 1.3.7 and 2.4.0 contain a fix
  for this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
