  - CVE-2024-25617
summary: Squid is an open source caching proxy for the Web supporting HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and
  more. Due to a Collapse of Data into Unsafe Value bug ,Squid may be vulnerable to a Denial
  of Service attack against HTTP header parsing. This problem allows a remote client or a remote
  server to perform Denial of Service when sending oversized headers in HTTP messages. In versions
  of Squid prior to 6.5 this can be achieved if the request_header_max_size or reply_header_max_size
  settings are unchanged from the default. In Squid version 6.5 and later, the default setting
  of these parameters is safe. Squid will emit a critical warning in cache.log if the administrator
  is setting these parameters to unsafe values. Squid will not at this time prevent these settings
  from being changed to unsafe values. Users are advised to upgrade to version 6.5. There are
  no known workarounds for this vulnerability. This issue is also tracked as SQUID-2024:2
