  - CVE-2019-12519
summary: An issue was discovered in Squid through 4.7. When handling the tag esi:when when ESI
  is enabled, Squid calls ESIExpression::Evaluate. This function uses a fixed stack buffer to
  hold the expression while it's being evaluated. When processing the expression, it could either
  evaluate the top of the stack, or add a new member to the stack. When adding a new member,
  there is no check to ensure that the stack won't overflow.
