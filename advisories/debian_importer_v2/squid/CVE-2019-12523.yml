  - CVE-2019-12523
summary: An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.9. When handling a URN request, a corresponding
  HTTP request is made. This HTTP request doesn't go through the access checks that incoming
  HTTP requests go through. This causes all access checks to be bypassed and allows access to
  restricted HTTP servers, e.g., an attacker can connect to HTTP servers that only listen on
  localhost.
