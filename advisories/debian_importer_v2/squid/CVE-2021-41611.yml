summary: An issue was discovered in Squid 5.0.6 through 5.1.x before 5.2. When validating an
  origin server or peer certificate, Squid may incorrectly classify certain certificates as
  trusted. This problem allows a remote server to obtain security trust well improperly. This
  indication of trust may be passed along to clients, allowing access to unsafe or hijacked
  services.
