summary: Squid is a caching proxy for the Web. Due to an Uncontrolled Recursion bug in versions
  2.6 through 2.7.STABLE9, versions 3.1 through 5.9, and versions 6.0.1 through 6.5, Squid may
  be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against HTTP Request parsing. This problem allows
  a remote client to perform Denial of Service attack by sending a large X-Forwarded-For header
  when the follow_x_forwarded_for feature is configured. This bug is fixed by Squid version
  6.6. In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable releases can be found in
  Squid's patch archives.
