summary: An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.13 and 5.x before 5.0.4. Due to incorrect
  data validation, HTTP Request Smuggling attacks may succeed against HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
  This leads to cache poisoning. This allows any client, including browser scripts, to bypass
  local security and poison the proxy cache and any downstream caches with content from an arbitrary
  source. When configured for relaxed header parsing (the default), Squid relays headers containing
  whitespace characters to upstream servers. When this occurs as a prefix to a Content-Length
  header, the frame length specified will be ignored by Squid (allowing for a conflicting length
  to be used from another Content-Length header) but relayed upstream.
