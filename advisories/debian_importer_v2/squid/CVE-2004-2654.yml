  - CVE-2004-2654
summary: 'The clientAbortBody function in client_side.c in Squid Web Proxy Cache before 2.6
  STABLE6 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via unspecified
  vectors that trigger a null dereference.  NOTE: in a followup advisory, a researcher claimed
  that the issue was a buffer overflow that was not fixed in STABLE6. However, the vendor''s
  bug report clearly shows that the researcher later retracted this claim, because the tested
  product was actually STABLE5.'
