  - CVE-2019-12522
summary: An issue was discovered in Squid through 4.7. When Squid is run as root, it spawns
  its child processes as a lesser user, by default the user nobody. This is done via the leave_suid
  call. leave_suid leaves the Saved UID as 0. This makes it trivial for an attacker who has
  compromised the child process to escalate their privileges back to root.
