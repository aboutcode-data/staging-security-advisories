  - CVE-2020-11945
summary: An issue was discovered in Squid before 5.0.2. A remote attacker can replay a sniffed
  Digest Authentication nonce to gain access to resources that are otherwise forbidden. This
  occurs because the attacker can overflow the nonce reference counter (a short integer). Remote
  code execution may occur if the pooled token credentials are freed (instead of replayed as
  valid credentials).
