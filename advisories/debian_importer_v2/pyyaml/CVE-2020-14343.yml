aliases:
  - CVE-2020-14343
summary: A vulnerability was discovered in the PyYAML library in versions before 5.4, where
  it is susceptible to arbitrary code execution when it processes untrusted YAML files through
  the full_load method or with the FullLoader loader. Applications that use the library to process
  untrusted input may be vulnerable to this flaw. This flaw allows an attacker to execute arbitrary
  code on the system by abusing the python/object/new constructor. This flaw is due to an incomplete
  fix for CVE-2020-1747.
