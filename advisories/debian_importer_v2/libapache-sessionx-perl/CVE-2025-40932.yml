  - CVE-2025-40932
summary: Apache::SessionX versions through 2.01 for Perl create insecure session id.  Apache::SessionX
  generates session ids insecurely. The default session id generator in Apache::SessionX::Generate::MD5
  returns a MD5 hash seeded with the built-in rand() function, the epoch time, and the PID.
  The PID will come from a small set of numbers, and the epoch time may be guessed, if it is
  not leaked from the HTTP Date header. The built-in rand function is unsuitable for cryptographic
  usage. Predicable session ids could allow an attacker to gain access to systems.
