  - CVE-2024-27289
summary: 'pgx is a PostgreSQL driver and toolkit for Go. Prior to version 4.18.2, SQL injection
  can occur when all of the following conditions are met: the non-default simple protocol is
  used; a placeholder for a numeric value must be immediately preceded by a minus; there must
  be a second placeholder for a string value after the first placeholder; both must be on the
  same line; and both parameter values must be user-controlled. The problem is resolved in v4.18.2.
  As a workaround, do not use the simple protocol or do not place a minus directly before a
  placeholder.'
