summary: 'Issue summary: A timing side-channel which could potentially allow recovering the
  private key exists in the ECDSA signature computation.  Impact summary: A timing side-channel
  in ECDSA signature computations could allow recovering the private key by an attacker. However,
  measuring the timing would require either local access to the signing application or a very
  fast network connection with low latency.  There is a timing signal of around 300 nanoseconds
  when the top word of the inverted ECDSA nonce value is zero. This can happen with significant
  probability only for some of the supported elliptic curves. In particular the NIST P-521 curve
  is affected. To be able to measure this leak, the attacker process must either be located
  in the same physical computer or must have a very fast network connection with low latency.
  For that reason the severity of this vulnerability is Low.  The FIPS modules in 3.4, 3.3,
  3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are affected by this issue.'
