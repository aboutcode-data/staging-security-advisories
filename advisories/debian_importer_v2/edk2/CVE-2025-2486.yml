  - CVE-2025-2486
summary: The Ubuntu edk2 UEFI firmware packages accidentally allowed the UEFI Shell to be accessed
  in Secure Boot environments, possibly allowing bypass of Secure Boot constraints. Versions
  2024.05-2ubuntu0.3 and 2024.02-2ubuntu0.3 disable the Shell. Some previous versions inserted
  a secure-boot-based decision to continue running inside the Shell itself, which is believed
  to be sufficient to enforce Secure Boot restrictions. This is an additional repair on top
  of the incomplete fix for CVE-2023-48733.
