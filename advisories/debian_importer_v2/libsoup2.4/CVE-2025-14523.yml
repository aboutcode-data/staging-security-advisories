  - CVE-2025-14523
summary: 'A flaw in libsoup’s HTTP header handling allows multiple Host: headers in a request
  and returns the last occurrence for server-side processing. Common front proxies often honor
  the first Host: header, so this mismatch can cause vhost confusion where a proxy routes a
  request to one backend but the backend interprets it as destined for another host. This discrepancy
  enables request-smuggling style attacks, cache poisoning, or bypassing host-based access controls
  when an attacker supplies duplicate Host headers.'
