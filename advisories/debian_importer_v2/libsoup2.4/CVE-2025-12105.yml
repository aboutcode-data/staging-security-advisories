  - CVE-2025-12105
summary: A flaw was found in the asynchronous message queue handling of the libsoup library,
  widely used by GNOME and WebKit-based applications to manage HTTP/2 communications. When network
  operations are aborted at specific timing intervals, an internal message queue item may be
  freed twice due to missing state synchronization. This leads to a use-after-free memory access,
  potentially crashing the affected application. Attackers could exploit this behavior remotely
  by triggering specific HTTP/2 read and cancel sequences, resulting in a denial-of-service
  condition.
