  - CVE-2025-4945
summary: A flaw was found in the cookie parsing logic of the libsoup HTTP library, used in GNOME
  applications and other software. The vulnerability arises when processing the expiration date
  of cookies, where a specially crafted value can trigger an integer overflow. This may result
  in undefined behavior, allowing an attacker to bypass cookie expiration logic, causing persistent
  or unintended cookie behavior. The issue stems from improper validation of large integer inputs
  during date arithmetic operations within the cookie parsing routines.
