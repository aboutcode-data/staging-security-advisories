  - CVE-2025-4969
summary: A vulnerability was found in the libsoup package. This flaw stems from its failure
  to correctly verify the termination of multipart HTTP messages. This can allow a remote attacker
  to send a specially crafted multipart HTTP body, causing the libsoup-consuming server to read
  beyond its allocated memory boundaries (out-of-bounds read).
