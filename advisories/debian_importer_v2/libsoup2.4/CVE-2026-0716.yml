summary: A flaw was found in libsoup’s WebSocket frame processing when handling incoming messages.

  library may read memory outside the intended bounds. This can cause unintended memory exposure
  or a crash. Applications using libsoup’s WebSocket support with this configuration may be
  impacted.
