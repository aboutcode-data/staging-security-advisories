aliases:
  - CVE-2024-3651
summary: A vulnerability was identified in the kjd/idna library, specifically within the `idna.encode()`
  function, affecting version 3.6. The issue arises from the function's handling of crafted
  input strings, which can lead to quadratic complexity and consequently, a denial of service
  condition. This vulnerability is triggered by a crafted input that causes the `idna.encode()`
  function to process the input with considerable computational load, significantly increasing
  the processing time in a quadratic manner relative to the input size.
