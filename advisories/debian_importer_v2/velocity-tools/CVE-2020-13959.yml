  - CVE-2020-13959
summary: The default error page for VelocityView in Apache Velocity Tools prior to 3.1 reflects
  back the vm file that was entered as part of the URL. An attacker can set an XSS payload file
  as this vm file in the URL which results in this payload being executed. XSS vulnerabilities
  allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the attacked website and
  the attacked user. This can be abused to steal session cookies, perform requests in the name
  of the victim or for phishing attacks.
