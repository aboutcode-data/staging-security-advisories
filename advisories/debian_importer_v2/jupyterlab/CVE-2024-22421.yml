summary: JupyterLab is an extensible environment for interactive and reproducible computing,
  based on the Jupyter Notebook and Architecture. Users of JupyterLab who click on a malicious
  link may get their `Authorization` and `XSRFToken` tokens exposed to a third party when running
  an older `jupyter-server` version. JupyterLab versions 4.1.0b2, 4.0.11, and 3.6.7 are patched.
  No workaround has been identified, however users should ensure to upgrade `jupyter-server`
  to version 2.7.2 or newer which includes a redirect vulnerability fix.
