summary: JupyterLab is a user interface for Project Jupyter which will eventually replace the
  classic Jupyter Notebook. In affected versions untrusted notebook can execute code on load.
  In particular JupyterLab doesn’t sanitize the action attribute of html `<form>`. Using this
  it is possible to trigger the form validation outside of the form itself. This is a remote
  code execution, but requires user action to open a notebook.
