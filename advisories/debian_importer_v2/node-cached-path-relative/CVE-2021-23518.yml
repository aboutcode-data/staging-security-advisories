aliases:
  - CVE-2021-23518
summary: The package cached-path-relative before 1.1.0 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution
  via the cache variable that is set as {} instead of Object.create(null) in the cachedPathRelative
  function, which allows access to the parent prototype properties when the object is used to
  create the cached relative path. When using the origin path as __proto__, the attribute of
  the object is accessed instead of a path. **Note:** This vulnerability derives from an incomplete
  fix in https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-CACHEDPATHRELATIVE-72573
