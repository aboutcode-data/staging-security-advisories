summary: 'Heap-based buffer overflow in the strip_escapes function in signal.c in GNU ed before
  1.0 allows context-dependent or user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long
  filename.  NOTE: since ed itself does not typically run with special privileges, this issue
  only crosses privilege boundaries when ed is invoked as a third-party component.'
