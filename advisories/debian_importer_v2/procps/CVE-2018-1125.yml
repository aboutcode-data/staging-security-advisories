  - CVE-2018-1125
summary: procps-ng before version 3.3.15 is vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow in pgrep.
  This vulnerability is mitigated by FORTIFY, as it involves strncat() to a stack-allocated
  string. When pgrep is compiled with FORTIFY (as on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora), the
  impact is limited to a crash.
