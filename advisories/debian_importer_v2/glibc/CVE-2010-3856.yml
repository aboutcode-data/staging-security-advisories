aliases:
  - CVE-2010-3856
summary: ld.so in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.11.3, and 2.12.x before 2.12.2,
  does not properly restrict use of the LD_AUDIT environment variable to reference dynamic shared
  objects (DSOs) as audit objects, which allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging
  an unsafe DSO located in a trusted library directory, as demonstrated by libpcprofile.so.
