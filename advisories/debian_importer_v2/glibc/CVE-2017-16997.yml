  - CVE-2017-16997
summary: 'elf/dl-load.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.19 through 2.26 mishandles
  RPATH and RUNPATH containing $ORIGIN for a privileged (setuid or AT_SECURE) program, which
  allows local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse library in the current working directory,
  related to the fillin_rpath and decompose_rpath functions. This is associated with misinterpretion
  of an empty RPATH/RUNPATH token as the "./" directory. NOTE: this configuration of RPATH/RUNPATH
  for a privileged program is apparently very uncommon; most likely, no such program is shipped
  with any common Linux distribution.'
