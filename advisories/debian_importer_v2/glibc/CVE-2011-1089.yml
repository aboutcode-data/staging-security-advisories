aliases:
  - CVE-2011-1089
summary: The addmntent function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.13 and earlier does
  not report an error status for failed attempts to write to the /etc/mtab file, which makes
  it easier for local users to trigger corruption of this file, as demonstrated by writes from
  a process with a small RLIMIT_FSIZE value, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-0296.
