  - CVE-2016-10739
summary: In the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) through 2.28, the getaddrinfo function would
  successfully parse a string that contained an IPv4 address followed by whitespace and arbitrary
  characters, which could lead applications to incorrectly assume that it had parsed a valid
  string, without the possibility of embedded HTTP headers or other potentially dangerous substrings.
