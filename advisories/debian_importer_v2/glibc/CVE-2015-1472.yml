aliases:
  - CVE-2015-1472
summary: The ADDW macro in stdio-common/vfscanf.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6)
  before 2.21 does not properly consider data-type size during memory allocation, which allows
  context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow) or possibly have
  unspecified other impact via a long line containing wide characters that are improperly handled
  in a wscanf call.
