aliases:
  - CVE-2023-4527
summary: A flaw was found in glibc. When the getaddrinfo function is called with the AF_UNSPEC
  address family and the system is configured with no-aaaa mode via /etc/resolv.conf, a DNS
  response via TCP larger than 2048 bytes can potentially disclose stack contents through the
  function returned address data, and may cause a crash.
