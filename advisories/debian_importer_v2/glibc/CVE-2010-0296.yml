aliases:
  - CVE-2010-0296
summary: The encode_name macro in misc/mntent_r.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6)
  2.11.1 and earlier, as used by ncpmount and mount.cifs, does not properly handle newline characters
  in mountpoint names, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (mtab corruption),
  or possibly modify mount options and gain privileges, via a crafted mount request.
