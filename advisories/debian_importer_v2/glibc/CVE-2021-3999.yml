aliases:
  - CVE-2021-3999
summary: A flaw was found in glibc. An off-by-one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd()
  may lead to memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1. A local attacker who
  can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd() in a setuid program could use this
  flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system.
