  - CVE-2023-6779
summary: An off-by-one heap-based buffer overflow was found in the __vsyslog_internal function
  of the glibc library. This function is called by the syslog and vsyslog functions. This issue
  occurs when these functions are called with a message bigger than INT_MAX bytes, leading to
  an incorrect calculation of the buffer size to store the message, resulting in an application
  crash. This issue affects glibc 2.37 and newer.
