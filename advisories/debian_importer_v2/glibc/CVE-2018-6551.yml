aliases:
  - CVE-2018-6551
summary: The malloc implementation in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6), from version 2.24
  to 2.26 on powerpc, and only in version 2.26 on i386, did not properly handle malloc calls
  with arguments close to SIZE_MAX and could return a pointer to a heap region that is smaller
  than requested, eventually leading to heap corruption.
