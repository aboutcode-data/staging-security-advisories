aliases:
  - CVE-2021-35942
summary: The wordexp function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc) through 2.33 may crash or read
  arbitrary memory in parse_param (in posix/wordexp.c) when called with an untrusted, crafted
  pattern, potentially resulting in a denial of service or disclosure of information. This occurs
  because atoi was used but strtoul should have been used to ensure correct calculations.
