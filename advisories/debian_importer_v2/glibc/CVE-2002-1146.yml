  - CVE-2002-1146
summary: The BIND 4 and BIND 8.2.x stub resolver libraries, and other libraries such as glibc
  2.2.5 and earlier, libc, and libresolv, use the maximum buffer size instead of the actual
  size when processing a DNS response, which causes the stub resolvers to read past the actual
  boundary ("read buffer overflow"), allowing remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (crash).
