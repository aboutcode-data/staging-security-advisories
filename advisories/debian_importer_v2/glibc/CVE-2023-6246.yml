  - CVE-2023-6246
summary: A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the __vsyslog_internal function of the glibc
  library. This function is called by the syslog and vsyslog functions. This issue occurs when
  the openlog function was not called, or called with the ident argument set to NULL, and the
  program name (the basename of argv[0]) is bigger than 1024 bytes, resulting in an application
  crash or local privilege escalation. This issue affects glibc 2.36 and newer.
