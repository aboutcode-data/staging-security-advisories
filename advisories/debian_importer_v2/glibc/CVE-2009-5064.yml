  - CVE-2009-5064
summary: 'ldd in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.13 and earlier allows local users
  to gain privileges via a Trojan horse executable file linked with a modified loader that omits
  certain LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS checks.  NOTE: the GNU C Library vendor states "This is just
  nonsense. There are a gazillion other ways to introduce code if people are downloading arbitrary
  binaries and install them in appropriate directories or set LD_LIBRARY_PATH etc.'
