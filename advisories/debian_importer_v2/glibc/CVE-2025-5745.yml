aliases:
  - CVE-2025-5745
summary: The strncmp implementation optimized for the Power10 processor in the GNU C Library
  version 2.40 and later writes to vector registers v20 to v31 without saving contents from
  the caller (those registers are defined as non-volatile registers by the powerpc64le ABI),
  resulting in overwriting of its contents and potentially altering control flow of the caller,
  or leaking the input strings to the function to other parts of the program.
