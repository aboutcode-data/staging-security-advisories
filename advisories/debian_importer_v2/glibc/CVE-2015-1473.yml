aliases:
  - CVE-2015-1473
summary: The ADDW macro in stdio-common/vfscanf.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6)
  before 2.21 does not properly consider data-type size during a risk-management decision for
  use of the alloca function, which might allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial
  of service (segmentation violation) or overwrite memory locations beyond the stack boundary
  via a long line containing wide characters that are improperly handled in a wscanf call.
