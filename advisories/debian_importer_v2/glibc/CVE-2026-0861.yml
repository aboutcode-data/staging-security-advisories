  - CVE-2026-0861
summary: Passing too large an alignment to the memalign suite of functions (memalign, posix_memalign,
  aligned_alloc) in the GNU C Library version 2.30 to 2.42 may result in an integer overflow,
  which could consequently result in a heap corruption.  Note that the attacker must have control
  over both, the size as well as the alignment arguments of the memalign function to be able
  to exploit this.  The size parameter must be close enough to PTRDIFF_MAX so as to overflow
  size_t along with the large alignment argument.  This limits the malicious inputs for the
  alignment for memalign to the range [1<<62+ 1, 1<<63] and exactly 1<<63 for posix_memalign
  and aligned_alloc.  Typically the alignment argument passed to such functions is a known constrained
  quantity (e.g. page size, block size, struct sizes) and is not attacker controlled, because
  of which this may not be easily exploitable in practice.  An application bug could potentially
  result in the input alignment being too large, e.g. due to a different buffer overflow or
  integer overflow in the application or its dependent libraries, but that is again an uncommon
  usage pattern given typical sources of alignments.
