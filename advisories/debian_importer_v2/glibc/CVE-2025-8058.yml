aliases:
  - CVE-2025-8058
summary: The regcomp function in the GNU C library version from 2.4 to 2.41 is  subject to a
  double free if some previous allocation fails. It can be  accomplished either by a malloc
  failure or by using an interposed malloc  that injects random malloc failures. The double
  free can allow buffer  manipulation depending of how the regex is constructed. This issue  affects
  all architectures and ABIs supported by the GNU C library.
