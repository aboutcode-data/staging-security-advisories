aliases:
  - CVE-2017-1000366
summary: glibc contains a vulnerability that allows specially crafted LD_LIBRARY_PATH values
  to manipulate the heap/stack, causing them to alias, potentially resulting in arbitrary code
  execution. Please note that additional hardening changes have been made to glibc to prevent
  manipulation of stack and heap memory but these issues are not directly exploitable, as such
  they have not been given a CVE. This affects glibc 2.25 and earlier.
