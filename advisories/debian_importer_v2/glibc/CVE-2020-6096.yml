  - CVE-2020-6096
summary: An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7 memcpy() implementation
  of GNU glibc 2.30.9000. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7 targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation)
  with a negative value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison vulnerability.
  If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to
  undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution.
  Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution to continue in scenarios
  where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent
  execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this corrupted data.
