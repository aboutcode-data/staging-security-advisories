aliases:
  - CVE-2015-20109
summary: 'end_pattern (called from internal_fnmatch) in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6)
  before 2.22 might allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application
  crash), as demonstrated by use of the fnmatch library function with the **(!() pattern. NOTE:
  this is not the same as CVE-2015-8984; also, some Linux distributions have fixed CVE-2015-8984
  but have not fixed this additional fnmatch issue.'
