  - CVE-2012-6706
summary: A VMSF_DELTA memory corruption was discovered in unrar before 5.5.5, as used in Sophos
  Anti-Virus Threat Detection Engine before 3.37.2 and other products, that can lead to arbitrary
  code execution. An integer overflow can be caused in DataSize+CurChannel. The result is a
  negative value of the "DestPos" variable, which allows the attacker to write out of bounds
  when setting Mem[DestPos].
