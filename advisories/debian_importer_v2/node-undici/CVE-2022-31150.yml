  - CVE-2022-31150
summary: undici is an HTTP/1.1 client, written from scratch for Node.js. It is possible to inject
  CRLF sequences into request headers in undici in versions less than 5.7.1. A fix was released
  in version 5.8.0. Sanitizing all HTTP headers from untrusted sources to eliminate `\r\n` is
  a workaround for this issue.
