summary: Undici is an HTTP/1.1 client. Starting in version 4.5.0 and prior to versions 5.28.5,
  6.21.1, and 7.2.3, undici uses `Math.random()` to choose the boundary for a multipart/form-data
  request. It is known that the output of `Math.random()` can be predicted if several of its
  generated values are known. If there is a mechanism in an app that sends multipart requests
  to an attacker-controlled website, they can use this to leak the necessary values. Therefore,
  an attacker can tamper with the requests going to the backend APIs if certain conditions are
  met. This is fixed in versions 5.28.5, 6.21.1, and 7.2.3. As a workaround, do not issue multipart
  requests to attacker controlled servers.
