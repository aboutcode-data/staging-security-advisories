  - CVE-2025-47279
summary: Undici is an HTTP/1.1 client for Node.js. Prior to versions 5.29.0, 6.21.2, and 7.5.0,
  applications that use undici to implement a webhook-like system are vulnerable. If the attacker
  set up a server with an invalid certificate, and they can force the application to call the
  webhook repeatedly, then they can cause a memory leak. This has been patched in versions 5.29.0,
  6.21.2, and 7.5.0. As a workaound, avoid calling a webhook repeatedly if the webhook fails.
