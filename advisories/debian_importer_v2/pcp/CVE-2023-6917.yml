  - CVE-2023-6917
summary: A vulnerability has been identified in the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) package, stemming
  from the mixed privilege levels utilized by systemd services associated with PCP. While certain
  services operate within the confines of limited PCP user/group privileges, others are granted
  full root privileges. This disparity in privilege levels poses a risk when privileged root
  processes interact with directories or directory trees owned by unprivileged PCP users. Specifically,
  this vulnerability may lead to the compromise of PCP user isolation and facilitate local PCP-to-root
  exploits, particularly through symlink attacks. These vulnerabilities underscore the importance
  of maintaining robust privilege separation mechanisms within PCP to mitigate the potential
  for unauthorized privilege escalation.
