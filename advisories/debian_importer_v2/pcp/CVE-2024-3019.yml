  - CVE-2024-3019
summary: A flaw was found in PCP. The default pmproxy configuration exposes the Redis server
  backend to the local network, allowing remote command execution with the privileges of the
  Redis user. This issue can only be exploited when pmproxy is running. By default, pmproxy
  is not running and needs to be started manually. The pmproxy service is usually started from
  the 'Metrics settings' page of the Cockpit web interface. This flaw affects PCP versions 4.3.4
  and newer.
