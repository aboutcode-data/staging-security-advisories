aliases:
  - CVE-2022-23853
summary: The LSP (Language Server Protocol) plugin in KDE Kate before 21.12.2 and KTextEditor
  before 5.91.0 tries to execute the associated LSP server binary when opening a file of a given
  type. If this binary is absent from the PATH, it will try running the LSP server binary in
  the directory of the file that was just opened (due to a misunderstanding of the QProcess
  API, that was never intended). This can be an untrusted directory.
