  - CVE-2025-0495
summary: Buildx is a Docker CLI plugin that extends build capabilities using BuildKit.  Cache
  backends support credentials by setting secrets directly as attribute values in cache-to/cache-from configuration.
  When supplied as user input, these secure values may be inadvertently captured in OpenTelemetry
  traces as part of the arguments and flags for the traced CLI command. OpenTelemetry traces
  are also saved in BuildKit daemon's history records.   This vulnerability does not impact
  secrets passed to the Github cache backend via environment variables or registry authentication.
