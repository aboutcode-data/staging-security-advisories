summary: 'vdrleaktest in Video Disk Recorder (VDR) 1.6.0 places a zero-length directory name
  in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which allows local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse shared
  library in the current working directory.  NOTE: a third party disputes this issue because
  the script erroneously uses a semicolon in a context where a colon was intended'
