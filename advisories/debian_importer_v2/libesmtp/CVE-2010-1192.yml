  - CVE-2010-1192
summary: libESMTP, probably 1.0.4 and earlier, does not properly handle a '\0' character in
  a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) field of an X.509 certificate, which allows
  man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued
  by a legitimate Certification Authority, a related issue to CVE-2009-2408.
