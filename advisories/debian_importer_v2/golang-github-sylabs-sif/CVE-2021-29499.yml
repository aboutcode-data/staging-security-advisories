  - CVE-2021-29499
summary: SIF is an open source implementation of the Singularity Container Image Format. The
  `siftool new` command and func siftool.New() produce predictable UUID identifiers due to insecure
  randomness in the version of the `github.com/satori/go.uuid` module used as a dependency.
  A patch is available in version >= v1.2.3 of the module. Users are encouraged to upgrade.
  As a workaround, users passing CreateInfo struct should ensure the `ID` field is generated
  using a version of `github.com/satori/go.uuid` that is not vulnerable to this issue.
