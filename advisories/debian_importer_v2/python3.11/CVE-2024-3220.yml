  - CVE-2024-3220
summary: There is a defect in the CPython standard library module “mimetypes” where on Windows
  the default list of known file locations are writable meaning other users can create invalid
  files to cause MemoryError to be raised on Python runtime startup or have file extensions
  be interpreted as the incorrect file type.  This defect is caused by the default locations
  of Linux and macOS platforms (such as “/etc/mime.types”) also being used on Windows, where
  they are user-writable locations (“C:\etc\mime.types”).  To work-around this issue a user
  can call mimetypes.init() with an empty list (“[]”) on Windows platforms to avoid using the
  default list of known file locations.
