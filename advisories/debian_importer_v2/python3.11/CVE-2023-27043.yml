  - CVE-2023-27043
summary: The email module of Python through 3.11.3 incorrectly parses e-mail addresses that
  contain a special character. The wrong portion of an RFC2822 header is identified as the value
  of the addr-spec. In some applications, an attacker can bypass a protection mechanism in which
  application access is granted only after verifying receipt of e-mail to a specific domain
  (e.g., only @company.example.com addresses may be used for signup). This occurs in email/_parseaddr.py
  in recent versions of Python.
