  - CVE-2023-6507
summary: An issue was found in CPython 3.12.0 `subprocess` module on POSIX platforms. The issue
  was fixed in CPython 3.12.1 and does not affect other stable releases.  When using the `extra_groups=`
  parameter with an empty list as a value (ie `extra_groups=[]`) the logic regressed to not
  call `setgroups(0, NULL)` before calling `exec()`, thus not dropping the original processes'
  groups before starting the new process. There is no issue when the parameter isn't used or
  when any value is used besides an empty list.  This issue only impacts CPython processes run
  with sufficient privilege to make the `setgroups` system call (typically `root`).
