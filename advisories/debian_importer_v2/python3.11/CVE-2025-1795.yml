summary: During an address list folding when a separating comma ends up on a folded line and
  that line is to be unicode-encoded then the separator itself is also unicode-encoded. Expected
  behavior is that the separating comma remains a plan comma. This can result in the address
  header being misinterpreted by some mail servers.
