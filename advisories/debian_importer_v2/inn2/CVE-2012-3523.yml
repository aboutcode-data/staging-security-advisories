aliases:
  - CVE-2012-3523
summary: The STARTTLS implementation in nnrpd in INN before 2.5.3 does not properly restrict
  I/O buffering, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert commands into encrypted
  sessions by sending a cleartext command that is processed after TLS is in place, related to
  a "plaintext command injection" attack, a similar issue to CVE-2011-0411.
