  - CVE-2012-1191
summary: The resolver in dnscache in Daniel J. Bernstein djbdns 1.05 overwrites cached server
  names and TTL values in NS records during the processing of a response to an A record query,
  which allows remote attackers to trigger continued resolvability of revoked domain names via
  a "ghost domain names" attack.
