summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PCI/DOE: Fix
  destroy_work_on_stack() race  The following debug object splat was observed in testing:    ODEBUG:
  free active (active state 0) object: 0000000097d23782 object type: work_struct hint: doe_statemachine_work+0x0/0x510   WARNING:
  CPU: 1 PID: 71 at lib/debugobjects.c:514 debug_print_object+0x7d/0xb0   ...   Workqueue: pci
  0000:36:00.0 DOE [1 doe_statemachine_work   RIP: 0010:debug_print_object+0x7d/0xb0   ...   Call
  Trace:    ? debug_print_object+0x7d/0xb0    ? __pfx_doe_statemachine_work+0x10/0x10    debug_object_free.part.0+0x11b/0x150    doe_statemachine_work+0x45e/0x510    process_one_work+0x1d4/0x3c0  This
  occurs because destroy_work_on_stack() was called after signaling the completion in the calling
  thread.  This creates a race between destroy_work_on_stack() and the task->work struct going
  out of scope in pci_doe().  Signal the work complete after destroying the work struct.  This
  is safe because signal_task_complete() is the final thing the work item does and the workqueue
  code is careful not to access the work struct after.'
