summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: core: ensure
  the allocated report buffer can contain the reserved report ID  When the report ID is not

  allocated buffer not account for that extra byte, meaning that instead of having 8 guaranteed
  bytes for implement to be working, we only have 7.'
