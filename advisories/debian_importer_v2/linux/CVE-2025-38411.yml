summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfs: Fix double
  put of request  If a netfs request finishes during the pause loop, it will have the ref that
  belongs to the IN_PROGRESS flag removed at that point - however, if it then goes to the final
  wait loop, that will *also* put the ref because it sees that the IN_PROGRESS flag is clear
  and incorrectly assumes that this happened when it called the collector.  In fact, since IN_PROGRESS
  is clear, we shouldn''t call the collector again since it''s done all the cleanup, such as
  calling ->ki_complete().  Fix this by making netfs_collect_in_app() just return, indicating
  that we''re done if IN_PROGRESS is removed.'
