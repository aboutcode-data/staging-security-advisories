summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  9p: add missing
  locking around taking dentry fid list  Fix a use-after-free on dentry''s d_fsdata fid list
  when a thread looks up a fid through dentry while another thread unlinks it:  UAF thread:
  refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.  p9_fid_get linux/./include/net/9p/client.h:262  v9fs_fid_find+0x236/0x280

  linux/fs/9p/vfs_inode.c:518  vfs_unlink+0x29a/0x810 linux/fs/namei.c:4335  The problem is
  that d_fsdata was not accessed under d_lock, because d_release() normally is only called once
  the dentry is otherwise no longer accessible but since we also call it explicitly in v9fs_remove
  that lock is required: move the hlist out of the dentry under lock then unref its fids once
  they are no longer accessible.'
