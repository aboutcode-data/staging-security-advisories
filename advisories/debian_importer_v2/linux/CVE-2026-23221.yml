summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bus: fsl-mc:
  fix use-after-free in driver_override_show()  The driver_override_show() function reads the
  driver_override string without holding the device_lock. However, driver_override_store() uses
  driver_set_override(), which modifies and frees the string while holding the device_lock.  This
  can result in a concurrent use-after-free if the string is freed by the store function while
  being read by the show function.  Fix this by holding the device_lock around the read operation.'
