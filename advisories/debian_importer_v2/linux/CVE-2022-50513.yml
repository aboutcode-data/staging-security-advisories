summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  staging: rtl8723bs:
  fix a potential memory leak in rtw_init_cmd_priv()  In rtw_init_cmd_priv(), if `pcmdpriv->rsp_allocated_buf`
  is allocated in failure, then `pcmdpriv->cmd_allocated_buf` will be not properly released.
  Besides, considering there are only two error paths and the first one can directly return,
  so we do not need implicitly jump to the `exit` tag to execute the error handler.  So this
  patch added `kfree(pcmdpriv->cmd_allocated_buf);` on the error path to release the resource
  and simplified the return logic of rtw_init_cmd_priv(). As there is no proper device to test
  with, no runtime testing was performed.'
