summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  virtio-mmio:
  don''t break lifecycle of vm_dev  vm_dev has a separate lifecycle because it has a ''struct
  device'' embedded. Thus, having a release callback for it is correct.  Allocating the vm_dev
  struct with devres totally breaks this protection, though. Instead of waiting for the vm_dev
  release callback, the memory is freed when the platform_device is removed. Resulting in a
  use-after-free when finally the callback is to be called.  To easily see the problem, compile
  the kernel with CONFIG_DEBUG_KOBJECT_RELEASE and unbind with sysfs.  The fix is easy, don''t
  use devres in this case.  Found during my research about object lifetime problems.'
