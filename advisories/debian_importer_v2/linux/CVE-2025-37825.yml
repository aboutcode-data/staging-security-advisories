summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nvmet: fix out-of-bounds
  access in nvmet_enable_port  When trying to enable a port that has no transport configured
  yet, nvmet_enable_port() uses NVMF_TRTYPE_MAX (255) to query the transports array, causing
  an out-of-bounds access:  [  106.058694] BUG: KASAN: global-out-of-bounds in nvmet_enable_port+0x42/0x1da
  [  106.058719] Read of size 8 at addr ffffffff89dafa58 by task ln/632 [...] [  106.076026]
  nvmet: transport type 255 not supported  Since commit 200adac75888, NVMF_TRTYPE_MAX is the
  default state as configured by nvmet_ports_make(). Avoid this by checking for NVMF_TRTYPE_MAX
  before proceeding.'
