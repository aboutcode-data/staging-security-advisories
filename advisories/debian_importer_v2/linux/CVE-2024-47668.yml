summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  lib/generic-radix-tree.c:
  Fix rare race in __genradix_ptr_alloc()  If we need to increase the tree depth, allocate a
  new node, and then race with another thread that increased the tree depth before us, we''ll
  still have a preallocated node that might be used later.  If we then use that node for a new
  non-root node, it''ll still have a pointer to the old root instead of being zeroed - fix this
  by zeroing it in the cmpxchg failure path.'
