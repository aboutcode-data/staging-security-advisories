summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/hugetlb.c:
  fix UAF of vma in hugetlb fault pathway  Syzbot reports a UAF in hugetlb_fault().  This happens
  because vmf_anon_prepare() could drop the per-VMA lock and allow the current VMA to be freed
  before hugetlb_vma_unlock_read() is called.  We can fix this by using a modified version of
  vmf_anon_prepare() that doesn''t release the VMA lock on failure, and then release it ourselves
  after hugetlb_vma_unlock_read().'
