summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/MCE: Always
  save CS register on AMD Zen IF Poison errors  The Instruction Fetch (IF) units on current
  AMD Zen-based systems do not guarantee a synchronous #MC is delivered for poison consumption
  errors. Therefore, MCG_STATUS[EIPV|RIPV] will not be set. However, the microarchitecture does
  guarantee that the exception is delivered within the same context. In other words, the exact
  rIP is not known, but the context is known to not have changed.  There is no architecturally-defined
  method to determine this behavior.  The Code Segment (CS) register is always valid on such
  IF unit poison errors regardless of the value of MCG_STATUS[EIPV|RIPV].  Add a quirk to save
  the CS register for poison consumption from the IF unit banks.  This is needed to properly
  determine the context of the error. Otherwise, the severity grading function will assume the
  context is IN_KERNEL due to the m->cs value being 0 (the initialized value). This leads to
  unnecessary kernel panics on data poison errors due to the kernel believing the poison consumption
  occurred in kernel context.'
