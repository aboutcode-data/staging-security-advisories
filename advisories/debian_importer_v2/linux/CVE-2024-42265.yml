  - CVE-2024-42265
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  protect the fetch
  of ->fd[fd] in do_dup2() from mispredictions  both callers have verified that fd is not greater
  than ->max_fds; however, misprediction might end up with         tofree = fdt->fd[fd]; being
  speculatively executed.  That''s wrong for the same reasons why it''s wrong in close_fd()/file_close_fd_locked();
  the same solution applies - array_index_nospec(fd, fdt->max_fds) could differ from fd only
  in case of speculative execution on mispredicted path.'
