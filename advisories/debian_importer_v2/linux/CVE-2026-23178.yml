summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: i2c-hid:
  fix potential buffer overflow in i2c_hid_get_report()  `i2c_hid_xfer` is used to read `recv_len
  + sizeof(__le16)` bytes of data into `ihid->rawbuf`.  The former can come from the userspace
  in the hidraw driver and is only bounded by HID_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE(16384) by default (unless
  we also set `max_buffer_size` field of `struct hid_ll_driver` which we do not).  The latter
  has size determined at runtime by the maximum size of different report types you could receive
  on any particular device and can be a much smaller value.  Fix this by truncating `recv_len`
  to `ihid->bufsize - sizeof(__le16)`.  The impact is low since access to hidraw devices requires
  root.'
