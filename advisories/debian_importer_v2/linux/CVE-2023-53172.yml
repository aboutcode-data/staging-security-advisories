summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fsverity: reject
  FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY on mode 3 fds  Commit 56124d6c87fd ("fsverity: support enabling with
  tree block size < PAGE_SIZE") changed FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY to use __kernel_read() to read
  the file''s data, instead of direct pagecache accesses.  An unintended consequence of this
  is that the ''WARN_ON_ONCE(!(file->f_mode & FMODE_READ))'' in __kernel_read() became reachable
  by fuzz tests.  This happens if FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY is called on a fd opened with access
  mode 3, which means "ioctl access only".  Arguably, FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY should work on ioctl-only
  fds.  But ioctl-only fds are a weird Linux extension that is rarely used and that few people
  even know about.  (The documentation for FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY even specifically says it requires
  O_RDONLY.)  It''s probably not worthwhile to make the ioctl internally open a new fd just
  to handle this case.  Thus, just reject the ioctl on such fds for now.'
