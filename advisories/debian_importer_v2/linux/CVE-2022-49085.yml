summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drbd: Fix five
  use after free bugs in get_initial_state  In get_initial_state, it calls notify_initial_state_done(skb,..)
  if cb->args[5]==1. If genlmsg_put() failed in notify_initial_state_done(), the skb will be
  freed by nlmsg_free(skb). Then get_initial_state will goto out and the freed skb will be used
  by return value skb->len, which is a uaf bug.  What''s worse, the same problem goes even further:
  skb can also be freed in the notify_*_state_change -> notify_*_state calls below. Thus 4 additional
  uaf bugs happened.  My patch lets the problem callee functions: notify_initial_state_done
  and notify_*_state_change return an error code if errors happen. So that the error codes could
  be propagated and the uaf bugs can be avoid.  v2 reports a compilation warning. This v3 fixed
  this warning and built successfully in my local environment with no additional warnings. v2:
