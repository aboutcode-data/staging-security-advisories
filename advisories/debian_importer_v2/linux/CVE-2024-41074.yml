  - CVE-2024-41074
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cachefiles: Set
  object to close if ondemand_id < 0 in copen  If copen is maliciously called in the user mode,
  it may delete the request corresponding to the random id. And the request may have not been
  read yet.  Note that when the object is set to reopen, the open request will be done with
  the still reopen state in above case. As a result, the request corresponding to this object
  is always skipped in select_req function, so the read request is never completed and blocks
  other process.  Fix this issue by simply set object to close if its id < 0 in copen.'
