summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: phy: fsl-usb:
  Fix use-after-free in delayed work during device removal  The delayed work item otg_event
  is initialized in fsl_otg_conf() and scheduled under two conditions: 1. When a host controller
  binds to the OTG controller. 2. When the USB ID pin state changes (cable insertion/removal).  A
  race condition occurs when the device is removed via fsl_otg_remove(): the fsl_otg instance
  may be freed while the delayed work is still pending or executing. This leads to use-after-free
  when the work function fsl_otg_event() accesses the already freed memory.  The problematic
  scenario:  (detach thread)            | (delayed work) fsl_otg_remove()           |   kfree(fsl_otg_dev)
  //FREE| fsl_otg_event()                            |   og = container_of(...) //USE                            |   og->
  //USE  Fix this by calling disable_delayed_work_sync() in fsl_otg_remove() before deallocating
  the fsl_otg structure. This ensures the delayed work is properly canceled and completes execution
  prior to memory deallocation.  This bug was identified through static analysis.'
