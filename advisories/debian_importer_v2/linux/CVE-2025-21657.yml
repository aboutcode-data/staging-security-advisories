summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sched_ext: Replace
  rq_lock() to raw_spin_rq_lock() in scx_ops_bypass()  scx_ops_bypass() iterates all CPUs to
  re-enqueue all the scx tasks. For each CPU, it acquires a lock using rq_lock() regardless
  of whether a CPU is offline or the CPU is currently running a task in a higher scheduler class
  (e.g., deadline). The rq_lock() is supposed to be used for online CPUs, and the use of rq_lock()
  may trigger an unnecessary warning in rq_pin_lock(). Therefore, replace rq_lock() to raw_spin_rq_lock()
  in scx_ops_bypass().  Without this change, we observe the following warning:  ===== START
  ===== [    6.615205] rq->balance_callback && rq->balance_callback != &balance_push_callback
  [    6.615208] WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 0 at kernel/sched/sched.h:1730 __schedule+0x1130/0x1c90
  =====  END  ====='
