summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/ast: Fix
  soft lockup  There is a while-loop in ast_dp_set_on_off() that could lead to infinite-loop.
  This is because the register, VGACRI-Dx, checked in this API is a scratch register actually
  controlled by a MCU, named DPMCU, in BMC.  These scratch registers are protected by scu-lock.
  If suc-lock is not off, DPMCU can not update these registers and then host will have soft
  lockup due to never updated status.  DPMCU is used to control DP and relative registers to
  handshake with host''s VGA driver. Even the most time-consuming task, DP''s link training,
  is less than 100ms. 200ms should be enough.'
