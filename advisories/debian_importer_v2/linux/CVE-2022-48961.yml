summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: mdio: fix
  unbalanced fwnode reference count in mdio_device_release()  There is warning report about
  of_node refcount leak while probing mdio device:  OF: ERROR: memory leak, expected refcount
  1 instead of 2, of_node_get()/of_node_put() unbalanced - destroy cset entry: attach overlay
  node /spi/soc@0/mdio@710700c0/ethernet@4  In of_mdiobus_register_device(), we increase fwnode
  refcount by fwnode_handle_get() before associating the of_node with mdio device, but it has
  never been decreased in normal path. Since that, in mdio_device_release(), it needs to call
  fwnode_handle_put() in addition instead of calling kfree() directly.  After above, just calling
  mdio_device_free() in the error handle path of of_mdiobus_register_device() is enough to keep
  the refcount balanced.'
