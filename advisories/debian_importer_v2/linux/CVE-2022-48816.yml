  - CVE-2022-48816
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  SUNRPC: lock
  against ->sock changing during sysfs read  ->sock can be set to NULL asynchronously unless
  ->recv_mutex is held. So it is important to hold that mutex.  Otherwise a sysfs read can trigger
  an oops. Commit 17f09d3f619a ("SUNRPC: Check if the xprt is connected before handling sysfs
  reads") appears to attempt to fix this problem, but it only narrows the race window.'
