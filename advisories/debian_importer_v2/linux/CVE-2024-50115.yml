summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: nSVM: Ignore
  nCR3[4:0] when loading PDPTEs from memory  Ignore nCR3[4:0] when loading PDPTEs from memory
  for nested SVM, as bits 4:0 of CR3 are ignored when PAE paging is used, and thus VMRUN doesn''t
  enforce 32-byte alignment of nCR3.  In the absolute worst case scenario, failure to ignore
  bits 4:0 can result in an out-of-bounds read, e.g. if the target page is at the end of a memslot,
  and the VMM isn''t using guard pages.  Per the APM:    The CR3 register points to the base
  address of the page-directory-pointer   table. The page-directory-pointer table is aligned
  on a 32-byte boundary,   with the low 5 address bits 4:0 assumed to be 0.  And the SDM''s
  much more explicit:    4:0    Ignored  Note, KVM gets this right when loading PDPTRs, it''s
  only the nSVM flow that is broken.'
