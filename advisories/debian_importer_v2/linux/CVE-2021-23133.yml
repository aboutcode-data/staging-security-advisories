  - CVE-2021-23133
summary: A race condition in Linux kernel SCTP sockets (net/sctp/socket.c) before 5.12-rc8 can
  lead to kernel privilege escalation from the context of a network service or an unprivileged
  process. If sctp_destroy_sock is called without sock_net(sk)->sctp.addr_wq_lock then an element
  is removed from the auto_asconf_splist list without any proper locking. This can be exploited
  by an attacker with network service privileges to escalate to root or from the context of
  an unprivileged user directly if a BPF_CGROUP_INET_SOCK_CREATE is attached which denies creation
  of some SCTP socket.
