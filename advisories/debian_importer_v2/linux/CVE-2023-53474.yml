summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/MCE/AMD:
  Use an u64 for bank_map  Thee maximum number of MCA banks is 64 (MAX_NR_BANKS), see    a0bc32b3cacf
  ("x86/mce: Increase maximum number of banks to 64").  However, the bank_map which contains
  a bitfield of which banks to initialize is of type unsigned int and that overflows when those
  bit numbers are >= 32, leading to UBSAN complaining correctly:    UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds
  in arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mce/amd.c:1365:38   shift exponent 32 is too large for 32-bit type
  ''int''  Change the bank_map to a u64 and use the proper BIT_ULL() macro when modifying bits
  in there.    [ bp: Rewrite commit message. ]'
