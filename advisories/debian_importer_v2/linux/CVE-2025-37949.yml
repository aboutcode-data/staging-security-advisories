summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xenbus: Use kref
  to track req lifetime  Marek reported seeing a NULL pointer fault in the xenbus_thread callstack:
  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000 RIP: e030:__wake_up_common+0x4c/0x180
  Call Trace:  <TASK>  __wake_up_common_lock+0x82/0xd0  process_msg+0x18e/0x2f0  xenbus_thread+0x165/0x1c0  process_msg+0x18e
  is req->cb(req).  req->cb is set to xs_wake_up(), a thin wrapper around wake_up(), or xenbus_dev_queue_reply().  It
  seems like it was xs_wake_up() in this case.  It seems like req may have woken up the xs_wait_for_reply(),
  which kfree()ed the req.  When xenbus_thread resumes, it faults on the zero-ed data.  Linux
  Device Drivers 2nd edition states: "Normally, a wake_up call can cause an immediate reschedule
  to happen, meaning that other processes might run before wake_up returns." ... which would
  match the behaviour observed.  Change to keeping two krefs on each request.  One for the caller,
  and one for xenbus_thread.  Each will kref_put() when finished, and the last will free it.  This
  use of kref matches the description in Documentation/core-api/kref.rst'
