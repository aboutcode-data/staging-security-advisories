summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: Fix memory
  leak in devm_clk_notifier_register()  devm_clk_notifier_register() allocates a devres resource
  for clk notifier but didn''t register that to the device, so the notifier didn''t get unregistered
  on device detach and the allocated resource was leaked.  Fix the issue by registering the
  resource through devres_add().  This issue was found with kmemleak on a Chromebook.'
