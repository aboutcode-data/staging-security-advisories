summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: phy: qcom:
  at803x: fix kernel panic with at8031_probe  On reworking and splitting the at803x driver,
  in splitting function of at803x PHYs it was added a NULL dereference bug where priv is referenced
  before it''s actually allocated and then is tried to write to for the is_1000basex and is_fiber
  variables in the case of at8031, writing on the wrong address.  Fix this by correctly setting
  priv local variable only after at803x_probe is called and actually allocates priv in the phydev
  struct.'
