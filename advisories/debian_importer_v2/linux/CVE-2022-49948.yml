  - CVE-2022-49948
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vt: Clear selection
  before changing the font  When changing the console font with ioctl(KDFONTOP) the new font
  size can be bigger than the previous font. A previous selection may thus now be outside of
  the new screen size and thus trigger out-of-bounds accesses to graphics memory if the selection
  is removed in vc_do_resize().  Prevent such out-of-memory accesses by dropping the selection
  before the various con_font_set() console handlers are called.'
