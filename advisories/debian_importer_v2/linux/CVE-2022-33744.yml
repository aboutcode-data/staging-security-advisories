  - CVE-2022-33744
summary: Arm guests can cause Dom0 DoS via PV devices When mapping pages of guests on Arm, dom0
  is using an rbtree to keep track of the foreign mappings. Updating of that rbtree is not always
  done completely with the related lock held, resulting in a small race window, which can be
  used by unprivileged guests via PV devices to cause inconsistencies of the rbtree. These inconsistencies
  can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) of dom0, e.g. by causing crashes or the inability to perform
  further mappings of other guests' memory pages.
