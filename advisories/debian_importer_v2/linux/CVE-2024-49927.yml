summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/ioapic: Handle
  allocation failures gracefully  Breno observed panics when using failslab under certain conditions
  during runtime:     can not alloc irq_pin_list (-1,0,20)    Kernel panic - not syncing: IO-APIC:
  failed to add irq-pin. Can not proceed     panic+0x4e9/0x590    mp_irqdomain_alloc+0x9ab/0xa80    irq_domain_alloc_irqs_locked+0x25d/0x8d0    __irq_domain_alloc_irqs+0x80/0x110    mp_map_pin_to_irq+0x645/0x890    acpi_register_gsi_ioapic+0xe6/0x150    hpet_open+0x313/0x480  That''s
  a pointless panic which is a leftover of the historic IO/APIC code which panic''ed during
  early boot when the interrupt allocation failed.  The only place which might justify panic
  is the PIT/HPET timer_check() code which tries to figure out whether the timer interrupt is
  delivered through the IO/APIC. But that code does not require to handle interrupt allocation
  failures. If the interrupt cannot be allocated then timer delivery fails and it either panics
  due to that or falls back to legacy mode.  Cure this by removing the panic wrapper around
  __add_pin_to_irq_node() and making mp_irqdomain_alloc() aware of the failure condition and
  handle it as any other failure in this function gracefully.'
