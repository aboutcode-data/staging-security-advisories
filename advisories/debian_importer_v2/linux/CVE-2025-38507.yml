summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: nintendo:
  avoid bluetooth suspend/resume stalls  Ensure we don''t stall or panic the kernel when using
  bluetooth-connected controllers. This was reported as an issue on android devices using kernel
  6.6 due to the resume hook which had been added for usb joycons.  First, set a new state value
  to JOYCON_CTLR_STATE_SUSPENDED in a newly-added nintendo_hid_suspend. This makes sure we will
  not stall out the kernel waiting for input reports during led classdev suspend. The stalls
  could happen if connectivity is unreliable or lost to the controller prior to suspend.  Second,
  since we lose connectivity during suspend, do not try joycon_init() for bluetooth controllers
  in the nintendo_hid_resume path.  Tested via multiple suspend/resume flows when using the
  controller both in USB and bluetooth modes.'
