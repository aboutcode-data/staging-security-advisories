summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  kunit: executor:
  Fix a memory leak on failure in kunit_filter_tests  It''s possible that memory allocation
  for ''filtered'' will fail, but for the copy of the suite to succeed. In this case, the copy
  could be leaked.  Properly free ''copy'' in the error case for the allocation of ''filtered''
  failing.  Note that there may also have been a similar issue in kunit_filter_subsuites, before
  it was removed in "kunit: flatten kunit_suite*** to kunit_suite** in .kunit_test_suites".  This
  was reported by clang-analyzer via the kernel test robot, here: https://lore.kernel.org/all/c8073b8e-7b9e-0830-4177-87c12f16349c@intel.com/  And
  by smatch via Dan Carpenter and the kernel test robot: https://lore.kernel.org/all/202207101328.ASjx88yj-lkp@intel.com/'
