summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: dwc3: gadget:\
  \ Bail from dwc3_gadget_exit() if dwc->gadget is NULL  There exists a possible scenario in\
  \ which dwc3_gadget_init() can fail: during during host -> peripheral mode switch in dwc3_set_mode(),\
  \ and a pending gadget driver fails to bind.  Then, if the DRD undergoes another mode switch\
  \ from peripheral->host the resulting dwc3_gadget_exit() will attempt to reference an invalid\
  \ and dangling dwc->gadget pointer as well as call dma_free_coherent() on unmapped DMA pointers.\
  \  The exact scenario can be reproduced as follows:  - Start DWC3 in peripheral mode  - Configure\
  \ ConfigFS gadget with FunctionFS instance (or use g_ffs)  - Run FunctionFS userspace application\
  \ (open EPs, write descriptors, etc)  - Bind gadget driver to DWC3's UDC  - Switch DWC3 to\
  \ host mode    => dwc3_gadget_exit() is called. usb_del_gadget() will put the \tConfigFS driver\
  \ instance on the gadget_driver_pending_list  - Stop FunctionFS application (closes the ep\
  \ files)  - Switch DWC3 to peripheral mode    => dwc3_gadget_init() fails as usb_add_gadget()\
  \ calls \tcheck_pending_gadget_drivers() and attempts to rebind the UDC \tto the ConfigFS\
  \ gadget but fails with -19 (-ENODEV) because the \tFFS instance is not in FFS_ACTIVE state\
  \ (userspace has not \tre-opened and written the descriptors yet, i.e. desc_ready!=0).  -\
  \ Switch DWC3 back to host mode    => dwc3_gadget_exit() is called again, but this time dwc->gadget\
  \ \tis invalid.  Although it can be argued that userspace should take responsibility for ensuring\
  \ that the FunctionFS application be ready prior to allowing the composite driver bind to\
  \ the UDC, failure to do so should not result in a panic from the kernel driver.  Fix this\
  \ by setting dwc->gadget to NULL in the failure path of dwc3_gadget_init() and add a check\
  \ to dwc3_gadget_exit() to bail out unless the gadget pointer is valid."
