aliases:
  - CVE-2022-3577
summary: An out-of-bounds memory write flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s Kid-friendly Wired
  Controller driver. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges
  on the system. It is in bigben_probe of drivers/hid/hid-bigbenff.c. The reason is incorrect
  assumption - bigben devices all have inputs. However, malicious devices can break this assumption,
  leaking to out-of-bound write.
