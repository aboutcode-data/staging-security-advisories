summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: imx-jpeg:
  fix a bug of accessing array out of bounds  When error occurs in parsing jpeg, the slot isn''t
  acquired yet, it may be the default value MXC_MAX_SLOTS. If the driver access the slot using
  the incorrect slot number, it will access array out of bounds. The result is the driver will
  change num_domains, which follows slot_data in struct mxc_jpeg_dev. Then the driver won''t
  detach the pm domain at rmmod, which will lead to kernel panic when trying to insmod again.'
