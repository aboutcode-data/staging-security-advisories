summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix use-after-free
  of nilfs_root in dirtying inodes via iput  During unmount process of nilfs2, nothing holds
  nilfs_root structure after nilfs2 detaches its writer in nilfs_detach_log_writer().  Previously,
  nilfs_evict_inode() could cause use-after-free read for nilfs_root if inodes are left in "garbage_list"
  and released by nilfs_dispose_list at the end of nilfs_detach_log_writer(), and this bug was
  fixed by commit 9b5a04ac3ad9 ("nilfs2: fix use-after-free bug of nilfs_root in nilfs_evict_inode()").  However,
  it turned out that there is another possibility of UAF in the call path where mark_inode_dirty_sync()
  is called from iput():  nilfs_detach_log_writer()   nilfs_dispose_list()     iput()       mark_inode_dirty_sync()         __mark_inode_dirty()           nilfs_dirty_inode()             __nilfs_mark_inode_dirty()               nilfs_load_inode_block()
  --> causes UAF of nilfs_root struct  This can happen after commit 0ae45f63d4ef ("vfs: add
  support for a lazytime mount option"), which changed iput() to call mark_inode_dirty_sync()
  on its final reference if i_state has I_DIRTY_TIME flag and i_nlink is non-zero.  This issue
  appears after commit 28a65b49eb53 ("nilfs2: do not write dirty data after degenerating to
  read-only") when using the syzbot reproducer, but the issue has potentially existed before.  Fix
  this issue by adding a "purging flag" to the nilfs structure, setting that flag while disposing
  the "garbage_list" and checking it in __nilfs_mark_inode_dirty().  Unlike commit 9b5a04ac3ad9
  ("nilfs2: fix use-after-free bug of nilfs_root in nilfs_evict_inode()"), this patch does not
  rely on ns_writer to determine whether to skip operations, so as not to break recovery on
  mount.  The nilfs_salvage_orphan_logs routine dirties the buffer of salvaged data before attaching
  the log writer, so changing __nilfs_mark_inode_dirty() to skip the operation when ns_writer
  is NULL will cause recovery write to fail.  The purpose of using the cleanup-only flag is
  to allow for narrowing of such conditions.'
