summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bnxt_en: Fix
  error handling path in bnxt_init_chip()  WARN_ON() is triggered in __flush_work() if bnxt_init_chip()
  fails because we call cancel_work_sync() on dim work that has not been initialized.  WARNING:
  CPU: 37 PID: 5223 at kernel/workqueue.c:4201 __flush_work.isra.0+0x212/0x230  The driver relies
  on the BNXT_STATE_NAPI_DISABLED bit to check if dim work has already been cancelled.  But
  in the bnxt_open() path, BNXT_STATE_NAPI_DISABLED is not set and this causes the error path
  to think that it needs to cancel the uninitalized dim work. Fix it by setting BNXT_STATE_NAPI_DISABLED
  during initialization. The bit will be cleared when we enable NAPI and initialize dim work.'
