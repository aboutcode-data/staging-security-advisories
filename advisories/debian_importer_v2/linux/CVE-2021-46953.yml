summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ACPI: GTDT: Don''t
  corrupt interrupt mappings on watchdow probe failure  When failing the driver probe because
  of invalid firmware properties, the GTDT driver unmaps the interrupt that it mapped earlier.  However,
  it never checks whether the mapping of the interrupt actially succeeded. Even more, should
  the firmware report an illegal interrupt number that overlaps with the GIC SGI range, this
  can result in an IPI being unmapped, and subsequent fireworks (as reported by Dann Frazier).  Rework
  the driver to have a slightly saner behaviour and actually check whether the interrupt has
  been mapped before unmapping things.'
