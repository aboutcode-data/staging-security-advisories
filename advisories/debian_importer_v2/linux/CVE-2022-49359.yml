summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/panfrost:
  Job should reference MMU not file_priv  For a while now it''s been allowed for a MMU context
  to outlive it''s corresponding panfrost_priv, however the job structure still references panfrost_priv
  to get hold of the MMU context. If panfrost_priv has been freed this is a use-after-free which
  I''ve been able to trigger resulting in a splat.  To fix this, drop the reference to panfrost_priv
  in the job structure and add a direct reference to the MMU structure which is what''s actually
  needed.'
