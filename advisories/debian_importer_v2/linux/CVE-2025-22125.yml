summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  md/raid1,raid10:
  don''t ignore IO flags  If blk-wbt is enabled by default, it''s found that raid write performance
  is quite bad because all IO are throttled by wbt of underlying disks, due to flag REQ_IDLE
  is ignored. And turns out this behaviour exist since blk-wbt is introduced.  Other than REQ_IDLE,
  other flags should not be ignored as well, for example REQ_META can be set for filesystems,
  clearing it can cause priority reverse problems; And REQ_NOWAIT should not be cleared as well,
  because io will wait instead of failing directly in underlying disks.  Fix those problems
  by keep IO flags from master bio.  Fises: f51d46d0e7cb ("md: add support for REQ_NOWAIT")'
