summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mips: bmips:
  BCM6358: make sure CBR is correctly set  It was discovered that some device have CBR address
  set to 0 causing kernel panic when arch_sync_dma_for_cpu_all is called.  This was notice in
  situation where the system is booted from TP1 and BMIPS_GET_CBR() returns 0 instead of a valid
  address and !!(read_c0_brcm_cmt_local() & (1 << 31)); not failing.  The current check whether
  RAC flush should be disabled or not are not enough hence lets check if CBR is a valid address
  or not.'
