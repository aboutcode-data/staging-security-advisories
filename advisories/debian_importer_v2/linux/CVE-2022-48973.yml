summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gpio: amd8111:
  Fix PCI device reference count leak  for_each_pci_dev() is implemented by pci_get_device().
  The comment of pci_get_device() says that it will increase the reference count for the returned
  pci_dev and also decrease the reference count for the input pci_dev @from if it is not NULL.  If
  we break for_each_pci_dev() loop with pdev not NULL, we need to call pci_dev_put() to decrease
  the reference count. Add the missing pci_dev_put() after the ''out'' label. Since pci_dev_put()
  can handle NULL input parameter, there is no problem for the ''Device not found'' branch.
  For the normal path, add pci_dev_put() in amd_gpio_exit().'
