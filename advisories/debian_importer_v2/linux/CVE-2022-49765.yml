summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/9p: use a
  dedicated spinlock for trans_fd  Shamelessly copying the explanation from Tetsuo Handa''s
  suggested patch[1] (slightly reworded): syzbot is reporting inconsistent lock state in p9_req_put()[2],
  for p9_tag_remove() from p9_req_put() from IRQ context is using spin_lock_irqsave() on "struct
  p9_client"->lock but trans_fd (not from IRQ context) is using spin_lock().  Since the locks
  actually protect different things in client.c and in trans_fd.c, just replace trans_fd.c''s
  lock by a new one specific to the transport (client.c''s protect the idr for fid/tag allocations,
  while trans_fd.c''s protects its own req list and request status field that acts as the transport''s
  state machine)'
