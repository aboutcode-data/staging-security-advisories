  - CVE-2022-49072
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gpio: Restrict
  usage of GPIO chip irq members before initialization  GPIO chip irq members are exposed before
  they could be completely initialized and this leads to race conditions.  One such issue was
  observed for the gc->irq.domain variable which was accessed through the I2C interface in gpiochip_to_irq()
  before it could be initialized by gpiochip_add_irqchip(). This resulted in Kernel NULL pointer
  dereference.  Following are the logs for reference :-  kernel: Call Trace: kernel:  gpiod_to_irq+0x53/0x70
  kernel:  acpi_dev_gpio_irq_get_by+0x113/0x1f0 kernel:  i2c_acpi_get_irq+0xc0/0xd0 kernel:  i2c_device_probe+0x28a/0x2a0
  kernel:  really_probe+0xf2/0x460 kernel: RIP: 0010:gpiochip_to_irq+0x47/0xc0  To avoid such
  scenarios, restrict usage of GPIO chip irq members before they are completely initialized.'
