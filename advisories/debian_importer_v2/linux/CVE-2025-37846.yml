summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  arm64: mops:
  Do not dereference src reg for a set operation  The source register is not used for SET* and
  reading it can result in a UBSAN out-of-bounds array access error, specifically when the MOPS
  exception is taken from a SET* sequence with XZR (reg 31) as the source. Architecturally this
  is the only case where a src/dst/size field in the ESR can be reported as 31.  Prior to 2de451a329cf662b
  the code in do_el0_mops() was benign as the use of pt_regs_read_reg() prevented the out-of-bounds
  access.'
