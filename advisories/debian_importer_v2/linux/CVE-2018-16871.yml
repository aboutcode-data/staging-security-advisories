  - CVE-2018-16871
summary: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's NFS implementation, all versions 3.x and all
  versions 4.x up to 4.20. An attacker, who is able to mount an exported NFS filesystem, is
  able to trigger a null pointer dereference by using an invalid NFS sequence. This can panic
  the machine and deny access to the NFS server. Any outstanding disk writes to the NFS server
  will be lost.
