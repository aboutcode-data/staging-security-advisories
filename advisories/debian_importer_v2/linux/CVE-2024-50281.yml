summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KEYS: trusted:
  dcp: fix NULL dereference in AEAD crypto operation  When sealing or unsealing a key blob we
  currently do not wait for the AEAD cipher operation to finish and simply return after submitting
  the request. If there is some load on the system we can exit before the cipher operation is
  done and the buffer we read from/write to is already removed from the stack. This will e.g.
  result in NULL pointer dereference errors in the DCP driver during blob creation.  Fix this
  by waiting for the AEAD cipher operation to finish before resuming the seal and unseal calls.'
