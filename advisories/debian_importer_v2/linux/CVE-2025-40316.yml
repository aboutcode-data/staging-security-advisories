summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/mediatek:
  Fix device use-after-free on unbind  A recent change fixed device reference leaks when looking
  up drm platform device driver data during bind() but failed to remove a partial fix which
  had been added by commit 80805b62ea5b ("drm/mediatek: Fix kobject put for component sub-drivers").  This
  results in a reference imbalance on component bind() failures and on unbind() which could
  lead to a user-after-free.  Make sure to only drop the references after retrieving the driver
  data by effectively reverting the previous partial fix.  Note that holding a reference to
  a device does not prevent its driver data from going away so there is no point in keeping
  the reference.'
