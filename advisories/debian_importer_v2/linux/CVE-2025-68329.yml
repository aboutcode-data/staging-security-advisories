summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tracing: Fix
  WARN_ON in tracing_buffers_mmap_close for split VMAs  When a VMA is split (e.g., by partial
  munmap or MAP_FIXED), the kernel calls vm_ops->close on each portion. For trace buffer mappings,
  this results in ring_buffer_unmap() being called multiple times while ring_buffer_map() was
  only called once.  This causes ring_buffer_unmap() to return -ENODEV on subsequent calls because
  user_mapped is already 0, triggering a WARN_ON.  Trace buffer mappings cannot support partial
  mappings because the ring buffer structure requires the complete buffer including the meta
  page.  Fix this by adding a may_split callback that returns -EINVAL to prevent VMA splits
  entirely.'
