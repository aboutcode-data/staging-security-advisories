summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  s390/cio: fix
  out-of-bounds access on cio_ignore free  The channel-subsystem-driver scans for newly available
  devices whenever device-IDs are removed from the cio_ignore list using a command such as:    echo
  free >/proc/cio_ignore  Since an I/O device scan might interfer with running I/Os, commit
  172da89ed0ea ("s390/cio: avoid excessive path-verification requests") introduced an optimization
  to exclude online devices from the scan.  The newly added check for online devices incorrectly
  assumes that an I/O-subchannel''s drvdata points to a struct io_subchannel_private. For devices
  that are bound to a non-default I/O subchannel driver, such as the vfio_ccw driver, this results
  in an out-of-bounds read access during each scan.  Fix this by changing the scan logic to
  rely on a driver-independent online indication. For this we can use struct subchannel->config.ena,
  which is the driver''s requested subchannel-enabled state. Since I/Os can only be started
  on enabled subchannels, this matches the intent of the original optimization of not scanning
  devices where I/O might be running.'
