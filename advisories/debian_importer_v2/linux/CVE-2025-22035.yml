summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tracing: Fix
  use-after-free in print_graph_function_flags during tracer switching  Kairui reported a UAF
  issue in print_graph_function_flags() during ftrace stress testing [1]. This issue can be
  reproduced if puting a ''mdelay(10)'' after ''mutex_unlock(&trace_types_lock)'' in s_start(),
  and executing the following script:    $ echo function_graph > current_tracer   $ cat trace
  > /dev/null &   $ sleep 5  # Ensure the ''cat'' reaches the ''mdelay(10)'' point   $ echo
  timerlat > current_tracer  The root cause lies in the two calls to print_graph_function_flags
  within print_trace_line during each s_show():    * One through ''iter->trace->print_line()'';   *
  Another through ''event->funcs->trace()'', which is hidden in     print_trace_fmt() before
  print_trace_line returns.  Tracer switching only updates the former, while the latter continues
  to use the print_line function of the old tracer, which in the script above is print_graph_function_flags.  Moreover,
  when switching from the ''function_graph'' tracer to the ''timerlat'' tracer, s_start only
  calls graph_trace_close of the ''function_graph'' tracer to free ''iter->private'', but does
  not set it to NULL. This provides an opportunity for ''event->funcs->trace()'' to use an invalid
  ''iter->private''.  To fix this issue, set ''iter->private'' to NULL immediately after freeing
  it in graph_trace_close(), ensuring that an invalid pointer is not passed to other tracers.
  Additionally, clean up the unnecessary ''iter->private = NULL'' during each ''cat trace''
  when using wakeup and irqsoff tracers.   [1] https://lore.kernel.org/all/20231112150030.84609-1-ryncsn@gmail.com/'
