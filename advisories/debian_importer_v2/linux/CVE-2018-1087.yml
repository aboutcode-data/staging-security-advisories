  - CVE-2018-1087
summary: kernel KVM before versions kernel 4.16, kernel 4.16-rc7, kernel 4.17-rc1, kernel 4.17-rc2
  and kernel 4.17-rc3 is vulnerable to a flaw in the way the Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor handled
  exceptions delivered after a stack switch operation via Mov SS or Pop SS instructions. During
  the stack switch operation, the processor did not deliver interrupts and exceptions, rather
  they are delivered once the first instruction after the stack switch is executed. An unprivileged
  KVM guest user could use this flaw to crash the guest or, potentially, escalate their privileges
  in the guest.
