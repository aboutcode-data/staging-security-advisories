summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  libbpf: Prevent
  null-pointer dereference when prog to load has no BTF  In bpf_objec_load_prog(), there''s
  no guarantee that obj->btf is non-NULL when passing it to btf__fd(), and this function does
  not perform any check before dereferencing its argument (as bpf_object__btf_fd() used to do).
  As a consequence, we get segmentation fault errors in bpftool (for example) when trying to
  load programs that come without BTF information.  v2: Keep btf__fd() in the fix instead of
  reverting to bpf_object__btf_fd().'
