  - CVE-2018-1000204
summary: 'Linux Kernel version 3.18 to 4.16 incorrectly handles an SG_IO ioctl on /dev/sg0 with
  dxfer_direction=SG_DXFER_FROM_DEV and an empty 6-byte cmdp. This may lead to copying up to
  1000 kernel heap pages to the userspace. This has been fixed upstream in https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/a45b599ad808c3c982fdcdc12b0b8611c2f92824
  already. The problem has limited scope, as users don''t usually have permissions to access
  SCSI devices. On the other hand, e.g. the Nero user manual suggests doing `chmod o+r+w /dev/sg*`
  to make the devices accessible. NOTE: third parties dispute the relevance of this report,
  noting that the requirement for an attacker to have both the CAP_SYS_ADMIN and CAP_SYS_RAWIO
  capabilities makes it "virtually impossible to exploit.'
