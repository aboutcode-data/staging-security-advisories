summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  NFSD: Protect
  against send buffer overflow in NFSv2 READ  Since before the git era, NFSD has conserved the
  number of pages held by each nfsd thread by combining the RPC receive and send buffers into
  a single array of pages. This works because there are no cases where an operation needs a
  large RPC Call message and a large RPC Reply at the same time.  Once an RPC Call has been
  received, svc_process() updates svc_rqst::rq_res to describe the part of rq_pages that can
  be used for constructing the Reply. This means that the send buffer (rq_res) shrinks when
  the received RPC record containing the RPC Call is large.  A client can force this shrinkage
  on TCP by sending a correctly- formed RPC Call header contained in an RPC record that is excessively
  large. The full maximum payload size cannot be constructed in that case.'
