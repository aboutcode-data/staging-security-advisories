summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  accel/habanalabs:
  support mapping cb with vmalloc-backed coherent memory  When IOMMU is enabled, dma_alloc_coherent()
  with GFP_USER may return addresses from the vmalloc range. If such an address is mapped without
  VM_MIXEDMAP, vm_insert_page() will trigger a BUG_ON due to the VM_PFNMAP restriction.  Fix
  this by checking for vmalloc addresses and setting VM_MIXEDMAP in the VMA before mapping.
  This ensures safe mapping and avoids kernel crashes. The memory is still driver-allocated
  and cannot be accessed directly by userspace.'
