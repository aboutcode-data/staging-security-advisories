summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/mediatek:
  dp: drm_err => dev_err in HPD path to avoid NULL ptr  The function mtk_dp_wait_hpd_asserted()
  may be called before the `mtk_dp->drm_dev` pointer is assigned in mtk_dp_bridge_attach().
  Specifically it can be called via this callpath:  - mtk_edp_wait_hpd_asserted  - [panel probe]  -
  dp_aux_ep_probe  Using "drm" level prints anywhere in this callpath causes a NULL pointer
  dereference. Change the error message directly in mtk_dp_wait_hpd_asserted() to dev_err()
  to avoid this. Also change the error messages in mtk_dp_parse_capabilities(), which is called
  by mtk_dp_wait_hpd_asserted().  While touching these prints, also add the error code to them
  to make future debugging easier.'
