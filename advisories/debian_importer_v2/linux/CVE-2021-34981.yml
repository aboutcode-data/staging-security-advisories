summary: Linux Kernel Bluetooth CMTP Module Double Free Privilege Escalation Vulnerability.
  This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations
  of Linux Kernel. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code
  on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within
  the CMTP module. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object
  prior to performing further free operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability
  to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel. Was ZDI-CAN-11977.
