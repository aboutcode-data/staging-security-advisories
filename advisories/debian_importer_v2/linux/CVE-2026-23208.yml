summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: usb-audio:
  Prevent excessive number of frames  In this case, the user constructed the parameters with
  maxpacksize 40 for rate 22050 / pps 1000, and packsize[0] 22 packsize[1] 23. The buffer size
  for each data URB is maxpacksize * packets, which in this example is 40 * 6 = 240; When the
  user performs a write operation to send audio data into the ALSA PCM playback stream, the
  calculated number of frames is packsize[0] * packets = 264, which exceeds the allocated URB
  buffer size, triggering the out-of-bounds (OOB) issue reported by syzbot [1].  Added a check
  for the number of single data URB frames when calculating the number of frames to prevent
