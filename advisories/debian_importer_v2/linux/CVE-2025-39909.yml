summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/damon/lru_sort:
  avoid divide-by-zero in damon_lru_sort_apply_parameters()  Patch series "mm/damon: avoid divide-by-zero
  in DAMON module''s parameters application".  DAMON''s RECLAIM and LRU_SORT modules perform
  no validation on user-configured parameters during application, which may lead to division-by-zero
  errors.  Avoid the divide-by-zero by adding validation checks when DAMON modules attempt to
  apply the parameters.   This patch (of 2):  During the calculation of ''hot_thres'' and ''cold_thres'',
  either ''sample_interval'' or ''aggr_interval'' is used as the divisor, which may lead to
  division-by-zero errors.  Fix it by directly returning -EINVAL when such a case occurs.  Additionally,
  since ''aggr_interval'' is already required to be set no smaller than ''sample_interval''
  in damon_set_attrs(), only the case where ''sample_interval'' is zero needs to be checked.'
