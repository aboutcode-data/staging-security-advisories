summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/smc: remove
  device from smcd_dev_list after failed device_add()  If the device_add() for a smcd_dev fails,
  there''s no cleanup step that rolls back the earlier list_add(). The device subsequently gets
  freed, and we end up with a corrupted list.  Add some error handling that removes the device
  from the list.'
