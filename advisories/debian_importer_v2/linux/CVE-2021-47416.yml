summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  phy: mdio: fix\
  \ memory leak  Syzbot reported memory leak in MDIO bus interface, the problem was in wrong\
  \ state logic.  MDIOBUS_ALLOCATED indicates 2 states: \t1. Bus is only allocated \t2. Bus\
  \ allocated and __mdiobus_register() fails, but \t   device_register() was called  In case\
  \ of device_register() has been called we should call put_device() to correctly free the memory\
  \ allocated for this device, but mdiobus_free() calls just kfree(dev) in case of MDIOBUS_ALLOCATED\
  \ state  To avoid this behaviour we need to set bus->state to MDIOBUS_UNREGISTERED _before_\
  \ calling device_register(), because put_device() should be called even in case of device_register()\
  \ failure."
