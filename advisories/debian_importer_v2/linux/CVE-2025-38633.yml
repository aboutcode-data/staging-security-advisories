summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: spacemit:
  mark K1 pll1_d8 as critical  The pll1_d8 clock is enabled by the boot loader, and is ultimately
  a parent for numerous clocks, including those used by APB and AXI buses. Guodong Xu discovered
  that this clock got disabled while responding to getting -EPROBE_DEFER when requesting a reset
  controller.  The needed clock (CLK_DMA, along with its parents) had already been enabled.  To
  respond to the probe deferral return, the CLK_DMA clock was disabled, and this led to parent
  clocks also reducing their enable count.  When the enable count for pll1_d8 was decremented
  it became 0, which caused it to be disabled.  This led to a system hang.  Marking that clock
  critical resolves this by preventing it from being disabled.  Define a new macro CCU_FACTOR_GATE_DEFINE()
  to allow clock flags to be supplied for a CCU_FACTOR_GATE clock.'
