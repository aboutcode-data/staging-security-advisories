  - CVE-2025-39793
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring/memmap:
  cast nr_pages to size_t before shifting  If the allocated size exceeds UINT_MAX, then it''s
  necessary to cast the mr->nr_pages value to size_t to prevent it from overflowing. In practice
  this isn''t much of a concern as the required memory size will have been validated upfront,
  and accounted to the user. And > 4GB sizes will be necessary to make the lack of a cast a
  problem, which greatly exceeds normal user locked_vm settings that are generally in the kb
  to mb range. However, if root is used, then accounting isn''t done, and then it''s possible
  to hit this issue.'
