  - CVE-2025-40185
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ice: ice_adapter:
  release xa entry on adapter allocation failure  When ice_adapter_new() fails, the reserved
  XArray entry created by xa_insert() is not released. This causes subsequent insertions at
  the same index to return -EBUSY, potentially leading to NULL pointer dereferences.  Reorder
  the operations as suggested by Przemek Kitszel: 1. Check if adapter already exists (xa_load)
  2. Reserve the XArray slot (xa_reserve) 3. Allocate the adapter (ice_adapter_new) 4. Store
  the adapter (xa_store)'
