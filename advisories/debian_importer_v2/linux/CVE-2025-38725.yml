  - CVE-2025-38725
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: usb: asix_devices:
  add phy_mask for ax88772 mdio bus  Without setting phy_mask for ax88772 mdio bus, current
  driver may create at most 32 mdio phy devices with phy address range from 0x00 ~ 0x1f. DLink
  DUB-E100 H/W Ver B1 is such a device. However, only one main phy device will bind to net phy
  driver. This is creating issue during system suspend/resume since phy_polling_mode() in phy_state_machine()
  will directly deference member of phydev->drv for non-main phy devices. Then NULL pointer
  dereference issue will occur. Due to only external phy or internal phy is necessary, add phy_mask
  for ax88772 mdio bus to workarnoud the issue.'
