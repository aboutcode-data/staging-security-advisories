summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: wacom: fix
  crash in wacom_aes_battery_handler()  Commit fd2a9b29dc9c ("HID: wacom: Remove AES power_supply
  after extended inactivity") introduced wacom_aes_battery_handler() which is scheduled as a
  delayed work (aes_battery_work).  In wacom_remove(), aes_battery_work is not canceled. Consequently,
  if the device is removed while aes_battery_work is still pending, then hard crashes or "Oops:
  general protection fault..." are experienced when wacom_aes_battery_handler() is finally called.
  E.g., this happens with built-in USB devices after resume from hibernate when aes_battery_work
  was still pending at the time of hibernation.  So, take care to cancel aes_battery_work in
  wacom_remove().'
