summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath9k:
  htc_hst: free skb in ath9k_htc_rx_msg() if there is no callback function  It is stated that
  ath9k_htc_rx_msg() either frees the provided skb or passes its management to another callback
  function. However, the skb is not freed in case there is no another callback function, and
  Syzkaller was able to cause a memory leak. Also minor comment fix.  Found by Linux Verification
  Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.'
