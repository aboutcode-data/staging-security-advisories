summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  pci/hotplug/pnv_php:
  Fix hotplug driver crash on Powernv  The hotplug driver for powerpc (pci/hotplug/pnv_php.c)
  causes a kernel crash when we try to hot-unplug/disable the PCIe switch/bridge from the PHB.  The
  crash occurs because although the MSI data structure has been released during disable/hot-unplug
  path and it has been assigned with NULL, still during unregistration the code was again trying
  to explicitly disable the MSI which causes the NULL pointer dereference and kernel crash.  The
  patch fixes the check during unregistration path to prevent invoking pci_disable_msi/msix()
  since its data structure is already freed.'
