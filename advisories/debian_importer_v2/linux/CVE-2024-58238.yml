summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: btnxpuart:
  Resolve TX timeout error in power save stress test  This fixes the tx timeout issue seen while
  running a stress test on btnxpuart for couple of hours, such that the interval between two
  HCI commands coincide with the power save timeout value of 2 seconds.  Test procedure using
  bash script: <load btnxpuart.ko> hciconfig hci0 up //Enable Power Save feature hcitool -i
  hci0 cmd 3f 23 02 00 00 while (true) do     hciconfig hci0 leadv     sleep 2     hciconfig
  hci0 noleadv     sleep 2 done  Error log, after adding few more debug prints: Bluetooth: btnxpuart_queue_skb():
  01 0A 20 01 00 Bluetooth: hci0: Set UART break: on, status=0 Bluetooth: hci0: btnxpuart_tx_wakeup()
  tx_work scheduled Bluetooth: hci0: btnxpuart_tx_work() dequeue: 01 0A 20 01 00 Can''t set
  advertise mode on hci0: Connection timed out (110) Bluetooth: hci0: command 0x200a tx timeout  When
  the power save mechanism turns on UART break, and btnxpuart_tx_work() is scheduled simultaneously,
  psdata->ps_state is read as PS_STATE_AWAKE, which prevents the psdata->work from being scheduled,
  which is responsible to turn OFF UART break.  This issue is fixed by adding a ps_lock mutex
  around UART break on/off as well as around ps_state read/write. btnxpuart_tx_wakeup() will
  now read updated ps_state value. If ps_state is PS_STATE_SLEEP, it will first schedule psdata->work,
  and then it will reschedule itself once UART break has been turned off and ps_state is PS_STATE_AWAKE.  Tested
  above script for 50,000 iterations and TX timeout error was not observed anymore.'
