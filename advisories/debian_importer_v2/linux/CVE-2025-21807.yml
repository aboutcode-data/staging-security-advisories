summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  block: fix queue
  freeze vs limits lock order in sysfs store methods  queue_attr_store() always freezes a device
  queue before calling the attribute store operation. For attributes that control queue limits,
  the store operation will also lock the queue limits with a call to queue_limits_start_update().
  However, some drivers (e.g. SCSI sd) may need to issue commands to a device to obtain limit
  values from the hardware with the queue limits locked. This creates a potential ABBA deadlock
  situation if a user attempts to modify a limit (thus freezing the device queue) while the
  device driver starts a revalidation of the device queue limits.  Avoid such deadlock by not
  freezing the queue before calling the ->store_limit() method in struct queue_sysfs_entry and
  instead use the queue_limits_commit_update_frozen helper to freeze the queue after taking
  the limits lock.  This also removes taking the sysfs lock for the store_limit method as it
  doesn''t protect anything here, but creates even more nesting. Hopefully it will go away from
  the actual sysfs methods entirely soon.  (commit log adapted from a similar patch from  Damien
  Le Moal)'
