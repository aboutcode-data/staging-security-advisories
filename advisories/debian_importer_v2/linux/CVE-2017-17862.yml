  - CVE-2017-17862
summary: kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel through 4.14.8 ignores unreachable code,
  even though it would still be processed by JIT compilers. This behavior, also considered an
  improper branch-pruning logic issue, could possibly be used by local users for denial of service.
