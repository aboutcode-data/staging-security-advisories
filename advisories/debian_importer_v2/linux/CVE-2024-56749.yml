summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dlm: fix dlm_recover_members
  refcount on error  If dlm_recover_members() fails we don''t drop the references of the previous
  created root_list that holds and keep all rsbs alive during the recovery. It might be not
  an unlikely event because ping_members() could run into an -EINTR if another recovery progress
  was triggered again.'
