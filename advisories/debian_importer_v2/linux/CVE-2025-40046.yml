summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring/zcrx:
  fix overshooting recv limit  It''s reported that sometimes a zcrx request can receive more
  than was requested. It''s caused by io_zcrx_recv_skb() adjusting desc->count for all received
  buffers including frag lists, but then doing recursive calls to process frag list skbs, which
  leads to desc->count double accounting and underflow.'
