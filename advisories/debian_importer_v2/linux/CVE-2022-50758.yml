summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  staging: vt6655:
  fix potential memory leak  In function device_init_td0_ring, memory is allocated for member
  td_info of priv->apTD0Rings[i], with i increasing from 0. In case of allocation failure, the
  memory is freed in reversed order, with i decreasing to 0. However, the case i=0 is left out
  and thus memory is leaked.  Modify the memory freeing loop to include the case i=0.'
