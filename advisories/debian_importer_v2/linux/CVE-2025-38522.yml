summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sched/ext: Prevent
  update_locked_rq() calls with NULL rq  Avoid invoking update_locked_rq() when the runqueue
  (rq) pointer is NULL in the SCX_CALL_OP and SCX_CALL_OP_RET macros.  Previously, calling update_locked_rq(NULL)
  with preemption enabled could trigger the following warning:      BUG: using __this_cpu_write()
  in preemptible [00000000]  This happens because __this_cpu_write() is unsafe to use in preemptible
  context.  rq is NULL when an ops invoked from an unlocked context. In such cases, we don''t
  need to store any rq, since the value should already be NULL (unlocked). Ensure that update_locked_rq()
  is only called when rq is non-NULL, preventing calling __this_cpu_write() on preemptible context.'
