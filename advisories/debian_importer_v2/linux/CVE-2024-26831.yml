summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/handshake:
  Fix handshake_req_destroy_test1  Recently, handshake_req_destroy_test1 started failing:  Expected
  handshake_req_destroy_test == req, but     handshake_req_destroy_test == 0000000000000000     req
  == 0000000060f99b40 not ok 11 req_destroy works  This is because "sock_release(sock)" was
  replaced with "fput(filp)" to address a memory leak. Note that sock_release() is synchronous
  but fput() usually delays the final close and clean-up.  The delay is not consequential in
  the other cases that were changed but handshake_req_destroy_test1 is testing that handshake_req_cancel()
  followed by closing the file actually does call the ->hp_destroy method. Thus the PTR_EQ test
  at the end has to be sure that the final close is complete before it checks the pointer.  We
  cannot use a completion here because if ->hp_destroy is never called (ie, there is an API
  bug) then the test will hang.  Reported by: Guenter Roeck <linux@roeck-us.net>'
