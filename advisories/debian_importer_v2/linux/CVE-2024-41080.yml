summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring: fix
  possible deadlock in io_register_iowq_max_workers()  The io_register_iowq_max_workers() function
  calls io_put_sq_data(), which acquires the sqd->lock without releasing the uring_lock. Similar
  to the commit 009ad9f0c6ee ("io_uring: drop ctx->uring_lock before acquiring sqd->lock"),
  this can lead to a potential deadlock situation.  To resolve this issue, the uring_lock is
  released before calling io_put_sq_data(), and then it is re-acquired after the function call.  This
  change ensures that the locks are acquired in the correct order, preventing the possibility
  of a deadlock.'
