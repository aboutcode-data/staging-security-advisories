summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: sunxi-ng:
  common: Don''t call hw_to_ccu_common on hw without common  In order to set the rate range
  of a hw sunxi_ccu_probe calls hw_to_ccu_common() assuming all entries in desc->ccu_clks are
  contained in a ccu_common struct. This assumption is incorrect and, in consequence, causes
  invalid pointer de-references.  Remove the faulty call. Instead, add one more loop that iterates
  over the ccu_clks and sets the rate range, if required.'
