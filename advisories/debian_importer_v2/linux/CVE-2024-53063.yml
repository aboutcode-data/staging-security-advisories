summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: dvbdev:
  prevent the risk of out of memory access  The dvbdev contains a static variable used to store
  dvb minors.  The behavior of it depends if CONFIG_DVB_DYNAMIC_MINORS is set or not. When not
  set, dvb_register_device() won''t check for boundaries, as it will rely that a previous call
  to dvb_register_adapter() would already be enforcing it.  On a similar way, dvb_device_open()
  uses the assumption that the register functions already did the needed checks.  This can be
  fragile if some device ends using different calls. This also generate warnings on static check
  analysers like Coverity.  So, add explicit guards to prevent potential risk of OOM issues.'
