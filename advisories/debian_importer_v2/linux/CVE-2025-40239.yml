summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: phy: micrel:
  always set shared->phydev for LAN8814  Currently, during the LAN8814 PTP probe shared->phydev
  is only set if PTP clock gets actually set, otherwise the function will return before setting
  it.  This is an issue as shared->phydev is unconditionally being used when IRQ is being handled,
  especially in lan8814_gpio_process_cap and since it was not set it will cause a NULL pointer
  exception and crash the kernel.  So, simply always set shared->phydev to avoid the NULL pointer
  exception.'
