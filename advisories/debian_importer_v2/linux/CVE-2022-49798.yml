summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tracing: Fix
  race where eprobes can be called before the event  The flag that tells the event to call its
  triggers after reading the event is set for eprobes after the eprobe is enabled. This leads
  to a race where the eprobe may be triggered at the beginning of the event where the record
  information is NULL. The eprobe then dereferences the NULL record causing a NULL kernel pointer
  bug.  Test for a NULL record to keep this from happening.'
