summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  octeontx2-pf:
  Fix SQE threshold checking  Current way of checking available SQE count which is based on
  HW updated SQB count could result in driver submitting an SQE even before CQE for the previously
  transmitted SQE at the same index is processed in NAPI resulting losing SKB pointers, hence
  a leak. Fix this by checking a consumer index which is updated once CQE is processed.'
