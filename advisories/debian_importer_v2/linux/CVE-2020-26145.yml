  - CVE-2020-26145
summary: An issue was discovered on Samsung Galaxy S3 i9305 4.4.4 devices. The WEP, WPA, WPA2,
  and WPA3 implementations accept second (or subsequent) broadcast fragments even when sent
  in plaintext and process them as full unfragmented frames. An adversary can abuse this to
  inject arbitrary network packets independent of the network configuration.
