summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: nf_set_pipapo:
  fix initial map fill  The initial buffer has to be inited to all-ones, but it must restrict
  it to the size of the first field, not the total field size.  After each round in the map
  search step, the result and the fill map are swapped, so if we have a set where f->bsize of
  the first element is smaller than m->bsize_max, those one-bits are leaked into future rounds
  result map.  This makes pipapo find an incorrect matching results for sets where first field
  size is not the largest.  Followup patch adds a test case to nft_concat_range.sh selftest
  script.  Thanks to Stefano Brivio for pointing out that we need to zero out the remainder
  explicitly, only correcting memset() argument isn''t enough.'
