summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sfc: fix TX channel
  offset when using legacy interrupts  In legacy interrupt mode the tx_channel_offset was hardcoded
  to 1, but that''s not correct if efx_sepparate_tx_channels is false. In that case, the offset
  is 0 because the tx queues are in the single existing channel at index 0, together with the
  rx queue.  Without this fix, as soon as you try to send any traffic, it tries to get the tx
  queues from an uninitialized channel getting these errors:   WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 0 at drivers/net/ethernet/sfc/tx.c:540
