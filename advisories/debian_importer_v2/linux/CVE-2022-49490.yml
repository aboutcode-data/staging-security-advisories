summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/msm/mdp5:
  Return error code in mdp5_pipe_release when deadlock is detected  mdp5_get_global_state runs
  the risk of hitting a -EDEADLK when acquiring the modeset lock, but currently mdp5_pipe_release
  doesn''t check for if an error is returned. Because of this, there is a possibility of mdp5_pipe_release
  hitting a NULL dereference error.  To avoid this, let''s have mdp5_pipe_release check if mdp5_get_global_state
  returns an error and propogate that error.  Changes since v1: - Separated declaration and
  initialization of *new_state to avoid   compiler warning - Fixed some spelling mistakes in
  commit message  Changes since v2: - Return 0 in case where hwpipe is NULL as this is considered
  normal   behavior - Added 2nd patch in series to fix a similar NULL dereference issue in   mdp5_mixer_release  Patchwork:
