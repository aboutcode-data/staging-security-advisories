summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: codec:
  sma1307: Fix memory corruption in sma1307_setting_loaded()  The sma1307->set.header_size is
  how many integers are in the header (there are 8 of them) but instead of allocating space
  of 8 integers we allocate 8 bytes.  This leads to memory corruption when we copy data it on
  the next line:          memcpy(sma1307->set.header, data,                sma1307->set.header_size
  * sizeof(int));  Also since we''re immediately copying over the memory in ->set.header, there
  is no need to zero it in the allocator.  Use devm_kmalloc_array() to allocate the memory instead.'
