summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/CPU/AMD:
  Disable INVLPGB on Zen2  AMD Cyan Skillfish (Family 17h, Model 47h, Stepping 0h) has an issue
  that causes system oopses and panics when performing TLB flush using INVLPGB.  However, the
  problem is that that machine has misconfigured CPUID and should not report the INVLPGB bit
  in the first place. So zap the kernel''s representation of the flag so that nothing gets confused.    [
