summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  EDAC/skx_common:
  Fix general protection fault  After loading i10nm_edac (which automatically loads skx_edac_common),
  if unload only i10nm_edac, then reload it and perform error injection testing, a general protection
  fault may occur:    mce: [Hardware Error]: Machine check events logged   Oops: general protection
  fault ...   ...   Workqueue: events mce_gen_pool_process   RIP: 0010:string+0x53/0xe0   ...   Call

  [skx_edac_common]   ...  The issue arose was because the variable ''adxl_component_count''
  (inside skx_edac_common), which counts the ADXL components, was not reset. During the reloading
  of i10nm_edac, the count was incremented by the actual number of ADXL components again, resulting
  in a count that was double the real number of ADXL components. This led to an out-of-bounds
  reference to the ADXL component array, causing the general protection fault above.  Fix this
  issue by resetting the ''adxl_component_count'' in adxl_put(), which is called during the
  unloading of {skx,i10nm}_edac.'
