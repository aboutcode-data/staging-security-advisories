  - CVE-2024-35842
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: mediatek:
  sof-common: Add NULL check for normal_link string  It''s not granted that all entries of struct
  sof_conn_stream declare a `normal_link` (a non-SOF, direct link) string, and this is the case
  for SoCs that support only SOF paths (hence do not support both direct and SOF usecases).  For
  example, in the case of MT8188 there is no normal_link string in any of the sof_conn_stream
  entries and there will be more drivers doing that in the future.  To avoid possible NULL pointer
  KPs, add a NULL check for `normal_link`.'
