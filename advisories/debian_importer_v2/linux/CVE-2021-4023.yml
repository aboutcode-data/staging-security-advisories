  - CVE-2021-4023
summary: A flaw was found in the io-workqueue implementation in the Linux kernel versions prior
  to 5.15-rc1. The kernel can panic when an improper cancellation operation triggers the submission
  of new io-uring operations during a shortage of free space. This flaw allows a local user
  with permissions to execute io-uring requests to possibly crash the system.
