summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: tls, fix
  WARNIING in __sk_msg_free  A splice with MSG_SPLICE_PAGES will cause tls code to use the tls_sw_sendmsg_splice
  path in the TLS sendmsg code to move the user provided pages from the msg into the msg_pl.
  This will loop over the msg until msg_pl is full, checked by sk_msg_full(msg_pl). The user
  can also set the MORE flag to hint stack to delay sending until receiving more pages and ideally
  a full buffer.  If the user adds more pages to the msg than can fit in the msg_pl scatterlist
  (MAX_MSG_FRAGS) we should ignore the MORE flag and send the buffer anyways.  What actually
  happens though is we abort the msg to msg_pl scatterlist setup and then because we forget
  to set ''full record'' indicating we can no longer consume data without a send we fallthrough
  to the ''continue'' path which will check if msg_data_left(msg) has more bytes to send and
  then attempts to fit them in the already full msg_pl. Then next iteration of sender doing
  send will encounter a full msg_pl and throw the warning in the syzbot report.  To fix simply
  check if we have a full_record in splice code path and if not send the msg regardless of MORE
  flag.'
