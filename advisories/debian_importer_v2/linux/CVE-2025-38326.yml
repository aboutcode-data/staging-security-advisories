summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  aoe: clean device
  rq_list in aoedev_downdev()  An aoe device''s rq_list contains accepted block requests that
  are waiting to be transmitted to the aoe target. This queue was added as part of the conversion
  to blk_mq. However, the queue was not cleaned out when an aoe device is downed which caused
  blk_mq_freeze_queue() to sleep indefinitely waiting for those requests to complete, causing
  a hang. This fix cleans out the queue before calling blk_mq_freeze_queue().'
