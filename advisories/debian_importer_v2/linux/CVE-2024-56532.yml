summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: us122l:
  Use snd_card_free_when_closed() at disconnection  The USB disconnect callback is supposed
  to be short and not too-long waiting.  OTOH, the current code uses snd_card_free() at disconnection,
  but this waits for the close of all used fds, hence it can take long.  It eventually blocks
  the upper layer USB ioctls, which may trigger a soft lockup.  An easy workaround is to replace
  snd_card_free() with snd_card_free_when_closed().  This variant returns immediately while
  the release of resources is done asynchronously by the card device release at the last close.  The
  loop of us122l->mmap_count check is dropped as well.  The check is useless for the asynchronous
  operation with *_when_closed().'
