summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PCI: s390: Fix
  use-after-free of PCI resources with per-function hotplug  On s390 PCI functions may be hotplugged
  individually even when they belong to a multi-function device. In particular on an SR-IOV
  device VFs may be removed and later re-added.  In commit a50297cf8235 ("s390/pci: separate
  zbus creation from scanning") it was missed however that struct pci_bus and struct zpci_bus''s
  resource list retained a reference to the PCI functions MMIO resources even though those resources
  are released and freed on hot-unplug. These stale resources may subsequently be claimed when
  the PCI function re-appears resulting in use-after-free.  One idea of fixing this use-after-free
  in s390 specific code that was investigated was to simply keep resources around from the moment
  a PCI function first appeared until the whole virtual PCI bus created for a multi-function
  device disappears. The problem with this however is that due to the requirement of artificial
  MMIO addreesses (address cookies) extra logic is then needed to keep the address cookies compatible
  on re-plug. At the same time the MMIO resources semantically belong to the PCI function so
  tying their lifecycle to the function seems more logical.  Instead a simpler approach is to
  remove the resources of an individually hot-unplugged PCI function from the PCI bus''s resource
  list while keeping the resources of other PCI functions on the PCI bus untouched.  This is
  done by introducing pci_bus_remove_resource() to remove an individual resource. Similarly
  the resource also needs to be removed from the struct zpci_bus''s resource list. It turns
  out however, that there is really no need to add the MMIO resources to the struct zpci_bus''s
  resource list at all and instead we can simply use the zpci_bar_struct''s resource pointer
  directly.'
