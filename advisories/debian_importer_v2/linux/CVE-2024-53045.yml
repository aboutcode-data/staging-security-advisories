summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: dapm: fix
  bounds checker error in dapm_widget_list_create  The widgets array in the snd_soc_dapm_widget_list
  has a __counted_by attribute attached to it, which points to the num_widgets variable. This
  attribute is used in bounds checking, and if it is not set before the array is filled, then
  the bounds sanitizer will issue a warning or a kernel panic if CONFIG_UBSAN_TRAP is set.  This
  patch sets the size of the widgets list calculated with list_for_each as the initial value
  for num_widgets as it is used for allocating memory for the array. It is updated with the
  actual number of added elements after the array is filled.'
