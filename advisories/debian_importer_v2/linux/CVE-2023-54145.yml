summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: drop unnecessary
  user-triggerable WARN_ONCE in verifierl log  It''s trivial for user to trigger "verifier log
  line truncated" warning, as verifier has a fixed-sized buffer of 1024 bytes (as of now), and
  there are at least two pieces of user-provided information that can be output through this
  buffer, and both can be arbitrarily sized by user:   - BTF names;   - BTF.ext source code
  lines strings.  Verifier log buffer should be properly sized for typical verifier state output.
  But it''s sort-of expected that this buffer won''t be long enough in some circumstances. So
  let''s drop the check. In any case code will work correctly, at worst truncating a part of
  a single line output.'
