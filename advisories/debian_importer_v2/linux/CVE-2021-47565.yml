summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: mpt3sas:
  Fix kernel panic during drive powercycle test  While looping over shost''s sdev list it is
  possible that one of the drives is getting removed and its sas_target object is freed but
  its sdev object remains intact.  Consequently, a kernel panic can occur while the driver is
  trying to access the sas_address field of sas_target object without also checking the sas_target
  object for NULL.'
