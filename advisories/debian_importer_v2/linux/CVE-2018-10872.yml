  - CVE-2018-10872
summary: A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled exceptions delivered after a stack
  switch operation via Mov SS or Pop SS instructions. During the stack switch operation, processor
  does not deliver interrupts and exceptions, they are delivered once the first instruction
  after the stack switch is executed. An unprivileged system user could use this flaw to crash
  the system kernel resulting in DoS. This CVE-2018-10872 was assigned due to regression of
  CVE-2018-8897 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.10 GA kernel. No other versions are affected by
  this CVE.
