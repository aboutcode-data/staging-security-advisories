summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: gs_usb:
  gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): unanchor URL on usb_submit_urb() error  In commit 7352e1d5932a
  ("can: gs_usb: gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): fix URB memory leak"), the URB was re-anchored
  before usb_submit_urb() in gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback() to prevent a leak of this URB during
  cleanup.  However, this patch did not take into account that usb_submit_urb() could fail.
  The URB remains anchored and usb_kill_anchored_urbs(&parent->rx_submitted) in gs_can_close()
  loops infinitely since the anchor list never becomes empty.  To fix the bug, unanchor the
  URB when an usb_submit_urb() error occurs, also print an info message.'
