summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Skip scalar
  adjustment for BPF_NEG if dst is a pointer  In check_alu_op(), the verifier currently calls
  check_reg_arg() and adjust_scalar_min_max_vals() unconditionally for BPF_NEG operations. However,
  if the destination register holds a pointer, these scalar adjustments are unnecessary and
  potentially incorrect.  This patch adds a check to skip the adjustment logic when the destination
  register contains a pointer.'
