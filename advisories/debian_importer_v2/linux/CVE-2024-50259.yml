summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netdevsim: Add
  trailing zero to terminate the string in nsim_nexthop_bucket_activity_write()  This was found
  by a static analyzer. We should not forget the trailing zero after copy_from_user() if we
  will further do some string operations, sscanf() in this case. Adding a trailing zero will
  ensure that the function performs properly.'
