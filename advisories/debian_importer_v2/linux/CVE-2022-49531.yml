summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  loop: implement
  ->free_disk  Ensure that the lo_device which is stored in the gendisk private data is valid

  device is not freed when it is still in use, but to to fix a potential deadlock this will
  be relaxed a bit soon.'
