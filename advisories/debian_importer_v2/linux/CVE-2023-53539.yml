summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/rxe: Fix
  incomplete state save in rxe_requester  If a send packet is dropped by the IP layer in rxe_requester()
  the call to rxe_xmit_packet() can fail with err == -EAGAIN. To recover, the state of the wqe
  is restored to the state before the packet was sent so it can be resent. However, the routines
  that save and restore the state miss a significnt part of the variable state in the wqe, the
  dma struct which is used to process through the sge table. And, the state is not saved before
  the packet is built which modifies the dma struct.  Under heavy stress testing with many QPs
  on a fast node sending large messages to a slow node dropped packets are observed and the
  resent packets are corrupted because the dma struct was not restored. This patch fixes this
  behavior and allows the test cases to succeed.'
