summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dma-buf/sync_file:
  Don''t leak fences on merge failure  Each add_fence() call does a dma_fence_get() on the relevant
  fence.  In the error path, we weren''t calling dma_fence_put() so all those fences got leaked.  Also,
  in the krealloc_array failure case, we weren''t freeing the fences array.  Instead, ensure
  that i and fences are always zero-initialized and dma_fence_put() all the fences and kfree(fences)
  on every error path.'
