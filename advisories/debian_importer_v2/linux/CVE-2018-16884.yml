  - CVE-2018-16884
summary: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's NFS41+ subsystem. NFS41+ shares mounted in different
  network namespaces at the same time can make bc_svc_process() use wrong back-channel IDs and
  cause a use-after-free vulnerability. Thus a malicious container user can cause a host kernel
  memory corruption and a system panic. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation
  cannot be fully ruled out.
