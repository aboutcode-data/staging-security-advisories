summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  kernel/kexec:
  fix IMA when allocation happens in CMA area  *** Bug description ***  When I tested kexec
  with the latest kernel, I ran into the following warning:  [   40.712410] ------------[ cut
  here ]------------ [   40.712576] WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 1562 at kernel/kexec_core.c:1001 kimage_map_segment+0x144/0x198
  [...] [   40.816047] Call trace: [   40.818498]  kimage_map_segment+0x144/0x198 (P) [   40.823221]  ima_kexec_post_load+0x58/0xc0
  [   40.827246]  __do_sys_kexec_file_load+0x29c/0x368 [...] [   40.855423] ---[ end trace 0000000000000000
  ]---  *** How to reproduce ***  This bug is only triggered when the kexec target address is
  allocated in the CMA area. If no CMA area is reserved in the kernel, use the "cma=" option
  in the kernel command line to reserve one.  *** Root cause *** The commit 07d24902977e ("kexec:
  enable CMA based contiguous allocation") allocates the kexec target address directly on the
  CMA area to avoid copying during the jump. In this case, there is no IND_SOURCE for the kexec
  segment.  But the current implementation of kimage_map_segment() assumes that IND_SOURCE pages
  exist and map them into a contiguous virtual address by vmap().  *** Solution *** If IMA segment
  is allocated in the CMA area, use its page_address() directly.'
