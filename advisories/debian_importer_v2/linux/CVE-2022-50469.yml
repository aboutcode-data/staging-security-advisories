summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  staging: rtl8723bs:
  fix potential memory leak in rtw_init_drv_sw()  In rtw_init_drv_sw(), there are various init
  functions are called to populate the padapter structure and some checks for their return value.
  However, except for the first one error path, the other five error paths do not properly release
  the previous allocated resources, which leads to various memory leaks.  This patch fixes them
  and keeps the success and error separate. Note that these changes keep the form of `rtw_init_drv_sw()`
  in "drivers/staging/r8188eu/os_dep/os_intfs.c". As there is no proper device to test with,
  no runtime testing was performed.'
