summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: codecs:
  wcd938x: fix incorrect used of portid  Mixer controls have the channel id in mixer->reg, which
  is not same as port id. port id should be derived from chan_info array. So fix this. Without

  out of range with channel id instead of port id.'
