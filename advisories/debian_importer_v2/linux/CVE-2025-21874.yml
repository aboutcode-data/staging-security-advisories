summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dm-integrity:
  Avoid divide by zero in table status in Inline mode  In Inline mode, the journal is unused,
  and journal_sectors is zero.  Calculating the journal watermark requires dividing by journal_sectors,
  which should be done only if the journal is configured.  Otherwise, a simple table query (dmsetup
  table) can cause OOPS.  This bug did not show on some systems, perhaps only due to compiler
  optimization.  On my 32-bit testing machine, this reliably crashes with the following:   :
  Oops: divide error: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP  : CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 2450 Comm: dmsetup Not tainted
  6.14.0-rc2+ #959  : EIP: dm_integrity_status+0x2f8/0xab0 [dm_integrity]  ...'
