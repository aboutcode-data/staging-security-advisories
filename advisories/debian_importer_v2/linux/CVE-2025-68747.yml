summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/panthor:
  Fix UAF on kernel BO VA nodes  If the MMU is down, panthor_vm_unmap_range() might return an
  error. We expect the page table to be updated still, and if the MMU is blocked, the rest of
  the GPU should be blocked too, so no risk of accessing physical memory returned to the system
  (which the current code doesn''t cover for anyway).  Proceed with the rest of the cleanup
  instead of bailing out and leaving the va_node inserted in the drm_mm, which leads to UAF
  when other adjacent nodes are removed from the drm_mm tree.'
