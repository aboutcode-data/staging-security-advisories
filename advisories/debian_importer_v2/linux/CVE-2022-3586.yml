aliases:
  - CVE-2022-3586
summary: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s networking code. A use-after-free was found
  in the way the sch_sfb enqueue function used the socket buffer (SKB) cb field after the same
  SKB had been enqueued (and freed) into a child qdisc. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged
  user to crash the system, causing a denial of service.
