  - CVE-2021-3492
summary: Shiftfs, an out-of-tree stacking file system included in Ubuntu Linux kernels, did
  not properly handle faults occurring during copy_from_user() correctly. These could lead to
  either a double-free situation or memory not being freed at all. An attacker could use this
  to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion) or gain privileges via executing arbitrary
  code. AKA ZDI-CAN-13562.
