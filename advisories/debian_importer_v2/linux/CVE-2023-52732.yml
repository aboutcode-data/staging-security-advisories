  - CVE-2023-52732
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ceph: blocklist
  the kclient when receiving corrupted snap trace  When received corrupted snap trace we don''t
  know what exactly has happened in MDS side. And we shouldn''t continue IOs and metadatas access
  to MDS, which may corrupt or get incorrect contents.  This patch will just block all the further
  IO/MDS requests immediately and then evict the kclient itself.  The reason why we still need
  to evict the kclient just after blocking all the further IOs is that the MDS could revoke
  the caps faster.'
