summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: phy: dp83822:
  Fix null pointer access on DP83825/DP83826 devices  The probe() function is only used for
  the DP83822 PHY, leaving the private data pointer uninitialized for the smaller DP83825/26
  models. While all uses of the private data structure are hidden in 82822 specific callbacks,
  configuring the interrupt is shared across all models. This causes a NULL pointer dereference
  on the smaller PHYs as it accesses the private data unchecked. Verifying the pointer avoids
  that.'
