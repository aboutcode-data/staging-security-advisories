summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  md: avoid repeated
  calls to del_gendisk  There is a uaf problem which is found by case 23rdev-lifetime:  Oops:
  general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdead000000000122 RIP: 0010:bdi_unregister+0x4b/0x170
  Call Trace:  <TASK>  __del_gendisk+0x356/0x3e0  mddev_unlock+0x351/0x360  rdev_attr_store+0x217/0x280  kernfs_fop_write_iter+0x14a/0x210  vfs_write+0x29e/0x550  ksys_write+0x74/0xf0  do_syscall_64+0xbb/0x380  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f
  RIP: 0033:0x7ff5250a177e  The sequence is: 1. rdev remove path gets reconfig_mutex 2. rdev
  remove path release reconfig_mutex in mddev_unlock 3. md stop calls do_md_stop and sets MD_DELETED
  4. rdev remove path calls del_gendisk because MD_DELETED is set 5. md stop path release reconfig_mutex
  and calls del_gendisk again  So there is a race condition we should resolve. This patch adds
  a flag MD_DO_DELETE to avoid the race condition.'
