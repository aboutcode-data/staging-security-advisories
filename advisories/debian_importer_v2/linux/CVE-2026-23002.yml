summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  lib/buildid:
  use __kernel_read() for sleepable context  Prevent a "BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer
  dereference in filemap_read_folio".  For the sleepable context, convert freader to use __kernel_read()
  instead of direct page cache access via read_cache_folio().  This simplifies the faultable
  code path by using the standard kernel file reading interface which handles all the complexity
  of reading file data.  At the moment we are not changing the code for non-sleepable context
  which uses filemap_get_folio() and only succeeds if the target folios are already in memory
  and up-to-date.  The reason is to keep the patch simple and easier to backport to stable kernels.  Syzbot
  repro does not crash the kernel anymore and the selftests run successfully.  In the follow
  up we will make __kernel_read() with IOCB_NOWAIT work for non-sleepable contexts.  In addition,
  I would like to replace the secretmem check with a more generic approach and will add fstest
  for the buildid code.'
