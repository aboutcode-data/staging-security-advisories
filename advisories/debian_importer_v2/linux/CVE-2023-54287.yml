summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tty: serial:\
  \ imx: disable Ageing Timer interrupt request irq  There maybe pending USR interrupt before\
  \ requesting irq, however uart_add_one_port has not executed, so there will be kernel panic:\
  \ [    0.795668] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual addre ss 0000000000000080\

  \ [    0.872283] lr : imx_uart_int+0xf8/0x1ec  The issue only happends in the inmate linux\
  \ when Jailhouse hypervisor enabled. The test procedure is: while true; do \tjailhouse enable\
  \ imx8mp.cell \tjailhouse cell linux xxxx \tsleep 10 \tjailhouse cell destroy 1 \tjailhouse\
  \ disable \tsleep 5 done  And during the upper test, press keys to the 2nd linux console.\
  \ When `jailhouse cell destroy 1`, the 2nd linux has no chance to put the uart to a quiese\
  \ state, so USR1/2 may has pending interrupts. Then when `jailhosue cell linux xx` to start\
  \ 2nd linux again, the issue trigger.  In order to disable irqs before requesting them, both\
  \ UCR1 and UCR2 irqs should be disabled, so here fix that, disable the Ageing Timer interrupt\
  \ in UCR2 as UCR1 does."
