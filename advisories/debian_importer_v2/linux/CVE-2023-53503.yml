summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: allow ext4_get_group_info()
  to fail  Previously, ext4_get_group_info() would treat an invalid group number as BUG(), since
  in theory it should never happen.  However, if a malicious attaker (or fuzzer) modifies the
  superblock via the block device while it is the file system is mounted, it is possible for
  s_first_data_block to get set to a very large number.  In that case, when calculating the
  block group of some block number (such as the starting block of a preallocation region), could
  result in an underflow and very large block group number.  Then the BUG_ON check in ext4_get_group_info()
  would fire, resutling in a denial of service attack that can be triggered by root or someone
  with write access to the block device.  For a quality of implementation perspective, it''s
  best that even if the system administrator does something that they shouldn''t, that it will
  not trigger a BUG.  So instead of BUG''ing, ext4_get_group_info() will call ext4_error and
  return NULL.  We also add fallback code in all of the callers of ext4_get_group_info() that
  it might NULL.  Also, since ext4_get_group_info() was already borderline to be an inline function,
  un-inline it.  The results in a next reduction of the compiled text size of ext4 by roughly
  2k.'
