  - CVE-2021-46932
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Input: appletouch
  - initialize work before device registration  Syzbot has reported warning in __flush_work().
  This warning is caused by work->func == NULL, which means missing work initialization.  This
  may happen, since input_dev->close() calls cancel_work_sync(&dev->work), but dev->work initalization
  happens _after_ input_register_device() call.  So this patch moves dev->work initialization
  before registering input device'
