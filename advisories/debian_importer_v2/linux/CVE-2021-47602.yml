summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mac80211: track
  only QoS data frames for admission control  For admission control, obviously all of that only
  works for QoS data frames, otherwise we cannot even access the QoS field in the header.  Syzbot
  reported (see below) an uninitialized value here due to a status of a non-QoS nullfunc packet,
  which isn''t even long enough to contain the QoS header.  Fix this to only do anything for
  QoS data packets.'
