  - CVE-2023-52458
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  block: add check
  that partition length needs to be aligned with block size  Before calling add partition or
  resize partition, there is no check on whether the length is aligned with the logical block
  size. If the logical block size of the disk is larger than 512 bytes, then the partition size
  maybe not the multiple of the logical block size, and when the last sector is read, bio_truncate()
  will adjust the bio size, resulting in an IO error if the size of the read command is smaller
  than the logical block size.If integrity data is supported, this will also result in a null
  pointer dereference when calling bio_integrity_free.'
