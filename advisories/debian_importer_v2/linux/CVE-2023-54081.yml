summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xen: speed up
  grant-table reclaim  When a grant entry is still in use by the remote domain, Linux must put
  it on a deferred list.  Normally, this list is very short, because the PV network and block
  protocols expect the backend to unmap the grant first.  However, Qubes OS''s GUI protocol
  is subject to the constraints of the X Window System, and as such winds up with the frontend
  unmapping the window first.  As a result, the list can grow very large, resulting in a massive
  memory leak and eventual VM freeze.  To partially solve this problem, make the number of entries
  that the VM will attempt to free at each iteration tunable.  The default is still 10, but
  it can be overridden via a module parameter.  This is Cc: stable because (when combined with
  appropriate userspace changes) it fixes a severe performance and stability problem for Qubes
  OS users.'
