summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: reject
  invalid reloc tree root keys with stack dump  [BUG] Syzbot reported a crash that an ASSERT()
  got triggered inside prepare_to_merge().  That ASSERT() makes sure the reloc tree is properly
  pointed back by its subvolume tree.  [CAUSE] After more debugging output, it turns out we
  had an invalid reloc tree:    BTRFS error (device loop1): reloc tree mismatch, root 8 has
  no reloc root, expect reloc root key (-8, 132, 8) gen 17  Note the above root key is (TREE_RELOC_OBJECTID,
  ROOT_ITEM, QUOTA_TREE_OBJECTID), meaning it''s a reloc tree for quota tree.  But reloc trees
  can only exist for subvolumes, as for non-subvolume trees, we just COW the involved tree block,
  no need to create a reloc tree since those tree blocks won''t be shared with other trees.  Only
  subvolumes tree can share tree blocks with other trees (thus they have BTRFS_ROOT_SHAREABLE
  flag).  Thus this new debug output proves my previous assumption that corrupted on-disk data
  can trigger that ASSERT().  [FIX] Besides the dedicated fix and the graceful exit, also let
  tree-checker to check such root keys, to make sure reloc trees can only exist for subvolumes.'
