summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mshv: Fix create
  memory region overlap check  The current check is incorrect; it only checks if the beginning
  or end of a region is within an existing region. This doesn''t account for userspace specifying
  a region that begins before and ends after an existing region.  Change the logic to a range
  intersection check against gfns and uaddrs for each region.  Remove mshv_partition_region_by_uaddr()
  as it is no longer used.'
