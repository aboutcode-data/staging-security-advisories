summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/platform/uv:
  Use alternate source for socket to node data  The UV code attempts to build a set of tables
  to allow it to do bidirectional socket<=>node lookups.  But when nr_cpus is set to a smaller
  number than actually present, the cpu_to_node() mapping information for unused CPUs is not
  available to build_socket_tables(). This results in skipping some nodes or sockets when creating
  the tables and leaving some -1''s for later code to trip. over, causing oopses.  The problem
  is that the socket<=>node lookups are created by doing a loop over all CPUs, then looking
  up the CPU''s APICID and socket. But if a CPU is not present, there is no way to start this
  lookup.  Instead of looping over all CPUs, take CPUs out of the equation entirely. Loop over
  all APICIDs which are mapped to a valid NUMA node. Then just extract the socket-id from the
  APICID.  This avoid tripping over disabled CPUs.'
