  - CVE-2021-31916
summary: An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory write flaw was found in list_devices in drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c
  in the Multi-device driver module in the Linux kernel before 5.12. A bound check failure allows
  an attacker with special user (CAP_SYS_ADMIN) privilege to gain access to out-of-bounds memory
  leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information. The highest threat from
  this vulnerability is to system availability.
