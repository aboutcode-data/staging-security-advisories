summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gpiolib: fix
  race condition for gdev->srcu  If two drivers were calling gpiochip_add_data_with_key(), one
  may be traversing the srcu-protected list in gpio_name_to_desc(), meanwhile other has just
  added its gdev in gpiodev_add_to_list_unlocked(). This creates a non-mutexed and non-protected
  timeframe, when one instance is dereferencing and using &gdev->srcu, before the other has
  initialized it, resulting in crash:  [    4.935481] Unable to handle kernel paging request
