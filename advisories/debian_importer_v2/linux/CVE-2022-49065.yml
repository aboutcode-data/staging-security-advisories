summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  SUNRPC: Fix the
  svc_deferred_event trace class  Fix a NULL deref crash that occurs when an svc_rqst is deferred
  while the sunrpc tracing subsystem is enabled. svc_revisit() sets dr->xprt to NULL, so it
  can''t be relied upon in the tracepoint to provide the remote''s address.  Unfortunately we
  can''t revert the "svc_deferred_class" hunk in commit ece200ddd54b ("sunrpc: Save remote presentation
  address in svc_xprt for trace events") because there is now a specific check of event format
  specifiers for unsafe dereferences. The warning that check emits is:    event svc_defer_recv
  has unsafe dereference of argument 1  A "%pISpc" format specifier with a "struct sockaddr
  *" is indeed flagged by this check.  Instead, take the brute-force approach used by the svcrdma_qp_error
  tracepoint. Convert the dr::addr field into a presentation address in the TP_fast_assign()
  arm of the trace event, and store that as a string. This fix can be backported to -stable
  kernels.  In the meantime, commit c6ced22997ad ("tracing: Update print fmt check to handle
  new __get_sockaddr() macro") is now in v5.18, so this wonky fix can be replaced with __sockaddr()
  and friends properly during the v5.19 merge window.'
