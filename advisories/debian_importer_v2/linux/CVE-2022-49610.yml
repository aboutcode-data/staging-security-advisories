summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: VMX: Prevent
  RSB underflow before vmenter  On VMX, there are some balanced returns between the time the
  guest''s SPEC_CTRL value is written, and the vmenter.  Balanced returns (matched by a preceding
  call) are usually ok, but it''s at least theoretically possible an NMI with a deep call stack
  could empty the RSB before one of the returns.  For maximum paranoia, don''t allow *any* returns
  (balanced or otherwise) between the SPEC_CTRL write and the vmenter.    [ bp: Fix 32-bit build.
