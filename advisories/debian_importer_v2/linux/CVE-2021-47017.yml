summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ath10k: Fix a
  use after free in ath10k_htc_send_bundle  In ath10k_htc_send_bundle, the bundle_skb could
  be freed by dev_kfree_skb_any(bundle_skb). But the bundle_skb is used later by bundle_skb->len.  As
  skb_len = bundle_skb->len, my patch replaces bundle_skb->len to skb_len after the bundle_skb
  was freed.'
