summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/rmap: fix
  potential out-of-bounds page table access during batched unmap  As pointed out by David[1],
  the batched unmap logic in try_to_unmap_one() may read past the end of a PTE table when a
  large folio''s PTE mappings are not fully contained within a single page table.  While this
  scenario might be rare, an issue triggerable from userspace must be fixed regardless of its
  likelihood.  This patch fixes the out-of-bounds access by refactoring the logic into a new
  helper, folio_unmap_pte_batch().  The new helper correctly calculates the safe batch size
  by capping the scan at both the VMA and PMD boundaries.  To simplify the code, it also supports
  partial batching (i.e., any number of pages from 1 up to the calculated safe maximum), as
  there is no strong reason to special-case for fully mapped folios.'
