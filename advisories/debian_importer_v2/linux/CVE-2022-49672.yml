summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: tun: unlink
  NAPI from device on destruction  Syzbot found a race between tun file and device destruction.
  NAPIs live in struct tun_file which can get destroyed before the netdev so we have to del
  them explicitly. The current code is missing deleting the NAPI if the queue was detached first.'
