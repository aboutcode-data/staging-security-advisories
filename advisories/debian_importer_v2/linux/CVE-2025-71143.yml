summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: samsung:
  exynos-clkout: Assign .num before accessing .hws  Commit f316cdff8d67 ("clk: Annotate struct
  clk_hw_onecell_data with __counted_by") annotated the hws member of ''struct clk_hw_onecell_data''
  with __counted_by, which informs the bounds sanitizer (UBSAN_BOUNDS) about the number of elements
  in .hws[], so that it can warn when .hws[] is accessed out of bounds. As noted in that change,
  the __counted_by member must be initialized with the number of elements before the first array
  access happens, otherwise there will be a warning from each access prior to the initialization
  because the number of elements is zero. This occurs in exynos_clkout_probe() due to .num being
  assigned after .hws[] has been accessed:    UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in drivers/clk/samsung/clk-exynos-clkout.c:178:18   index
  0 is out of range for type ''clk_hw *[*]''  Move the .num initialization to before the first
  access of .hws[], clearing up the warning.'
