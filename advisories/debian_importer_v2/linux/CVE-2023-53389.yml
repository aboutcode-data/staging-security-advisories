summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/mediatek:
  dp: Only trigger DRM HPD events if bridge is attached  The MediaTek DisplayPort interface
  bridge driver starts its interrupts as soon as its probed. However when the interrupts trigger
  the bridge might not have been attached to a DRM device. As drm_helper_hpd_irq_event() does
  not check whether the passed in drm_device is valid or not, a NULL pointer passed in results
  in a kernel NULL pointer dereference in it.  Check whether the bridge is attached and only
  trigger an HPD event if it is.'
