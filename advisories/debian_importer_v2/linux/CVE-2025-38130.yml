  - CVE-2025-38130
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/connector:
  only call HDMI audio helper plugged cb if non-null  On driver remove, sound/soc/codecs/hdmi-codec.c
  calls the plugged_cb with NULL as the callback function and codec_dev, as seen in its hdmi_remove
  function.  The HDMI audio helper then happily tries calling said null function pointer, and
  produces an Oops as a result.  Fix this by only executing the callback if fn is non-null.
  This means the .plugged_cb and .plugged_cb_dev members still get appropriately cleared.'
