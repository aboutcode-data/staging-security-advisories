summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath10k:
  shutdown driver when hardware is unreliable  In rare cases, ath10k may lose connection with
  the PCIe bus due to some unknown reasons, which could further lead to system crashes during
  resuming due to watchdog timeout:  ath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: wmi command 20486 timeout, restarting
  hardware ath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: already restarting ath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: failed to stop
  WMI vdev 0: -11 ath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: failed to stop vdev 0: -11 ieee80211 phy0: PM: ****
  DPM device timeout **** Call Trace:  panic+0x125/0x315  dpm_watchdog_set+0x54/0x54  dpm_watchdog_handler+0x57/0x57  call_timer_fn+0x31/0x13c  At
  this point, all WMI commands will timeout and attempt to restart device. So set a threshold
  for consecutive restart failures. If the threshold is exceeded, consider the hardware is unreliable
  and all ath10k operations should be skipped to avoid system crash.  fail_cont_count and pending_recovery
  are atomic variables, and do not involve complex conditional logic. Therefore, even if recovery
  check and reconfig complete are executed concurrently, the recovery mechanism will not be
  broken.  Tested-on: QCA6174 hw3.2 PCI WLAN.RM.4.4.1-00288-QCARMSWPZ-1'
