summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cgroup/cpuset:
  Fix wrong check in update_parent_subparts_cpumask()  It was found that the check to see if
  a partition could use up all the cpus from the parent cpuset in update_parent_subparts_cpumask()
  was incorrect. As a result, it is possible to leave parent with no effective cpu left even
  if there are tasks in the parent cpuset. This can lead to system panic as reported in [1].  Fix
  this probem by updating the check to fail the enabling the partition if parent''s effective_cpus
  is a subset of the child''s cpus_allowed.  Also record the error code when an error happens
  in update_prstate() and add a test case where parent partition and child have the same cpu
  list and parent has task. Enabling partition in the child will fail in this case.  [1] https://www.spinics.net/lists/cgroups/msg36254.html'
