summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: pci: cx23885:
  Fix the error handling in cx23885_initdev()  When the driver fails to call the dma_set_mask(),
  the driver will get the following splat:  [   55.853884] BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in __process_removed_driver+0x3c/0x240
  [   55.854486] Read of size 8 at addr ffff88810de60408 by task modprobe/590 [   55.856822]
  Call Trace: [   55.860327]  __process_removed_driver+0x3c/0x240 [   55.861347]  bus_for_each_dev+0x102/0x160
  [   55.861681]  i2c_del_driver+0x2f/0x50  This is because the driver has initialized the i2c
  related resources in cx23885_dev_setup() but not released them in error handling, fix this
  bug by modifying the error path that jumps after failing to call the dma_set_mask().'
