summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  md/raid10: fix
  leak of ''r10bio->remaining'' for recovery  raid10_sync_request() will add ''r10bio->remaining''
  for both rdev and replacement rdev. However, if the read io fails, recovery_request_write()
  returns without issuing the write io, in this case, end_sync_request() is only called once
  and ''remaining'' is leaked, cause an io hang.  Fix the problem by decreasing ''remaining''
  according to if ''bio'' and ''repl_bio'' is valid.'
