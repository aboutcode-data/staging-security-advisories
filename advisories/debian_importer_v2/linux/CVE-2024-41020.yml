summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  filelock: Fix
  fcntl/close race recovery compat path  When I wrote commit 3cad1bc01041 ("filelock: Remove
  locks reliably when fcntl/close race is detected"), I missed that there are two copies of
  the code I was patching: The normal version, and the version for 64-bit offsets on 32-bit
  kernels. Thanks to Greg KH for stumbling over this while doing the stable backport...  Apply
  exactly the same fix to the compat path for 32-bit kernels.'
