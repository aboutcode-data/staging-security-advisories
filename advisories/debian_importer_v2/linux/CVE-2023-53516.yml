summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  macvlan: add
  forgotten nla_policy for IFLA_MACVLAN_BC_CUTOFF  The previous commit 954d1fa1ac93 ("macvlan:
  Add netlink attribute for broadcast cutoff") added one additional attribute named IFLA_MACVLAN_BC_CUTOFF
  to allow broadcast cutfoff.  However, it forgot to describe the nla_policy at macvlan_policy
  (drivers/net/macvlan.c). Hence, this suppose NLA_S32 (4 bytes) integer can be faked as empty
  (0 bytes) by a malicious user, which could leads to OOB in heap just like CVE-2023-3773.  To
  fix it, this commit just completes the nla_policy description for IFLA_MACVLAN_BC_CUTOFF.
  This enforces the length check and avoids the potential OOB read.'
