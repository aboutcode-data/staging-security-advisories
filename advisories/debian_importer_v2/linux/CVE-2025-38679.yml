summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: venus:
  Fix OOB read due to missing payload bound check  Currently, The event_seq_changed() handler
  processes a variable number of properties sent by the firmware. The number of properties is
  indicated by the firmware and used to iterate over the payload. However, the payload size
  is not being validated against the actual message length.  This can lead to out-of-bounds
  memory access if the firmware provides a property count that exceeds the data available in
  the payload. Such a condition can result in kernel crashes or potential information leaks
  if memory beyond the buffer is accessed.  Fix this by properly validating the remaining size
  of the payload before each property access and updating bounds accordingly as properties are
  parsed.  This ensures that property parsing is safely bounded within the received message
  buffer and protects against malformed or malicious firmware behavior.'
