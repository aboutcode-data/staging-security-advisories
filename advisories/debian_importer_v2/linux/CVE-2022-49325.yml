  - CVE-2022-49325
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tcp: add accessors
  to read/set tp->snd_cwnd  We had various bugs over the years with code breaking the assumption
  that tp->snd_cwnd is greater than zero.  Lately, syzbot reported the WARN_ON_ONCE(!tp->prior_cwnd)
  added in commit 8b8a321ff72c ("tcp: fix zero cwnd in tcp_cwnd_reduction") can trigger, and
  without a repro we would have to spend considerable time finding the bug.  Instead of complaining
  too late, we want to catch where and when tp->snd_cwnd is set to an illegal value.'
