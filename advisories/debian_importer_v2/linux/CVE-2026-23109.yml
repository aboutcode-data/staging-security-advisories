  - CVE-2026-23109
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fs/writeback:
  skip AS_NO_DATA_INTEGRITY mappings in wait_sb_inodes()  Above the while() loop in wait_sb_inodes(),
  we document that we must wait for all pages under writeback for data integrity.  Consequently,
  if a mapping, like fuse, traditionally does not have data integrity semantics, there is no
  need to wait at all; we can simply skip these inodes.  This restores fuse back to prior behavior
  where syncs are no-ops.  This fixes a user regression where if a system is running a faulty
  fuse server that does not reply to issued write requests, this causes wait_sb_inodes() to
  wait forever.'
