  - CVE-2016-9604
summary: It was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.11-rc8 that root can gain direct access
  to an internal keyring, such as '.dns_resolver' in RHEL-7 or '.builtin_trusted_keys' upstream,
  by joining it as its session keyring. This allows root to bypass module signature verification
  by adding a new public key of its own devising to the keyring.
