summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/sched: taprio:
  extend minimum interval restriction to entire cycle too  It is possible for syzbot to side-step
  the restriction imposed by the blamed commit in the Fixes: tag, because the taprio UAPI permits
  a cycle-time different from (and potentially shorter than) the sum of entry intervals.  We
  need one more restriction, which is that the cycle time itself must be larger than N * ETH_ZLEN
  bit times, where N is the number of schedule entries. This restriction needs to apply regardless
  of whether the cycle time came from the user or was the implicit, auto-calculated value, so
  we move the existing "cycle == 0" check outside the "if "(!new->cycle_time)" branch. This
  way covers both conditions and scenarios.  Add a selftest which illustrates the issue triggered
  by syzbot.'
