summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/mediatek:
  hdmi: Perform NULL pointer check for mtk_hdmi_conf  In commit 41ca9caaae0b ("drm/mediatek:
  hdmi: Add check for CEA modes only") a check for CEA modes was added to function mtk_hdmi_bridge_mode_valid()
  in order to address possible issues on MT8167; moreover, with commit c91026a938c2 ("drm/mediatek:
  hdmi: Add optional limit on maximal HDMI mode clock") another similar check was introduced.  Unfortunately
  though, at the time of writing, MT8173 does not provide any mtk_hdmi_conf structure and this
  is crashing the kernel with NULL pointer upon entering mtk_hdmi_bridge_mode_valid(), which
  happens as soon as a HDMI cable gets plugged in.  To fix this regression, add a NULL pointer
  check for hdmi->conf in the said function, restoring HDMI functionality and avoiding NULL
  pointer kernel panics.'
