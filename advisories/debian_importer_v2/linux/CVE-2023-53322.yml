summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: qla2xxx:
  Wait for io return on terminate rport  System crash due to use after free. Current code allows
  terminate_rport_io to exit before making sure all IOs has returned. For FCP-2 device, IO''s
  can hang on in HW because driver has not tear down the session in FW at first sign of cable
  pull. When dev_loss_tmo timer pops, terminate_rport_io is called and upper layer is about
  to free various resources. Terminate_rport_io trigger qla to do the final cleanup, but the
  cleanup might not be fast enough where it leave qla still holding on to the same resource.  Wait
  for IO''s to return to upper layer before resources are freed.'
