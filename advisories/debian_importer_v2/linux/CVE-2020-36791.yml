summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net_sched: keep
  alloc_hash updated after hash allocation  In commit 599be01ee567 ("net_sched: fix an OOB access
  in cls_tcindex") I moved cp->hash calculation before the first tcindex_alloc_perfect_hash(),
  but cp->alloc_hash is left untouched. This difference could lead to another out of bound access.  cp->alloc_hash
  should always be the size allocated, we should update it after this tcindex_alloc_perfect_hash().'
