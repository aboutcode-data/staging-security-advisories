summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: hso: fix
  null-ptr-deref during tty device unregistration  Multiple ttys try to claim the same the minor
  number causing a double unregistration of the same device. The first unregistration succeeds
  but the next one results in a null-ptr-deref.  The get_free_serial_index() function returns
  an available minor number but doesn''t assign it immediately. The assignment is done by the
  caller later. But before this assignment, calls to get_free_serial_index() would return the
  same minor number.  Fix this by modifying get_free_serial_index to assign the minor number
  immediately after one is found to be and rename it to obtain_minor() to better reflect what
  it does. Similary, rename set_serial_by_index() to release_minor() and modify it to free up
  the minor number of the given hso_serial. Every obtain_minor() should have corresponding release_minor()
  call.'
