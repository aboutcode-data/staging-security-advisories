summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: btusb:
  revert use of devm_kzalloc in btusb  This reverts commit 98921dbd00c4e ("Bluetooth: Use devm_kzalloc
  in btusb.c file").  In btusb_probe(), we use devm_kzalloc() to allocate the btusb data. This
  ties the lifetime of all the btusb data to the binding of a driver to one interface, INTF.
  In a driver that binds to other interfaces, ISOC and DIAG, this is an accident waiting to
  happen.  The issue is revealed in btusb_disconnect(), where calling usb_driver_release_interface(&btusb_driver,
  data->intf) will have devm free the data that is also being used by the other interfaces of
  the driver that may not be released yet.  To fix this, revert the use of devm and go back
  to freeing memory explicitly.'
