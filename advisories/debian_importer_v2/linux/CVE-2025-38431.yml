summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  smb: client:
  fix regression with native SMB symlinks  Some users and customers reported that their backup/copy
  tools started to fail when the directory being copied contained symlink targets that the client
  couldn''t parse - even when those symlinks weren''t followed.  Fix this by allowing lstat(2)
  and readlink(2) to succeed even when the client can''t resolve the symlink target, restoring
  old behavior.'
