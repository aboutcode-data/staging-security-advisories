summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: phy: Don''t
  register LEDs for genphy  If a PHY has no driver, the genphy driver is probed/removed directly
  in phy_attach/detach. If the PHY''s ofnode has an "leds" subnode, then the LEDs will be (un)registered
  when probing/removing the genphy driver. This could occur if the leds are for a non-generic
  driver that isn''t loaded for whatever reason. Synchronously removing the PHY device in phy_detach
  leads to the following deadlock:  rtnl_lock() ndo_close()     ...     phy_detach()         phy_remove()             phy_leds_unregister()                 led_classdev_unregister()                     led_trigger_set()                         netdev_trigger_deactivate()                             unregister_netdevice_notifier()                                 rtnl_lock()  There
  is a corresponding deadlock on the open/register side of things (and that one is reported
  by lockdep), but it requires a race while this one is deterministic.  Generic PHYs do not
  support LEDs anyway, so don''t bother registering them.'
