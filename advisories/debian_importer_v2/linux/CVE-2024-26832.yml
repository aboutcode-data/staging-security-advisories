summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm: zswap: fix
  missing folio cleanup in writeback race path  In zswap_writeback_entry(), after we get a folio
  from __read_swap_cache_async(), we grab the tree lock again to check that the swap entry was
  not invalidated and recycled.  If it was, we delete the folio we just added to the swap cache
  and exit.  However, __read_swap_cache_async() returns the folio locked when it is newly allocated,
  which is always true for this path, and the folio is ref''d.  Make sure to unlock and put
  the folio before returning.  This was discovered by code inspection, probably because this
  path handles a race condition that should not happen often, and the bug would not crash the
  system, it will only strand the folio indefinitely.'
