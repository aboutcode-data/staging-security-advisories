summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Do not let
  BPF test infra emit invalid GSO types to stack  Yinhao et al. reported that their fuzzer tool
  was able to trigger a skb_warn_bad_offload() from netif_skb_features() -> gso_features_check().
  When a BPF program - triggered via BPF test infra - pushes the packet to the loopback device
  via bpf_clone_redirect() then mentioned offload warning can be seen. GSO-related features
  are then rightfully disabled.  We get into this situation due to convert___skb_to_skb() setting
  gso_segs and gso_size but not gso_type. Technically, it makes sense that this warning triggers
  since the GSO properties are malformed due to the gso_type. Potentially, the gso_type could
  be marked non-trustworthy through setting it at least to SKB_GSO_DODGY without any other specific
  assumptions, but that also feels wrong given we should not go further into the GSO engine
  in the first place.  The checks were added in 121d57af308d ("gso: validate gso_type in GSO
  handlers") because there were malicious (syzbot) senders that combine a protocol with a non-matching
  gso_type. If we would want to drop such packets, gso_features_check() currently only returns
  feature flags via netif_skb_features(), so one location for potentially dropping such skbs
  could be validate_xmit_unreadable_skb(), but then otoh it would be an additional check in
  the fast-path for a very corner case. Given bpf_clone_redirect() is the only place where BPF
  test infra could emit such packets, lets reject them right there.'
