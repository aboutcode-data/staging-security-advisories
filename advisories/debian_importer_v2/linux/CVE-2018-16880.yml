  - CVE-2018-16880
summary: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's handle_rx() function in the [vhost_net] driver.
  A malicious virtual guest, under specific conditions, can trigger an out-of-bounds write in
  a kmalloc-8 slab on a virtual host which may lead to a kernel memory corruption and a system
  panic. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out. Versions
  from v4.16 and newer are vulnerable.
