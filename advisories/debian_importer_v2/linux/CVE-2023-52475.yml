summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Input: powermate
  - fix use-after-free in powermate_config_complete  syzbot has found a use-after-free bug [1]
  in the powermate driver. This happens when the device is disconnected, which leads to a memory
  free from the powermate_device struct.  When an asynchronous control message completes after
  the kfree and its callback is invoked, the lock does not exist anymore and hence the bug.  Use
  usb_kill_urb() on pm->config to cancel any in-progress requests upon device disconnection.  [1]
