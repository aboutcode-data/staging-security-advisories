summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gfs2: Fix use-after-free
  in gfs2_glock_shrink_scan  The GLF_LRU flag is checked under lru_lock in gfs2_glock_remove_from_lru()
  to remove the glock from the lru list in __gfs2_glock_put().  On the shrink scan path, the
  same flag is cleared under lru_lock but because of cond_resched_lock(&lru_lock) in gfs2_dispose_glock_lru(),
  progress on the put side can be made without deleting the glock from the lru list.  Keep GLF_LRU
  across the race window opened by cond_resched_lock(&lru_lock) to ensure correct behavior on
  both sides - clear GLF_LRU after list_del under lru_lock.'
