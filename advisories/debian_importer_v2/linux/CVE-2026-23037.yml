summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: etas_es58x:
  allow partial RX URB allocation to succeed  When es58x_alloc_rx_urbs() fails to allocate the
  requested number of URBs but succeeds in allocating some, it returns an error code. This causes
  es58x_open() to return early, skipping the cleanup label ''free_urbs'', which leads to the
  anchored URBs being leaked.  As pointed out by maintainer Vincent Mailhol, the driver is designed
  to handle partial URB allocation gracefully. Therefore, partial allocation should not be treated
  as a fatal error.  Modify es58x_alloc_rx_urbs() to return 0 if at least one URB has been allocated,
  restoring the intended behavior and preventing the leak in es58x_open().'
