  - CVE-2017-9605
summary: The vmw_gb_surface_define_ioctl function (accessible via DRM_IOCTL_VMW_GB_SURFACE_CREATE)
  in drivers/gpu/drm/vmwgfx/vmwgfx_surface.c in the Linux kernel through 4.11.4 defines a backup_handle
  variable but does not give it an initial value. If one attempts to create a GB surface, with
  a previously allocated DMA buffer to be used as a backup buffer, the backup_handle variable
  does not get written to and is then later returned to user space, allowing local users to
  obtain sensitive information from uninitialized kernel memory via a crafted ioctl call.
