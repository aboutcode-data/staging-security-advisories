summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bus: fsl-mc:
  fix double-free on mc_dev  The blamed commit tried to simplify how the deallocations are done
  but, in the process, introduced a double-free on the mc_dev variable.  In case the MC device
  is a DPRC, a new mc_bus is allocated and the mc_dev variable is just a reference to one of
  its fields. In this circumstance, on the error path only the mc_bus should be freed.  This
  commit introduces back the following checkpatch warning which is a false-positive.  WARNING:
  kfree(NULL) is safe and this check is probably not required +       if (mc_bus) +               kfree(mc_bus);'
