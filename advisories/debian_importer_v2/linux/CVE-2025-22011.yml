summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ARM: dts: bcm2711:
  Fix xHCI power-domain  During s2idle tests on the Raspberry CM4 the VPU firmware always crashes
  on xHCI power-domain resume:  root@raspberrypi:/sys/power# echo freeze > state [   70.724347]
  xhci_suspend finished [   70.727730] xhci_plat_suspend finished [   70.755624] bcm2835-power
  bcm2835-power: Power grafx off [   70.761127]  USB: Set power to 0  [   74.653040]  USB: Failed
  to set power to 1 (-110)  This seems to be caused because of the mixed usage of raspberrypi-power
  and bcm2835-power at the same time. So avoid the usage of the VPU firmware power-domain driver,
  which prevents the VPU crash.'
