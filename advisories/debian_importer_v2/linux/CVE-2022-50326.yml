summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: airspy:
  fix memory leak in airspy probe  The commit ca9dc8d06ab6 ("media: airspy: respect the DMA
  coherency  rules") moves variable buf from stack to heap, however, it only frees buf in the
  error handling code, missing deallocation in the success path.  Fix this by freeing buf in
  the success path since this variable does not have any references in other code.'
