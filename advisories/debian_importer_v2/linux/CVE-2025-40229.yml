summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/damon/core:
  fix potential memory leak by cleaning ops_filter in damon_destroy_scheme  Currently, damon_destroy_scheme()
  only cleans up the filter list but leaves ops_filter untouched, which could lead to memory
  leaks when a scheme is destroyed.  This patch ensures both filter and ops_filter are properly
  freed in damon_destroy_scheme(), preventing potential memory leaks.'
