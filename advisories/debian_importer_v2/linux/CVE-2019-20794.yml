  - CVE-2019-20794
summary: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 4.18 through 5.6.11 when unprivileged user
  namespaces are allowed. A user can create their own PID namespace, and mount a FUSE filesystem.
  Upon interaction with this FUSE filesystem, if the userspace component is terminated via a
  kill of the PID namespace's pid 1, it will result in a hung task, and resources being permanently
  locked up until system reboot. This can result in resource exhaustion.
