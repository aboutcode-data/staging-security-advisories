summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i2c: piix4: Fix
  a memory leak in the EFCH MMIO support  The recently added support for EFCH MMIO regions introduced
  a memory leak in that code path. The leak is caused by the fact that release_resource() merely
  removes the resource from the tree but does not free its memory. We need to call release_mem_region()
  instead, which does free the memory. As a nice side effect, this brings back some symmetry
  between the legacy and MMIO paths.'
