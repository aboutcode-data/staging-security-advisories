summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  freezer,umh:
  Fix call_usermode_helper_exec() vs SIGKILL  Tetsuo-San noted that commit f5d39b020809 ("freezer,sched:
  Rewrite core freezer logic") broke call_usermodehelper_exec() for the KILLABLE case.  Specifically
  it was missed that the second, unconditional, wait_for_completion() was not optional and ensures
  the on-stack completion is unused before going out-of-scope.'
