summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ublk: clean up
  user copy references on ublk server exit  If a ublk server process releases a ublk char device
  file, any requests dispatched to the ublk server but not yet completed will retain a ref value
  of UBLK_REFCOUNT_INIT. Before commit e63d2228ef83 ("ublk: simplify aborting ublk request"),
  __ublk_fail_req() would decrement the reference count before completing the failed request.
  However, that commit optimized __ublk_fail_req() to call __ublk_complete_rq() directly without
  decrementing the request reference count. The leaked reference count incorrectly allows user
  copy and zero copy operations on the completed ublk request. It also triggers the WARN_ON_ONCE(refcount_read(&io->ref))
  warnings in ublk_queue_reinit() and ublk_deinit_queue(). Commit c5c5eb24ed61 ("ublk: avoid
  ublk_io_release() called after ublk char dev is closed") already fixed the issue for ublk
  devices using UBLK_F_SUPPORT_ZERO_COPY or UBLK_F_AUTO_BUF_REG. However, the reference count
  leak also affects UBLK_F_USER_COPY, the other reference-counted data copy mode. Fix the condition
  in ublk_check_and_reset_active_ref() to include all reference-counted data copy modes. This
  ensures that any ublk requests still owned by the ublk server when it exits have their reference
  counts reset to 0.'
