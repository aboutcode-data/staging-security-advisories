summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  staging: most:
  remove broken i2c driver  The MOST I2C driver has been completely broken for five years without
  anyone noticing so remove the driver from staging.  Specifically, commit 723de0f9171e ("staging:
  most: remove device from interface structure") started requiring drivers to set the interface
  device pointer before registration, but the I2C driver was never updated which results in
  a NULL pointer dereference if anyone ever tries to probe it.'
