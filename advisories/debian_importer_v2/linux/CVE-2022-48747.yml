summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  block: Fix wrong
  offset in bio_truncate()  bio_truncate() clears the buffer outside of last block of bdev,
  however current bio_truncate() is using the wrong offset of page. So it can return the uninitialized
  data.  This happened when both of truncated/corrupted FS and userspace (via bdev) are trying
  to read the last of bdev.'
