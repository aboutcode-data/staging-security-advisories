  - CVE-2025-40024
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vhost: Take a
  reference on the task in struct vhost_task.  vhost_task_create() creates a task and keeps
  a reference to its task_struct. That task may exit early via a signal and its task_struct
  will be released. A pending vhost_task_wake() will then attempt to wake the task and access
  a task_struct which is no longer there.  Acquire a reference on the task_struct while creating
  the thread and release the reference while the struct vhost_task itself is removed. If the
  task exits early due to a signal, then the vhost_task_wake() will still access a valid task_struct.
  The wake is safe and will be skipped in this case.'
