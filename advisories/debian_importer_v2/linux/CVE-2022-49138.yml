summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: hci_event:
  Ignore multiple conn complete events  When one of the three connection complete events is
  received multiple times for the same handle, the device is registered multiple times which
  leads to memory corruptions. Therefore, consequent events for a single connection are ignored.  The
  conn->state can hold different values, therefore HCI_CONN_HANDLE_UNSET is introduced to identify
  new connections. To make sure the events do not contain this or another invalid handle HCI_CONN_HANDLE_MAX
  and checks are introduced.  Buglink: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215497'
