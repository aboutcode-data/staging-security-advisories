summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: hci_qca:
  Use del_timer_sync() before freeing  While looking at a crash report on a timer list being
  corrupted, which usually happens when a timer is freed while still active. This is commonly
  triggered by code calling del_timer() instead of del_timer_sync() just before freeing.  One
  possible culprit is the hci_qca driver, which does exactly that.  Eric mentioned that wake_retrans_timer
  could be rearmed via the work queue, so also move the destruction of the work queue before
  del_timer_sync().'
