summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ptp: vmclock:
  Set driver data before its usage  If vmclock_ptp_register() fails during probing, vmclock_remove()
  is called to clean up the ptp clock and misc device. It uses dev_get_drvdata() to access the
  vmclock state. However the driver data is not yet set at this point.  Assign the driver data
  earlier.'
