summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: oss: Fix
  PCM OSS buffer allocation overflow  We''ve got syzbot reports hitting INT_MAX overflow at
  vmalloc() allocation that is called from snd_pcm_plug_alloc().  Although we apply the restrictions
  to input parameters, it''s based only on the hw_params of the underlying PCM device.  Since
  the PCM OSS layer allocates a temporary buffer for the data conversion, the size may become
  unexpectedly large when more channels or higher rates is given; in the reported case, it went
  over INT_MAX, hence it hits WARN_ON().  This patch is an attempt to avoid such an overflow
  and an allocation for too large buffers.  First off, it adds the limit of 1MB as the upper
  bound for period bytes.  This must be large enough for all use cases, and we really don''t
  want to handle a larger temporary buffer than this size.  The size check is performed at two
  places, where the original period bytes is calculated and where the plugin buffer size is
  calculated.  In addition, the driver uses array_size() and array3_size() for multiplications
  to catch overflows for the converted period size and buffer bytes.'
