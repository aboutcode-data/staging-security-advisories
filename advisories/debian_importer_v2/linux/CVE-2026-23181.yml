summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: sync read
  disk super and set block size  When the user performs a btrfs mount, the block device is not
  set correctly. The user sets the block size of the block device to 0x4000 by executing the
  BLKBSZSET command. Since the block size change also changes the mapping->flags value, this
  further affects the result of the mapping_min_folio_order() calculation.  Let''s analyze the
  following two scenarios:  Scenario 1: Without executing the BLKBSZSET command, the block size
  is 0x1000, and mapping_min_folio_order() returns 0;  Scenario 2: After executing the BLKBSZSET
  command, the block size is 0x4000, and mapping_min_folio_order() returns 2.  do_read_cache_folio()
  allocates a folio before the BLKBSZSET command is executed. This results in the allocated
  folio having an order value of 0. Later, after BLKBSZSET is executed, the block size increases
  to 0x4000, and the mapping_min_folio_order() calculation result becomes 2.  This leads to
  two undesirable consequences:  1. filemap_add_folio() triggers a VM_BUG_ON_FOLIO(folio_order(folio)
  < mapping_min_folio_order(mapping)) assertion.  2. The syzbot report [1] shows a null pointer
  dereference in create_empty_buffers() due to a buffer head allocation failure.  Synchronization
  should be established based on the inode between the BLKBSZSET command and read cache page
  to prevent inconsistencies in block size or mapping flags before and after folio allocation.  [1]
