summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath12k:
  fix invalid access to memory  In ath12k_dp_rx_msdu_coalesce(), rxcb is fetched from skb and
  boolean is_continuation is part of rxcb. Currently, after freeing the skb, the rxcb->is_continuation
  accessed again which is wrong since the memory is already freed. This might lead use-after-free
  error.  Hence, fix by locally defining bool is_continuation from rxcb, so that after freeing
  skb, is_continuation can be used.  Compile tested only.'
