aliases:
  - CVE-2018-7755
summary: An issue was discovered in the fd_locked_ioctl function in drivers/block/floppy.c in
  the Linux kernel through 4.15.7. The floppy driver will copy a kernel pointer to user memory
  in response to the FDGETPRM ioctl. An attacker can send the FDGETPRM ioctl and use the obtained
  kernel pointer to discover the location of kernel code and data and bypass kernel security
  protections such as KASLR.
