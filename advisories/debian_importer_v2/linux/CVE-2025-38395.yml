summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  regulator: gpio:
  Fix the out-of-bounds access to drvdata::gpiods  drvdata::gpiods is supposed to hold an array
  of ''gpio_desc'' pointers. But the memory is allocated for only one pointer. This will lead
  to out-of-bounds access later in the code if ''config::ngpios'' is > 1. So fix the code to
  allocate enough memory to hold ''config::ngpios'' of GPIO descriptors.  While at it, also
  move the check for memory allocation failure to be below the allocation to make it more readable.'
