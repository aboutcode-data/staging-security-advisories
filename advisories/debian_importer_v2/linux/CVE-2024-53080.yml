summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/panthor:
  Lock XArray when getting entries for the VM  Similar to commit cac075706f29 ("drm/panthor:
  Fix race when converting group handle to group object") we need to use the XArray''s internal
  locking when retrieving a vm pointer from there.  v2: Removed part of the patch that was trying
  to protect fetching the heap pointer from XArray, as that operation is protected by the @pool->lock.'
