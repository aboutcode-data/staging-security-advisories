summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  memory: pl353-smc:
  Fix refcount leak bug in pl353_smc_probe()  The break of for_each_available_child_of_node()
  needs a corresponding of_node_put() when the reference ''child'' is not used anymore. Here
  we do not need to call of_node_put() in fail path as ''!match'' means no break.  While the
  of_platform_device_create() will created a new reference by ''child'' but it has considered
  the refcounting.'
