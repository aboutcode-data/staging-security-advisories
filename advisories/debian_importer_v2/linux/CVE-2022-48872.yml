summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  misc: fastrpc:
  Fix use-after-free race condition for maps  It is possible that in between calling fastrpc_map_get()
  until map->fl->lock is taken in fastrpc_free_map(), another thread can call fastrpc_map_lookup()
  and get a reference to a map that is about to be deleted.  Rewrite fastrpc_map_get() to only
  increase the reference count of a map if it''s non-zero. Propagate this to callers so they
  can know if a map is about to be deleted.  Fixes this warning: refcount_t: addition on 0;
  use-after-free. WARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 10100 at lib/refcount.c:25 refcount_warn_saturate ...
  Call trace:  refcount_warn_saturate  [fastrpc_map_get inlined]  [fastrpc_map_lookup inlined]  fastrpc_map_create  fastrpc_internal_invoke  fastrpc_device_ioctl  __arm64_sys_ioctl  invoke_syscall'
