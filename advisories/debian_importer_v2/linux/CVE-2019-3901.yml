  - CVE-2019-3901
summary: A race condition in perf_event_open() allows local attackers to leak sensitive data
  from setuid programs. As no relevant locks (in particular the cred_guard_mutex) are held during
  the ptrace_may_access() call, it is possible for the specified target task to perform an execve()
  syscall with setuid execution before perf_event_alloc() actually attaches to it, allowing
  an attacker to bypass the ptrace_may_access() check and the perf_event_exit_task(current)
  call that is performed in install_exec_creds() during privileged execve() calls. This issue
  affects kernel versions before 4.8.
