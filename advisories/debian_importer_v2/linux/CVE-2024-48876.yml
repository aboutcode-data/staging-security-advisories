summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  stackdepot: fix
  stack_depot_save_flags() in NMI context  Per documentation, stack_depot_save_flags() was meant
  to be usable from NMI context if STACK_DEPOT_FLAG_CAN_ALLOC is unset.  However, it still would
  try to take the pool_lock in an attempt to save a stack trace in the current pool (if space
  is available).  This could result in deadlock if an NMI is handled while pool_lock is already
  held.  To avoid deadlock, only try to take the lock in NMI context and give up if unsuccessful.  The
  documentation is fixed to clearly convey this.'
