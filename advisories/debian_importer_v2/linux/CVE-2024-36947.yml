  leak  simple_recursive_removal() drops the pinning references to all positives in subtree.  For
  the cases when its argument has been kept alive by the pinning alone that''s exactly the right
  thing to do, but here the argument comes from dcache lookup, that needs to be balanced by
  explicit dput().  Fucked-up-by: Al Viro <viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk>'
