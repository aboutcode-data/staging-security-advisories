summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PCI: endpoint:
  pci-epf-test: Fix double free that causes kernel to oops  Fix a kernel oops found while testing
  the stm32_pcie Endpoint driver with handling of PERST# deassertion:  During EP initialization,
  pci_epf_test_alloc_space() allocates all BARs, which are further freed if epc_set_bar() fails
  (for instance, due to no free inbound window).  However, when pci_epc_set_bar() fails, the
  error path:    pci_epc_set_bar() ->     pci_epf_free_space()  does not clear the previous
  assignment to epf_test->reg[bar].  Then, if the host reboots, the PERST# deassertion restarts
  the BAR allocation sequence with the same allocation failure (no free inbound window), creating
  a double free situation since epf_test->reg[bar] was deallocated and is still non-NULL.  Thus,
  make sure that pci_epf_alloc_space() and pci_epf_free_space() invocations are symmetric, and
  as such, set epf_test->reg[bar] to NULL when memory is freed.  [kwilczynski: commit log]'
