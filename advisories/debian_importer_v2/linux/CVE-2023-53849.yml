summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/msm: fix
  workqueue leak on bind errors  Make sure to destroy the workqueue also in case of early errors
  during bind (e.g. a subcomponent failing to bind).  Since commit c3b790ea07a1 ("drm: Manage
  drm_mode_config_init with drmm_") the mode config will be freed when the drm device is released
  also when using the legacy interface, but add an explicit cleanup for consistency and to facilitate
  backporting.  Patchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/525093/'
