  - CVE-2023-53559
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ip_vti: fix potential
  slab-use-after-free in decode_session6  When ip_vti device is set to the qdisc of the sfb
  type, the cb field of the sent skb may be modified during enqueuing. Then, slab-use-after-free
  may occur when ip_vti device sends IPv6 packets. As commit f855691975bb ("xfrm6: Fix the nexthdr
  offset in _decode_session6.") showed, xfrm_decode_session was originally intended only for
  the receive path. IP6CB(skb)->nhoff is not set during transmission. Therefore, set the cb
  field in the skb to 0 before sending packets.'
