summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: appletb-kbd:
  fix "appletb_backlight" backlight device reference counting  During appletb_kbd_probe, probe
  attempts to get the backlight device by name. When this happens backlight_device_get_by_name
  looks for a device in the backlight class which has name "appletb_backlight" and upon finding
  a match it increments the reference count for the device and returns it to the caller. However
  this reference is never released leading to a reference leak.  Fix this by decrementing the
  backlight device reference count on removal via put_device and on probe failure.'
