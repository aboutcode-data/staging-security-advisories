summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cxl/region: Fix
  decoder allocation crash  When an intermediate port''s decoders have been exhausted by existing
  regions, and creating a new region with the port in question in it''s hierarchical path is
  attempted, cxl_port_attach_region() fails to find a port decoder (as would be expected), and
  drops into the failure / cleanup path.  However, during cleanup of the region reference, a
  sanity check attempts to dereference the decoder, which in the above case didn''t exist. This
  causes a NULL pointer dereference BUG.  To fix this, refactor the decoder allocation and de-allocation
  into helper routines, and in this ''free'' routine, check that the decoder, @cxld, is valid
  before attempting any operations on it.'
