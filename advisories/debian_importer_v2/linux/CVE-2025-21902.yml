summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  acpi: typec:
  ucsi: Introduce a ->poll_cci method  For the ACPI backend of UCSI the UCSI "registers" are
  just a memory copy of the register values in an opregion. The ACPI implementation in the BIOS
  ensures that the opregion contents are synced to the embedded controller and it ensures that
  the registers (in particular CCI) are synced back to the opregion on notifications. While
  there is an ACPI call that syncs the actual registers to the opregion there is rarely a need
  to do this and on some ACPI implementations it actually breaks in various interesting ways.  The
  only reason to force a sync from the embedded controller is to poll CCI while notifications
  are disabled. Only the ucsi core knows if this is the case and guessing based on the current
  command is suboptimal, i.e. leading to the following spurious assertion splat:  WARNING: CPU:

  introduce a ->poll_cci() method that works like ->read_cci() with an additional forced sync
  and document that this should be used when polling with notifications disabled. For all other
  backends that presumably don''t have this issue use the same implementation for both methods.'
