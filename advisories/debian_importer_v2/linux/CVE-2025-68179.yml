summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  s390: Disable
  ARCH_WANT_OPTIMIZE_HUGETLB_VMEMMAP  As reported by Luiz Capitulino enabling HVO on s390 leads
  to reproducible crashes. The problem is that kernel page tables are modified without flushing
  corresponding TLB entries.  Even if it looks like the empty flush_tlb_all() implementation
  on s390 is the problem, it is actually a different problem: on s390 it is not allowed to replace
  an active/valid page table entry with another valid page table entry without the detour over
  an invalid entry. A direct replacement may lead to random crashes and/or data corruption.  In
  order to invalidate an entry special instructions have to be used (e.g. ipte or idte). Alternatively
  there are also special instructions available which allow to replace a valid entry with a
  different valid entry (e.g. crdte or cspg).  Given that the HVO code currently does not provide
  the hooks to allow for an implementation which is compliant with the s390 architecture requirements,
  disable ARCH_WANT_OPTIMIZE_HUGETLB_VMEMMAP again, which is basically a revert of the original
  patch which enabled it.'
