summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  arm64: mte: Do
  not warn if the page is already tagged in copy_highpage()  The arm64 copy_highpage() assumes
  that the destination page is newly allocated and not MTE-tagged (PG_mte_tagged unset) and
  warns accordingly. However, following commit 060913999d7a ("mm: migrate: support poisoned
  recover from migrate folio"), folio_mc_copy() is called before __folio_migrate_mapping().
  If the latter fails (-EAGAIN), the copy will be done again to the same destination page. Since
  copy_highpage() already set the PG_mte_tagged flag, this second copy will warn.  Replace the
  WARN_ON_ONCE(page already tagged) in the arm64 copy_highpage() with a comment.'
