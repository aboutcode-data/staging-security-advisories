summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  be2net: pass
  wrb_params in case of OS2BMC  be_insert_vlan_in_pkt() is called with the wrb_params argument
  being NULL at be_send_pkt_to_bmc() call site.  This may lead to dereferencing a NULL pointer
  when processing a workaround for specific packet, as commit bc0c3405abbb ("be2net: fix a Tx
  stall bug caused by a specific ipv6 packet") states.  The correct way would be to pass the
  wrb_params from be_xmit().'
