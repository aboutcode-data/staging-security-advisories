summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HSI: ssi_protocol:
  Fix use after free vulnerability in ssi_protocol Driver Due to Race Condition  In the ssi_protocol_probe()
  function, &ssi->work is bound with ssip_xmit_work(), In ssip_pn_setup(), the ssip_pn_xmit()
  function within the ssip_pn_ops structure is capable of starting the work.  If we remove the
  module which will call ssi_protocol_remove() to make a cleanup, it will free ssi through kfree(ssi),
  while the work mentioned above will be used. The sequence of operations that may lead to a
  UAF bug is as follows:  CPU0                                    CPU1                          |
  ssip_xmit_work ssi_protocol_remove     | kfree(ssi);             |                         |
  struct hsi_client *cl = ssi->cl;                         | // use ssi  Fix it by ensuring
  that the work is canceled before proceeding with the cleanup in ssi_protocol_remove().'
