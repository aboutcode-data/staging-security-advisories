summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: don''t
  set up encryption key during jbd2 transaction  Commit a80f7fcf1867 ("ext4: fixup ext4_fc_track_*
  functions'' signature") extended the scope of the transaction in ext4_unlink() too far, making
  it include the call to ext4_find_entry().  However, ext4_find_entry() can deadlock when called
  from within a transaction because it may need to set up the directory''s encryption key.  Fix
  this by restoring the transaction to its original scope.'
