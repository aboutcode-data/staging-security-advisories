summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  igc: Reduce TSN
  TX packet buffer from 7KB to 5KB per queue  The previous 7 KB per queue caused TX unit hangs
  under heavy timestamping load. Reducing to 5 KB avoids these hangs and matches the TSN recommendation
  in I225/I226 SW User Manual Section 7.5.4.  The 8 KB "freed" by this change is currently unused.
  This reduction is not expected to impact throughput, as the i226 is PCIe-limited for small
  TSN packets rather than TX-buffer-limited.'
