summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: at76c50x:
  fix use after free access in at76_disconnect  The memory pointed to by priv is freed at the
  end of at76_delete_device function (using ieee80211_free_hw). But the code then accesses the
  udev field of the freed object to put the USB device. This may also lead to a memory leak
  of the usb device. Fix this by using udev from interface.'
