summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ACPICA: Avoid
  walking the Namespace if start_node is NULL  Although commit 0c9992315e73 ("ACPICA: Avoid
  walking the ACPI Namespace if it is not there") fixed the situation when both start_node and
  acpi_gbl_root_node are NULL, the Linux kernel mainline now still crashed on Honor Magicbook
  14 Pro [1].  That happens due to the access to the member of parent_node in acpi_ns_get_next_node().  The
  NULL pointer dereference will always happen, no matter whether or not the start_node is equal
  to ACPI_ROOT_OBJECT, so move the check of start_node being NULL out of the if block.  Unfortunately,
  all the attempts to contact Honor have failed, they refused to provide any technical support
  for Linux.  The bad DSDT table''s dump could be found on GitHub [2].  DMI: HONOR FMB-P/FMB-P-PCB,
  BIOS 1.13 05/08/2025  [ rjw: Subject adjustment, changelog edits ]'
