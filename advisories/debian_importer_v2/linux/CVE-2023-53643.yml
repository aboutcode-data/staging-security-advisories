  - CVE-2023-53643
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nvme-tcp: don''t
  access released socket during error recovery  While the error recovery work is temporarily
  failing reconnect attempts, running the ''nvme list'' command causes a kernel NULL pointer
  dereference by calling getsockname() with a released socket.  During error recovery work,
  the nvme tcp socket is released and a new one created, so it is not safe to access the socket
  without proper check.'
