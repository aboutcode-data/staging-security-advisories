summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/vmwgfx: Disable
  coherent dumb buffers without 3d  Coherent surfaces make only sense if the host renders to
  them using accelerated apis. Without 3d the entire content of dumb buffers stays in the guest
  making all of the extra work they''re doing to synchronize between guest and host useless.  Configurations
  without 3d also tend to run with very low graphics memory limits. The pinned console fb, mob
  cursors and graphical login manager tend to run out of 16MB graphics memory that those guests
  use.  Fix it by making sure the coherent dumb buffers are only used on configs with 3d enabled.'
