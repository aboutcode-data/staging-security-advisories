summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: zoned:
  fix memory leak after finding block group with super blocks  At exclude_super_stripes(), if
  we happen to find a block group that has super blocks mapped to it and we are on a zoned filesystem,
  we error out as this is not supposed to happen, indicating either a bug or maybe some memory
  corruption for example. However we are exiting the function without freeing the memory allocated
  for the logical address of the super blocks. Fix this by freeing the logical address.'
