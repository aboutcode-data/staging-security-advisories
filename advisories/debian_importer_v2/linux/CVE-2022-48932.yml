summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/mlx5: DR,
  Fix slab-out-of-bounds in mlx5_cmd_dr_create_fte  When adding a rule with 32 destinations,
  we hit the following out-of-band access issue:    BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in mlx5_cmd_dr_create_fte+0x18ee/0x1e70  This
  patch fixes the issue by both increasing the allocated buffers to accommodate for the needed
  actions and by checking the number of actions to prevent this issue when a rule with too many
  actions is provided.'
