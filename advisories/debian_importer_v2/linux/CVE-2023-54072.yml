summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: pcm: Fix
  potential data race at PCM memory allocation helpers  The PCM memory allocation helpers have
  a sanity check against too many buffer allocations.  However, the check is performed without
  a proper lock and the allocation isn''t serialized; this allows user to allocate more memories
  than predefined max size.  Practically seen, this isn''t really a big problem, as it''s more
  or less some "soft limit" as a sanity check, and it''s not possible to allocate unlimitedly.  But
  it''s still better to address this for more consistent behavior.  The patch covers the size
  check in do_alloc_pages() with the card->memory_mutex, and increases the allocated size there
  for preventing the further overflow.  When the actual allocation fails, the size is decreased
  accordingly.'
