summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: qca:
  fix NULL-deref on non-serdev suspend  Qualcomm ROME controllers can be registered from the
  Bluetooth line discipline and in this case the HCI UART serdev pointer is NULL.  Add the missing
  sanity check to prevent a NULL-pointer dereference when wakeup() is called for a non-serdev
  controller during suspend.  Just return true for now to restore the original behaviour and
  address the crash with pre-6.2 kernels, which do not have commit e9b3e5b8c657 ("Bluetooth:
  hci_qca: only assign wakeup with serial port support") that causes the crash to happen already
  at setup() time.'
