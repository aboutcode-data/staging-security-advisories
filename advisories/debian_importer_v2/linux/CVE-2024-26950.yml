summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wireguard: netlink:
  access device through ctx instead of peer  The previous commit fixed a bug that led to a NULL
  peer->device being dereferenced. It''s actually easier and faster performance-wise to instead
  get the device from ctx->wg. This semantically makes more sense too, since ctx->wg->peer_allowedips.seq
  is compared with ctx->allowedips_seq, basing them both in ctx. This also acts as a defence
  in depth provision against freed peers.'
