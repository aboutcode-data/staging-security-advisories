summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  comedi: ni_usb6501:
  fix NULL-deref in command paths  The driver uses endpoint-sized USB transfer buffers but had
  no sanity checks on the sizes. This can lead to zero-size-pointer dereferences or overflowed
  transfer buffers in ni6501_port_command() and ni6501_counter_command() if a (malicious) device
  has smaller max-packet sizes than expected (or when doing descriptor fuzz testing).  Add the
  missing sanity checks to probe().'
