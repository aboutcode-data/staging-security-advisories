  - CVE-2023-39198
summary: A race condition was found in the QXL driver in the Linux kernel. The qxl_mode_dumb_create()
  function dereferences the qobj returned by the qxl_gem_object_create_with_handle(), but the
  handle is the only one holding a reference to it. This flaw allows an attacker to guess the
  returned handle value and trigger a use-after-free issue, potentially leading to a denial
  of service or privilege escalation.
