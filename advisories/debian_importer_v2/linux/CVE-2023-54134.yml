  structs should be freed if their wait_ctr becomes zero. Otherwise they will be lost.  In this
  case an AUTOFS_IOC_EXPIRE_MULTI ioctl is done, then a new waitqueue struct is allocated in
  autofs_wait(), its initial wait_ctr equals 2. After that wait_event_killable() is interrupted
  (it returns -ERESTARTSYS), so that ''wq->name.name == NULL'' condition may be not satisfied.
  Actually, this condition can be satisfied when autofs_wait_release() or autofs_catatonic_mode()
  is called and, what is also important, wait_ctr is decremented in those places. Upon the exit
  of autofs_wait(), wait_ctr is decremented to 1. Then the unmounting process begins: kill_sb
  calls autofs_catatonic_mode(), which should have freed the waitqueues, but it only decrements
  its usage counter to zero which is not a correct behaviour.  edit:imk This description is
  of course not correct. The umount performed as a result of an expire is a umount of a mount
  that has been automounted, it''s not the autofs mount itself. They happen independently, usually
  after everything mounted within the autofs file system has been expired away. If everything
  hasn''t been expired away the automount daemon can still exit leaving mounts in place. But
  expires done in both cases will result in a notification that calls autofs_wait_release()
  with a result status. The problem case is the summary execution of of the automount daemon.
  In this case any waiting processes won''t be woken up until either they are terminated or
  the mount is umounted. end edit: imk  So in catatonic mode we should free waitqueues which
  counter becomes zero.  edit: imk Initially I was concerned that the calling of autofs_wait_release()
  and autofs_catatonic_mode() was not mutually exclusive but that can''t be the case (obviously)
  because the queue entry (or entries) is removed from the list when either of these two functions
  are called. Consequently the wait entry will be freed by only one of these functions or by
  the woken process in autofs_wait() depending on the order of the calls. end edit: imk'
