summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bcache: fix variable
  length array abuse in btree_iter  btree_iter is used in two ways: either allocated on the
  stack with a fixed size MAX_BSETS, or from a mempool with a dynamic size based on the specific
  cache set. Previously, the struct had a fixed-length array of size MAX_BSETS which was indexed
  out-of-bounds for the dynamically-sized iterators, which causes UBSAN to complain.  This patch
  uses the same approach as in bcachefs''s sort_iter and splits the iterator into a btree_iter
  with a flexible array member and a btree_iter_stack which embeds a btree_iter as well as a
  fixed-length data array.'
