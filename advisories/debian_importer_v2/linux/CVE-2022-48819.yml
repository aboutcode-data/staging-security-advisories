summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tcp: take care\
  \ of mixed splice()/sendmsg(MSG_ZEROCOPY) case  syzbot found that mixing sendpage() and sendmsg(MSG_ZEROCOPY)\
  \ calls over the same TCP socket would again trigger the infamous warning in inet_sock_destruct()\
  \  \tWARN_ON(sk_forward_alloc_get(sk));  While Talal took into account a mix of regular copied\
  \ data and MSG_ZEROCOPY one in the same skb, the sendpage() path has been forgotten.  We want\
  \ the charging to happen for sendpage(), because pages could be coming from a pipe. What is\
  \ missing is the downgrading of pure zerocopy status to make sure sk_forward_alloc will stay\
  \ synced.  Add tcp_downgrade_zcopy_pure() helper so that we can use it from the two callers."
