summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ceph: fix memory
  leak in ceph_direct_read_write()  The bvecs array which is allocated in iter_get_bvecs_alloc()
  is leaked and pages remain pinned if ceph_alloc_sparse_ext_map() fails.  There is no need
  to delay the allocation of sparse_ext map until after the bvecs array is set up, so fix this
  by moving sparse_ext allocation a bit earlier.  Also, make a similar adjustment in __ceph_sync_read()
  for consistency (a leak of the same kind in __ceph_sync_read() has been addressed differently).'
