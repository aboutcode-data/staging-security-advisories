  - CVE-2025-22074
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ksmbd: fix r_count
  dec/increment mismatch  r_count is only increased when there is an oplock break wait, so r_count
  inc/decrement are not paired. This can cause r_count to become negative, which can lead to
  a problem where the ksmbd thread does not terminate.'
