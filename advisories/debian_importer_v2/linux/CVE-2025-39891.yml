summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: mwifiex:
  Initialize the chan_stats array to zero  The adapter->chan_stats[] array is initialized in
  mwifiex_init_channel_scan_gap() with vmalloc(), which doesn''t zero out memory.  The array
  is filled in mwifiex_update_chan_statistics() and then the user can query the data in mwifiex_cfg80211_dump_survey().  There
  are two potential issues here.  What if the user calls mwifiex_cfg80211_dump_survey() before
  the data has been filled in. Also the mwifiex_update_chan_statistics() function doesn''t necessarily
  initialize the whole array.  Since the array was not initialized at the start that could result
  in an information leak.  Also this array is pretty small.  It''s a maximum of 900 bytes so
  it''s more appropriate to use kcalloc() instead vmalloc().'
