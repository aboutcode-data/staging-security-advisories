summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  s390/cio: fix
  race condition during online processing  A race condition exists in ccw_device_set_online()
  that can cause the online process to fail, leaving the affected device in an inconsistent
  state. As a result, subsequent attempts to set that device online fail with return code ENODEV.  The
  problem occurs when a path verification request arrives after a wait for final device state
  completed, but before the result state is evaluated.  Fix this by ensuring that the CCW-device
  lock is held between determining final state and checking result state.  Note that since:  commit
  2297791c92d0 ("s390/cio: dont unregister subchannel from child-drivers")  path verification
  requests are much more likely to occur during boot, resulting in an increased chance of this
  race condition occurring.'
