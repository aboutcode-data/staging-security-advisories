summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommu/amd/iommu_v2:
  Fix pasid_state refcount dec hit 0 warning on pasid unbind  When unbinding pasid - a race
  condition exists vs outstanding page faults.  To prevent this, the pasid_state object contains
  a refcount.     * set to 1 on pasid bind     * incremented on each ppr notification start     *
  decremented on each ppr notification done     * decremented on pasid unbind  Since refcount_dec
  assumes that refcount will never reach 0:   the current implementation causes the following
  to be invoked on   pasid unbind:         REFCOUNT_WARN("decrement hit 0; leaking memory")  Fix
  this issue by changing refcount_dec to refcount_dec_and_test to explicitly handle refcount=1.'
