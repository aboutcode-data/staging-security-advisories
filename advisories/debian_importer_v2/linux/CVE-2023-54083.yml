  - CVE-2023-54083
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  phy: tegra: xusb:
  Clear the driver reference in usb-phy dev  For the dual-role port, it will assign the phy
  dev to usb-phy dev and use the port dev driver as the dev driver of usb-phy.  When we try
  to destroy the port dev, it will destroy its dev driver as well. But we did not remove the
  reference from usb-phy dev. This might cause the use-after-free issue in KASAN.'
