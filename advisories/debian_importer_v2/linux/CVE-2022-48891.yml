summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  regulator: da9211:
  Use irq handler when ready  If the system does not come from reset (like when it is kexec()),
  the regulator might have an IRQ waiting for us.  If we enable the IRQ handler before its structures
  are ready, we crash.  This patch fixes:  [    1.141839] Unable to handle kernel read from
  unreadable memory at virtual address 0000000000000078 [    1.316096] Call trace: [    1.316101]  blocking_notifier_call_chain+0x20/0xa8
