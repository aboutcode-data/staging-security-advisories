summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  arm64: ptrace:
  fix partial SETREGSET for NT_ARM_POE  Currently poe_set() doesn''t initialize the temporary
  ''ctrl'' variable, and a SETREGSET call with a length of zero will leave this uninitialized.
  Consequently an arbitrary value will be written back to target->thread.por_el0, potentially
  leaking up to 64 bits of memory from the kernel stack. The read is limited to a specific slot
  on the stack, and the issue does not provide a write mechanism.  Fix this by initializing
  the temporary value before copying the regset from userspace, as for other regsets (e.g. NT_PRSTATUS,
  NT_PRFPREG, NT_ARM_SYSTEM_CALL). In the case of a zero-length write, the existing contents
  of POR_EL1 will be retained.  Before this patch:  | # ./poe-test | Attempting to write NT_ARM_POE::por_el0
