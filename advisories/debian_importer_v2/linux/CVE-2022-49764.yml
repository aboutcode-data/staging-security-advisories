summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Prevent
  bpf program recursion for raw tracepoint probes  We got report from sysbot [1] about warnings
  that were caused by bpf program attached to contention_begin raw tracepoint triggering the
  same tracepoint by using bpf_trace_printk helper that takes trace_printk_lock lock.   Call

The
  can be reproduced by attaching bpf program as raw tracepoint on contention_begin tracepoint.
  The bpf prog calls bpf_trace_printk helper. Then by running perf bench the spin lock code
  is forced to take slow path and call contention_begin tracepoint.  Fixing this by skipping
  execution of the bpf program if it''s already running, Using bpf prog ''active'' field, which
  is being currently used by trampoline programs for the same reason.  Moving bpf_prog_inc_misses_counter
  to syscall.c because trampoline.c is compiled in just for CONFIG_BPF_JIT option.  [1] https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/YxhFe3EwqchC%2FfYf@krava/T/#t'
