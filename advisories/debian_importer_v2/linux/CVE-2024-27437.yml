  - CVE-2024-27437
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vfio/pci: Disable
  auto-enable of exclusive INTx IRQ  Currently for devices requiring masking at the irqchip
  for INTx, ie. devices without DisINTx support, the IRQ is enabled in request_irq() and subsequently
  disabled as necessary to align with the masked status flag.  This presents a window where
  the interrupt could fire between these events, resulting in the IRQ incrementing the disable
  depth twice. This would be unrecoverable for a user since the masked flag prevents nested
  enables through vfio.  Instead, invert the logic using IRQF_NO_AUTOEN such that exclusive
  INTx is never auto-enabled, then unmask as required.'
