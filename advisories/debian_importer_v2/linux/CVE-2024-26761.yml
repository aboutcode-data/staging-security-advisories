summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cxl/pci: Fix
  disabling memory if DVSEC CXL Range does not match a CFMWS window  The Linux CXL subsystem
  is built on the assumption that HPA == SPA. That is, the host physical address (HPA) the HDM
  decoder registers are programmed with are system physical addresses (SPA).  During HDM decoder
  setup, the DVSEC CXL range registers (cxl-3.1, 8.1.3.8) are checked if the memory is enabled
  and the CXL range is in a HPA window that is described in a CFMWS structure of the CXL host
  bridge (cxl-3.1, 9.18.1.3).  Now, if the HPA is not an SPA, the CXL range does not match a
  CFMWS window and the CXL memory range will be disabled then. The HDM decoder stops working
  which causes system memory being disabled and further a system hang during HDM decoder initialization,
  typically when a CXL enabled kernel boots.  Prevent a system hang and do not disable the HDM
  decoder if the decoder''s CXL range is not found in a CFMWS window.  Note the change only
  fixes a hardware hang, but does not implement HPA/SPA translation. Support for this can be
  added in a follow on patch series.'
