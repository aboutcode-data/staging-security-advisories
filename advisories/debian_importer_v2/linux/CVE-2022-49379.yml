summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  driver core:
  Fix wait_for_device_probe() & deferred_probe_timeout interaction  Mounting NFS rootfs was
  timing out when deferred_probe_timeout was non-zero [1].  This was because ip_auto_config()
  initcall times out waiting for the network interfaces to show up when deferred_probe_timeout
  was non-zero. While ip_auto_config() calls wait_for_device_probe() to make sure any currently
  running deferred probe work or asynchronous probe finishes, that wasn''t sufficient to account
  for devices being deferred until deferred_probe_timeout.  Commit 35a672363ab3 ("driver core:
  Ensure wait_for_device_probe() waits until the deferred_probe_timeout fires") tried to fix
  that by making sure wait_for_device_probe() waits for deferred_probe_timeout to expire before
  returning.  However, if wait_for_device_probe() is called from the kernel_init() context:  -
  Before deferred_probe_initcall() [2], it causes the boot process to   hang due to a deadlock.  -
  After deferred_probe_initcall() [3], it blocks kernel_init() from   continuing till deferred_probe_timeout
  expires and beats the point of   deferred_probe_timeout that''s trying to wait for userspace
  to load   modules.  Neither of this is good. So revert the changes to wait_for_device_probe().  [1]
