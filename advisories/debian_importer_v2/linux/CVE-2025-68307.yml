summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: gs_usb:
  gs_usb_xmit_callback(): fix handling of failed transmitted URBs  The driver lacks the cleanup
  of failed transfers of URBs. This reduces the number of available URBs per error by 1. This
  leads to reduced performance and ultimately to a complete stop of the transmission.  If the
  sending of a bulk URB fails do proper cleanup: - increase netdev stats - mark the echo_sbk
  as free - free the driver''s context and do accounting - wake the send queue'
