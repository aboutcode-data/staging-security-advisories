  - CVE-2019-3900
summary: An infinite loop issue was found in the vhost_net kernel module in Linux Kernel up
  to and including v5.1-rc6, while handling incoming packets in handle_rx(). It could occur
  if one end sends packets faster than the other end can process them. A guest user, maybe remote
  one, could use this flaw to stall the vhost_net kernel thread, resulting in a DoS scenario.
