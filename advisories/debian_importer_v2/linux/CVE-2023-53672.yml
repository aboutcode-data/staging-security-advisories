summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: output
  extra debug info if we failed to find an inline backref  [BUG] Syzbot reported several warning
  triggered inside lookup_inline_extent_backref().  [CAUSE] As usual, the reproducer doesn''t
  reliably trigger locally here, but at least we know the WARN_ON() is triggered when an inline
  backref can not be found, and it can only be triggered when @insert is true. (I.e. inserting
  a new inline backref, which means the backref should already exist)  [ENHANCEMENT] After the
  WARN_ON(), dump all the parameters and the extent tree leaf to help debug.'
