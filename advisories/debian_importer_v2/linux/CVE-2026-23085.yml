summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  irqchip/gic-v3-its:
  Avoid truncating memory addresses  On 32-bit machines with CONFIG_ARM_LPAE, it is possible
  for lowmem allocations to be backed by addresses physical memory above the 32-bit address
  limit, as found while experimenting with larger VMSPLIT configurations.  This caused the qemu
  virt model to crash in the GICv3 driver, which allocates the ''itt'' object using GFP_KERNEL.
  Since all memory below the 4GB physical address limit is in ZONE_DMA in this configuration,
  kmalloc() defaults to higher addresses for ZONE_NORMAL, and the ITS driver stores the physical
  address in a 32-bit ''unsigned long'' variable.  Change the itt_addr variable to the correct
  phys_addr_t type instead, along with all other variables in this driver that hold a physical
  address.  The gicv5 driver correctly uses u64 variables, while all other irqchip drivers don''t
  call virt_to_phys or similar interfaces. It''s expected that other device drivers have similar
  issues, but fixing this one is sufficient for booting a virtio based guest.'
