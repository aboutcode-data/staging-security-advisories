summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: mac80211:
  increase scan_ies_len for S1G  Currently the S1G capability element is not taken into account
  for the scan_ies_len, which leads to a buffer length validation failure in ieee80211_prep_hw_scan()
  and subsequent WARN in __ieee80211_start_scan(). This prevents hw scanning from functioning.
  To fix ensure we accommodate for the S1G capability length.'
