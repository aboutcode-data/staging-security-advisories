summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gfs2: Prevent
  recursive memory reclaim  Function new_inode() returns a new inode with inode->i_mapping->gfp_mask
  set to GFP_HIGHUSER_MOVABLE.  This value includes the __GFP_FS flag, so allocations in that
  address space can recurse into filesystem memory reclaim.  We don''t want that to happen because
  it can consume a significant amount of stack memory.  Worse than that is that it can also
  deadlock: for example, in several places, gfs2_unstuff_dinode() is called inside filesystem
  transactions. This calls filemap_grab_folio(), which can allocate a new folio, which can trigger
  memory reclaim.  If memory reclaim recurses into the filesystem and starts another transaction,
  a deadlock will ensue.  To fix these kinds of problems, prevent memory reclaim from recursing
  into filesystem code by making sure that the gfp_mask of inode address spaces doesn''t include
  __GFP_FS.  The "meta" and resource group address spaces were already using GFP_NOFS as their
  gfp_mask (which doesn''t include __GFP_FS).  The default value of GFP_HIGHUSER_MOVABLE is
  less restrictive than GFP_NOFS, though.  To avoid being overly limiting, use the default value
  and only knock off the __GFP_FS flag.  I''m not sure if this will actually make a difference,
  but it also shouldn''t hurt.  This patch is loosely based on commit ad22c7a043c2 ("xfs: prevent
  stack overflows from page cache allocation").  Fixes xfstest generic/273.'
