summary: TCP, when using a large Window Size, makes it easier for remote attackers to guess
  sequence numbers and cause a denial of service (connection loss) to persistent TCP connections
  by repeatedly injecting a TCP RST packet, especially in protocols that use long-lived connections,
  such as BGP.
