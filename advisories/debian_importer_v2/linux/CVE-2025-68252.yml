summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  misc: fastrpc:
  Fix dma_buf object leak in fastrpc_map_lookup  In fastrpc_map_lookup, dma_buf_get is called
  to obtain a reference to the dma_buf for comparison purposes. However, this reference is never
  released when the function returns, leading to a dma_buf memory leak.  Fix this by adding
  dma_buf_put before returning from the function, ensuring that the temporarily acquired reference
  is properly released regardless of whether a matching map is found.  Rule: add'
