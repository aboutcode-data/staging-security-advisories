summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  devlink: fix
  xa_alloc_cyclic() error handling  In case of returning 1 from xa_alloc_cyclic() (wrapping)
  ERR_PTR(1) will be returned, which will cause IS_ERR() to be false. Which can lead to dereference
  not allocated pointer (rel).  Fix it by checking if err is lower than zero.  This wasn''t
  found in real usecase, only noticed. Credit to Pierre.'
