summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: codecs:
  wcd934x: handle channel mappping list correctly  Currently each channel is added as list to
  dai channel list, however there is danger of adding same channel to multiple dai channel list
  which endups corrupting the other list where its already added.  This patch ensures that the
  channel is actually free before adding to the dai channel list and also ensures that the channel
  is on the list before deleting it.  This check was missing previously, and we did not hit
  this issue as we were testing very simple usecases with sequence of amixer commands.'
