summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/nouveau:
  fix off by one in BIOS boundary checking  Bounds checking when parsing init scripts embedded
  in the BIOS reject access to the last byte. This causes driver initialization to fail on Apple
  eMac''s with GeForce 2 MX GPUs, leaving the system with no working console.  This is probably
  only seen on OpenFirmware machines like PowerPC Macs because the BIOS image provided by OF
  is only the used parts of the ROM, not a power-of-two blocks read from PCI directly so PCs
  always have empty bytes at the end that are never accessed.'
