summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/mediatek:
  fix potential OF node use-after-free  The for_each_child_of_node() helper drops the reference
  it takes to each node as it iterates over children and an explicit of_node_put() is only needed
  when exiting the loop early.  Drop the recently introduced bogus additional reference count
  decrement at each iteration that could potentially lead to a use-after-free.'
