summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: fix potential
  refcount leak in ndisc_router_discovery()  The issue happens on specific paths in the function.
  After both the object `rt` and `neigh` are grabbed successfully, when `lifetime` is nonzero
  but the metric needs change, the function just deletes the route and set `rt` to NULL. Then,
  it may try grabbing `rt` and `neigh` again if above conditions hold. The function simply overwrite
  `neigh` if succeeds or returns if fails, without decreasing the reference count of previous
  `neigh`. This may result in memory leaks.  Fix it by decrementing the reference count of `neigh`
  in place.'
