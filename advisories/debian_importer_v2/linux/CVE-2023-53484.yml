summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  lib: cpu_rmap:
  Avoid use after free on rmap->obj array entries  When calling irq_set_affinity_notifier()
  with NULL at the notify argument, it will cause freeing of the glue pointer in the corresponding
  array entry but will leave the pointer in the array. A subsequent call to free_irq_cpu_rmap()
  will try to free this entry again leading to possible use after free.  Fix that by setting
  NULL to the array entry and checking that we have non-zero at the array entry when iterating
  over the array in free_irq_cpu_rmap().  The current code does not suffer from this since there
  are no cases where irq_set_affinity_notifier(irq, NULL) (note the NULL passed for the notify
  arg) is called, followed by a call to free_irq_cpu_rmap() so we don''t hit and issue. Subsequent
  patches in this series excersize this flow, hence the required fix.'
