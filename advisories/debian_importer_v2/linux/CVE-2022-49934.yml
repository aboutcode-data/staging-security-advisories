summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: mac80211:
  Fix UAF in ieee80211_scan_rx()  ieee80211_scan_rx() tries to access scan_req->flags after
  a null check, but a UAF is observed when the scan is completed and __ieee80211_scan_completed()
  executes, which then calls cfg80211_scan_done() leading to the freeing of scan_req.  Since
  scan_req is rcu_dereference()''d, prevent the racing in __ieee80211_scan_completed() by ensuring
  that from mac80211''s POV it is no longer accessed from an RCU read critical section before
  we call cfg80211_scan_done().'
