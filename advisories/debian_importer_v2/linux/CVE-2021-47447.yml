summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/msm/a3xx:
  fix error handling in a3xx_gpu_init()  These error paths returned 1 on failure, instead of
  a negative error code.  This would lead to an Oops in the caller.  A second problem is that
  the check for "if (ret != -ENODATA)" did not work because "ret" was set to 1.'
