  - CVE-2024-52319
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm: use aligned
  address in clear_gigantic_page()  In current kernel, hugetlb_no_page() calls folio_zero_user()
  with the fault address.  Where the fault address may be not aligned with the huge page size.  Then,
  folio_zero_user() may call clear_gigantic_page() with the address, while clear_gigantic_page()
  requires the address to be huge page size aligned.  So, this may cause memory corruption or
  information leak, addtional, use more obvious naming ''addr_hint'' instead of ''addr'' for
  clear_gigantic_page().'
