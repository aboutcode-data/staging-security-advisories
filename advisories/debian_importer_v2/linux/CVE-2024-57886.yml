summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/damon/core:
  fix new damon_target objects leaks on damon_commit_targets()  Patch series "mm/damon/core:
  fix memory leaks and ignored inputs from damon_commit_ctx()".  Due to two bugs in damon_commit_targets()
  and damon_commit_schemes(), which are called from damon_commit_ctx(), some user inputs can
  be ignored, and some mmeory objects can be leaked.  Fix those.  Note that only DAMON sysfs
  interface users are affected.  Other DAMON core API user modules that more focused more on
  simple and dedicated production usages, including DAMON_RECLAIM and DAMON_LRU_SORT are not
  using the buggy function in the way, so not affected.   This patch (of 2):  When new DAMON
  targets are added via damon_commit_targets(), the newly created targets are not deallocated
  when updating the internal data (damon_commit_target()) is failed.  Worse yet, even if the
  setup is successfully done, the new target is not linked to the context.  Hence, the new targets
  are always leaked regardless of the internal data setup failure.  Fix the leaks.'
