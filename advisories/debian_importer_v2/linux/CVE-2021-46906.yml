summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: usbhid:
  fix info leak in hid_submit_ctrl  In hid_submit_ctrl(), the way of calculating the report
  length doesn''t take into account that report->size can be zero. When running the syzkaller
  reproducer, a report of size 0 causes hid_submit_ctrl) to calculate transfer_buffer_length
  as 16384. When this urb is passed to the usb core layer, KMSAN reports an info leak of 16384
  bytes.  To fix this, first modify hid_report_len() to account for the zero report size case
  by using DIV_ROUND_UP for the division. Then, call it from hid_submit_ctrl().'
