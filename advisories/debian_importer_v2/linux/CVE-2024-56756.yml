summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nvme-pci: fix
  freeing of the HMB descriptor table  The HMB descriptor table is sized to the maximum number
  of descriptors that could be used for a given device, but __nvme_alloc_host_mem could break
  out of the loop earlier on memory allocation failure and end up using less descriptors than
  planned for, which leads to an incorrect size passed to dma_free_coherent.  In practice this
  was not showing up because the number of descriptors tends to be low and the dma coherent
  allocator always allocates and frees at least a page.'
