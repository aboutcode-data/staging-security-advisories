summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: rt5645:
  Fix errorenous cleanup order  There is a logic error when removing rt5645 device as the function
  rt5645_i2c_remove() first cancel the &rt5645->jack_detect_work and delete the &rt5645->btn_check_timer
  latter. However, since the timer handler rt5645_btn_check_callback() will re-queue the jack_detect_work,
  this cleanup order is buggy.  That is, once the del_timer_sync in rt5645_i2c_remove is concurrently
  run with the rt5645_btn_check_callback, the canceled jack_detect_work will be rescheduled
  again, leading to possible use-after-free.  This patch fix the issue by placing the del_timer_sync
  function before the cancel_delayed_work_sync.'
