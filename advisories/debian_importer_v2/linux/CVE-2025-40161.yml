summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mailbox: zynqmp-ipi:
  Fix SGI cleanup on unbind  The driver incorrectly determines SGI vs SPI interrupts by checking
  IRQ number < 16, which fails with dynamic IRQ allocation. During unbind, this causes improper
  SGI cleanup leading to kernel crash.  Add explicit irq_type field to pdata for reliable identification
  of SGI interrupts (type-2) and only clean up SGI resources when appropriate.'
