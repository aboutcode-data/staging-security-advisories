summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm: cachestat:
  fix two shmem bugs  When cachestat on shmem races with swapping and invalidation, there are
  two possible bugs:  1) A swapin error can have resulted in a poisoned swap entry in the    shmem
  inode''s xarray. Calling get_shadow_from_swap_cache() on it    will result in an out-of-bounds
  access to swapper_spaces[].     Validate the entry with non_swap_entry() before going further.  2)
  When we find a valid swap entry in the shmem''s inode, the shadow    entry in the swapcache
  might not exist yet: swap IO is still in    progress and we''re before __remove_mapping; swapin,
  invalidation,    or swapoff have removed the shadow from swapcache after we saw the    shmem
  swap entry.     This will send a NULL to workingset_test_recent(). The latter    purely operates
  on pointer bits, so it won''t crash - node 0, memcg    ID 0, eviction timestamp 0, etc. are
  all valid inputs - but it''s a    bogus test. In theory that could result in a false "recently    evicted"
  count.     Such a false positive wouldn''t be the end of the world. But for    code clarity
  and (future) robustness, be explicit about this case.     Bail on get_shadow_from_swap_cache()
  returning NULL.'
