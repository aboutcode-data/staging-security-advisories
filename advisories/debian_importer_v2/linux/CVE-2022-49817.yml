summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: mhi: Fix
  memory leak in mhi_net_dellink()  MHI driver registers network device without setting the
  needs_free_netdev flag, and does NOT call free_netdev() when unregisters network device, which
  causes a memory leak.  This patch calls free_netdev() to fix it since netdev_priv is used
  after unregister.'
