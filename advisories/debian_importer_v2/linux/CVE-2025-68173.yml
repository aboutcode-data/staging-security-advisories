summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ftrace: Fix softlockup
  in ftrace_module_enable  A soft lockup was observed when loading amdgpu module. If a module
  has a lot of tracable functions, multiple calls to kallsyms_lookup can spend too much time
  in RCU critical section and with disabled preemption, causing kernel panic. This is the same
  issue that was fixed in commit d0b24b4e91fc ("ftrace: Prevent RCU stall on PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY
  kernels") and commit 42ea22e754ba ("ftrace: Add cond_resched() to ftrace_graph_set_hash()").  Fix
  it the same way by adding cond_resched() in ftrace_module_enable.'
