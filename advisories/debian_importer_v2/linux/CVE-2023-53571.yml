summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/i915: Make
  intel_get_crtc_new_encoder() less oopsy  The point of the WARN was to print something, not
  oops straight up. Currently that is precisely what happens if we can''t find the connector
  for the crtc in the atomic state. Get the dev pointer from the atomic state instead of the
  potentially NULL encoder to avoid that.  (cherry picked from commit 3b6692357f70498f617ea1b31a0378070a0acf1c)'
