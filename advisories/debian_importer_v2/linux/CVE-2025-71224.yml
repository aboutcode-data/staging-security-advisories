summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: mac80211:
  ocb: skip rx_no_sta when interface is not joined  ieee80211_ocb_rx_no_sta() assumes a valid
  channel context, which is only present after JOIN_OCB.  RX may run before JOIN_OCB is executed,
  in which case the OCB interface is not operational. Skip RX peer handling when the interface
  is not joined to avoid warnings in the RX path.'
