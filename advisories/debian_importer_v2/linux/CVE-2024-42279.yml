  - CVE-2024-42279
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  spi: microchip-core:
  ensure TX and RX FIFOs are empty at start of a transfer  While transmitting with rx_len ==
  0, the RX FIFO is not going to be emptied in the interrupt handler. A subsequent transfer
  could then read crap from the previous transfer out of the RX FIFO into the start RX buffer.
  The core provides a register that will empty the RX and TX FIFOs, so do that before each transfer.'
