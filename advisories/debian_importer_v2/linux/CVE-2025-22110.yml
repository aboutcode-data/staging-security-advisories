summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: nfnetlink_queue:
  Initialize ctx to avoid memory allocation error  It is possible that ctx in nfqnl_build_packet_message()
  could be used before it is properly initialize, which is only initialized by nfqnl_get_sk_secctx().  This
  patch corrects this problem by initializing the lsmctx to a safe value when it is declared.  This
  is similar to the commit 35fcac7a7c25 ("audit: Initialize lsmctx to avoid memory allocation
  error").'
