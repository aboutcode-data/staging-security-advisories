  - CVE-2025-68794
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iomap: adjust
  read range correctly for non-block-aligned positions  iomap_adjust_read_range() assumes that
  the position and length passed in are block-aligned. This is not always the case however,
  as shown in the syzbot generated case for erofs. This causes too many bytes to be skipped
  for uptodate blocks, which results in returning the incorrect position and length to read
  in. If all the blocks are uptodate, this underflows length and returns a position beyond the
  folio.  Fix the calculation to also take into account the block offset when calculating how
  many bytes can be skipped for uptodate blocks.'
