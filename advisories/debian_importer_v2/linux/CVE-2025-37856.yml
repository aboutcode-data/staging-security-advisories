summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: harden
  block_group::bg_list against list_del() races  As far as I can tell, these calls of list_del_init()
  on bg_list cannot run concurrently with btrfs_mark_bg_unused() or btrfs_mark_bg_to_reclaim(),
  as they are in transaction error paths and situations where the block group is readonly.  However,
  if there is any chance at all of racing with mark_bg_unused(), or a different future user
  of bg_list, better to be safe than sorry.  Otherwise we risk the following interleaving (bg_list
  refcount in parens)  T1 (some random op)                       T2 (btrfs_mark_bg_unused)                                         !list_empty(&bg->bg_list);
  (1) list_del_init(&bg->bg_list); (1)                                         list_move_tail
  (1) btrfs_put_block_group (0)                                         btrfs_delete_unused_bgs                                              bg
  = list_first_entry                                              list_del_init(&bg->bg_list);                                              btrfs_put_block_group(bg);
  (-1)  Ultimately, this results in a broken ref count that hits zero one deref early and the
  real final deref underflows the refcount, resulting in a WARNING.'
