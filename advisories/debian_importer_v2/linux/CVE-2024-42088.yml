summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: mediatek:\
  \ mt8195: Add platform entry for ETDM1_OUT_BE dai link  Commit e70b8dd26711 (\"ASoC: mediatek:\
  \ mt8195: Remove afe-dai component and rework codec link\") removed the codec entry for the\
  \ ETDM1_OUT_BE dai link entirely instead of replacing it with COMP_EMPTY(). This worked by\
  \ accident as the remaining COMP_EMPTY() platform entry became the codec entry, and the platform\
  \ entry became completely empty, effectively the same as COMP_DUMMY() since snd_soc_fill_dummy_dai()\
  \ doesn't do anything for platform entries.  This causes a KASAN out-of-bounds warning in\
  \ mtk_soundcard_common_probe() in sound/soc/mediatek/common/mtk-soundcard-driver.c:  \tfor_each_card_prelinks(card,\
  \ i, dai_link) { \t\tif (adsp_node && !strncmp(dai_link->name, \"AFE_SOF\", strlen(\"AFE_SOF\"\
  ))) \t\t\tdai_link->platforms->of_node = adsp_node; \t\telse if (!dai_link->platforms->name\
  \ && !dai_link->platforms->of_node) \t\t\tdai_link->platforms->of_node = platform_node; \t\
  }  where the code expects the platforms array to have space for at least one entry.  Add an\
  \ COMP_EMPTY() entry so that dai_link->platforms has space."
