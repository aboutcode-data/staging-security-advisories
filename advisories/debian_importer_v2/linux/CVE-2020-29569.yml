  - CVE-2020-29569
summary: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.10.1, as used with Xen through
  4.14.x. The Linux kernel PV block backend expects the kernel thread handler to reset ring->xenblkd
  to NULL when stopped. However, the handler may not have time to run if the frontend quickly
  toggles between the states connect and disconnect. As a consequence, the block backend may
  re-use a pointer after it was freed. A misbehaving guest can trigger a dom0 crash by continuously
  connecting / disconnecting a block frontend. Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot
  be ruled out. This only affects systems with a Linux blkback.
