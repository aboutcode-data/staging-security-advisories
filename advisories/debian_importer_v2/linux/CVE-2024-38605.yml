summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: core: Fix
  NULL module pointer assignment at card init  The commit 81033c6b584b ("ALSA: core: Warn on
  empty module") introduced a WARN_ON() for a NULL module pointer passed at snd_card object
  creation, and it also wraps the code around it with ''#ifdef MODULE''.  This works in most
  cases, but the devils are always in details.  "MODULE" is defined when the target code (i.e.
  the sound core) is built as a module; but this doesn''t mean that the caller is also built-in
  or not.  Namely, when only the sound core is built-in (CONFIG_SND=y) while the driver is a
  module (CONFIG_SND_USB_AUDIO=m), the passed module pointer is ignored even if it''s non-NULL,
  and card->module remains as NULL.  This would result in the missing module reference up/down
  at the device open/close, leading to a race with the code execution after the module removal.  For
  addressing the bug, move the assignment of card->module again out of ifdef.  The WARN_ON()
  is still wrapped with ifdef because the module can be really NULL when all sound drivers are
  built-in.  Note that we keep ''ifdef MODULE'' for WARN_ON(), otherwise it would lead to a
  false-positive NULL module check.  Admittedly it won''t catch perfectly, i.e. no check is
  performed when CONFIG_SND=y.  But, it''s no real problem as it''s only for debugging, and
  the condition is pretty rare.'
