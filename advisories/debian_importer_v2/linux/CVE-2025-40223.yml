summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  most: usb: Fix
  use-after-free in hdm_disconnect  hdm_disconnect() calls most_deregister_interface(), which
  eventually unregisters the MOST interface device with device_unregister(iface->dev). If that
  drops the last reference, the device core may call release_mdev() immediately while hdm_disconnect()
  is still executing.  The old code also freed several mdev-owned allocations in hdm_disconnect()
  and then performed additional put_device() calls. Depending on refcount order, this could
  lead to use-after-free or double-free when release_mdev() ran (or when unregister paths also
  performed puts).  Fix by moving the frees of mdev-owned allocations into release_mdev(), so
  they happen exactly once when the device is truly released, and by dropping the extra put_device()
  calls in hdm_disconnect() that are redundant after device_unregister() and most_deregister_interface().  This
  addresses the KASAN slab-use-after-free reported by syzbot in hdm_disconnect(). See report
  and stack traces in the bug link below.'
