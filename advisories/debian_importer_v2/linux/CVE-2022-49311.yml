summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drivers: staging:
  rtl8192bs: Fix deadlock in rtw_joinbss_event_prehandle()  There is a deadlock in rtw_joinbss_event_prehandle(),
  which is shown below:     (Thread 1)                |      (Thread 2)                              |
  _set_timer() rtw_joinbss_event_prehandle()|  mod_timer()  spin_lock_bh() //(1)        |  (wait
  a time)  ...                         | _rtw_join_timeout_handler()  del_timer_sync()            |  spin_lock_bh()
  //(2)  (wait timer to stop)        |  ...  We hold pmlmepriv->lock in position (1) of thread
  1 and use del_timer_sync() to wait timer to stop, but timer handler also need pmlmepriv->lock
  in position (2) of thread 2. As a result, rtw_joinbss_event_prehandle() will block forever.  This
  patch extracts del_timer_sync() from the protection of spin_lock_bh(), which could let timer
  handler to obtain the needed lock. What`s more, we change spin_lock_bh() to spin_lock_irq()
  in _rtw_join_timeout_handler() in order to prevent deadlock.'
