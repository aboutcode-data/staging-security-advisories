summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ipmi: Rework
  user message limit handling  The limit on the number of user messages had a number of issues,
  improper counting in some cases and a use after free.  Restructure how this is all done to
  handle more in the receive message allocation routine, so all refcouting and user message
  limit counts are done in that routine.  It''s a lot cleaner and safer.'
