summary: 'The ioapic_deliver function in virt/kvm/ioapic.c in the Linux kernel through 3.14.1
  does not properly validate the kvm_irq_delivery_to_apic return value, which allows guest OS
  users to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) via a crafted entry in the redirection
  table of an I/O APIC.  NOTE: the affected code was moved to the ioapic_service function before
  the vulnerability was announced.'
