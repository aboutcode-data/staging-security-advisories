summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  smc: Use __sk_dst_get()
  and dst_dev_rcu() in in smc_clc_prfx_set().  smc_clc_prfx_set() is called during connect()
  and not under RCU nor RTNL.  Using sk_dst_get(sk)->dev could trigger UAF.  Let''s use __sk_dst_get()
  and dev_dst_rcu() under rcu_read_lock() after kernel_getsockname().  Note that the returned
  value of smc_clc_prfx_set() is not used in the caller.  While at it, we change the 1st arg
  of smc_clc_prfx_set[46]_rcu() not to touch dst there.'
