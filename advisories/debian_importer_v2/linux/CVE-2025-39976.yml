summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  futex: Use correct
  exit on failure from futex_hash_allocate_default()  copy_process() uses the wrong error exit
  path from futex_hash_allocate_default(). After exiting from futex_hash_allocate_default(),
  neither tasklist_lock nor siglock has been acquired. The exit label bad_fork_core_free unlocks
  both of these locks which is wrong.  The next exit label, bad_fork_cancel_cgroup, is the correct
  exit. sched_cgroup_fork() did not allocate any resources that need to freed.  Use bad_fork_cancel_cgroup
  on error exit from futex_hash_allocate_default().'
