summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ACPI: battery:
  Fix possible crash when unregistering a battery hook  When a battery hook returns an error
  when adding a new battery, then the battery hook is automatically unregistered. However the
  battery hook provider cannot know that, so it will later call battery_hook_unregister() on
  the already unregistered battery hook, resulting in a crash.  Fix this by using the list head
  to mark already unregistered battery hooks as already being unregistered so that they can
  be ignored by battery_hook_unregister().'
