summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ice: add missing
  ice_deinit_hw() in devlink reinit path  devlink-reload results in ice_init_hw failed error,
  and then removing the ice driver causes a NULL pointer dereference.  [  +0.102213] ice 0000:ca:00.0:
  ice_init_hw failed: -16 ... [  +0.000001] Call Trace: [  +0.000003]  <TASK> [  +0.000006]  ice_unload+0x8f/0x100
  [ice] [  +0.000081]  ice_remove+0xba/0x300 [ice]  Commit 1390b8b3d2be ("ice: remove duplicate
  call to ice_deinit_hw() on error paths") removed ice_deinit_hw() from ice_deinit_dev(). As
  a result ice_devlink_reinit_down() no longer calls ice_deinit_hw(), but ice_devlink_reinit_up()
  still calls ice_init_hw(). Since the control queues are not uninitialized, ice_init_hw() fails
  with -EBUSY.  Add ice_deinit_hw() to ice_devlink_reinit_down() to correspond with ice_init_hw()
  in ice_devlink_reinit_up().'
