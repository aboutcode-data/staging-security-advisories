summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  USB: core: Fix\
  \ deadlock in port \"disable\" sysfs attribute  The show and store callback routines for the\
  \ \"disable\" sysfs attribute file in port.c acquire the device lock for the port's parent\
  \ hub device.  This can cause problems if another process has locked the hub to remove it\
  \ or change its configuration:  \tRemoving the hub or changing its configuration requires\
  \ the \thub interface to be removed, which requires the port device \tto be removed, and device_del()\
  \ waits until all outstanding \tsysfs attribute callbacks for the ports have returned.  The\
  \ \tlock can't be released until then.  \tBut the disable_show() or disable_store() routine\
  \ can't return \tuntil after it has acquired the lock.  The resulting deadlock can be avoided\
  \ by calling sysfs_break_active_protection().  This will cause the sysfs core not to wait\
  \ for the attribute's callback routine to return, allowing the removal to proceed.  The disadvantage\
  \ is that after making this call, there is no guarantee that the hub structure won't be deallocated\
  \ at any moment.  To prevent this, we have to acquire a reference to it first by calling hub_get()."
