  - CVE-2024-44957
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xen: privcmd:
  Switch from mutex to spinlock for irqfds  irqfd_wakeup() gets EPOLLHUP, when it is called
  by eventfd_release() by way of wake_up_poll(&ctx->wqh, EPOLLHUP), which gets called under
  spin_lock_irqsave(). We can''t use a mutex here as it will lead to a deadlock.  Fix it by
  switching over to a spin lock.'
