summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  power: supply:
  bq27xxx: Fix poll_interval handling and races on remove  Before this patch bq27xxx_battery_teardown()
  was setting poll_interval = 0 to avoid bq27xxx_battery_update() requeuing the delayed_work
  item.  There are 2 problems with this:  1. If the driver is unbound through sysfs, rather
  then the module being    rmmod-ed, this changes poll_interval unexpectedly  2. This is racy,
  after it being set poll_interval could be changed    before bq27xxx_battery_update() checks
  it through    /sys/module/bq27xxx_battery/parameters/poll_interval  Fix this by added a removed
  attribute to struct bq27xxx_device_info and using that instead of setting poll_interval to
  0.  There also is another poll_interval related race on remove(), writing /sys/module/bq27xxx_battery/parameters/poll_interval
  will requeue the delayed_work item for all devices on the bq27xxx_battery_devices list and
  the device being removed was only removed from that list after cancelling the delayed_work
  item.  Fix this by moving the removal from the bq27xxx_battery_devices list to before cancelling
  the delayed_work item.'
