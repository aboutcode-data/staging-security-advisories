summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Revert "drm/gem-framebuffer:
  Use dma_buf from GEM object instance"  This reverts commit cce16fcd7446dcff7480cd9d2b6417075ed81065.  The
  dma_buf field in struct drm_gem_object is not stable over the object instance''s lifetime.
  The field becomes NULL when user space releases the final GEM handle on the buffer object.
  This resulted in a NULL-pointer deref.  Workarounds in commit 5307dce878d4 ("drm/gem: Acquire
  references on GEM handles for framebuffers") and commit f6bfc9afc751 ("drm/framebuffer: Acquire
  internal references on GEM handles") only solved the problem partially. They especially don''t
  work for buffer objects without a DRM framebuffer associated.  Hence, this revert to going
  back to using .import_attach->dmabuf.  v3: - cc stable'
