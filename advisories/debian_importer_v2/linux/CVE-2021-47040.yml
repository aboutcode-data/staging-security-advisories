summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring: fix
  overflows checks in provide buffers  Colin reported before possible overflow and sign extension
  problems in io_provide_buffers_prep(). As Linus pointed out previous attempt did nothing useful,
  see d81269fecb8ce ("io_uring: fix provide_buffers sign extension").  Do that with help of
  check_<op>_overflow helpers. And fix struct io_provide_buf::len type, as it doesn''t make
  much sense to keep it signed.'
