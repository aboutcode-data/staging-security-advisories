summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ice: Block switchdev
  mode when ADQ is active and vice versa  ADQ and switchdev are not supported simultaneously.
  Enabling both at the same time can result in nullptr dereference.  To prevent this, check
  if ADQ is active when changing devlink mode to switchdev mode, and check if switchdev is active
  when enabling ADQ.'
