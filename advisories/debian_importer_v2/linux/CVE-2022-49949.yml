summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  firmware_loader:
  Fix memory leak in firmware upload  In the case of firmware-upload, an instance of struct
  fw_upload is allocated in firmware_upload_register(). This data needs to be freed in fw_dev_release().
  Create a new fw_upload_free() function in sysfs_upload.c to handle the firmware-upload specific
  memory frees and incorporate the missing kfree call for the fw_upload structure.'
