  - CVE-2019-19770
summary: 'In the Linux kernel 4.19.83, there is a use-after-free (read) in the debugfs_remove
  function in fs/debugfs/inode.c (which is used to remove a file or directory in debugfs that
  was previously created with a call to another debugfs function such as debugfs_create_file).
  NOTE: Linux kernel developers dispute this issue as not being an issue with debugfs, instead
  this is an issue with misuse of debugfs within blktrace'
