summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: iaa -
  Fix out-of-bounds index in find_empty_iaa_compression_mode  The local variable ''i'' is initialized
  with -EINVAL, but the for loop immediately overwrites it and -EINVAL is never returned.  If
  no empty compression mode can be found, the function would return the out-of-bounds index
  IAA_COMP_MODES_MAX, which would cause an invalid array access in add_iaa_compression_mode().  Fix
  both issues by returning either a valid index or -EINVAL.'
