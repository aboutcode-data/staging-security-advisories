  - CVE-2024-38580
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  epoll: be better
  about file lifetimes  epoll can call out to vfs_poll() with a file pointer that may race with
  the last ''fput()''. That would make f_count go down to zero, and while the ep->mtx locking
  means that the resulting file pointer tear-down will be blocked until the poll returns, it
  means that f_count is already dead, and any use of it won''t actually get a reference to the
  file any more: it''s dead regardless.  Make sure we have a valid ref on the file pointer before
  we call down to vfs_poll() from the epoll routines.'
