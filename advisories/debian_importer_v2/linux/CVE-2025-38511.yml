summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/xe/pf: Clear
  all LMTT pages on alloc  Our LMEM buffer objects are not cleared by default on alloc and during
  VF provisioning we only setup LMTT PTEs for the actually provisioned LMEM range. But beyond
  that valid range we might leave some stale data that could either point to some other VFs
  allocations or even to the PF pages.  Explicitly clear all new LMTT page to avoid the risk
  that a malicious VF would try to exploit that gap.  While around add asserts to catch any
  undesired PTE overwrites and low-level debug traces to track LMTT PT life-cycle.  (cherry
  picked from commit 3fae6918a3e27cce20ded2551f863fb05d4bef8d)'
