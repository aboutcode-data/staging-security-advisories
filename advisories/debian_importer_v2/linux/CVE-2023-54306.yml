summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: tls: avoid
  hanging tasks on the tx_lock  syzbot sent a hung task report and Eric explains that adversarial
  receiver may keep RWIN at 0 for a long time, so we are not guaranteed to make forward progress.
  Thread which took tx_lock and went to sleep may not release tx_lock for hours. Use interruptible
  sleep where possible and reschedule the work if it can''t take the lock.  Testing: existing
  selftest passes'
