summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfsd: don''t
  replace page in rq_pages if it''s a continuation of last page  The splice read calls nfsd_splice_actor
  to put the pages containing file data into the svc_rqst->rq_pages array. It''s possible however
  to get a splice result that only has a partial page at the end, if (e.g.) the filesystem hands
  back a short read that doesn''t cover the whole page.  nfsd_splice_actor will plop the partial
  page into its rq_pages array and return. Then later, when nfsd_splice_actor is called again,
  the remainder of the page may end up being filled out. At this point, nfsd_splice_actor will
  put the page into the array _again_ corrupting the reply. If this is done enough times, rq_next_page
  will overrun the array and corrupt the trailing fields -- the rq_respages and rq_next_page
  pointers themselves.  If we''ve already added the page to the array in the last pass, don''t
  add it to the array a second time when dealing with a splice continuation. This was originally
  handled properly in nfsd_splice_actor, but commit 91e23b1c3982 ("NFSD: Clean up nfsd_splice_actor()")
  removed the check for it.'
