summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: uvcvideo:
  Fix crash during unbind if gpio unit is in use  We used the wrong device for the device managed
  functions. We used the usb device, when we should be using the interface device.  If we unbind
  the driver from the usb interface, the cleanup functions are never called. In our case, the
  IRQ is never disabled.  If an IRQ is triggered, it will try to access memory sections that
  are already free, causing an OOPS.  We cannot use the function devm_request_threaded_irq here.
  The devm_* clean functions may be called after the main structure is released by uvc_delete.  Luckily
  this bug has small impact, as it is only affected by devices with gpio units and the user
  has to unbind the device, a disconnect will not trigger this error.'
