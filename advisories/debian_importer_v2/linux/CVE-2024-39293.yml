summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Revert "xsk:
  Support redirect to any socket bound to the same umem"  This reverts commit 2863d665ea41282379f108e4da6c8a2366ba66db.  This
  patch introduced a potential kernel crash when multiple napi instances redirect to the same
  AF_XDP socket. By removing the queue_index check, it is possible for multiple napi instances
  to access the Rx ring at the same time, which will result in a corrupted ring state which
  can lead to a crash when flushing the rings in __xsk_flush(). This can happen when the linked
  list of sockets to flush gets corrupted by concurrent accesses. A quick and small fix is not
  possible, so let us revert this for now.'
