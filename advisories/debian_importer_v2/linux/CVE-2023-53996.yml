  - CVE-2023-53996
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/sev: Make
  enc_dec_hypercall() accept a size instead of npages  enc_dec_hypercall() accepted a page count
  instead of a size, which forced its callers to round up. As a result, non-page aligned vaddrs
  caused pages to be spuriously marked as decrypted via the encryption status hypercall, which
  in turn caused consistent corruption of pages during live migration. Live migration requires
  accurate encryption status information to avoid migrating pages from the wrong perspective.'
