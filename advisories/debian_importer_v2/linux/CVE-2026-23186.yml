summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  hwmon: (acpi_power_meter)
  Fix deadlocks related to acpi_power_meter_notify()  The acpi_power_meter driver''s .notify()
  callback function, acpi_power_meter_notify(), calls hwmon_device_unregister() under a lock
  that is also acquired by callbacks in sysfs attributes of the device being unregistered which
  is prone to deadlocks between sysfs access and device removal.  Address this by moving the
  hwmon device removal in acpi_power_meter_notify() outside the lock in question, but notice
  that doing it alone is not sufficient because two concurrent METER_NOTIFY_CONFIG notifications
  may be attempting to remove the same device at the same time.  To prevent that from happening,
  add a new lock serializing the execution of the switch () statement in acpi_power_meter_notify().  For
  simplicity, it is a static mutex which should not be a problem from the performance perspective.  The
  new lock also allows the hwmon_device_register_with_info() in acpi_power_meter_notify() to
  be called outside the inner lock because it prevents the other notifications handled by that
  function from manipulating the "resource" object while the hwmon device based on it is being
  registered.  The sending of ACPI netlink messages from acpi_power_meter_notify() is serialized
  by the new lock too which generally helps to ensure that the order of handling firmware notifications
  is the same as the order of sending netlink messages related to them.  In addition, notice
  that hwmon_device_register_with_info() may fail in which case resource->hwmon_dev will become
  an error pointer, so add checks to avoid attempting to unregister the hwmon device pointer
  to by it in that case to acpi_power_meter_notify() and acpi_power_meter_remove().'
