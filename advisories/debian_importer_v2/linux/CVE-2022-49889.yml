summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ring-buffer:
  Check for NULL cpu_buffer in ring_buffer_wake_waiters()  On some machines the number of listed
  CPUs may be bigger than the actual CPUs that exist. The tracing subsystem allocates a per_cpu
  directory with access to the per CPU ring buffer via a cpuX file. But to save space, the ring
  buffer will only allocate buffers for online CPUs, even though the CPU array will be as big
  as the nr_cpu_ids.  With the addition of waking waiters on the ring buffer when closing the
  file, the ring_buffer_wake_waiters() now needs to make sure that the buffer is allocated (with
  the irq_work allocated with it) before trying to wake waiters, as it will cause a NULL pointer
  dereference.  While debugging this, I added a NULL check for the buffer itself (which is OK
  to do), and also NULL pointer checks against buffer->buffers (which is not fine, and will
  WARN) as well as making sure the CPU number passed in is within the nr_cpu_ids (which is also
  not fine if it isn''t).   Bugzilla: https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1204705'
