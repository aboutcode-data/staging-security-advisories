summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/fred: Fix
  system hang during S4 resume with FRED enabled  Upon a wakeup from S4, the restore kernel
  starts and initializes the FRED MSRs as needed from its perspective.  It then loads a hibernation
  image, including the image kernel, and attempts to load image pages directly into their original
  page frames used before hibernation unless those frames are currently in use.  Once all pages
  are moved to their original locations, it jumps to a "trampoline" page in the image kernel.  At
  this point, the image kernel takes control, but the FRED MSRs still contain values set by
  the restore kernel, which may differ from those set by the image kernel before hibernation.  Therefore,
  the image kernel must ensure the FRED MSRs have the same values as before hibernation. Since
  these values depend only on the location of the kernel text and data, they can be recomputed
  from scratch.'
