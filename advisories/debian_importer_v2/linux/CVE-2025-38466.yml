summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  perf: Revert
  to requiring CAP_SYS_ADMIN for uprobes  Jann reports that uprobes can be used destructively
  when used in the middle of an instruction. The kernel only verifies there is a valid instruction
  at the requested offset, but due to variable instruction length cannot determine if this is
  an instruction as seen by the intended execution stream.  Additionally, Mark Rutland notes
  that on architectures that mix data in the text segment (like arm64), a similar things can
  be done if the data word is ''mistaken'' for an instruction.  As such, require CAP_SYS_ADMIN
  for uprobes.'
