  - CVE-2021-47159
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: dsa: fix
  a crash if ->get_sset_count() fails  If ds->ops->get_sset_count() fails then it "count" is
  a negative error code such as -EOPNOTSUPP.  Because "i" is an unsigned int, the negative error
  code is type promoted to a very high value and the loop will corrupt memory until the system
  crashes.  Fix this by checking for error codes and changing the type of "i" to just int.'
