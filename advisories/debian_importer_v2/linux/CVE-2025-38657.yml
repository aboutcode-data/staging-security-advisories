summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: rtw89:
  mcc: prevent shift wrapping in rtw89_core_mlsr_switch()  The "link_id" value comes from the
  user via debugfs.  If it''s larger than BITS_PER_LONG then that would result in shift wrapping
  and potentially an out of bounds access later.  In fact, we can limit it to IEEE80211_MLD_MAX_NUM_LINKS
  (15).  Fortunately, only root can write to debugfs files so the security impact is minimal.'
