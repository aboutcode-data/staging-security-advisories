summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: ctxfi:
  Fix potential OOB access in audio mixer handling  In the audio mixer handling code of ctxfi
  driver, the conf field is used as a kind of loop index, and it''s referred in the index callbacks
  (amixer_index() and sum_index()).  As spotted recently by fuzzers, the current code causes
  OOB access at those functions. | UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in /build/reproducible-path/linux-6.17.8/sound/pci/ctxfi/ctamixer.c:347:48
  | index 8 is out of range for type ''unsigned char [8]''  After the analysis, the cause was
  found to be the lack of the proper (re-)initialization of conj field.  This patch addresses
  those OOB accesses by adding the proper initializations of the loop indices.'
