summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iio: imu: st_lsm6dsx:
  fix iio_chan_spec for sensors without event detection  The st_lsm6dsx_acc_channels array of
  struct iio_chan_spec has a non-NULL event_spec field, indicating support for IIO events. However,
  event detection is not supported for all sensors, and if userspace tries to configure accelerometer
  wakeup events on a sensor device that does not support them (e.g. LSM6DS0), st_lsm6dsx_write_event()
  dereferences a NULL pointer when trying to write to the wakeup register. Define an additional
  struct iio_chan_spec array whose members have a NULL event_spec field, and use this array
  instead of st_lsm6dsx_acc_channels for sensors without event detection capability.'
