summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: lpfc: Move
  NPIV''s transport unregistration to after resource clean up  There are cases after NPIV deletion
  where the fabric switch still believes the NPIV is logged into the fabric.  This occurs when
  a vport is unregistered before the Remove All DA_ID CT and LOGO ELS are sent to the fabric.  Currently
  fc_remove_host(), which calls dev_loss_tmo for all D_IDs including the fabric D_ID, removes
  the last ndlp reference and frees the ndlp rport object.  This sometimes causes the race condition
  where the final DA_ID and LOGO are skipped from being sent to the fabric switch.  Fix by moving
  the fc_remove_host() and scsi_remove_host() calls after DA_ID and LOGO are sent.'
