summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  hwmon: (drivetemp)
  Fix driver producing garbage data when SCSI errors occur  scsi_execute_cmd() function can
  return both negative (linux codes) and positive (scsi_cmnd result field) error codes.  Currently
  the driver just passes error codes of scsi_execute_cmd() to hwmon core, which is incorrect
  because hwmon only checks for negative error codes. This leads to hwmon reporting uninitialized
  data to userspace in case of SCSI errors (for example if the disk drive was disconnected).  This
  patch checks scsi_execute_cmd() output and returns -EIO if it''s error code is positive.  [groeck:
  Avoid inline variable declaration for portability]'
