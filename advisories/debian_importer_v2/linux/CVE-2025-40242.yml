summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gfs2: Fix unlikely
  race in gdlm_put_lock  In gdlm_put_lock(), there is a small window of time in which the DFL_UNMOUNT
  flag has been set but the lockspace hasn''t been released, yet.  In that window, dlm may still
  call gdlm_ast() and gdlm_bast(). To prevent it from dereferencing freed glock objects, only
  free the glock if the lockspace has actually been released.'
