  - CVE-2021-4159
summary: A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's EBPF verifier when handling internal
  data structures. Internal memory locations could be returned to userspace. A local attacker
  with the permissions to insert eBPF code to the kernel can use this to leak internal kernel
  memory details defeating some of the exploit mitigations in place for the kernel.
