summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: avoid journaling\
  \ sb update on error if journal is destroying  Presently we always BUG_ON if trying to start\
  \ a transaction on a journal marked with JBD2_UNMOUNT, since this should never happen. However,\
  \ while ltp running stress tests, it was observed that in case of some error handling paths,\
  \ it is possible for update_super_work to start a transaction after the journal is destroyed\
  \ eg:  (umount) ext4_kill_sb   kill_block_super     generic_shutdown_super       sync_filesystem\
  \ /* commits all txns */       evict_inodes         /* might start a new txn */       ext4_put_super\
  \ \tflush_work(&sbi->s_sb_upd_work) /* flush the workqueue */         jbd2_journal_destroy\
  \           journal_kill_thread             journal->j_flags |= JBD2_UNMOUNT;           jbd2_journal_commit_transaction\
  \             jbd2_journal_get_descriptor_buffer               jbd2_journal_bmap         \
  \        ext4_journal_bmap                   ext4_map_blocks                     ...     \
  \                ext4_inode_error                       ext4_handle_error                \
  \         schedule_work(&sbi->s_sb_upd_work)                                             \
  \    /* work queue kicks in */                                                update_super_work\
  \                                                  jbd2_journal_start                    \
  \                                start_this_handle                                       \
  \               BUG_ON(journal->j_flags &                                                \
  \             JBD2_UNMOUNT)  Hence, introduce a new mount flag to indicate journal is destroying\
  \ and only do a journaled (and deferred) update of sb if this flag is not set. Otherwise,\
  \ just fallback to an un-journaled commit.  Further, in the journal destroy path, we have\
  \ the following sequence:    1. Set mount flag indicating journal is destroying   2. force\
  \ a commit and wait for it   3. flush pending sb updates  This sequence is important as it\
  \ ensures that, after this point, there is no sb update that might be journaled so it is safe\
  \ to update the sb outside the journal. (To avoid race discussed in 2d01ddc86606)  Also, we\
  \ don't need a similar check in ext4_grp_locked_error since it is only called from mballoc\
  \ and AFAICT it would be always valid to schedule work here."
