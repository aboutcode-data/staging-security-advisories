  Fix accessing an released usb phy  Commit 6ed05c68cbca ("usb: musb: sunxi: Explicitly release
  USB PHY on exit") will cause that usb phy @glue->xceiv is accessed after released.  1) register
  platform driver @sunxi_musb_driver // get the usb phy @glue->xceiv sunxi_musb_probe() -> devm_usb_get_phy().  2)
  register and unregister platform driver @musb_driver musb_probe() -> sunxi_musb_init() use
  the phy here //the phy is released here musb_remove() -> sunxi_musb_exit() -> devm_usb_put_phy()  3)
  register @musb_driver again musb_probe() -> sunxi_musb_init() use the phy here but the phy
  has been released at 2). ...  Fixed by reverting the commit, namely, removing devm_usb_put_phy()
