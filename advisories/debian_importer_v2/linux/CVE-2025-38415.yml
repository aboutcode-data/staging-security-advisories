summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Squashfs: check
  return result of sb_min_blocksize  Syzkaller reports an "UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in squashfs_bio_read"
  bug.  Syzkaller forks multiple processes which after mounting the Squashfs filesystem, issues
  an ioctl("/dev/loop0", LOOP_SET_BLOCK_SIZE, 0x8000).  Now if this ioctl occurs at the same
  time another process is in the process of mounting a Squashfs filesystem on /dev/loop0, the
  failure occurs.  When this happens the following code in squashfs_fill_super() fails.  ----
  msblk->devblksize = sb_min_blocksize(sb, SQUASHFS_DEVBLK_SIZE); msblk->devblksize_log2 = ffz(~msblk->devblksize);
  ----  sb_min_blocksize() returns 0, which means msblk->devblksize is set to 0.  As a result,
  ffz(~msblk->devblksize) returns 64, and msblk->devblksize_log2 is set to 64.  This subsequently
  causes the  UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in fs/squashfs/block.c:195:36 shift exponent 64 is
  too large for 64-bit type ''u64'' (aka ''unsigned long long'')  This commit adds a check for
  a 0 return by sb_min_blocksize().'
