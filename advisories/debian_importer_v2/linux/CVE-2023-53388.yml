  - CVE-2023-53388
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/mediatek:
  Clean dangling pointer on bind error path  mtk_drm_bind() can fail, in which case drm_dev_put()
  is called, destroying the drm_device object. However a pointer to it was still being held
  in the private object, and that pointer would be passed along to DRM in mtk_drm_sys_prepare()
  if a suspend were triggered at that point, resulting in a panic. Clean the pointer when destroying
  the object in the error path to prevent this from happening.'
