summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  video: fbdev:
  nvidiafb: Use strscpy() to prevent buffer overflow  Coverity complains of a possible buffer
  overflow. However, given the ''static'' scope of nvidia_setup_i2c_bus() it looks like that
  can''t happen after examiniing the call sites.  CID 19036 (#1 of 1): Copy into fixed size
  buffer (STRING_OVERFLOW) 1. fixed_size_dest: You might overrun the 48-character fixed-size
  string   chan->adapter.name by copying name without checking the length. 2. parameter_as_source:
  Note: This defect has an elevated risk because the   source argument is a parameter of the
  current function.  89        strcpy(chan->adapter.name, name);  Fix this warning by using
  strscpy() which will silence the warning and prevent any future buffer overflows should the
  names used to identify the channel become much longer.'
