summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/vmwgfx: Fix
  stale file descriptors on failed usercopy  A failing usercopy of the fence_rep object will
  lead to a stale entry in the file descriptor table as put_unused_fd() won''t release it. This
  enables userland to refer to a dangling ''file'' object through that still valid file descriptor,
  leading to all kinds of use-after-free exploitation scenarios.  Fix this by deferring the
  call to fd_install() until after the usercopy has succeeded.'
