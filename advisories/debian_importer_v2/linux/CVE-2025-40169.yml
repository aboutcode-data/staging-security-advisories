summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Reject negative
  offsets for ALU ops  When verifying BPF programs, the check_alu_op() function validates instructions
  with ALU operations. The ''offset'' field in these instructions is a signed 16-bit integer.  The
  existing check ''insn->off > 1'' was intended to ensure the offset is either 0, or 1 for BPF_MOD/BPF_DIV.
  However, because ''insn->off'' is signed, this check incorrectly accepts all negative values
  (e.g., -1).  This commit tightens the validation by changing the condition to ''(insn->off
  != 0 && insn->off != 1)''. This ensures that any value other than the explicitly permitted
  0 and 1 is rejected, hardening the verifier against malformed BPF programs.'
