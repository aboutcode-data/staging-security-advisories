summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: ethernet:
  ti: am65-cpsw-nuss: Fix skb size by accounting for skb_shared_info  While transitioning from
  netdev_alloc_ip_align() to build_skb(), memory for the "skb_shared_info" member of an "skb"
  was not allocated. Fix this by allocating "PAGE_SIZE" as the skb length, accounting for the
  packet length, headroom and tailroom, thereby including the required memory space for skb_shared_info.'
