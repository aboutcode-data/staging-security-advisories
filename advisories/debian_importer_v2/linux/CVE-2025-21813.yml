summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  timers/migration:
  Fix off-by-one root mis-connection  Before attaching a new root to the old root, the children
  counter of the new root is checked to verify that only the upcoming CPU''s top group have
  been connected to it. However since the recently added commit b729cc1ec21a ("timers/migration:
  Fix another race between hotplug and idle entry/exit") this check is not valid anymore because
  the old root is pre-accounted as a child to the new root. Therefore after connecting the upcoming
  CPU''s top group to the new root, the children count to be expected must be 2 and not 1 anymore.  This
  omission results in the old root to not be connected to the new root. Then eventually the
  system may run with more than one top level, which defeats the purpose of a single idle migrator.  Also
  the old root is pre-accounted but not connected upon the new root creation. But it can be
  connected to the new root later on. Therefore the old root may be accounted twice to the new
  root. The propagation of such overcommit can end up creating a double final top-level root
  with a groupmask incorrectly initialized. Although harmless given that the final top level
  roots will never have a parent to walk up to, this oddity opportunistically reported the core
  issue:    WARNING: CPU: 8 PID: 0 at kernel/time/timer_migration.c:543 tmigr_requires_handle_remote   CPU:
  8 UID: 0 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/8   RIP: 0010:tmigr_requires_handle_remote   Call Trace:    <IRQ>    ?

  the problem by taking the old root into account in the children count of the new root so the
  connection is not omitted.  Also warn when more than one top level group exists to better
  detect similar issues in the future.'
