summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: update
  s_journal_inum if it changes after journal replay  When mounting a crafted ext4 image, s_journal_inum
  may change after journal replay, which is obviously unreasonable because we have successfully
  loaded and replayed the journal through the old s_journal_inum. And the new s_journal_inum
  bypasses some of the checks in ext4_get_journal(), which may trigger a null pointer dereference
  problem. So if s_journal_inum changes after the journal replay, we ignore the change, and
  rewrite the current journal_inum to the superblock.'
