summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fs: PM: Fix reverse
  check in filesystems_freeze_callback()  The freeze_all_ptr check in filesystems_freeze_callback()
  introduced by commit a3f8f8662771 ("power: always freeze efivarfs") is reverse which quite
  confusingly causes all file systems to be frozen when filesystem_freeze_enabled is false.  On
  my systems it causes the WARN_ON_ONCE() in __set_task_frozen() to trigger, most likely due
  to an attempt to freeze a file system that is not ready for that.  Add a logical negation
  to the check in question to reverse it as appropriate.'
