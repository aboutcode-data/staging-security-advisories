summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/xe: Use reserved
  copy engine for user binds on faulting devices  User binds map to engines with can fault,
  faults depend on user binds completion, thus we can deadlock. Avoid this by using reserved
  copy engine for user binds on faulting devices.  While we are here, normalize bind queue creation
  with a helper.  v2:  - Pass in extensions to bind queue creation (CI) v3:  - s/resevered/reserved
