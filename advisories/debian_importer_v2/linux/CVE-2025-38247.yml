  - CVE-2025-38247
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  userns and mnt_idmap
  leak in open_tree_attr(2)  Once want_mount_setattr() has returned a positive, it does require
  finish_mount_kattr() to release ->mnt_userns.  Failing do_mount_setattr() does not change
  that.  As the result, we can end up leaking userns and possibly mnt_idmap as well.'
