  - CVE-2023-4010
summary: A flaw was found in the USB Host Controller Driver framework in the Linux kernel. The
  usb_giveback_urb function has a logic loophole in its implementation. Due to the inappropriate
  judgment condition of the goto statement, the function cannot return under the input of a
  specific malformed descriptor file, so it falls into an endless loop, resulting in a denial
  of service.
