summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mlx5: Fix default
  values in create CQ  Currently, CQs without a completion function are assigned the mlx5_add_cq_to_tasklet
  function by default. This is problematic since only user CQs created through the mlx5_ib driver
  are intended to use this function.  Additionally, all CQs that will use doorbells instead
  of polling for completions must call mlx5_cq_arm. However, the default CQ creation flow leaves
  a valid value in the CQ''s arm_db field, allowing FW to send interrupts to polling-only CQs
  in certain corner cases.  These two factors would allow a polling-only kernel CQ to be triggered
  by an EQ interrupt and call a completion function intended only for user CQs, causing a null
  pointer exception.  Some areas in the driver have prevented this issue with one-off fixes
  but did not address the root cause.  This patch fixes the described issue by adding defaults
  to the create CQ flow. It adds a default dummy completion function to protect against null
  pointer exceptions, and it sets an invalid command sequence number by default in kernel CQs
  to prevent the FW from sending an interrupt to the CQ until it is armed. User CQs are responsible
  for their own initialization values.  Callers of mlx5_core_create_cq are responsible for changing
  the completion function and arming the CQ per their needs.'
