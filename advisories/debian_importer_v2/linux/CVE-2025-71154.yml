summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: usb: rtl8150:
  fix memory leak on usb_submit_urb() failure  In async_set_registers(), when usb_submit_urb()
  fails, the allocated   async_req structure and URB are not freed, causing a memory leak.    The
  completion callback async_set_reg_cb() is responsible for freeing   these allocations, but
  it is only called after the URB is successfully   submitted and completes (successfully or
  with error). If submission   fails, the callback never runs and the memory is leaked.    Fix
  this by freeing both the URB and the request structure in the error   path when usb_submit_urb()
  fails.'
