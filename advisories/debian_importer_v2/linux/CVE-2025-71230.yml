summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  hfs: ensure sb->s_fs_info
  is always cleaned up  When hfs was converted to the new mount api a bug was introduced by
  changing the allocation pattern of sb->s_fs_info. If setup_bdev_super() fails after a new
  superblock has been allocated by sget_fc(), but before hfs_fill_super() takes ownership of
  the filesystem-specific s_fs_info data it was leaked.  Fix this by freeing sb->s_fs_info in
  hfs_kill_super().'
