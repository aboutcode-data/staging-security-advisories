summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: Only allow
  init netns to set default tcp cong to a restricted algo  tcp_set_default_congestion_control()
  is netns-safe in that it writes to &net->ipv4.tcp_congestion_control, but it also sets ca->flags
  |= TCP_CONG_NON_RESTRICTED which is not namespaced. This has the unintended side-effect of
  changing the global net.ipv4.tcp_allowed_congestion_control sysctl, despite the fact that
  it is read-only: 97684f0970f6 ("net: Make tcp_allowed_congestion_control readonly in non-init
  netns")  Resolve this netns "leak" by only allowing the init netns to set the default algorithm
  to one that is restricted. This restriction could be removed if tcp_allowed_congestion_control
  were namespace-ified in the future.  This bug was uncovered with https://github.com/JonathonReinhart/linux-netns-sysctl-verify'
