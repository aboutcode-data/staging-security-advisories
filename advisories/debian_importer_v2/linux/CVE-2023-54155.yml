  > PAGE_SIZE check was introduced in commit c8741e2bfe87 ("xdp: Allow bpf_xdp_adjust_tail()
  to grow packet size"). But Jesper Dangaard Brouer <jbrouer@redhat.com> noted that after introducing
  the xdp_init_buff() which all XDP driver use - it''s safe to remove this check. The original
  intend was to catch cases where XDP drivers have not been updated to use xdp.frame_sz, but
  that is not longer a concern (since xdp_init_buff).  Running the initial syzkaller repro it
  was discovered that the contiguous physical memory allocation is used for both xdp paths in
  tun_get_user(), e.g. tun_build_skb() and tun_alloc_skb(). It was also stated by Jesper Dangaard
  Brouer <jbrouer@redhat.com> that XDP can work on higher order pages, as long as this is contiguous
  physical memory (e.g. a page).'
