summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bfs: Reconstruct
  file type when loading from disk  syzbot is reporting that S_IFMT bits of inode->i_mode can
  become bogus when the S_IFMT bits of the 32bits "mode" field loaded from disk are corrupted
  or when the 32bits "attributes" field loaded from disk are corrupted.  A documentation says
  that BFS uses only lower 9 bits of the "mode" field. But I can''t find an explicit explanation
  that the unused upper 23 bits (especially, the S_IFMT bits) are initialized with 0.  Therefore,
  ignore the S_IFMT bits of the "mode" field loaded from disk. Also, verify that the value of
  the "attributes" field loaded from disk is either BFS_VREG or BFS_VDIR (because BFS supports
  only regular files and the root directory).'
