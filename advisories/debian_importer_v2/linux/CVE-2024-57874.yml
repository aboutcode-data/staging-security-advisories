summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  arm64: ptrace:
  fix partial SETREGSET for NT_ARM_TAGGED_ADDR_CTRL  Currently tagged_addr_ctrl_set() doesn''t
  initialize the temporary ''ctrl'' variable, and a SETREGSET call with a length of zero will
  leave this uninitialized. Consequently tagged_addr_ctrl_set() will consume an arbitrary value,
  potentially leaking up to 64 bits of memory from the kernel stack. The read is limited to
  a specific slot on the stack, and the issue does not provide a write mechanism.  As set_tagged_addr_ctrl()
  only accepts values where bits [63:4] zero and rejects other values, a partial SETREGSET attempt
  will randomly succeed or fail depending on the value of the uninitialized value, and the exposure
  is significantly limited.  Fix this by initializing the temporary value before copying the
  regset from userspace, as for other regsets (e.g. NT_PRSTATUS, NT_PRFPREG, NT_ARM_SYSTEM_CALL).
  In the case of a zero-length write, the existing value of the tagged address ctrl will be
  retained.  The NT_ARM_TAGGED_ADDR_CTRL regset is only visible in the user_aarch64_view used
  by a native AArch64 task to manipulate another native AArch64 task. As get_tagged_addr_ctrl()
  only returns an error value when called for a compat task, tagged_addr_ctrl_get() and tagged_addr_ctrl_set()
  should never observe an error value from get_tagged_addr_ctrl(). Add a WARN_ON_ONCE() to both
  to indicate that such an error would be unexpected, and error handlnig is not missing in either
  case.'
