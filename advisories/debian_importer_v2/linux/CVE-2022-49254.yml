summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: ti-vpe:
  cal: Fix a NULL pointer dereference in cal_ctx_v4l2_init_formats()  In cal_ctx_v4l2_init_formats(),
  devm_kzalloc() is assigned to ctx->active_fmt and there is a dereference of it after that,
  which could lead to NULL pointer dereference on failure of devm_kzalloc().  Fix this bug by
  adding a NULL check of ctx->active_fmt.  This bug was found by a static analyzer.  Builds
  with ''make allyesconfig'' show no new warnings, and our static analyzer no longer warns about
  this code.'
