  - CVE-2023-53589
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: iwlwifi:
  mvm: don''t trust firmware n_channels  If the firmware sends us a corrupted MCC response with
  n_channels much larger than the command response can be, we might copy far too much (uninitialized)
  memory and even crash if the n_channels is large enough to make it run out of the one page
  allocated for the FW response.  Fix that by checking the lengths. Doing a < comparison would
  be sufficient, but the firmware should be doing it correctly, so check more strictly.'
