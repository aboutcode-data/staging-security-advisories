summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  atm/fore200e:
  Fix possible data race in fore200e_open()  Protect access to fore200e->available_cell_rate
  with rate_mtx lock in the error handling path of fore200e_open() to prevent a data race.  The
  field fore200e->available_cell_rate is a shared resource used to track available bandwidth.
  It is concurrently accessed by fore200e_open(), fore200e_close(), and fore200e_change_qos().  In
  fore200e_open(), the lock rate_mtx is correctly held when subtracting vcc->qos.txtp.max_pcr
  from available_cell_rate to reserve bandwidth. However, if the subsequent call to fore200e_activate_vcin()
  fails, the function restores the reserved bandwidth by adding back to available_cell_rate
  without holding the lock.  This introduces a race condition because available_cell_rate is
  a global device resource shared across all VCCs. If the error path in fore200e_open() executes
  concurrently with operations like fore200e_close() or fore200e_change_qos() on other VCCs,
  a read-modify-write race occurs.  Specifically, the error path reads the rate without the
  lock. If another CPU acquires the lock and modifies the rate (e.g., releasing bandwidth in
  fore200e_close()) between this read and the subsequent write, the error path will overwrite
  the concurrent update with a stale value. This results in incorrect bandwidth accounting.'
