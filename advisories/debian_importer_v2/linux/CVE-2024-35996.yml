summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cpu: Re-enable
  CPU mitigations by default for !X86 architectures  Rename x86''s to CPU_MITIGATIONS, define
  it in generic code, and force it on for all architectures exception x86.  A recent commit
  to turn mitigations off by default if SPECULATION_MITIGATIONS=n kinda sorta missed that "cpu_mitigations"
  is completely generic, whereas SPECULATION_MITIGATIONS is x86-specific.  Rename x86''s SPECULATIVE_MITIGATIONS
  instead of keeping both and have it select CPU_MITIGATIONS, as having two configs for the
  same thing is unnecessary and confusing.  This will also allow x86 to use the knob to manage
  mitigations that aren''t strictly related to speculative execution.  Use another Kconfig to
  communicate to common code that CPU_MITIGATIONS is already defined instead of having x86''s
  menu depend on the common CPU_MITIGATIONS.  This allows keeping a single point of contact
  for all of x86''s mitigations, and it''s not clear that other architectures *want* to allow
  disabling mitigations at compile-time.'
