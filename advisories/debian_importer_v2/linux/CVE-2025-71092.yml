summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/bnxt_re:
  Fix OOB write in bnxt_re_copy_err_stats()  Commit ef56081d1864 ("RDMA/bnxt_re: RoCE related
  hardware counters update") added three new counters and placed them after BNXT_RE_OUT_OF_SEQ_ERR.  BNXT_RE_OUT_OF_SEQ_ERR
  acts as a boundary marker for allocating hardware statistics with different num_counters values
  on chip_gen_p5_p7 devices.  As a result, BNXT_RE_NUM_STD_COUNTERS are used when allocating
  hw_stats, which leads to an out-of-bounds write in bnxt_re_copy_err_stats().  The counters
  BNXT_RE_REQ_CQE_ERROR, BNXT_RE_RESP_CQE_ERROR, and BNXT_RE_RESP_REMOTE_ACCESS_ERRS are applicable
  to generic hardware, not only p5/p7 devices.  Fix this by moving these counters before BNXT_RE_OUT_OF_SEQ_ERR
  so they are included in the generic counter set.'
