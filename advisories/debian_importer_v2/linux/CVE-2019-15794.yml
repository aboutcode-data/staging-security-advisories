  - CVE-2019-15794
summary: Overlayfs in the Linux kernel and shiftfs, a non-upstream patch to the Linux kernel
  included in the Ubuntu 5.0 and 5.3 kernel series, both replace vma->vm_file in their mmap
  handlers. On error the original value is not restored, and the reference is put for the file
  to which vm_file points. On upstream kernels this is not an issue, as no callers dereference
  vm_file following after call_mmap() returns an error. However, the aufs patchs change mmap_region()
  to replace the fput() using a local variable with vma_fput(), which will fput() vm_file, leading
  to a refcount underflow.
