summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tracing: Add
  down_write(trace_event_sem) when adding trace event  When a module is loaded, it adds trace
  events defined by the module. It may also need to modify the modules trace printk formats
  to replace enum names with their values.  If two modules are loaded at the same time, the
  adding of the event to the ftrace_events list can corrupt the walking of the list in the code
  that is modifying the printk format strings and crash the kernel.  The addition of the event
  should take the trace_event_sem for write while it adds the new event.  Also add a lockdep_assert_held()
  on that semaphore in __trace_add_event_dirs() as it iterates the list.'
