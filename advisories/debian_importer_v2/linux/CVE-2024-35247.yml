summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fpga: region:
  add owner module and take its refcount  The current implementation of the fpga region assumes
  that the low-level module registers a driver for the parent device and uses its owner pointer
  to take the module''s refcount. This approach is problematic since it can lead to a null pointer
  dereference while attempting to get the region during programming if the parent device does
  not have a driver.  To address this problem, add a module owner pointer to the fpga_region
  struct and use it to take the module''s refcount. Modify the functions for registering a region
  to take an additional owner module parameter and rename them to avoid conflicts. Use the old
  function names for helper macros that automatically set the module that registers the region
  as the owner. This ensures compatibility with existing low-level control modules and reduces
  the chances of registering a region without setting the owner.  Also, update the documentation
  to keep it consistent with the new interface for registering an fpga region.'
