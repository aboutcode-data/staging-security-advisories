summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  firmware: arm_ffa:
  Fix memory leak by freeing notifier callback node  Commit e0573444edbf ("firmware: arm_ffa:
  Add interfaces to request notification callbacks") adds support for notifier callbacks by
  allocating and inserting a callback node into a hashtable during registration of notifiers.
  However, during unregistration, the code only removes the node from the hashtable without
  freeing the associated memory, resulting in a memory leak.  Resolve the memory leak issue
  by ensuring the allocated notifier callback node is properly freed after it is removed from
  the hashtable entry.'
