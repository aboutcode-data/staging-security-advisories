summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  blk-mq: release
  crypto keyslot before reporting I/O complete  Once all I/O using a blk_crypto_key has completed,
  filesystems can call blk_crypto_evict_key().  However, the block layer currently doesn''t
  call blk_crypto_put_keyslot() until the request is being freed, which happens after upper
  layers have been told (via bio_endio()) the I/O has completed.  This causes a race condition
  where blk_crypto_evict_key() can see ''slot_refs != 0'' without there being an actual bug.  This
  makes __blk_crypto_evict_key() hit the ''WARN_ON_ONCE(atomic_read(&slot->slot_refs) != 0)''
  and return without doing anything, eventually causing a use-after-free in blk_crypto_reprogram_all_keys().  (This
  is a very rare bug and has only been seen when per-file keys are being used with fscrypt.)  There
  are two options to fix this: either release the keyslot before bio_endio() is called on the
  request''s last bio, or make __blk_crypto_evict_key() ignore slot_refs.  Let''s go with the
  first solution, since it preserves the ability to report bugs (via WARN_ON_ONCE) where a key
  is evicted while still in-use.'
