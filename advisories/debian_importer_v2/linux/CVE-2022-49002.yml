summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommu/vt-d: Fix
  PCI device refcount leak in dmar_dev_scope_init()  for_each_pci_dev() is implemented by pci_get_device().
  The comment of pci_get_device() says that it will increase the reference count for the returned
  pci_dev and also decrease the reference count for the input pci_dev @from if it is not NULL.  If
  we break for_each_pci_dev() loop with pdev not NULL, we need to call pci_dev_put() to decrease
  the reference count. Add the missing pci_dev_put() for the error path to avoid reference count
  leak.'
