summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: gtp: Fix
  Use-After-Free in gtp_dellink  Since call_rcu, which is called in the hlist_for_each_entry_rcu
  traversal of gtp_dellink, is not part of the RCU read critical section, it is possible that
  the RCU grace period will pass during the traversal and the key will be free.  To prevent
  this, it should be changed to hlist_for_each_entry_safe.'
