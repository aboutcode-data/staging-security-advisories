summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  firmware: qcom:
  scm: Mark get_wq_ctx() as atomic call  Currently get_wq_ctx() is wrongly configured as a standard
  call. When two SMC calls are in sleep and one SMC wakes up, it calls get_wq_ctx() to resume
  the corresponding sleeping thread. But if get_wq_ctx() is interrupted, goes to sleep and another
  SMC call is waiting to be allocated a waitq context, it leads to a deadlock.  To avoid this
  get_wq_ctx() must be an atomic call and can''t be a standard SMC call. Hence mark get_wq_ctx()
  as a fast call.'
