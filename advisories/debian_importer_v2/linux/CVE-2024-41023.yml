  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x6e/0x76  The issue occurs in start_dl_timer(), which increments
  the task_struct reference count and sets a timer. The timer callback, dl_task_timer, is supposed
  to decrement the reference count upon expiration. However, if enqueue_task_dl() is called
  before the timer expires and cancels it, the reference count is not decremented, leading to
  the leak.  This patch fixes the reference leak by ensuring the task_struct reference count
  is properly decremented when the timer is canceled.'
