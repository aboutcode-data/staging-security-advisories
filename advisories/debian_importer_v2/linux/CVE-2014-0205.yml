  - CVE-2014-0205
summary: The futex_wait function in kernel/futex.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.37 does not
  properly maintain a certain reference count during requeue operations, which allows local
  users to cause a denial of service (use-after-free and system crash) or possibly gain privileges
  via a crafted application that triggers a zero count.
