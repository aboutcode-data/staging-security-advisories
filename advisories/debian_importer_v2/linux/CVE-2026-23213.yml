summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/pm: Disable
  MMIO access during SMU Mode 1 reset  During Mode 1 reset, the ASIC undergoes a reset cycle
  and becomes temporarily inaccessible via PCIe. Any attempt to access MMIO registers during
  this window (e.g., from interrupt handlers or other driver threads) can result in uncompleted
  PCIe transactions, leading to NMI panics or system hangs.  To prevent this, set the `no_hw_access`
  flag to true immediately after triggering the reset. This signals other driver components
  to skip register accesses while the device is offline.  A memory barrier `smp_mb()` is added
  to ensure the flag update is globally visible to all cores before the driver enters the sleep/wait
  state.  (cherry picked from commit 7edb503fe4b6d67f47d8bb0dfafb8e699bb0f8a4)'
