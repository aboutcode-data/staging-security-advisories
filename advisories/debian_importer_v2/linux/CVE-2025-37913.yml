summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net_sched: qfq:
  Fix double list add in class with netem as child qdisc  As described in Gerrard''s report
  [1], there are use cases where a netem child qdisc will make the parent qdisc''s enqueue callback
  reentrant. In the case of qfq, there won''t be a UAF, but the code will add the same classifier
  to the list twice, which will cause memory corruption.  This patch checks whether the class
  was already added to the agg->active list (cl_is_active) before doing the addition to cater
  for the reentrant case.  [1] https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/CAHcdcOm+03OD2j6R0=YHKqmy=VgJ8xEOKuP6c7mSgnp-TEJJbw@mail.gmail.com/'
