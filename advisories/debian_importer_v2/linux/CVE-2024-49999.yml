summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  afs: Fix the
  setting of the server responding flag  In afs_wait_for_operation(), we set transcribe the
  call responded flag to the server record that we used after doing the fileserver iteration
  loop - but it''s possible to exit the loop having had a response from the server that we''ve
  discarded (e.g. it returned an abort or we started receiving data, but the call didn''t complete).  This
  means that op->server might be NULL, but we don''t check that before attempting to set the
  server flag.'
