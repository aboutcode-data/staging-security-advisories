  - CVE-2019-3882
summary: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's vfio interface implementation that permits violation
  of the user's locked memory limit. If a device is bound to a vfio driver, such as vfio-pci,
  and the local attacker is administratively granted ownership of the device, it may cause a
  system memory exhaustion and thus a denial of service (DoS). Versions 3.10, 4.14 and 4.18
  are vulnerable.
