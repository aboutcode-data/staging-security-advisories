summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  f2fs: compress:
  fix reserve_cblocks counting error when out of space  When a file only needs one direct_node,
  performing the following operations will cause the file to be unrepairable:  unisoc # ./f2fs_io
  compress test.apk unisoc #df -h | grep dm-48 /dev/block/dm-48 112G 112G 1.2M 100% /data  unisoc
  # ./f2fs_io release_cblocks test.apk 924 unisoc # df -h | grep dm-48 /dev/block/dm-48 112G
  112G 4.8M 100% /data  unisoc # dd if=/dev/random of=file4 bs=1M count=3 3145728 bytes (3.0
  M) copied, 0.025 s, 120 M/s unisoc # df -h | grep dm-48 /dev/block/dm-48 112G 112G 1.8M 100%
  /data  unisoc # ./f2fs_io reserve_cblocks test.apk F2FS_IOC_RESERVE_COMPRESS_BLOCKS failed:
  No space left on device  adb reboot unisoc # df -h  | grep dm-48 /dev/block/dm-48             112G
  112G   11M 100% /data unisoc # ./f2fs_io reserve_cblocks test.apk 0  This is because the file
  has only one direct_node. After returning to -ENOSPC, reserved_blocks += ret will not be executed.
  As a result, the reserved_blocks at this time is still 0, which is not the real number of
  reserved blocks. Therefore, fsck cannot be set to repair the file.  After this patch, the
  fsck flag will be set to fix this problem.  unisoc # df -h | grep dm-48 /dev/block/dm-48             112G
  112G  1.8M 100% /data unisoc # ./f2fs_io reserve_cblocks test.apk F2FS_IOC_RESERVE_COMPRESS_BLOCKS
  failed: No space left on device  adb reboot then fsck will be executed unisoc # df -h  | grep
  dm-48 /dev/block/dm-48             112G 112G   11M 100% /data unisoc # ./f2fs_io reserve_cblocks
  test.apk 924'
