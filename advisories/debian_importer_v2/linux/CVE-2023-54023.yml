summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: fix race
  between balance and cancel/pause  Syzbot reported a panic that looks like this:    assertion
  failed: fs_info->exclusive_operation == BTRFS_EXCLOP_BALANCE_PAUSED, in fs/btrfs/ioctl.c:465   ------------[

  reproducer is running a balance and a cancel or pause in parallel. The way balance finishes
  is a bit wonky, if we were paused we need to save the balance_ctl in the fs_info, but clear
  it otherwise and cleanup. However we rely on the return values being specific errors, or having
  a cancel request or no pause request.  If balance completes and returns 0, but we have a pause
  or cancel request we won''t do the appropriate cleanup, and then the next time we try to start
  a balance we''ll trip this ASSERT.  The error handling is just wrong here, we always want
  to clean up, unless we got -ECANCELLED and we set the appropriate pause flag in the exclusive
  op.  With this patch the reproducer ran for an hour without tripping, previously it would
  trip in less than a few minutes.'
