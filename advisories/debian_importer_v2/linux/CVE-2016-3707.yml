  - CVE-2016-3707
summary: The icmp_check_sysrq function in net/ipv4/icmp.c in the kernel.org projects/rt patches
  for the Linux kernel, as used in the kernel-rt package before 3.10.0-327.22.1 in Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux for Real Time 7 and other products, allows remote attackers to execute SysRq commands
  via crafted ICMP Echo Request packets, as demonstrated by a brute-force attack to discover
  a cookie, or an attack that occurs after reading the local icmp_echo_sysrq file.
