summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: fix match
  incorrectly in dev_args_match_device  syzkaller found a failed assertion:    assertion failed:
  (args->devid != (u64)-1) || args->missing, in fs/btrfs/volumes.c:6921  This can be triggered
  when we set devid to (u64)-1 by ioctl. In this case, the match of devid will be skipped and
  the match of device may succeed incorrectly.  Patch 562d7b1512f7 introduced this function
  which is used to match device. This function contains two matching scenarios, we can distinguish
  them by checking the value of args->missing rather than check whether args->devid and args->uuid
  is default value.'
