summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PCI: rcar-host:\
  \ Pass proper IRQ domain to generic_handle_domain_irq()  Starting with commit dd26c1a23fd5\
  \ (\"PCI: rcar-host: Switch to msi_create_parent_irq_domain()\"), the MSI parent IRQ domain\
  \ is NULL because the object of type struct irq_domain_info passed to:  msi_create_parent_irq_domain()\
  \ ->   irq_domain_instantiate()() ->     __irq_domain_instantiate()  has no reference to the\
  \ parent IRQ domain. Using msi->domain->parent as an argument for generic_handle_domain_irq()\
  \ leads to below error:  \t\"Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address\"\
  \  This error was identified while switching the upcoming RZ/G3S PCIe host controller driver\
  \ to msi_create_parent_irq_domain() (which was using a similar pattern to handle MSIs (see\
  \ link section)), but it was not tested on hardware using the pcie-rcar-host controller driver\
  \ due to lack of hardware.  [mani: reworded subject and description]"
