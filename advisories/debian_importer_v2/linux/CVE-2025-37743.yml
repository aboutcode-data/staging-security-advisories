summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath12k:
  Avoid memory leak while enabling statistics  Driver uses monitor destination rings for extended
  statistics mode and standalone monitor mode. In extended statistics mode, TLVs are parsed
  from the buffer received from the monitor destination ring and assigned to the ppdu_info structure
  to update per-packet statistics. In standalone monitor mode, along with per-packet statistics,
  the packet data (payload) is captured, and the driver updates per MSDU to mac80211.  When
  the AP interface is enabled, only extended statistics mode is activated. As part of enabling
  monitor rings for collecting statistics, the driver subscribes to HAL_RX_MPDU_START TLV in
  the filter configuration. This TLV is received from the monitor destination ring, and kzalloc
  for the mon_mpdu object occurs, which is not freed, leading to a memory leak. The kzalloc
  for the mon_mpdu object is only required while enabling the standalone monitor interface.
  This causes a memory leak while enabling extended statistics mode in the driver.  Fix this
  memory leak by removing the kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object in the HAL_RX_MPDU_START TLV handling.
  Additionally, remove the standalone monitor mode handlings in the HAL_MON_BUF_ADDR and HAL_RX_MSDU_END
  TLVs. These TLV tags will be handled properly when enabling standalone monitor mode in the
  future.  Tested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.3.1-00173-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1 Tested-on:
  WCN7850 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HMT.1.0.c5-00481-QCAHMTSWPL_V1.0_V2.0_SILICONZ-3'
