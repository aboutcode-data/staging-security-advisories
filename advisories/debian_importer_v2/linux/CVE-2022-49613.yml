summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  serial: 8250:
  Fix PM usage_count for console handover  When console is enabled, univ8250_console_setup()
  calls serial8250_console_setup() before .dev is set to uart_port. Therefore, it will not call
  pm_runtime_get_sync(). Later, when the actual driver is going to take over univ8250_console_exit()
  is called. As .dev is already set, serial8250_console_exit() makes pm_runtime_put_sync() call
  with usage count being zero triggering PM usage count warning (extra debug for univ8250_console_setup(),
  univ8250_console_exit(), and serial8250_register_ports()):  [    0.068987] univ8250_console_setup

  printk: console [ttyS0] enabled  To fix the issue, call pm_runtime_get_sync() in serial8250_register_ports()
  as soon as .dev is set for an uart_port if it has console enabled.  This problem became apparent
  only recently because 82586a721595 ("PM: runtime: Avoid device usage count underflows") added
  the warning printout. I confirmed this problem also occurs with v5.18 (w/o the warning printout,
  obviously).'
