summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: mediatek:
  Assign dummy when codec not specified for a DAI link  MediaTek sound card drivers are checking
  whether a DAI link is present and used on a board to assign the correct parameters and this
  is done by checking the codec DAI names at probe time.  If no real codec is present, assign
  the dummy codec to the DAI link to avoid NULL pointer during string comparison.'
