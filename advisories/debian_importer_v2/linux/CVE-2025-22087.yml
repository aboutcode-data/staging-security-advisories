  - CVE-2025-22087
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Fix array
  bounds error with may_goto  may_goto uses an additional 8 bytes on the stack, which causes
  the interpreters[] array to go out of bounds when calculating index by stack_size.  1. If
  a BPF program is rewritten, re-evaluate the stack size. For non-JIT cases, reject loading
  directly.  2. For non-JIT cases, calculating interpreters[idx] may still cause out-of-bounds
  array access, and just warn about it.  3. For jit_requested cases, the execution of bpf_func
  also needs to be warned. So move the definition of function __bpf_prog_ret0_warn out of the
  macro definition CONFIG_BPF_JIT_ALWAYS_ON.'
