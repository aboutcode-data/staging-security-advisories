summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/hfi1: Prevent
  use of lock before it is initialized  If there is a failure during probe of hfi1 before the
  sdma_map_lock is initialized, the call to hfi1_free_devdata() will attempt to use a lock that
  has not been initialized. If the locking correctness validator is on then an INFO message
  and stack trace resembling the following may be seen:    INFO: trying to register non-static
  key.   The code is fine but needs lockdep annotation, or maybe   you didn''t initialize this
  object before use?   turning off the locking correctness validator.   Call Trace:   register_lock_class+0x11b/0x880   __lock_acquire+0xf3/0x7930   lock_acquire+0xff/0x2d0   _raw_spin_lock_irq+0x46/0x60   sdma_clean+0x42a/0x660
  [hfi1]   hfi1_free_devdata+0x3a7/0x420 [hfi1]   init_one+0x867/0x11a0 [hfi1]   pci_device_probe+0x40e/0x8d0  The
  use of sdma_map_lock in sdma_clean() is for freeing the sdma_map memory, and sdma_map is not
  allocated/initialized until after sdma_map_lock has been initialized. This code only needs
  to be run if sdma_map is not NULL, and so checking for that condition will avoid trying to
  use the lock before it is initialized.'
