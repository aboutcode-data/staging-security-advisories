  - CVE-2019-15793
summary: In shiftfs, a non-upstream patch to the Linux kernel included in the Ubuntu 5.0 and
  5.3 kernel series, several locations which shift ids translate user/group ids before performing
  operations in the lower filesystem were translating them into init_user_ns, whereas they should
  have been translated into the s_user_ns for the lower filesystem. This resulted in using ids
  other than the intended ones in the lower fs, which likely did not map into the shifts s_user_ns.
  A local attacker could use this to possibly bypass discretionary access control permissions.
