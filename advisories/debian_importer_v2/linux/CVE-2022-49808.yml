summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: dsa: don''t
  leak tagger-owned storage on switch driver unbind  In the initial commit dc452a471dba ("net:
  dsa: introduce tagger-owned storage for private and shared data"), we had a call to tag_ops->disconnect(dst)
  issued from dsa_tree_free(), which is called at tree teardown time.  There were problems with
  connecting to a switch tree as a whole, so this got reworked to connecting to individual switches
  within the tree. In this process, tag_ops->disconnect(ds) was made to be called only from
  switch.c (cross-chip notifiers emitted as a result of dynamic tag proto changes), but the
  normal driver teardown code path wasn''t replaced with anything.  Solve this problem by adding
  a function that does the opposite of dsa_switch_setup_tag_protocol(), which is called from
  the equivalent spot in dsa_switch_teardown(). The positioning here also ensures that we won''t
  have any use-after-free in tagging protocol (*rcv) ops, since the teardown sequence is as
  follows:  dsa_tree_teardown -> dsa_tree_teardown_master    -> dsa_master_teardown       ->
  unsets master->dsa_ptr, making no further packets match the          ETH_P_XDSA packet type
  handler -> dsa_tree_teardown_ports    -> dsa_port_teardown       -> dsa_slave_destroy          ->
  unregisters DSA net devices, there is even a synchronize_net()             in unregister_netdevice_many()
  -> dsa_tree_teardown_switches    -> dsa_switch_teardown       -> dsa_switch_teardown_tag_protocol          ->
  finally frees the tagger-owned storage'
