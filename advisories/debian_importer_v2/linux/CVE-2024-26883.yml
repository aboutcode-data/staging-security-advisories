summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Fix stackmap
  overflow check on 32-bit arches  The stackmap code relies on roundup_pow_of_two() to compute
  the number of hash buckets, and contains an overflow check by checking if the resulting value
  is 0. However, on 32-bit arches, the roundup code itself can overflow by doing a 32-bit left-shift
  of an unsigned long value, which is undefined behaviour, so it is not guaranteed to truncate
  neatly. This was triggered by syzbot on the DEVMAP_HASH type, which contains the same check,
  copied from the hashtab code.  The commit in the fixes tag actually attempted to fix this,
  but the fix did not account for the UB, so the fix only works on CPUs where an overflow does
  result in a neat truncation to zero, which is not guaranteed. Checking the value before rounding
  does not have this problem.'
