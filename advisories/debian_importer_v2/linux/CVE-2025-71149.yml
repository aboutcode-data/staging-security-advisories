  - CVE-2025-71149
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring/poll:
  correctly handle io_poll_add() return value on update  When the core of io_uring was updated
  to handle completions consistently and with fixed return codes, the POLL_REMOVE opcode with
  updates got slightly broken. If a POLL_ADD is pending and then POLL_REMOVE is used to update
  the events of that request, if that update causes the POLL_ADD to now trigger, then that completion
  is lost and a CQE is never posted.  Additionally, ensure that if an update does cause an existing
  POLL_ADD to complete, that the completion value isn''t always overwritten with -ECANCELED.
  For that case, whatever io_poll_add() set the value to should just be retained.'
