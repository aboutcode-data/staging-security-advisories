summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: add reserved
  GDT blocks check  We capture a NULL pointer issue when resizing a corrupt ext4 image which
  is freshly clear resize_inode feature (not run e2fsck). It could be simply reproduced by following
  steps. The problem is because of the resize_inode feature was cleared, and it will convert
  the filesystem to meta_bg mode in ext4_resize_fs(), but the es->s_reserved_gdt_blocks was
  not reduced to zero, so could we mistakenly call reserve_backup_gdb() and passing an uninitialized
  resize_inode to it when adding new group descriptors.   mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda 3G  tune2fs -O
  ^resize_inode /dev/sda #forget to run requested e2fsck  mount /dev/sda /mnt  resize2fs /dev/sda
