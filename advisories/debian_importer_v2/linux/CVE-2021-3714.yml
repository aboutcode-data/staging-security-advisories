summary: A flaw was found in the Linux kernels memory deduplication mechanism. Previous work
  has shown that memory deduplication can be attacked via a local exploitation mechanism. The
  same technique can be used if an attacker can upload page sized files and detect the change
  in access time from a networked service to determine if the page has been merged.
