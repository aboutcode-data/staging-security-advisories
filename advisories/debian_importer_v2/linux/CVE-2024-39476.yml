summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  md/raid5: fix
  deadlock that raid5d() wait for itself to clear MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING  Xiao reported that lvm2
  test lvconvert-raid-takeover.sh can hang with small possibility, the root cause is exactly
  the same as commit bed9e27baf52 ("Revert "md/raid5: Wait for MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING in raid5d"")  However,
  Dan reported another hang after that, and junxiao investigated the problem and found out that
  this is caused by plugged bio can''t issue from raid5d().  Current implementation in raid5d()
  has a weird dependence:  1) md_check_recovery() from raid5d() must hold ''reconfig_mutex''
  to clear    MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING; 2) raid5d() handles IO in a deadloop, until all IO are issued;
  3) IO from raid5d() must wait for MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING to be cleared;  This behaviour is introduce
  before v2.6, and for consequence, if other context hold ''reconfig_mutex'', and md_check_recovery()
  can''t update super_block, then raid5d() will waste one cpu 100% by the deadloop, until ''reconfig_mutex''
  is released.  Refer to the implementation from raid1 and raid10, fix this problem by skipping
  issue IO if MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING is still set after md_check_recovery(), daemon thread will
  be woken up when ''reconfig_mutex'' is released. Meanwhile, the hang problem will be fixed
  as well.'
