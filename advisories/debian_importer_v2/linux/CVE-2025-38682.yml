summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i2c: core: Fix
  double-free of fwnode in i2c_unregister_device()  Before commit df6d7277e552 ("i2c: core:
  Do not dereference fwnode in struct device"), i2c_unregister_device() only called fwnode_handle_put()
  on of_node-s in the form of calling of_node_put(client->dev.of_node).  But after this commit
  the i2c_client''s fwnode now unconditionally gets fwnode_handle_put() on it.  When the i2c_client
  has no primary (ACPI / OF) fwnode but it does have a software fwnode, the software-node will
  be the primary node and fwnode_handle_put() will put() it.  But for the software fwnode device_remove_software_node()
  will also put() it leading to a double free:  [   82.665598] ------------[ cut here ]------------
