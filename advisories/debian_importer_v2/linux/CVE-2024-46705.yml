summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/xe: reset
  mmio mappings with devm  Set our various mmio mappings to NULL. This should make it easier
  to catch something rogue trying to mess with mmio after device removal. For example, we might
  unmap everything and then start hitting some mmio address which has already been unmamped
  by us and then remapped by something else, causing all kinds of carnage.'
