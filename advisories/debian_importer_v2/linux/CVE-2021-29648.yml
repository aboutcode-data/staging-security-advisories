  - CVE-2021-29648
summary: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.11. The BPF subsystem does
  not properly consider that resolved_ids and resolved_sizes are intentionally uninitialized
  in the vmlinux BPF Type Format (BTF), which can cause a system crash upon an unexpected access
  attempt (in map_create in kernel/bpf/syscall.c or check_btf_info in kernel/bpf/verifier.c),
  aka CID-350a5c4dd245.
