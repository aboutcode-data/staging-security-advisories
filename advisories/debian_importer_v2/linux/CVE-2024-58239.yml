  - CVE-2024-58239
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tls: stop recv()
  if initial process_rx_list gave us non-DATA  If we have a non-DATA record on the rx_list and
  another record of the same type still on the queue, we will end up merging them:  - process_rx_list
  copies the non-DATA record  - we start the loop and process the first available record since
  it''s    of the same type  - we break out of the loop since the record was not DATA  Just
  check the record type and jump to the end in case process_rx_list did some work.'
