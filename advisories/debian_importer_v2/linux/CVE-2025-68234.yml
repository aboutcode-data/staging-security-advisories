summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring/cmd_net:
  fix wrong argument types for skb_queue_splice()  If timestamp retriving needs to be retried
  and the local list of SKB''s already has entries, then it''s spliced back into the socket
  queue. However, the arguments for the splice helper are transposed, causing exactly the wrong
  direction of splicing into the on-stack list. Fix that up.'
