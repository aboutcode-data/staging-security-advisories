summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Prevent
  tailcall infinite loop caused by freplace  There is a potential infinite loop issue that can
  occur when using a combination of tail calls and freplace.  In an upcoming selftest, the attach
  target for entry_freplace of tailcall_freplace.c is subprog_tc of tc_bpf2bpf.c, while the
  tail call in entry_freplace leads to entry_tc. This results in an infinite loop:  entry_tc
  -> subprog_tc -> entry_freplace --tailcall-> entry_tc.  The problem arises because the tail_call_cnt
  in entry_freplace resets to zero each time entry_freplace is executed, causing the tail call
  mechanism to never terminate, eventually leading to a kernel panic.  To fix this issue, the
  solution is twofold:  1. Prevent updating a program extended by an freplace program to a    prog_array
  map. 2. Prevent extending a program that is already part of a prog_array map    with an freplace
  program.  This ensures that:  * If a program or its subprogram has been extended by an freplace
  program,   it can no longer be updated to a prog_array map. * If a program has been added
  to a prog_array map, neither it nor its   subprograms can be extended by an freplace program.  Moreover,
  an extension program should not be tailcalled. As such, return -EINVAL if the program has
  a type of BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT when adding it to a prog_array map.  Additionally, fix a minor
  code style issue by replacing eight spaces with a tab for proper formatting.'
