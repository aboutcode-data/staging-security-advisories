summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/smc: check
  return value of sock_recvmsg when draining clc data  When receiving clc msg, the field length
  in smc_clc_msg_hdr indicates the length of msg should be received from network and the value
  should not be fully trusted as it is from the network. Once the value of length exceeds the
  value of buflen in function smc_clc_wait_msg it may run into deadloop when trying to drain
  the remaining data exceeding buflen.  This patch checks the return value of sock_recvmsg when
  draining data in case of deadloop in draining.'
