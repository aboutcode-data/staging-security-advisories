summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: gs_usb:
  gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): fix URB memory leak  In gs_can_open(), the URBs for USB-in
  transfers are allocated, added to the parent->rx_submitted anchor and submitted. In the complete
  callback gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(), the URB is processed and resubmitted. In gs_can_close()
  the URBs are freed by calling usb_kill_anchored_urbs(parent->rx_submitted).  However, this
  does not take into account that the USB framework unanchors the URB before the complete function
  is called. This means that once an in-URB has been completed, it is no longer anchored and
  is ultimately not released in gs_can_close().  Fix the memory leak by anchoring the URB in
  the gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback() to the parent->rx_submitted anchor.'
