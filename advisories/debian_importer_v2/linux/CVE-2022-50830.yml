summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  auxdisplay: hd44780:
  Fix potential memory leak in hd44780_remove()  hd44780_probe() allocates a memory chunk for
  hd with kzalloc() and makes "lcd->drvdata->hd44780" point to it. When we call hd44780_remove(),
  we should release all relevant memory and resource. But "lcd->drvdata ->hd44780" is not released,
  which will lead to a memory leak.  We should release the "lcd->drvdata->hd44780" in hd44780_remove()
  to fix the memory leak bug.'
