  - CVE-2018-18021
summary: arch/arm64/kvm/guest.c in KVM in the Linux kernel before 4.18.12 on the arm64 platform
  mishandles the KVM_SET_ON_REG ioctl. This is exploitable by attackers who can create virtual
  machines. An attacker can arbitrarily redirect the hypervisor flow of control (with full register
  control). An attacker can also cause a denial of service (hypervisor panic) via an illegal
  exception return. This occurs because of insufficient restrictions on userspace access to
  the core register file, and because PSTATE.M validation does not prevent unintended execution
  modes.
