summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Propagate
  error from htab_lock_bucket() to userspace  In __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_batch() if htab_lock_bucket()
  returns -EBUSY, it will go to next bucket. Going to next bucket may not only skip the elements
  in current bucket silently, but also incur out-of-bound memory access or expose kernel memory
  to userspace if current bucket_cnt is greater than bucket_size or zero.  Fixing it by stopping
  batch operation and returning -EBUSY when htab_lock_bucket() fails, and the application can
  retry or skip the busy batch as needed.'
