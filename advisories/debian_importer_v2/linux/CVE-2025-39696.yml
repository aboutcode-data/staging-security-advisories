summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: hda: tas2781:
  Fix wrong reference of tasdevice_priv  During the conversion to unify the calibration data
  management, the reference to tasdevice_priv was wrongly set to h->hda_priv instead of h->priv.  This
  resulted in memory corruption and crashes eventually. Unfortunately it''s a void pointer,
  hence the compiler couldn''t know that it''s wrong.'
