summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: SOF: Intel:
  hda-dai: Ensure DAI widget is valid during params  Each cpu DAI should associate with a widget.
  However, the topology might not create the right number of DAI widgets for aggregated amps.
  And it will cause NULL pointer deference. Check that the DAI widget associated with the CPU
  DAI is valid to prevent NULL pointer deference due to missing DAI widgets in topologies with
  aggregated amps.'
