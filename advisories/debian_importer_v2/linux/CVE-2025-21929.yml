summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: intel-ish-hid:
  Fix use-after-free issue in hid_ishtp_cl_remove()  During the `rmmod` operation for the `intel_ishtp_hid`
  driver, a use-after-free issue can occur in the hid_ishtp_cl_remove() function. The function
  hid_ishtp_cl_deinit() is called before ishtp_hid_remove(), which can lead to accessing freed
  memory or resources during the removal process.  Call Trace:  ? ishtp_cl_send+0x168/0x220
  [intel_ishtp]  ? hid_output_report+0xe3/0x150 [hid]  hid_ishtp_set_feature+0xb5/0x120 [intel_ishtp_hid]  ishtp_hid_request+0x7b/0xb0

  [intel_ishtp]  ...  Additionally, ishtp_hid_remove() is a HID level power off, which should
  occur before the ISHTP level disconnect.  This patch resolves the issue by reordering the
  calls in hid_ishtp_cl_remove(). The function ishtp_hid_remove() is now called before hid_ishtp_cl_deinit().'
