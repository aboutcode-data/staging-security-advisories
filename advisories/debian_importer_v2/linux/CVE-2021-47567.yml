summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powerpc/32: Fix
  hardlockup on vmap stack overflow  Since the commit c118c7303ad5 ("powerpc/32: Fix vmap stack
  - Do not activate MMU before reading task struct") a vmap stack overflow results in a hard
  lockup. This is because emergency_ctx is still addressed with its virtual address allthough
  data MMU is not active anymore at that time.  Fix it by using a physical address instead.'
