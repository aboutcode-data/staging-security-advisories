summary: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free may be triggered in asus_kbd_backlight_set
  when plugging/disconnecting in a malicious USB device, which advertises itself as an Asus
  device. Similarly to the previous known CVE-2023-25012, but in asus devices, the work_struct
  may be scheduled by the LED controller while the device is disconnecting, triggering a use-after-free
  on the struct asus_kbd_leds *led structure. A malicious USB device may exploit the issue to
  cause memory corruption with controlled data.
