summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  idpf: fix memory
  leaks and crashes while performing a soft reset  The second tagged commit introduced a UAF,
  as it removed restoring q_vector->vport pointers after reinitializating the structures. This
  is due to that all queue allocation functions are performed here with the new temporary vport
  structure and those functions rewrite the backpointers to the vport. Then, this new struct
  is freed and the pointers start leading to nowhere.  But generally speaking, the current logic
  is very fragile. It claims to be more reliable when the system is low on memory, but in fact,
  it consumes two times more memory as at the moment of running this function, there are two
  vports allocated with their queues and vectors. Moreover, it claims to prevent the driver
  from running into "bad state", but in fact, any error during the rebuild leaves the old vport
  in the partially allocated state. Finally, if the interface is down when the function is called,
  it always allocates a new queue set, but when the user decides to enable the interface later
  on, vport_open() allocates them once again, IOW there''s a clear memory leak here.  Just don''t
  allocate a new queue set when performing a reset, that solves crashes and memory leaks. Readd
  the old queue number and reopen the interface on rollback - that solves limbo states when
  the device is left disabled and/or without HW queues enabled.'
