summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  thermal/debugfs:
  Prevent use-after-free from occurring after cdev removal  Since thermal_debug_cdev_remove()
  does not run under cdev->lock, it can run in parallel with thermal_debug_cdev_state_update()
  and it may free the struct thermal_debugfs object used by the latter after it has been checked
  against NULL.  If that happens, thermal_debug_cdev_state_update() will access memory that
  has been freed already causing the kernel to crash.  Address this by using cdev->lock in thermal_debug_cdev_remove()
  around the cdev->debugfs value check (in case the same cdev is removed at the same time in
  two different threads) and its reset to NULL.  Cc :6.8+ <stable@vger.kernel.org> # 6.8+'
