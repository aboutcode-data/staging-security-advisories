summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/microcode/AMD:
  Fix out-of-bounds on systems with CPU-less NUMA nodes  Currently, load_microcode_amd() iterates
  over all NUMA nodes, retrieves their CPU masks and unconditionally accesses per-CPU data for
  the first CPU of each mask.  According to Documentation/admin-guide/mm/numaperf.rst:    "Some
  memory may share the same node as a CPU, and others are provided as   memory only nodes."  Therefore,
  some node CPU masks may be empty and wouldn''t have a "first CPU".  On a machine with far
  memory (and therefore CPU-less NUMA nodes): - cpumask_of_node(nid) is 0 - cpumask_first(0)
  is CONFIG_NR_CPUS - cpu_data(CONFIG_NR_CPUS) accesses the cpu_info per-CPU array at an   index
  that is 1 out of bounds  This does not have any security implications since flashing microcode
  is a privileged operation but I believe this has reliability implications by potentially corrupting
  memory while flashing a microcode update.  When booting with CONFIG_UBSAN_BOUNDS=y on an AMD
  machine that flashes a microcode update. I get the following splat:    UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds
  in arch/x86/kernel/cpu/microcode/amd.c:X:Y   index 512 is out of range for type ''unsigned
  long[512]''   [...]   Call Trace:    dump_stack    __ubsan_handle_out_of_bounds    load_microcode_amd    request_microcode_amd    reload_store    kernfs_fop_write_iter    vfs_write    ksys_write    do_syscall_64    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe  Change
  the loop to go over only NUMA nodes which have CPUs before determining whether the first CPU
  on the respective node needs microcode update.    [ bp: Massage commit message, fix typo.
