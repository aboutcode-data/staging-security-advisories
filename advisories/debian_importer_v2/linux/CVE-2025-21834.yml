summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  seccomp: passthrough
  uretprobe systemcall without filtering  When attaching uretprobes to processes running inside
  docker, the attached process is segfaulted when encountering the retprobe.  The reason is
  that now that uretprobe is a system call the default seccomp filters in docker block it as
  they only allow a specific set of known syscalls. This is true for other userspace applications
  which use seccomp to control their syscall surface.  Since uretprobe is a "kernel implementation
  detail" system call which is not used by userspace application code directly, it is impractical
  and there''s very little point in forcing all userspace applications to explicitly allow it
  in order to avoid crashing tracked processes.  Pass this systemcall through seccomp without
  depending on configuration.  Note: uretprobe is currently only x86_64 and isn''t expected
  to ever be supported in i386.  [kees: minimized changes for easier backporting, tweaked commit
  log]'
