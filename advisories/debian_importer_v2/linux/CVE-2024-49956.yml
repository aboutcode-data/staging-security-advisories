summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gfs2: fix double
  destroy_workqueue error  When gfs2_fill_super() fails, destroy_workqueue() is called within
  gfs2_gl_hash_clear(), and the subsequent code path calls destroy_workqueue() on the same work
  queue again.  This issue can be fixed by setting the work queue pointer to NULL after the
  first destroy_workqueue() call and checking for a NULL pointer before attempting to destroy
  the work queue again.'
