  - CVE-2023-53341
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  of/fdt: run soc
  memory setup when early_init_dt_scan_memory fails  If memory has been found early_init_dt_scan_memory
  now returns 1. If it hasn''t found any memory it will return 0, allowing other memory setup
  mechanisms to carry on.  Previously early_init_dt_scan_memory always returned 0 without distinguishing
  between any kind of memory setup being done or not. Any code path after the early_init_dt_scan
  memory call in the ramips plat_mem_setup code wouldn''t be executed anymore. Making early_init_dt_scan_memory
  the only way to initialize the memory.  Some boards, including my mt7621 based Cudy X6 board,
  depend on memory initialization being done via the soc_info.mem_detect function pointer. Those
  wouldn''t be able to obtain memory and panic the kernel during early bootup with the message
  "early_init_dt_alloc_memory_arch: Failed to allocate 12416 bytes align=0x40".'
