summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dmaengine: ptdma:
  check for null desc before calling pt_cmd_callback  Resolves a panic that can occur on AMD
  systems, typically during host shutdown, after the PTDMA driver had been exercised. The issue
  was the pt_issue_pending() function is mistakenly assuming that there will be at least one
  descriptor in the Submitted queue when the function is called. However, it is possible that

  being mistakenly called with a NULL pointer. Ref: Bugzilla Bug 216856.'
