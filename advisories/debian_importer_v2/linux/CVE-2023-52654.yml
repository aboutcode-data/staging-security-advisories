summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring/af_unix:
  disable sending io_uring over sockets  File reference cycles have caused lots of problems
  for io_uring in the past, and it still doesn''t work exactly right and races with unix_stream_read_generic().
  The safest fix would be to completely disallow sending io_uring files via sockets via SCM_RIGHT,
  so there are no possible cycles invloving registered files and thus rendering SCM accounting
  on the io_uring side unnecessary.'
