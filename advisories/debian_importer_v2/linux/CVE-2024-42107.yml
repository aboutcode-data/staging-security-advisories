  - CVE-2024-42107
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ice: Don''t process
  extts if PTP is disabled  The ice_ptp_extts_event() function can race with ice_ptp_release()
  and result in a NULL pointer dereference which leads to a kernel panic.  Panic occurs because
  the ice_ptp_extts_event() function calls ptp_clock_event() with a NULL pointer. The ice driver
  has already released the PTP clock by the time the interrupt for the next external timestamp
  event occurs.  To fix this, modify the ice_ptp_extts_event() function to check the PTP state
  and bail early if PTP is not ready.'
