summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: af_can:
  fix NULL pointer dereference in can_rcv_filter  Analogue to commit 8aa59e355949 ("can: af_can:
  fix NULL pointer dereference in can_rx_register()") we need to check for a missing initialization
  of ml_priv in the receive path of CAN frames.  Since commit 4e096a18867a ("net: introduce
  CAN specific pointer in the struct net_device") the check for dev->type to be ARPHRD_CAN is
  not sufficient anymore since bonding or tun netdevices claim to be CAN devices but do not
  initialize ml_priv accordingly.'
