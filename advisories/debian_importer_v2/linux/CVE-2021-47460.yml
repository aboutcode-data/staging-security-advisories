summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ocfs2: fix data
  corruption after conversion from inline format  Commit 6dbf7bb55598 ("fs: Don''t invalidate
  page buffers in block_write_full_page()") uncovered a latent bug in ocfs2 conversion from
  inline inode format to a normal inode format.  The code in ocfs2_convert_inline_data_to_extents()
  attempts to zero out the whole cluster allocated for file data by grabbing, zeroing, and dirtying
  all pages covering this cluster.  However these pages are beyond i_size, thus writeback code
  generally ignores these dirty pages and no blocks were ever actually zeroed on the disk.  This
  oversight was fixed by commit 693c241a5f6a ("ocfs2: No need to zero pages past i_size.") for
  standard ocfs2 write path, inline conversion path was apparently forgotten; the commit log
  also has a reasoning why the zeroing actually is not needed.  After commit 6dbf7bb55598, things
  became worse as writeback code stopped invalidating buffers on pages beyond i_size and thus
  these pages end up with clean PageDirty bit but with buffers attached to these pages being
  still dirty.  So when a file is converted from inline format, then writeback triggers, and
  then the file is grown so that these pages become valid, the invalid dirtiness state is preserved,
  mark_buffer_dirty() does nothing on these pages (buffers are already dirty) but page is never
  written back because it is clean.  So data written to these pages is lost once pages are reclaimed.  Simple
  reproducer for the problem is:    xfs_io -f -c "pwrite 0 2000" -c "pwrite 2000 2000" -c "fsync"
  \     -c "pwrite 4000 2000" ocfs2_file  After unmounting and mounting the fs again, you can
  observe that end of ''ocfs2_file'' has lost its contents.  Fix the problem by not doing the
  pointless zeroing during conversion from inline format similarly as in the standard write
  path.  [akpm@linux-foundation.org: fix whitespace, per Joseph]'
