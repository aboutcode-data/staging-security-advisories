summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  kernel/resource:
  fix kfree() of bootmem memory again  Since commit ebff7d8f270d ("mem hotunplug: fix kfree()
  of bootmem memory"), we could get a resource allocated during boot via alloc_resource().  And
  it''s required to release the resource using free_resource().  Howerver, many people use kfree
  directly which will result in kernel BUG.  In order to fix this without fixing every call
  site, just leak a couple of bytes in such corner case.'
