summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Guard stack
  limits against 32bit overflow  This patch promotes the arithmetic around checking stack bounds
  to be done in the 64-bit domain, instead of the current 32bit. The arithmetic implies adding
  together a 64-bit register with a int offset. The register was checked to be below 1<<29 when
  it was variable, but not when it was fixed. The offset either comes from an instruction (in
  which case it is 16 bit), from another register (in which case the caller checked it to be
  below 1<<29 [1]), or from the size of an argument to a kfunc (in which case it can be a u32
  [2]). Between the register being inconsistently checked to be below 1<<29, and the offset
  being up to an u32, it appears that we were open to overflowing the `int`s which were currently
  used for arithmetic.  [1] https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/815fb87b753055df2d9e50f6cd80eb10235fe3e9/kernel/bpf/verifier.c#L7494-L7498
