summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  accel/ivpu: Fix\
  \ locking order in ivpu_job_submit  Fix deadlock in job submission and abort handling. When\
  \ a thread aborts currently executing jobs due to a fault, it first locks the global lock\
  \ protecting submitted_jobs (#1).  After the last job is destroyed, it proceeds to release\
  \ the related context and locks file_priv (#2). Meanwhile, in the job submission thread, the\
  \ file_priv lock (#2) is taken first, and then the submitted_jobs lock (#1) is obtained when\
  \ a job is added to the submitted jobs list.         CPU0                            CPU1\
  \        ----                    \t       ----   (for example due to a fault)         (jobs\
  \ submissions keep coming)    lock(&vdev->submitted_jobs_lock) #1   ivpu_jobs_abort_all()\
  \   job_destroy()                                       lock(&file_priv->lock)           #2\
  \                                       lock(&vdev->submitted_jobs_lock) #1   file_priv_release()\
  \   lock(&vdev->context_list_lock)   lock(&file_priv->lock)           #2  This order of locking\
  \ causes a deadlock. To resolve this issue, change the order of locking in ivpu_job_submit()."
