summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rust_binder:
  correctly handle FDA objects of length zero  Fix a bug where an empty FDA (fd array) object
  with 0 fds would cause an out-of-bounds error. The previous implementation used `skip == 0`
  to mean "this is a pointer fixup", but 0 is also the correct skip length for an empty FDA.
  If the FDA is at the end of the buffer, then this results in an attempt to write 8-bytes out
  of bounds. This is caught and results in an EINVAL error being returned to userspace.  The
  pattern of using `skip == 0` as a special value originates from the C-implementation of Binder.
  As part of fixing this bug, this pattern is replaced with a Rust enum.  I considered the alternate
  option of not pushing a fixup when the length is zero, but I think it''s cleaner to just get
  rid of the zero-is-special stuff.  The root cause of this bug was diagnosed by Gemini CLI
  on first try. I used the following prompt:  > There appears to be a bug in @drivers/android/binder/thread.rs
  where > the Fixups oob bug is triggered with 316 304 316 324. This implies > that we somehow
  ended up with a fixup where buffer A has a pointer to > buffer B, but the pointer is located
  at an index in buffer A that is > out of bounds. Please investigate the code to find the bug.
  You may > compare with @drivers/android/binder.c that implements this correctly.'
