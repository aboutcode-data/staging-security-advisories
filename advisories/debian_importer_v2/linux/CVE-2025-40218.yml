summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/damon/vaddr:
  do not repeat pte_offset_map_lock() until success  DAMON''s virtual address space operation
  set implementation (vaddr) calls pte_offset_map_lock() inside the page table walk callback
  function.  This is for reading and writing page table accessed bits.  If pte_offset_map_lock()
  fails, it retries by returning the page table walk callback function with ACTION_AGAIN.  pte_offset_map_lock()
  can continuously fail if the target is a pmd migration entry, though.  Hence it could cause
  an infinite page table walk if the migration cannot be done until the page table walk is finished.  This
  indeed caused a soft lockup when CPU hotplugging and DAMON were running in parallel.  Avoid
  the infinite loop by simply not retrying the page table walk.  DAMON is promising only a best-effort
  accuracy, so missing access to such pages is no problem.'
