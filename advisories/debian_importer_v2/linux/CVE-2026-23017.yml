summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  idpf: fix error
  handling in the init_task on load  If the init_task fails during a driver load, we end up
  without vports and netdevs, effectively failing the entire process. In that state a subsequent
  reset will result in a crash as the service task attempts to access uninitialized resources.
  Following trace is from an error in the init_task where the CREATE_VPORT (op 501) is rejected
  by the FW:  [40922.763136] idpf 0000:83:00.0: Device HW Reset initiated [40924.449797] idpf

  the error handling in the init_task to make sure the service and mailbox tasks are disabled
  if the error happens during load. These are started in idpf_vc_core_init(), which spawns the
  init_task and has no way of knowing if it failed. If the error happens on reset, following
  successful driver load, the tasks can still run, as that will allow the netdevs to attempt
  recovery through another reset. Stop the PTP callbacks either way as those will be restarted
  by the call to idpf_vc_core_init() during a successful reset.'
