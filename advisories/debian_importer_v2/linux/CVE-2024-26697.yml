summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix data
  corruption in dsync block recovery for small block sizes  The helper function nilfs_recovery_copy_block()
  of nilfs_recovery_dsync_blocks(), which recovers data from logs created by data sync writes
  during a mount after an unclean shutdown, incorrectly calculates the on-page offset when copying
  repair data to the file''s page cache.  In environments where the block size is smaller than
  the page size, this flaw can cause data corruption and leak uninitialized memory bytes during
  the recovery process.  Fix these issues by correcting this byte offset calculation on the
  page.'
