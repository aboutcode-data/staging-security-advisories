summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vsock: remove
  vsock from connected table when connect is interrupted by a signal  vsock_connect() expects
  that the socket could already be in the TCP_ESTABLISHED state when the connecting task wakes
  up with a signal pending. If this happens the socket will be in the connected table, and it
  is not removed when the socket state is reset. In this situation it''s common for the process
  to retry connect(), and if the connection is successful the socket will be added to the connected
  table a second time, corrupting the list.  Prevent this by calling vsock_remove_connected()
  if a signal is received while waiting for a connection. This is harmless if the socket is
  not in the connected table, and if it is in the table then removing it will prevent list corruption
  from a double add.  Note for backporting: this patch requires d5afa82c977e ("vsock: correct
  removal of socket from the list"), which is in all current stable trees except 4.9.y.'
