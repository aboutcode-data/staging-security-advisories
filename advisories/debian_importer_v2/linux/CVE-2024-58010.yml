summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  binfmt_flat:\
  \ Fix integer overflow bug on 32 bit systems  Most of these sizes and counts are capped at\
  \ 256MB so the math doesn't result in an integer overflow.  The \"relocs\" count needs to\
  \ be checked as well.  Otherwise on 32bit systems the calculation of \"full_data\" could be\
  \ wrong.  \tfull_data = data_len + relocs * sizeof(unsigned long);"
