  - CVE-2023-53620
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  md: fix soft
  lockup in status_resync  status_resync() will calculate ''curr_resync - recovery_active''
  to show user a progress bar like following:  [============>........]  resync = 61.4%  ''curr_resync''
  and ''recovery_active'' is updated in md_do_sync(), and status_resync() can read them concurrently,
  hence it''s possible that ''curr_resync - recovery_active'' can overflow to a huge number.
  In this case status_resync() will be stuck in the loop to print a large amount of ''='', which
  will end up soft lockup.  Fix the problem by setting ''resync'' to MD_RESYNC_ACTIVE in this
  case, this way resync in progress will be reported to user.'
