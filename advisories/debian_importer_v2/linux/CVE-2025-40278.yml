summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: sched: act_ife:
  initialize struct tc_ife to fix KMSAN kernel-infoleak  Fix a KMSAN kernel-infoleak detected  by
  the syzbot .  [net?] KMSAN: kernel-infoleak in __skb_datagram_iter  In tcf_ife_dump(), the
  variable ''opt'' was partially initialized using a designatied initializer. While the padding
  bytes are reamined uninitialized. nla_put() copies the entire structure into a netlink message,
  these uninitialized bytes leaked to userspace.  Initialize the structure with memset before
  assigning its fields to ensure all members and padding are cleared prior to beign copied.  This
  change silences the KMSAN report and prevents potential information leaks from the kernel
  memory.  This fix has been tested and validated by syzbot. This patch closes the bug reported
  at the following syzkaller link and ensures no infoleak.'
