summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/msm: make
  sure last_fence is always updated  Update last_fence in the vm-bind path instead of kernel
  managed path.  last_fence is used to wait for work to finish in vm_bind contexts but not used
  for kernel managed contexts.  This fixes a bug where last_fence is not waited on context close
  leading to faults as resources are freed while in use.  Patchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/680080/'
