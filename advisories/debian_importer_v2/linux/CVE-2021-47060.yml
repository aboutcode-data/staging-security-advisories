summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: Stop looking
  for coalesced MMIO zones if the bus is destroyed  Abort the walk of coalesced MMIO zones if
  kvm_io_bus_unregister_dev() fails to allocate memory for the new instance of the bus.  If
  it can''t instantiate a new bus, unregister_dev() destroys all devices _except_ the target
  device.   But, it doesn''t tell the caller that it obliterated the bus and invoked the destructor
  for all devices that were on the bus.  In the coalesced MMIO case, this can result in a deleted
  list entry dereference due to attempting to continue iterating on coalesced_zones after future
  entries (in the walk) have been deleted.  Opportunistically add curly braces to the for-loop,
  which encompasses many lines but sneaks by without braces due to the guts being a single if
  statement.'
