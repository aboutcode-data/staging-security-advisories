summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: iwlwifi:
  mld: cancel mlo_scan_start_wk  mlo_scan_start_wk is not canceled on disconnection. In fact,
  it is not canceled anywhere except in the restart cleanup, where we don''t really have to.  This
  can cause an init-after-queue issue: if, for example, the work was queued and then drv_change_interface
  got executed.  This can also cause use-after-free: if the work is executed after the vif is
  freed.'
