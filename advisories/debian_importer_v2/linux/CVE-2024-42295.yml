summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: handle
  inconsistent state in nilfs_btnode_create_block()  Syzbot reported that a buffer state inconsistency
  was detected in nilfs_btnode_create_block(), triggering a kernel bug.  It is not appropriate
  to treat this inconsistency as a bug; it can occur if the argument block address (the buffer
  index of the newly created block) is a virtual block number and has been reallocated due to
  corruption of the bitmap used to manage its allocation state.  So, modify nilfs_btnode_create_block()
  and its callers to treat it as a possible filesystem error, rather than triggering a kernel
  bug.'
