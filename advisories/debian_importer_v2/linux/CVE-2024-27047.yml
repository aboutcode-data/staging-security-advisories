summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: phy: fix
  phy_get_internal_delay accessing an empty array  The phy_get_internal_delay function could
  try to access to an empty array in the case that the driver is calling phy_get_internal_delay
  without defining delay_values and rx-internal-delay-ps or tx-internal-delay-ps is defined
  to 0 in the device-tree. This will lead to "unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference
  at virtual address 0". To avoid this kernel oops, the test should be delay >= 0. As there
  is already delay < 0 test just before, the test could only be size == 0.'
