summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring/rw:
  ensure allocated iovec gets cleared for early failure  A previous commit reused the recyling
  infrastructure for early cleanup, but this is not enough for the case where our internal caches
  have overflowed. If this happens, then the allocated iovec can get leaked if the request is
  also aborted early.  Reinstate the previous forced free of the iovec for that situation.'
