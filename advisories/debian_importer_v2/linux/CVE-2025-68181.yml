  calls to drm_put_dev()  Since the allocation of the drivers main structure was changed to
  devm_drm_dev_alloc() drm_put_dev()''ing to trigger it to be free''d should be done by devres.  However,
  drm_put_dev() is still in the probe error and device remove paths. When the driver fails to
  probe warnings like the following are shown because devres is trying to drm_put_dev() after
  the driver already did it.  [    5.642230] radeon 0000:01:05.0: probe with driver radeon failed
  with error -22 [    5.649605] ------------[ cut here ]------------ [    5.649607] refcount_t:
