summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf, test_run:
  Subtract size of xdp_frame from allowed metadata size  The xdp_frame structure takes up part
  of the XDP frame headroom, limiting the size of the metadata. However, in bpf_test_run, we
  don''t take this into account, which makes it possible for userspace to supply a metadata
  size that is too large (taking up the entire headroom).  If userspace supplies such a large
  metadata size in live packet mode, the xdp_update_frame_from_buff() call in xdp_test_run_init_page()
  call will fail, after which packet transmission proceeds with an uninitialised frame structure,
  leading to the usual Bad Stuff.  The commit in the Fixes tag fixed a related bug where the
  second check in xdp_update_frame_from_buff() could fail, but did not add any additional constraints
  on the metadata size. Complete the fix by adding an additional check on the metadata size.
  Reorder the checks slightly to make the logic clearer and add a comment.'
