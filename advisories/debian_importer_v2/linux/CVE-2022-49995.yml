  - CVE-2022-49995
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  writeback: avoid
  use-after-free after removing device  When a disk is removed, bdi_unregister gets called to
  stop further writeback and wait for associated delayed work to complete.  However, wb_inode_writeback_end()
  may schedule bandwidth estimation dwork after this has completed, which can result in the
  timer attempting to access the just freed bdi_writeback.  Fix this by checking if the bdi_writeback
  is alive, similar to when scheduling writeback work.  Since this requires wb->work_lock, and
  wb_inode_writeback_end() may get called from interrupt, switch wb->work_lock to an irqsafe
  lock.'
