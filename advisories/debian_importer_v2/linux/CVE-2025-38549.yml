summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  efivarfs: Fix
  memory leak of efivarfs_fs_info in fs_context error paths  When processing mount options,
  efivarfs allocates efivarfs_fs_info (sfi) early in fs_context initialization. However, sfi
  is associated with the superblock and typically freed when the superblock is destroyed. If
  the fs_context is released (final put) before fill_super is called—such as on error paths
  or during reconfiguration—the sfi structure would leak, as ownership never transfers to the
  superblock.  Implement the .free callback in efivarfs_context_ops to ensure any allocated
  sfi is properly freed if the fs_context is torn down before fill_super, preventing this memory
  leak.'
