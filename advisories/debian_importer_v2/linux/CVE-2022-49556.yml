summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: SVM: Use
  kzalloc for sev ioctl interfaces to prevent kernel data leak  For some sev ioctl interfaces,
  the length parameter that is passed maybe less than or equal to SEV_FW_BLOB_MAX_SIZE, but
  larger than the data that PSP firmware returns. In this case, kmalloc will allocate memory
  that is the size of the input rather than the size of the data. Since PSP firmware doesn''t
  fully overwrite the allocated buffer, these sev ioctl interface may return uninitialized kernel
  slab memory.'
