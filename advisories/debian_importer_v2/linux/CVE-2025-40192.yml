summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Revert "ipmi:
  fix msg stack when IPMI is disconnected"  This reverts commit c608966f3f9c2dca596967501d00753282b395fc.  This
  patch has a subtle bug that can cause the IPMI driver to go into an infinite loop if the BMC
  misbehaves in a certain way.  Apparently certain BMCs do misbehave this way because several
  reports have come in recently about this.'
