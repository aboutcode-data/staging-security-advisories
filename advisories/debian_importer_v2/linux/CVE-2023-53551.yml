summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: gadget:
  u_serial: Add null pointer check in gserial_resume  Consider a case where gserial_disconnect
  has already cleared gser->ioport. And if a wakeup interrupt triggers afterwards, gserial_resume
  gets called, which will lead to accessing of gser->ioport and thus causing null pointer dereference.Add
  a null pointer check to prevent this.  Added a static spinlock to prevent gser->ioport from
  becoming null after the newly added check.'
