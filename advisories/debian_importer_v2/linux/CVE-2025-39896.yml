summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  accel/ivpu: Prevent
  recovery work from being queued during device removal  Use disable_work_sync() instead of
  cancel_work_sync() in ivpu_dev_fini() to ensure that no new recovery work items can be queued
  after device removal has started. Previously, recovery work could be scheduled even after
  canceling existing work, potentially leading to use-after-free bugs if recovery accessed freed
  resources.  Rename ivpu_pm_cancel_recovery() to ivpu_pm_disable_recovery() to better reflect
  its new behavior.'
