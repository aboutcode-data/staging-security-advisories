summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  erofs: fix inconsistent
  per-file compression format  EROFS can select compression algorithms on a per-file basis,
  and each per-file compression algorithm needs to be marked in the on-disk superblock for initialization.  However,
  syzkaller can generate inconsistent crafted images that use an unsupported algorithmtype for
  specific inodes, e.g. use MicroLZMA algorithmtype even it''s not set in `sbi->available_compr_algs`.  This
  can lead to an unexpected "BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference" if the corresponding decompressor
  isn''t built-in.  Fix this by checking against `sbi->available_compr_algs` for each m_algorithmformat
  request.  Incorrect !erofs_sb_has_compr_cfgs preset bitmap is now fixed together since it
  was harmless previously.'
