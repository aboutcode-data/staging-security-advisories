summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: Fix clk_hw_get_clk()
  when dev is NULL  Any registered clk_core structure can have a NULL pointer in its dev field.
  While never actually documented, this is evidenced by the wide usage of clk_register and clk_hw_register
  with a NULL device pointer, and the fact that the core of_clk_hw_register() function also
  passes a NULL device pointer.  A call to clk_hw_get_clk() on a clk_hw struct whose clk_core
  is in that case will result in a NULL pointer derefence when it calls dev_name() on that NULL
  device pointer.  Add a test for this case and use NULL as the dev_id if the device pointer
  is NULL.'
