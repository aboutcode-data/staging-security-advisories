summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfsd: clean up
  potential nfsd_file refcount leaks in COPY codepath  There are two different flavors of the
  nfsd4_copy struct. One is embedded in the compound and is used directly in synchronous copies.
  The other is dynamically allocated, refcounted and tracked in the client struture. For the
  embedded one, the cleanup just involves releasing any nfsd_files held on its behalf. For the
  async one, the cleanup is a bit more involved, and we need to dequeue it from lists, unhash
  it, etc.  There is at least one potential refcount leak in this code now. If the kthread_create
  call fails, then both the src and dst nfsd_files in the original nfsd4_copy object are leaked.  The
  cleanup in this codepath is also sort of weird. In the async copy case, we''ll have up to
  four nfsd_file references (src and dst for both flavors of copy structure). They are both
  put at the end of nfsd4_do_async_copy, even though the ones held on behalf of the embedded
  one outlive that structure.  Change it so that we always clean up the nfsd_file refs held
  by the embedded copy structure before nfsd4_copy returns. Rework cleanup_async_copy to handle
  both inter and intra copies. Eliminate nfsd4_cleanup_intra_ssc since it now becomes a no-op.'
