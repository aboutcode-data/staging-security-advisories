summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: netpoll:
  initialize work queue before error checks  Prevent a kernel warning when netconsole setup
  fails on devices with IFF_DISABLE_NETPOLL flag. The warning (at kernel/workqueue.c:4242 in
  __flush_work) occurs because the cleanup path tries to cancel an uninitialized work queue.  When
  __netpoll_setup() encounters a device with IFF_DISABLE_NETPOLL, it fails early and calls skb_pool_flush()
  for cleanup. This function calls cancel_work_sync(&np->refill_wq), but refill_wq hasn''t been
  initialized yet, triggering the warning.  Move INIT_WORK() to the beginning of __netpoll_setup(),
  ensuring the work queue is properly initialized before any potential failure points. This
  allows the cleanup path to safely cancel the work queue regardless of where the setup fails.'
