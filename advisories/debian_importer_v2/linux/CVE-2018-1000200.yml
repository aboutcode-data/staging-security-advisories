  - CVE-2018-1000200
summary: The Linux Kernel versions 4.14, 4.15, and 4.16 has a null pointer dereference which
  can result in an out of memory (OOM) killing of large mlocked processes. The issue arises
  from an oom killed process's final thread calling exit_mmap(), which calls munlock_vma_pages_all()
  for mlocked vmas.This can happen synchronously with the oom reaper's unmap_page_range() since
  the vma's VM_LOCKED bit is cleared before munlocking (to determine if any other vmas share
  the memory and are mlocked).
