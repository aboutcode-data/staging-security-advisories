summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: qla2xxx:
  Sanitize payload size to prevent member overflow  In qla27xx_copy_fpin_pkt() and qla27xx_copy_multiple_pkt(),
  the frame_size reported by firmware is used to calculate the copy length into item->iocb.
  However, the iocb member is defined as a fixed-size 64-byte array within struct purex_item.  If
  the reported frame_size exceeds 64 bytes, subsequent memcpy calls will overflow the iocb member
  boundary. While extra memory might be allocated, this cross-member write is unsafe and triggers
  warnings under CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE.  Fix this by capping total_bytes to the size of the
  iocb member (64 bytes) before allocation and copying. This ensures all copies remain within
  the bounds of the destination structure member.'
