summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cgroup/dmem:\
  \ avoid pool UAF  An UAF issue was observed:  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in page_counter_uncharge+0x65/0x150\

  \ be held by a caller after its associated memory region is unregistered. The current implementation\
  \ frees the pool even if users still hold references to it (e.g., before uncharge operations\
  \ complete).  This patch adds a reference counter to each pool, ensuring that a pool is only\
  \ freed when its reference count drops to zero."
