summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: reject unhashed
  sockets in bpf_sk_assign  The semantics for bpf_sk_assign are as follows:      sk = some_lookup_func()     bpf_sk_assign(skb,
  sk)     bpf_sk_release(sk)  That is, the sk is not consumed by bpf_sk_assign. The function
  therefore needs to make sure that sk lives long enough to be consumed from __inet_lookup_skb.
  The path through the stack for a TCPv4 packet is roughly:    netif_receive_skb_core: takes
  RCU read lock     __netif_receive_skb_core:       sch_handle_ingress:         tcf_classify:           bpf_sk_assign()       deliver_ptype_list_skb:         deliver_skb:           ip_packet_type->func
  == ip_rcv:             ip_rcv_core:             ip_rcv_finish_core:               dst_input:                 ip_local_deliver:                   ip_local_deliver_finish:                     ip_protocol_deliver_rcu:                       tcp_v4_rcv:                         __inet_lookup_skb:                           skb_steal_sock  The
  existing helper takes advantage of the fact that everything happens in the same RCU critical
  section: for sockets with SOCK_RCU_FREE set bpf_sk_assign never takes a reference. skb_steal_sock
  then checks SOCK_RCU_FREE again and does sock_put if necessary.  This approach assumes that
  SOCK_RCU_FREE is never set on a sk between bpf_sk_assign and skb_steal_sock, but this invariant
  is violated by unhashed UDP sockets. A new UDP socket is created in TCP_CLOSE state but without
  SOCK_RCU_FREE set. That flag is only added in udp_lib_get_port() which happens when a socket
  is bound.  When bpf_sk_assign was added it wasn''t possible to access unhashed UDP sockets
  from BPF, so this wasn''t a problem. This changed in commit 0c48eefae712 ("sock_map: Lift
  socket state restriction for datagram sockets"), but the helper wasn''t adjusted accordingly.
  The following sequence of events will therefore lead to a refcount leak:  1. Add socket(AF_INET,
  SOCK_DGRAM) to a sockmap. 2. Pull socket out of sockmap and bpf_sk_assign it. Since    SOCK_RCU_FREE
  is not set we increment the refcount. 3. bind() or connect() the socket, setting SOCK_RCU_FREE.
  4. skb_steal_sock will now set refcounted = false due to    SOCK_RCU_FREE. 5. tcp_v4_rcv()
  skips sock_put().  Fix the problem by rejecting unhashed sockets in bpf_sk_assign(). This
  matches the behaviour of __inet_lookup_skb which is ultimately the goal of bpf_sk_assign().'
