  - CVE-2022-49134
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mlxsw: spectrum:
  Guard against invalid local ports  When processing events generated by the device''s firmware,
  the driver protects itself from events reported for non-existent local ports, but not for
  the CPU port (local port 0), which exists, but does not have all the fields as any local port.  This
  can result in a NULL pointer dereference when trying access ''struct mlxsw_sp_port'' fields
  which are not initialized for CPU port.  Commit 63b08b1f6834 ("mlxsw: spectrum: Protect driver
  from buggy firmware") already handled such issue by bailing early when processing a PUDE event
  reported for the CPU port.  Generalize the approach by moving the check to a common function
  and making use of it in all relevant places.'
