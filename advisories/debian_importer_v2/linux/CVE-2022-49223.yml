summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cxl/port: Hold
  port reference until decoder release  KASAN + DEBUG_KOBJECT_RELEASE reports a potential use-after-free
  in cxl_decoder_release() where it goes to reference its parent, a cxl_port, to free its id
  back to port->decoder_ida.   BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in to_cxl_port+0x18/0x90 [cxl_core]  Read
  of size 8 at addr ffff888119270908 by task kworker/35:2/379   CPU: 35 PID: 379 Comm: kworker/35:2

  device core only guarantees parent lifetime until all children are unregistered. If a child
  needs a parent to complete its ->release() callback that child needs to hold a reference to
  extend the lifetime of the parent.'
