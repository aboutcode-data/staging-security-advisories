  - CVE-2018-12896
summary: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3. An Integer Overflow in
  kernel/time/posix-timers.c in the POSIX timer code is caused by the way the overrun accounting
  works. Depending on interval and expiry time values, the overrun can be larger than INT_MAX,
  but the accounting is int based. This basically makes the accounting values, which are visible
  to user space via timer_getoverrun(2) and siginfo::si_overrun, random. For example, a local
  user can cause a denial of service (signed integer overflow) via crafted mmap, futex, timer_create,
  and timer_settime system calls.
