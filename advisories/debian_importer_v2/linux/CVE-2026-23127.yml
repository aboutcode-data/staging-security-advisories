summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  perf: Fix refcount
  warning on event->mmap_count increment  When calling refcount_inc(&event->mmap_count) inside
  perf_mmap_rb(), the following warning is triggered:          refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.         WARNING:
  lib/refcount.c:25  PoC:      struct perf_event_attr attr = {0};     int fd = syscall(__NR_perf_event_open,
  &attr, 0, -1, -1, 0);     mmap(NULL, 0x3000, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);     int
  victim = syscall(__NR_perf_event_open, &attr, 0, -1, fd,                          PERF_FLAG_FD_OUTPUT);     mmap(NULL,
  0x3000, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, victim, 0);  This occurs when creating a group
  member event with the flag PERF_FLAG_FD_OUTPUT. The group leader should be mmap-ed and then
  mmap-ing the event triggers the warning.  Since the event has copied the output_event in perf_event_set_output(),
  event->rb is set. As a result, perf_mmap_rb() calls refcount_inc(&event->mmap_count) when
  event->mmap_count = 0.  Disallow the case when event->mmap_count = 0. This also prevents two
  events from updating the same user_page.'
