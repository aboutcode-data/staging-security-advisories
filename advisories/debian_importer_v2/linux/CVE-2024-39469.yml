summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix nilfs_empty_dir()
  misjudgment and long loop on I/O errors  The error handling in nilfs_empty_dir() when a directory
  folio/page read fails is incorrect, as in the old ext2 implementation, and if the folio/page
  cannot be read or nilfs_check_folio() fails, it will falsely determine the directory as empty
  and corrupt the file system.  In addition, since nilfs_empty_dir() does not immediately return
  on a failed folio/page read, but continues to loop, this can cause a long loop with I/O if
  i_size of the directory''s inode is also corrupted, causing the log writer thread to wait
  and hang, as reported by syzbot.  Fix these issues by making nilfs_empty_dir() immediately
  return a false value (0) if it fails to get a directory folio/page.'
