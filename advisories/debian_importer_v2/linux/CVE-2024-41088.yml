summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: mcp251xfd:
  fix infinite loop when xmit fails  When the mcp251xfd_start_xmit() function fails, the driver
  stops processing messages, and the interrupt routine does not return, running indefinitely
  even after killing the running application.  Error messages: [  441.298819] mcp251xfd spi2.0
  can0: ERROR in mcp251xfd_start_xmit: -16 [  441.306498] mcp251xfd spi2.0 can0: Transmit Event
  FIFO buffer not empty. (seq=0x000017c7, tef_tail=0x000017cf, tef_head=0x000017d0, tx_head=0x000017d3).
  ... and repeat forever.  The issue can be triggered when multiple devices share the same SPI
  interface. And there is concurrent access to the bus.  The problem occurs because tx_ring->head
  increments even if mcp251xfd_start_xmit() fails. Consequently, the driver skips one TX package
  while still expecting a response in mcp251xfd_handle_tefif_one().  Resolve the issue by starting
  a workqueue to write the tx obj synchronously if err = -EBUSY. In case of another error, decrement
  tx_ring->head, remove skb from the echo stack, and drop the message.  [mkl: use more imperative
  wording in patch description]'
