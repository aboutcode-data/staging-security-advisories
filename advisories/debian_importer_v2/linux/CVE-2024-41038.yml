summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  firmware: cs_dsp:
  Prevent buffer overrun when processing V2 alg headers  Check that all fields of a V2 algorithm
  header fit into the available firmware data buffer.  The wmfw V2 format introduced variable-length
  strings in the algorithm block header. This means the overall header length is variable, and
  the position of most fields varies depending on the length of the string fields. Each field
  must be checked to ensure that it does not overflow the firmware data buffer.  As this ia
  bugfix patch, the fixes avoid making any significant change to the existing code. This makes
  it easier to review and less likely to introduce new bugs.'
