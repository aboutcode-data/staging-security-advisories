summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  um: time-travel:
  fix time corruption  In ''basic'' time-travel mode (without =inf-cpu or =ext), we still get
  timer interrupts. These can happen at arbitrary points in time, i.e. while in timer_read(),
  which pushes time forward just a little bit. Then, if we happen to get the interrupt after
  calculating the new time to push to, but before actually finishing that, the interrupt will
  set the time to a value that''s incompatible with the forward, and we''ll crash because time
  goes backwards when we do the forwarding.  Fix this by reading the time_travel_time, calculating
  the adjustment, and doing the adjustment all with interrupts disabled.'
