summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  NFS: Fix a potential
  NULL dereference in nfs_get_client()  None of the callers are expecting NULL returns from
  nfs_get_client() so this code will lead to an Oops.  It''s better to return an error pointer.  I
  expect that this is dead code so hopefully no one is affected.'
