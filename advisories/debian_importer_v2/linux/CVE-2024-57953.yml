summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rtc: tps6594:\
  \ Fix integer overflow on 32bit systems  The problem is this multiply in tps6594_rtc_set_offset()\
  \  \ttmp = offset * TICKS_PER_HOUR;  The \"tmp\" variable is an s64 but \"offset\" is a long\
  \ in the (-277774)-277774 range.  On 32bit systems a long can hold numbers up to approximately\
  \ two billion.  The number of TICKS_PER_HOUR is really large, (32768 * 3600) or roughly a\
  \ hundred million.  When you start multiplying by a hundred million it doesn't take long to\
  \ overflow the two billion mark.  Probably the safest way to fix this is to change the type\
  \ of TICKS_PER_HOUR to long long because it's such a large number."
