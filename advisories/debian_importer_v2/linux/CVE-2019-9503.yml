summary: The Broadcom brcmfmac WiFi driver prior to commit a4176ec356c73a46c07c181c6d04039fafa34a9f
  is vulnerable to a frame validation bypass. If the brcmfmac driver receives a firmware event
  frame from a remote source, the is_wlc_event_frame function will cause this frame to be discarded
  and unprocessed. If the driver receives the firmware event frame from the host, the appropriate
  handler is called. This frame validation can be bypassed if the bus used is USB (for instance
  by a wifi dongle). This can allow firmware event frames from a remote source to be processed.
  In the worst case scenario, by sending specially-crafted WiFi packets, a remote, unauthenticated
  attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. More typically, this
  vulnerability will result in denial-of-service conditions.
