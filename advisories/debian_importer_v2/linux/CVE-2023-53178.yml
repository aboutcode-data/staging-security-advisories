summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm: fix zswap
  writeback race condition  The zswap writeback mechanism can cause a race condition resulting
  in memory corruption, where a swapped out page gets swapped in with data that was written
  to a different page.  The race unfolds like this: 1. a page with data A and swap offset X
  is stored in zswap 2. page A is removed off the LRU by zpool driver for writeback in    zswap-shrink
  work, data for A is mapped by zpool driver 3. user space program faults and invalidates page
  entry A, offset X is    considered free 4. kswapd stores page B at offset X in zswap (zswap
  could also be    full, if so, page B would then be IOed to X, then skip step 5.) 5. entry
  A is replaced by B in tree->rbroot, this doesn''t affect the    local reference held by zswap-shrink
  work 6. zswap-shrink work writes back A at X, and frees zswap entry A 7. swapin of slot X
  brings A in memory instead of B  The fix: Once the swap page cache has been allocated (case
  ZSWAP_SWAPCACHE_NEW), zswap-shrink work just checks that the local zswap_entry reference is
  still the same as the one in the tree.  If it''s not the same it means that it''s either been
  invalidated or replaced, in both cases the writeback is aborted because the local entry contains
  stale data.  Reproducer: I originally found this by running `stress` overnight to validate
  my work on the zswap writeback mechanism, it manifested after hours on my test machine.  The
  key to make it happen is having zswap writebacks, so whatever setup pumps /sys/kernel/debug/zswap/written_back_pages
  should do the trick.  In order to reproduce this faster on a vm, I setup a system with ~100M
  of available memory and a 500M swap file, then running `stress --vm 1 --vm-bytes 300000000
  --vm-stride 4000` makes it happen in matter of tens of minutes.  One can speed things up even
  more by swinging /sys/module/zswap/parameters/max_pool_percent up and down between, say, 20
  and 1; this makes it reproduce in tens of seconds.  It''s crucial to set `--vm-stride` to
  something other than 4096 otherwise `stress` won''t realize that memory has been corrupted
  because all pages would have the same data.'
