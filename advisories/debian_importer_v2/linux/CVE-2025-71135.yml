  - CVE-2025-71135
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  md/raid5: fix
  possible null-pointer dereferences in raid5_store_group_thread_cnt()  The variable mddev->private
  is first assigned to conf and then checked:    conf = mddev->private;   if (!conf) ...  If
  conf is NULL, then mddev->private is also NULL. In this case, null-pointer dereferences can
  occur when calling raid5_quiesce():    raid5_quiesce(mddev, true);   raid5_quiesce(mddev,
  false);  since mddev->private is assigned to conf again in raid5_quiesce(), and conf is dereferenced
  in several places, for example:    conf->quiesce = 0;   wake_up(&conf->wait_for_quiescent);  To
  fix this issue, the function should unlock mddev and return before invoking raid5_quiesce()
  when conf is NULL, following the existing pattern in raid5_change_consistency_policy().'
