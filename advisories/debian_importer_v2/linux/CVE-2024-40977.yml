summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: mt76: mt7921s:
  fix potential hung tasks during chip recovery  During chip recovery (e.g. chip reset), there
  is a possible situation that kernel worker reset_work is holding the lock and waiting for
  kernel thread stat_worker to be parked, while stat_worker is waiting for the release of the
  same lock. It causes a deadlock resulting in the dumping of hung tasks messages and possible
  rebooting of the device.  This patch prevents the execution of stat_worker during the chip
  recovery.'
