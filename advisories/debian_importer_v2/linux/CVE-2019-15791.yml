  - CVE-2019-15791
summary: In shiftfs, a non-upstream patch to the Linux kernel included in the Ubuntu 5.0 and
  5.3 kernel series, shiftfs_btrfs_ioctl_fd_replace() installs an fd referencing a file from
  the lower filesystem without taking an additional reference to that file. After the btrfs
  ioctl completes this fd is closed, which then puts a reference to that file, leading to a
  refcount underflow.
