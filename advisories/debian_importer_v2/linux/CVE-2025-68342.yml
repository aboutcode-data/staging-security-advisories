summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: gs_usb:
  gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): check actual_length before accessing data  The URB received
  in gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback() contains a struct gs_host_frame. The length of the data
  after the header depends on the gs_host_frame hf::flags and the active device features (e.g.
  time stamping).  Introduce a new function gs_usb_get_minimum_length() and check that we have
  at least received the required amount of data before accessing it. Only copy the data to that
  skb that has actually been received.  [mkl: rename gs_usb_get_minimum_length() -> +gs_usb_get_minimum_rx_length()]'
