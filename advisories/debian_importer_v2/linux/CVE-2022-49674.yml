summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dm raid: fix
  accesses beyond end of raid member array  On dm-raid table load (using raid_ctr), dm-raid
  allocates an array rs->devs[rs->raid_disks] for the raid device members. rs->raid_disks is
  defined by the number of raid metadata and image tupples passed into the target''s constructor.  In
  the case of RAID layout changes being requested, that number can be different from the current
  number of members for existing raid sets as defined in their superblocks. Example RAID layout
  changes include: - raid1 legs being added/removed - raid4/5/6/10 number of stripes changed
  (stripe reshaping) - takeover to higher raid level (e.g. raid5 -> raid6)  When accessing array
  members, rs->raid_disks must be used in control loops instead of the potentially larger value
  in rs->md.raid_disks. Otherwise it will cause memory access beyond the end of the rs->devs
  array.  Fix this by changing code that is prone to out-of-bounds access. Also fix validate_raid_redundancy()
  to validate all devices that are added. Also, use braces to help clean up raid_iterate_devices().  The
  out-of-bounds memory accesses was discovered using KASAN.  This commit was verified to pass
  all LVM2 RAID tests (with KASAN enabled).'
