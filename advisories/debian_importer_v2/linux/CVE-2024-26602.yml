summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sched/membarrier:
  reduce the ability to hammer on sys_membarrier  On some systems, sys_membarrier can be very
  expensive, causing overall slowdowns for everything.  So put a lock on the path in order to
  serialize the accesses to prevent the ability for this to be called at too high of a frequency
  and saturate the machine.'
