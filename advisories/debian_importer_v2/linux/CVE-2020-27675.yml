  - CVE-2020-27675
summary: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.9.1, as used with Xen through
  4.14.x. drivers/xen/events/events_base.c allows event-channel removal during the event-handling
  loop (a race condition). This can cause a use-after-free or NULL pointer dereference, as demonstrated
  by a dom0 crash via events for an in-reconfiguration paravirtualized device, aka CID-073d0552ead5.
