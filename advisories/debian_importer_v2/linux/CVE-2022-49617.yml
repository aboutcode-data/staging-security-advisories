summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: Intel:
  sof_sdw: handle errors on card registration  If the card registration fails, typically because
  of deferred probes, the device properties added for headset codecs are not removed, which
  leads to kernel oopses in driver bind/unbind tests.  We already clean-up the device properties
  when the card is removed, this code can be moved as a helper and called upon card registration
  errors.'
