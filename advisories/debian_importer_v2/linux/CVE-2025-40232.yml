summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rv: Fully convert
  enabled_monitors to use list_head as iterator  The callbacks in enabled_monitors_seq_ops are
  inconsistent. Some treat the iterator as struct rv_monitor *, while others treat the iterator
  as struct list_head *.  This causes a wrong type cast and crashes the system as reported by
  Nathan.  Convert everything to use struct list_head * as iterator. This also makes enabled_monitors
  consistent with available_monitors.'
