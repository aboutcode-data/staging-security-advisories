summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tracing/user_events:
  Ensure write index cannot be negative  The write index indicates which event the data is for
  and accesses a per-file array. The index is passed by user processes during write() calls
  as the first 4 bytes. Ensure that it cannot be negative by returning -EINVAL to prevent out
  of bounds accesses.  Update ftrace self-test to ensure this occurs properly.'
