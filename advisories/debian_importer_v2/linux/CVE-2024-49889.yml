summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: avoid use-after-free
  in ext4_ext_show_leaf()  In ext4_find_extent(), path may be freed by error or be reallocated,
  so using a previously saved *ppath may have been freed and thus may trigger use-after-free,
  as follows:  ext4_split_extent   path = *ppath;   ext4_split_extent_at(ppath)   path = ext4_find_extent(ppath)   ext4_split_extent_at(ppath)     //
  ext4_find_extent fails to free path     // but zeroout succeeds   ext4_ext_show_leaf(inode,
  path)     eh = path[depth].p_hdr     // path use-after-free !!!  Similar to ext4_split_extent_at(),
  we use *ppath directly as an input to ext4_ext_show_leaf(). Fix a spelling error by the way.  Same
  problem in ext4_ext_handle_unwritten_extents(). Since ''path'' is only used in ext4_ext_show_leaf(),
  remove ''path'' and use *ppath directly.  This issue is triggered only when EXT_DEBUG is defined
  and therefore does not affect functionality.'
