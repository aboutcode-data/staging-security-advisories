summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: aloop:
  Fix racy access at PCM trigger  The PCM trigger callback of aloop driver tries to check the
  PCM state and stop the stream of the tied substream in the corresponding cable. Since both
  check and stop operations are performed outside the cable lock, this may result in UAF when
  a program attempts to trigger frequently while opening/closing the tied stream, as spotted
  by fuzzers.  For addressing the UAF, this patch changes two things: - It covers the most of
  code in loopback_check_format() with   cable->lock spinlock, and add the proper NULL checks.  This
  avoids   already some racy accesses. - In addition, now we try to check the state of the capture
  PCM stream   that may be stopped in this function, which was the major pain point   leading
  to UAF.'
