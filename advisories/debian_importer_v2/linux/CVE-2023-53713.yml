summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  arm64: sme: Use
  STR P to clear FFR context field in streaming SVE mode  The FFR is a predicate register which
  can vary between 16 and 256 bits in size depending upon the configured vector length. When
  saving the SVE state in streaming SVE mode, the FFR register is inaccessible and so commit
  9f5848665788 ("arm64/sve: Make access to FFR optional") simply clears the FFR field of the
  in-memory context structure. Unfortunately, it achieves this using an unconditional 8-byte
  store and so if the SME vector length is anything other than 64 bytes in size we will either
  fail to clear the entire field or, worse, we will corrupt memory immediately following the
  structure. This has led to intermittent kfence splats in CI [1] and can trigger kmalloc Redzone
  corruption messages when running the ''fp-stress'' kselftest:   | =============================================================================  |
  BUG kmalloc-1k (Not tainted): kmalloc Redzone overwritten  | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |  |

  the 8-byte store with a store of a predicate register which has been zero-initialised with
  PFALSE, ensuring that the entire field is cleared in memory.  [1] https://lore.kernel.org/r/CA+G9fYtU7HsV0R0dp4XEH5xXHSJFw8KyDf5VQrLLfMxWfxQkag@mail.gmail.com'
