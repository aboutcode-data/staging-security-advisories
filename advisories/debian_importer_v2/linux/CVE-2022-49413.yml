summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bfq: Update cgroup
  information before merging bio  When the process is migrated to a different cgroup (or in
  case of writeback just starts submitting bios associated with a different cgroup) bfq_merge_bio()
  can operate with stale cgroup information in bic. Thus the bio can be merged to a request
  from a different cgroup or it can result in merging of bfqqs for different cgroups or bfqqs
  of already dead cgroups and causing possible use-after-free issues. Fix the problem by updating
  cgroup information in bfq_merge_bio().'
