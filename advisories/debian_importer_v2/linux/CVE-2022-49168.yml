summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: do not
  clean up repair bio if submit fails  The submit helper will always run bio_endio() on the
  bio if it fails to submit, so cleaning up the bio just leads to a variety of use-after-free
  and NULL pointer dereference bugs because we race with the endio function that is cleaning
  up the bio.  Instead just return BLK_STS_OK as the repair function has to continue to process
  the rest of the pages, and the endio for the repair bio will do the appropriate cleanup for
  the page that it was given.'
