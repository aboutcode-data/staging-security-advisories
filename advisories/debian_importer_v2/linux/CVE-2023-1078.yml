aliases:
  - CVE-2023-1078
summary: A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel in RDS (Reliable Datagram Sockets) protocol. The
  rds_rm_zerocopy_callback() uses list_entry() on the head of a list causing a type confusion.
  Local user can trigger this with rds_message_put(). Type confusion leads to `struct rds_msg_zcopy_info
  *info` actually points to something else that is potentially controlled by local user. It
  is known how to trigger this, which causes an out of bounds access, and a lock corruption.
