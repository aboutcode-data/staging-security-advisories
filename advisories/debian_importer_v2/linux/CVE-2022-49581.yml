summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  be2net: Fix buffer
  overflow in be_get_module_eeprom  be_cmd_read_port_transceiver_data assumes that it is given
  a buffer that is at least PAGE_DATA_LEN long, or twice that if the module supports SFF 8472.
  However, this is not always the case.  Fix this by passing the desired offset and length to
  be_cmd_read_port_transceiver_data so that we only copy the bytes once.'
