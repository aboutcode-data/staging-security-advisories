summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tomoyo: don''t
  emit warning in tomoyo_write_control()  syzbot is reporting too large allocation warning at
  tomoyo_write_control(), for one can write a very very long line without new line character.
  To fix this warning, I use __GFP_NOWARN rather than checking for KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE, for practically
  a valid line should be always shorter than 32KB where the "too small to fail" memory-allocation
  rule applies.  One might try to write a valid line that is longer than 32KB, but such request
  will likely fail with -ENOMEM. Therefore, I feel that separately returning -EINVAL when a
  line is longer than KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE is redundant. There is no need to distinguish over-32KB
  and over-KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE.'
