summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  s390: fix double
  free of GS and RI CBs on fork() failure  The pointers for guarded storage and runtime instrumentation
  control blocks are stored in the thread_struct of the associated task. These pointers are
  initially copied on fork() via arch_dup_task_struct() and then cleared via copy_thread() before
  fork() returns. If fork() happens to fail after the initial task dup and before copy_thread(),
  the newly allocated task and associated thread_struct memory are freed via free_task() ->
  arch_release_task_struct(). This results in a double free of the guarded storage and runtime
  info structs because the fields in the failed task still refer to memory associated with the
  source task.  This problem can manifest as a BUG_ON() in set_freepointer() (with CONFIG_SLAB_FREELIST_HARDENED
  enabled) or KASAN splat (if enabled) when running trinity syscall fuzz tests on s390x. To
  avoid this problem, clear the associated pointer fields in arch_dup_task_struct() immediately
  after the new task is copied. Note that the RI flag is still cleared in copy_thread() because
  it resides in thread stack memory and that is where stack info is copied.'
