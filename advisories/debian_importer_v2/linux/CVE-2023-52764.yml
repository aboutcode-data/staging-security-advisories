summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: gspca:
  cpia1: shift-out-of-bounds in set_flicker  Syzkaller reported the following issue: UBSAN:
  shift-out-of-bounds in drivers/media/usb/gspca/cpia1.c:1031:27 shift exponent 245 is too large
  for 32-bit type ''int''  When the value of the variable "sd->params.exposure.gain" exceeds
  the number of bits in an integer, a shift-out-of-bounds error is reported. It is triggered
  because the variable "currentexp" cannot be left-shifted by more than the number of bits in
  an integer. In order to avoid invalid range during left-shift, the conditional expression
  is added.'
