summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cxl/region: Fix
  cxl_region leak, cleanup targets at region delete  When a region is deleted any targets that
  have been previously assigned to that region hold references to it. Trigger those references
  to drop by detaching all targets at unregister_region() time.  Otherwise that region object
  will leak as userspace has lost the ability to detach targets once region sysfs is torn down.'
