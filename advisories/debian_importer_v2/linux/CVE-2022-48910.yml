summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: ipv6: ensure\
  \ we call ipv6_mc_down() at most once  There are two reasons for addrconf_notify() to be called\
  \ with NETDEV_DOWN: either the network device is actually going down, or IPv6 was disabled\
  \ on the interface.  If either of them stays down while the other is toggled, we repeatedly\
  \ call the code for NETDEV_DOWN, including ipv6_mc_down(), while never calling the corresponding\
  \ ipv6_mc_up() in between. This will cause a new entry in idev->mc_tomb to be allocated for\
  \ each multicast group the interface is subscribed to, which in turn leaks one struct ifmcaddr6\
  \ per nontrivial multicast group the interface is subscribed to.  The following reproducer\
  \ will leak at least $n objects:  ip addr add ff2e::4242/32 dev eth0 autojoin sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.eth0.disable_ipv6=1\
  \ for i in $(seq 1 $n); do \tip link set up eth0; ip link set down eth0 done  Joining groups\
  \ with IPV6_ADD_MEMBERSHIP (unprivileged) or setting the sysctl net.ipv6.conf.eth0.forwarding\
  \ to 1 (=> subscribing to ff02::2) can also be used to create a nontrivial idev->mc_list,\
  \ which will the leak objects with the right up-down-sequence.  Based on both sources for\
  \ NETDEV_DOWN events the interface IPv6 state should be considered:   - not ready if the network\
  \ interface is not ready OR IPv6 is disabled    for it  - ready if the network interface is\
  \ ready AND IPv6 is enabled for it  The functions ipv6_mc_up() and ipv6_down() should only\
  \ be run when this state changes.  Implement this by remembering when the IPv6 state is ready,\
  \ and only run ipv6_mc_down() if it actually changed from ready to not ready.  The other direction\
  \ (not ready -> ready) already works correctly, as:   - the interface notification triggered\
  \ codepath for NETDEV_UP /    NETDEV_CHANGE returns early if ipv6 is disabled, and  - the\
  \ disable_ipv6=0 triggered codepath skips fully initializing the    interface as long as addrconf_link_ready(dev)\
  \ returns false  - calling ipv6_mc_up() repeatedly does not leak anything"
