summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  NFSD: Fix ia_size
  underflow  iattr::ia_size is a loff_t, which is a signed 64-bit type. NFSv3 and NFSv4 both
  define file size as an unsigned 64-bit type. Thus there is a range of valid file size values
  an NFS client can send that is already larger than Linux can handle.  Currently decode_fattr4()
  dumps a full u64 value into ia_size. If that value happens to be larger than S64_MAX, then
  ia_size underflows. I''m about to fix up the NFSv3 behavior as well, so let''s catch the underflow
  in the common code path: nfsd_setattr().'
