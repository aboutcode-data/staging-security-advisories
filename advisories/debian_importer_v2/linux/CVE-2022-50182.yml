summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: imx-jpeg:
  Align upwards buffer size  The hardware can support any image size WxH, with arbitrary W (image
  width) and H (image height) dimensions.  Align upwards buffer size for both encoder and decoder.
  and leave the picture resolution unchanged.  For decoder, the risk of memory out of bounds
  can be avoided. For both encoder and decoder, the driver will lift the limitation of resolution
  alignment.  For example, the decoder can support jpeg whose resolution is 227x149 the encoder
  can support nv12 1080P, won''t change it to 1920x1072.'
