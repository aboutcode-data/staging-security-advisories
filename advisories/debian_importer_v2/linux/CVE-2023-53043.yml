summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  arm64: dts: qcom:
  sc7280: Mark PCIe controller as cache coherent  If the controller is not marked as cache coherent,
  then kernel will try to ensure coherency during dma-ops and that may cause data corruption.
  So, mark the PCIe node as dma-coherent as the devices on PCIe bus are cache coherent.'
