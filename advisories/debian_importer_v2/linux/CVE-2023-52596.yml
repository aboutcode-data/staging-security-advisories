summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sysctl: Fix out
  of bounds access for empty sysctl registers  When registering tables to the sysctl subsystem
  there is a check to see if header is a permanently empty directory (used for mounts). This
  check evaluates the first element of the ctl_table. This results in an out of bounds evaluation
  when registering empty directories.  The function register_sysctl_mount_point now passes a
  ctl_table of size 1 instead of size 0. It now relies solely on the type to identify a permanently
  empty register.  Make sure that the ctl_table has at least one element before testing for
  permanent emptiness.'
