summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: fix memory
  leak in ext4_fill_super  Buffer head references must be released before calling kill_bdev();
  otherwise the buffer head (and its page referenced by b_data) will not be freed by kill_bdev,
  and subsequently that bh will be leaked.  If blocksizes differ, sb_set_blocksize() will kill
  current buffers and page cache by using kill_bdev(). And then super block will be reread again
  but using correct blocksize this time. sb_set_blocksize() didn''t fully free superblock page
  and buffer head, and being busy, they were not freed and instead leaked.  This can easily
  be reproduced by calling an infinite loop of:    systemctl start <ext4_on_lvm>.mount, and   systemctl
  stop <ext4_on_lvm>.mount  ... since systemd creates a cgroup for each slice which it mounts,
  and the bh leak get amplified by a dying memory cgroup that also never gets freed, and memory
  consumption is much more easily noticed.'
