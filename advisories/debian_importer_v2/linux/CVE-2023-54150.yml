summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd: Fix
  an out of bounds error in BIOS parser  The array is hardcoded to 8 in atomfirmware.h, but
  firmware provides a bigger one sometimes. Deferencing the larger array causes an out of bounds
  error.  commit 4fc1ba4aa589 ("drm/amd/display: fix array index out of bound error in bios
  parser") fixed some of this, but there are two other cases not covered by it.  Fix those as
  well.'
