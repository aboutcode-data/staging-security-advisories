summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm: vmalloc:
  check if a hash-index is in cpu_possible_mask  The problem is that there are systems where
  cpu_possible_mask has gaps between set CPUs, for example SPARC.  In this scenario addr_to_vb_xa()
  hash function can return an index which accesses to not-possible and not setup CPU area using
  per_cpu() macro.  This results in an oops on SPARC.  A per-cpu vmap_block_queue is also used
  as hash table, incorrectly assuming the cpu_possible_mask has no gaps.  Fix it by adjusting
  an index to a next possible CPU.'
