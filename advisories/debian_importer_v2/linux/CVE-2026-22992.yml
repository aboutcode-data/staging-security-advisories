  - CVE-2026-22992
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  libceph: return
  the handler error from mon_handle_auth_done()  Currently any error from ceph_auth_handle_reply_done()
  is propagated via finish_auth() but isn''t returned from mon_handle_auth_done().  This results
  in higher layers learning that (despite the monitor considering us to be successfully authenticated)
  something went wrong in the authentication phase and reacting accordingly, but msgr2 still
  trying to proceed with establishing the session in the background.  In the case of secure
  mode this can trigger a WARN in setup_crypto() and later lead to a NULL pointer dereference
  inside of prepare_auth_signature().'
