summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  MIPS: pgalloc:
  fix memory leak caused by pgd_free()  pgd page is freed by generic implementation pgd_free()
  since commit f9cb654cb550 ("asm-generic: pgalloc: provide generic pgd_free()"), however, there
  are scenarios that the system uses more than one page as the pgd table, in such cases the
  generic implementation pgd_free() won''t be applicable anymore. For example, when PAGE_SIZE_4KB
  is enabled and MIPS_VA_BITS_48 is not enabled in a 64bit system, the macro "PGD_ORDER" will
  be set as "1", which will cause allocating two pages as the pgd table. Well, at the same time,
  the generic implementation pgd_free() just free one pgd page, which will result in the memory
  leak.  The memory leak can be easily detected by executing shell command: "while true; do
  ls > /dev/null; grep MemFree /proc/meminfo; done"'
