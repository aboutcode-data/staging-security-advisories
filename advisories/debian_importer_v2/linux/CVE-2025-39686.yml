summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  comedi: Make
  insn_rw_emulate_bits() do insn->n samples  The `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` function is used as
  a default handler for `INSN_READ` instructions for subdevices that have a handler for `INSN_BITS`
  but not for `INSN_READ`.  Similarly, it is used as a default handler for `INSN_WRITE` instructions
  for subdevices that have a handler for `INSN_BITS` but not for `INSN_WRITE`. It works by emulating
  the `INSN_READ` or `INSN_WRITE` instruction handling with a constructed `INSN_BITS` instruction.  However,
  `INSN_READ` and `INSN_WRITE` instructions are supposed to be able read or write multiple samples,
  indicated by the `insn->n` value, but `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` currently only handles a single
  sample.  For `INSN_READ`, the comedi core will copy `insn->n` samples back to user-space.  (That
  triggered KASAN kernel-infoleak errors when `insn->n` was greater than 1, but that is being
  fixed more generally elsewhere in the comedi core.)  Make `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` either
  handle `insn->n` samples, or return an error, to conform to the general expectation for `INSN_READ`
  and `INSN_WRITE` handlers.'
