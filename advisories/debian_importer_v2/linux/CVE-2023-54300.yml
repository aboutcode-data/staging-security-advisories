summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath9k:
  avoid referencing uninit memory in ath9k_wmi_ctrl_rx  For the reasons also described in commit
  b383e8abed41 ("wifi: ath9k: avoid uninit memory read in ath9k_htc_rx_msg()"), ath9k_htc_rx_msg()
  should validate pkt_len before accessing the SKB.  For example, the obtained SKB may have
  been badly constructed with pkt_len = 8. In this case, the SKB can only contain a valid htc_frame_hdr
  but after being processed in ath9k_htc_rx_msg() and passed to ath9k_wmi_ctrl_rx() endpoint
  RX handler, it is expected to have a WMI command header which should be located inside its
  data payload.  Implement sanity checking inside ath9k_wmi_ctrl_rx(). Otherwise, uninit memory
  can be referenced.  Tested on Qualcomm Atheros Communications AR9271 802.11n .  Found by Linux
  Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.'
