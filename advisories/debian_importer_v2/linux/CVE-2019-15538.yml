  - CVE-2019-15538
summary: An issue was discovered in xfs_setattr_nonsize in fs/xfs/xfs_iops.c in the Linux kernel
  through 5.2.9. XFS partially wedges when a chgrp fails on account of being out of disk quota.
  xfs_setattr_nonsize is failing to unlock the ILOCK after the xfs_qm_vop_chown_reserve call
  fails. This is primarily a local DoS attack vector, but it might result as well in remote
  DoS if the XFS filesystem is exported for instance via NFS.
