aliases:
  - CVE-2019-1125
summary: An information disclosure vulnerability exists when certain central processing units
  (CPU) speculatively access memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability
  could read privileged data across trust boundaries. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker
  would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application. The vulnerability
  would not allow an attacker to elevate user rights directly, but it could be used to obtain
  information that could be used to try to compromise the affected system further. On January
  3, 2018, Microsoft released an advisory and security updates related to a newly-discovered
  class of hardware vulnerabilities (known as Spectre) involving speculative execution side
  channels that affect AMD, ARM, and Intel CPUs to varying degrees. This vulnerability, released
  on August 6, 2019, is a variant of the Spectre Variant 1 speculative execution side channel
  vulnerability and has been assigned CVE-2019-1125. Microsoft released a security update on
  July 9, 2019 that addresses the vulnerability through a software change that mitigates how
  the CPU speculatively accesses memory. Note that this vulnerability does not require a microcode
  update from your device OEM.
