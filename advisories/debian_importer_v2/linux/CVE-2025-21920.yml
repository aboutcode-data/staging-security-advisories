summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vlan: enforce
  underlying device type  Currently, VLAN devices can be created on top of non-ethernet devices.  Besides
  the fact that it doesn''t make much sense, this also causes a bug which leaks the address
  of a kernel function to usermode.  When creating a VLAN device, we initialize GARP (garp_init_applicant)
  and MRP (mrp_init_applicant) for the underlying device.  As part of the initialization process,
  we add the multicast address of each applicant to the underlying device, by calling dev_mc_add.  __dev_mc_add
  uses dev->addr_len to determine the length of the new multicast address.  This causes an out-of-bounds
  read if dev->addr_len is greater than 6, since the multicast addresses provided by GARP and
  MRP are only 6 bytes long.  This behaviour can be reproduced using the following commands:  ip
  tunnel add gretest mode ip6gre local ::1 remote ::2 dev lo ip l set up dev gretest ip link
  add link gretest name vlantest type vlan id 100  Then, the following command will display
  the address of garp_pdu_rcv:  ip maddr show | grep 01:80:c2:00:00:21  Fix the bug by enforcing
  the type of the underlying device during VLAN device initialization.'
