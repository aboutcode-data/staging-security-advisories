  5.1.5. phys_efi_set_virtual_address_map in arch/x86/platform/efi/efi.c and efi_call_phys_prolog
  in arch/x86/platform/efi/efi_64.c mishandle memory allocation failures. NOTE: This id is disputed
  as not being an issue because “All the code touched by the referenced commit runs only at
  boot, before any user processes are started. Therefore, there is no possibility for an unprivileged
  user to control it.”.'
