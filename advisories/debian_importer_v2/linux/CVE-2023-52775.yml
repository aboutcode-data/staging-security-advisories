summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/smc: avoid\
  \ data corruption caused by decline  We found a data corruption issue during testing of SMC-R\
  \ on Redis applications.  The benchmark has a low probability of reporting a strange error\
  \ as shown below.  \"Error: Protocol error, got \"\\xe2\" as reply type byte\"  Finally, we\
  \ found that the retrieved error data was as follows:  0xE2 0xD4 0xC3 0xD9 0x04 0x00 0x2C\
  \ 0x20 0xA6 0x56 0x00 0x16 0x3E 0x0C 0xCB 0x04 0x02 0x01 0x00 0x00 0x20 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00\
  \ 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0xE2  It is quite obvious\
  \ that this is a SMC DECLINE message, which means that the applications received SMC protocol\
  \ message. We found that this was caused by the following situations:  client            \
  \      server         ¦  clc proposal         ------------->         ¦  clc accept       \
  \  <-------------         ¦  clc confirm         -------------> wait llc confirm \t\t\tsend\
  \ llc confirm         ¦failed llc confirm         ¦   x------ (after 2s)timeout          \
  \               wait llc confirm rsp  wait decline  (after 1s) timeout                   \
  \      (after 2s) timeout         ¦   decline         -------------->         ¦   decline\
  \         <--------------  As a result, a decline message was sent in the implementation,\
  \ and this message was read from TCP by the already-fallback connection.  This patch double\
  \ the client timeout as 2x of the server value, With this simple change, the Decline messages\
  \ should never cross or collide (during Confirm link timeout).  This issue requires an immediate\
  \ solution, since the protocol updates involve a more long-term solution."
