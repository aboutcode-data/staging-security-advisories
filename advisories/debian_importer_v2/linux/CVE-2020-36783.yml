summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i2c: img-scb:
  fix reference leak when pm_runtime_get_sync fails  The PM reference count is not expected
  to be incremented on return in functions img_i2c_xfer and img_i2c_init.  However, pm_runtime_get_sync
  will increment the PM reference count even failed. Forgetting to putting operation will result
  in a reference leak here.  Replace it with pm_runtime_resume_and_get to keep usage counter
  balanced.'
