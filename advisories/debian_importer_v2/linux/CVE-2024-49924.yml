summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fbdev: pxafb:
  Fix possible use after free in pxafb_task()  In the pxafb_probe function, it calls the pxafb_init_fbinfo
  function, after which &fbi->task is associated with pxafb_task. Moreover, within this pxafb_init_fbinfo
  function, the pxafb_blank function within the &pxafb_ops struct is capable of scheduling work.  If
  we remove the module which will call pxafb_remove to make cleanup, it will call unregister_framebuffer
  function which can call do_unregister_framebuffer to free fbi->fb through put_fb_info(fb_info),
  while the work mentioned above will be used. The sequence of operations that may lead to a
  UAF bug is as follows:  CPU0                                                CPU1                                     |
  pxafb_task pxafb_remove                       | unregister_framebuffer(info)       | do_unregister_framebuffer(fb_info)
  | put_fb_info(fb_info)               | // free fbi->fb                    | set_ctrlr_state(fbi,
  state)                                    | __pxafb_lcd_power(fbi, 0)                                    |
  fbi->lcd_power(on, &fbi->fb.var)                                    | //use fbi->fb  Fix it
  by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding with the cleanup in pxafb_remove.  Note
  that only root user can remove the driver at runtime.'
