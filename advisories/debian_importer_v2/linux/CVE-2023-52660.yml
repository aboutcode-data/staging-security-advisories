  - CVE-2023-52660
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: rkisp1:
  Fix IRQ handling due to shared interrupts  The driver requests the interrupts as IRQF_SHARED,
  so the interrupt handlers can be called at any time. If such a call happens while the ISP
  is powered down, the SoC will hang as the driver tries to access the ISP registers.  This
  can be reproduced even without the platform sharing the IRQ line: Enable CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ
  and unload the driver, and the board will hang.  Fix this by adding a new field, ''irqs_enabled'',
  which is used to bail out from the interrupt handler when the ISP is not operational.'
