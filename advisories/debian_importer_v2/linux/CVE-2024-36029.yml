summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mmc: sdhci-msm:
  pervent access to suspended controller  Generic sdhci code registers LED device and uses host->runtime_suspended
  flag to protect access to it. The sdhci-msm driver doesn''t set this flag, which causes a
  crash when LED is accessed while controller is runtime suspended. Fix this by setting the
  flag correctly.'
