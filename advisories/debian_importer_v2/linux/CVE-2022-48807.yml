summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ice: Fix KASAN
  error in LAG NETDEV_UNREGISTER handler  Currently, the same handler is called for both a NETDEV_BONDING_INFO
  LAG unlink notification as for a NETDEV_UNREGISTER call.  This is causing a problem though,
  since the netdev_notifier_info passed has a different structure depending on which event is
  passed.  The problem manifests as a call trace from a BUG: KASAN stack-out-of-bounds error.  Fix
  this by creating a handler specific to NETDEV_UNREGISTER that only is passed valid elements
  in the netdev_notifier_info struct for the NETDEV_UNREGISTER event.  Also included is the
  removal of an unbalanced dev_put on the peer_netdev and related braces.'
