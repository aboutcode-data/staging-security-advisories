summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mtk-sd: Prevent
  memory corruption from DMA map failure  If msdc_prepare_data() fails to map the DMA region,
  the request is not prepared for data receiving, but msdc_start_data() proceeds the DMA with
  previous setting. Since this will lead a memory corruption, we have to stop the request operation
  soon after the msdc_prepare_data() fails to prepare it.'
