summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: LAPIC: Also
  cancel preemption timer during SET_LAPIC  The below warning is splatting during guest reboot.    ------------[

  0033:0x7fd39797350b  This can be triggered by not exposing tsc-deadline mode and doing a reboot
  in the guest. The lapic_shutdown() function which is called in sys_reboot path will not disarm
  the flying timer, it just masks LVTT. lapic_shutdown() clears APIC state w/ LVT_MASKED and
  timer-mode bit is 0, this can trigger timer-mode switch between tsc-deadline and oneshot/periodic,
  which can result in preemption timer be cancelled in apic_update_lvtt(). However, We can''t
  depend on this when not exposing tsc-deadline mode and oneshot/periodic modes emulated by
  preemption timer. Qemu will synchronise states around reset, let''s cancel preemption timer
  under KVM_SET_LAPIC.'
