summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  pstore/ram: Check
  start of empty przs during init  After commit 30696378f68a ("pstore/ram: Do not treat empty
  buffers as valid"), initialization would assume a prz was valid after seeing that the buffer_size
  is zero (regardless of the buffer start position). This unchecked start value means it could
  be outside the bounds of the buffer, leading to future access panics when written to:   sysdump_panic_event+0x3b4/0x5b8  atomic_notifier_call_chain+0x54/0x90  panic+0x1c8/0x42c  die+0x29c/0x2a8  die_kernel_fault+0x68/0x78  __do_kernel_fault+0x1c4/0x1e0  do_bad_area+0x40/0x100  do_translation_fault+0x68/0x80  do_mem_abort+0x68/0xf8  el1_da+0x1c/0xc0  __raw_writeb+0x38/0x174  __memcpy_toio+0x40/0xac  persistent_ram_update+0x44/0x12c  persistent_ram_write+0x1a8/0x1b8  ramoops_pstore_write+0x198/0x1e8  pstore_console_write+0x94/0xe0  ...  To
  avoid this, also check if the prz start is 0 during the initialization phase. If not, the
  next prz sanity check case will discover it (start > size) and zap the buffer back to a sane
  state.  [kees: update commit log with backtrace and clarifications]'
