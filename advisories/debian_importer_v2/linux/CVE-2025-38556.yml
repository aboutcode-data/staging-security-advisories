  - CVE-2025-38556
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: core: Harden
  s32ton() against conversion to 0 bits  Testing by the syzbot fuzzer showed that the HID core
  gets a shift-out-of-bounds exception when it tries to convert a 32-bit quantity to a 0-bit
  quantity.  Ideally this should never occur, but there are buggy devices and some might have
  a report field with size set to zero; we shouldn''t reject the report or the device just because
  of that.  Instead, harden the s32ton() routine so that it returns a reasonable result instead
  of crashing when it is called with the number of bits set to 0 -- the same as what snto32()
  does.'
