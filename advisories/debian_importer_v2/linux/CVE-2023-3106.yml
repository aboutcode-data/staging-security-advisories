aliases:
  - CVE-2023-3106
summary: A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability was found in netlink_dump. This issue can
  occur when the Netlink socket receives the message(sendmsg) for the XFRM_MSG_GETSA, XFRM_MSG_GETPOLICY
  type message, and the DUMP flag is set and can cause a denial of service or possibly another
  unspecified impact. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled
  out, although it is unlikely.
