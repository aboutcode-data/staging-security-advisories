summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  platform/x86:
  toshiba_acpi: Fix array out-of-bounds access  In order to use toshiba_dmi_quirks[] together
  with the standard DMI matching functions, it must be terminated by a empty entry.  Since this
  entry is missing, an array out-of-bounds access occurs every time the quirk list is processed.  Fix
  this by adding the terminating empty entry.'
