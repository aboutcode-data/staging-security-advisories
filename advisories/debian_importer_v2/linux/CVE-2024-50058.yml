summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  serial: protect
  uart_port_dtr_rts() in uart_shutdown() too  Commit af224ca2df29 (serial: core: Prevent unsafe
  uart port access, part 3) added few uport == NULL checks. It added one to uart_shutdown(),
  so the commit assumes, uport can be NULL in there. But right after that protection, there
  is an unprotected "uart_port_dtr_rts(uport, false);" call. That is invoked only if HUPCL is
  set, so I assume that is the reason why we do not see lots of these reports.  Or it cannot
  be NULL at this point at all for some reason :P.  Until the above is investigated, stay on
  the safe side and move this dereference to the if too.  I got this inconsistency from Coverity
  under CID 1585130. Thanks.'
