summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/msm/dp: fix
  bridge lifetime  Device-managed resources allocated post component bind must be tied to the
  lifetime of the aggregate DRM device or they will not necessarily be released when binding
  of the aggregate device is deferred.  This can lead resource leaks or failure to bind the
  aggregate device when binding is later retried and a second attempt to allocate the resources
  is made.  For the DP bridges, previously allocated bridges will leak on probe deferral.  Fix
  this by amending the DP parser interface and tying the lifetime of the bridge device to the
  DRM device rather than DP platform device.  Patchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/502667/'
