  - CVE-2014-5207
summary: fs/namespace.c in the Linux kernel through 3.16.1 does not properly restrict clearing
  MNT_NODEV, MNT_NOSUID, and MNT_NOEXEC and changing MNT_ATIME_MASK during a remount of a bind
  mount, which allows local users to gain privileges, interfere with backups and auditing on
  systems that had atime enabled, or cause a denial of service (excessive filesystem updating)
  on systems that had atime disabled via a "mount -o remount" command within a user namespace.
