  - CVE-2019-3887
summary: A flaw was found in the way KVM hypervisor handled x2APIC Machine Specific Rregister
  (MSR) access with nested(=1) virtualization enabled. In that, L1 guest could access L0's APIC
  register values via L2 guest, when 'virtualize x2APIC mode' is enabled. A guest could use
  this flaw to potentially crash the host kernel resulting in DoS issue. Kernel versions from
  4.16 and newer are vulnerable to this issue.
