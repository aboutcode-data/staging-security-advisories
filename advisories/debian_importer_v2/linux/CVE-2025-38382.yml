summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: fix iteration
  of extrefs during log replay  At __inode_add_ref() when processing extrefs, if we jump into
  the next label we have an undefined value of victim_name.len, since we haven''t initialized
  it before we did the goto. This results in an invalid memory access in the next iteration
  of the loop since victim_name.len was not initialized to the length of the name of the current
  extref.  Fix this by initializing victim_name.len with the current extref''s name length.'
