summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ARM: footbridge:
  fix PCI interrupt mapping  Since commit 30fdfb929e82 ("PCI: Add a call to pci_assign_irq()
  in pci_device_probe()"), the PCI code will call the IRQ mapping function whenever a PCI driver
  is probed. If these are marked as __init, this causes an oops if a PCI driver is loaded or
  bound after the kernel has initialised.'
