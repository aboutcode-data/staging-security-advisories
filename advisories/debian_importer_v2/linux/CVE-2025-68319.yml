summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netconsole: Acquire
  su_mutex before navigating configs hierarchy  There is a race between operations that iterate
  over the userdata cg_children list and concurrent add/remove of userdata items through configfs.
  The update_userdata() function iterates over the nt->userdata_group.cg_children list, and
  count_extradata_entries() also iterates over this same list to count nodes.  Quoting from
  Documentation/filesystems/configfs.rst: > A subsystem can navigate the cg_children list and
  the ci_parent pointer > to see the tree created by the subsystem.  This can race with configfs''
  > management of the hierarchy, so configfs uses the subsystem mutex to > protect modifications.  Whenever
  a subsystem wants to navigate the > hierarchy, it must do so under the protection of the subsystem
  > mutex.  Without proper locking, if a userdata item is added or removed concurrently while
  these functions are iterating, the list can be accessed in an inconsistent state. For example,
  the list_for_each() loop can reach a node that is being removed from the list by list_del_init()
  which sets the nodes'' .next pointer to point to itself, so the loop will never end (or reach
  the WARN_ON_ONCE in update_userdata() ).  Fix this by holding the configfs subsystem mutex
  (su_mutex) during all operations that iterate over cg_children. This includes: - userdatum_value_store()
  which calls update_userdata() to iterate over   cg_children - All sysdata_*_enabled_store()
  functions which call   count_extradata_entries() to iterate over cg_children  The su_mutex
  must be acquired before dynamic_netconsole_mutex to avoid potential lock ordering issues,
  as configfs operations may already hold su_mutex when calling into our code.'
