summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  block: Fix potential
  deadlock in blk_ia_range_sysfs_show()  When being read, a sysfs attribute is already protected
  against removal with the kobject node active reference counter. As a result, in blk_ia_range_sysfs_show(),
  there is no need to take the queue sysfs lock when reading the value of a range attribute.
  Using the queue sysfs lock in this function creates a potential deadlock situation with the
  disk removal, something that a lockdep signals with a splat when the device is removed:  [  760.703551]  Possible
  unsafe locking scenario: [  760.703551] [  760.703554]        CPU0                    CPU1
  [  760.703556]        ----                    ---- [  760.703558]   lock(&q->sysfs_lock);
  [  760.703565]                                lock(kn->active#385); [  760.703573]                                lock(&q->sysfs_lock);
  [  760.703579]   lock(kn->active#385); [  760.703587] [  760.703587]  *** DEADLOCK ***  Solve
  this by removing the mutex_lock()/mutex_unlock() calls from blk_ia_range_sysfs_show().'
