summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  kunit/overflow:
  Fix UB in overflow_allocation_test  The ''device_name'' array doesn''t exist out of the ''overflow_allocation_test''
  function scope. However, it is being used as a driver name when calling ''kunit_driver_create''
  from ''kunit_device_register''. It produces the kernel panic with KASAN enabled.  Since this
  variable is used in one place only, remove it and pass the device name into kunit_device_register
  directly as an ascii string.'
