  - CVE-2024-40965
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i2c: lpi2c: Avoid
  calling clk_get_rate during transfer  Instead of repeatedly calling clk_get_rate for each
  transfer, lock the clock rate and cache the value. A deadlock has been observed while adding
  tlv320aic32x4 audio codec to the system. When this clock provider adds its clock, the clk
  mutex is locked already, it needs to access i2c, which in return needs the mutex for clk_get_rate
  as well.'
