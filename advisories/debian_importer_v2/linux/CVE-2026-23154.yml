summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: fix segmentation
  of forwarding fraglist GRO  This patch enhances GSO segment handling by properly checking
  the SKB_GSO_DODGY flag for frag_list GSO packets, addressing low throughput issues observed
  when a station accesses IPv4 servers via hotspots with an IPv6-only upstream interface.  Specifically,
  it fixes a bug in GSO segmentation when forwarding GRO packets containing a frag_list. The
  function skb_segment_list cannot correctly process GRO skbs that have been converted by XLAT,
  since XLAT only translates the header of the head skb. Consequently, skbs in the frag_list
  may remain untranslated, resulting in protocol inconsistencies and reduced throughput.  To
  address this, the patch explicitly sets the SKB_GSO_DODGY flag for GSO packets in XLAT''s
  IPv4/IPv6 protocol translation helpers (bpf_skb_proto_4_to_6 and bpf_skb_proto_6_to_4). This
  marks GSO packets as potentially modified after protocol translation. As a result, GSO segmentation
  will avoid using skb_segment_list and instead falls back to skb_segment for packets with the
  SKB_GSO_DODGY flag. This ensures that only safe and fully translated frag_list packets are
  processed by skb_segment_list, resolving protocol inconsistencies and improving throughput
  when forwarding GRO packets converted by XLAT.'
