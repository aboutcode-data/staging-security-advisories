summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: hci_core:
  cancel all works upon hci_unregister_dev()  syzbot is reporting that calling hci_release_dev()
  from hci_error_reset() due to hci_dev_put() from hci_error_reset() can cause deadlock at destroy_workqueue(),
  for hci_error_reset() is called from hdev->req_workqueue which destroy_workqueue() needs to
  flush.  We need to make sure that hdev->{rx_work,cmd_work,tx_work} which are queued into hdev->workqueue
  and hdev->{power_on,error_reset} which are queued into hdev->req_workqueue are no longer running
  by the moment         destroy_workqueue(hdev->workqueue);        destroy_workqueue(hdev->req_workqueue);  are
  called from hci_release_dev().  Call cancel_work_sync() on these work items from hci_unregister_dev()
  as soon as hdev->list is removed from hci_dev_list.'
