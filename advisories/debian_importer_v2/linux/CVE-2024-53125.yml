summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: sync_linked_regs()
  must preserve subreg_def  Range propagation must not affect subreg_def marks, otherwise the
  following example is rewritten by verifier incorrectly when BPF_F_TEST_RND_HI32 flag is set:    0:
  call bpf_ktime_get_ns                   call bpf_ktime_get_ns   1: r0 &= 0x7fffffff       after
  verifier   r0 &= 0x7fffffff   2: w1 = w0                rewrites         w1 = w0   3: if w0
  < 10 goto +0     -------------->  r11 = 0x2f5674a6     (r)   4: r1 >>= 32                               r11
  <<= 32           (r)   5: r0 = r1                                 r1 |= r11            (r)   6:
  exit;                                   if w0 < 0xa goto pc+0                                              r1
  >>= 32                                              r0 = r1                                              exit  (or
  zero extension of w1 at (2) is missing for architectures that  require zero extension for
  upper register half).  The following happens w/o this patch: - r0 is marked as not a subreg
  at (0); - w1 is marked as subreg at (2); - w1 subreg_def is overridden at (3) by copy_register_state();
  - w1 is read at (5) but mark_insn_zext() does not mark (2)   for zero extension, because w1
  subreg_def is not set; - because of BPF_F_TEST_RND_HI32 flag verifier inserts random   value
  for hi32 bits of (2) (marked (r)); - this random value is read at (5).'
