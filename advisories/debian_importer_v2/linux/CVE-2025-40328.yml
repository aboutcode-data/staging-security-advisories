summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  smb: client:
  fix potential UAF in smb2_close_cached_fid()  find_or_create_cached_dir() could grab a new
  reference after kref_put() had seen the refcount drop to zero but before cfid_list_lock is
  acquired in smb2_close_cached_fid(), leading to use-after-free.  Switch to kref_put_lock()
  so cfid_release() is called with cfid_list_lock held, closing that gap.'
