summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gpio: virtuser:
  fix UAF in configfs release path  The gpio-virtuser configfs release path uses guard(mutex)
  to protect the device structure. However, the device is freed before the guard cleanup runs,
  causing mutex_unlock() to operate on freed memory.  Specifically, gpio_virtuser_device_config_group_release()
  destroys the mutex and frees the device while still inside the guard(mutex) scope. When the
  function returns, the guard cleanup invokes mutex_unlock(&dev->lock), resulting in a slab
  use-after-free.  Limit the mutex lifetime by using a scoped_guard() only around the activation
  check, so that the lock is released before mutex_destroy() and kfree() are called.'
