  - CVE-2021-47201
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iavf: free q_vectors
  before queues in iavf_disable_vf  iavf_free_queues() clears adapter->num_active_queues, which
  iavf_free_q_vectors() relies on, so swap the order of these two function calls in iavf_disable_vf().
  This resolves a panic encountered when the interface is disabled and then later brought up
  again after PF communication is restored.'
