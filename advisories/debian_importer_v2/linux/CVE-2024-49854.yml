summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  block, bfq: fix
  uaf for accessing waker_bfqq after splitting  After commit 42c306ed7233 ("block, bfq: don''t
  break merge chain in bfq_split_bfqq()"), if the current procress is the last holder of bfqq,
  the bfqq can be freed after bfq_split_bfqq(). Hence recored the bfqq and then access bfqq->waker_bfqq
  may trigger UAF. What''s more, the waker_bfqq may in the merge chain of bfqq, hence just recored
  waker_bfqq is still not safe.  Fix the problem by adding a helper bfq_waker_bfqq() to check
  if bfqq->waker_bfqq is in the merge chain, and current procress is the only holder.'
