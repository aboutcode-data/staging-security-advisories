summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powerpc/bpf:\
  \ fix JIT code size calculation of bpf trampoline  arch_bpf_trampoline_size() provides JIT\
  \ size of the BPF trampoline before the buffer for JIT'ing it is allocated. The total number\
  \ of instructions emitted for BPF trampoline JIT code depends on where the final image is\
  \ located. So, the size arrived at with the dummy pass in arch_bpf_trampoline_size() can vary\
  \ from the actual size needed in  arch_prepare_bpf_trampoline().  When the instructions accounted\
  \ in  arch_bpf_trampoline_size() is less than the number of instructions emitted during the\
  \ actual JIT compile of the trampoline, the below warning is produced:    WARNING: CPU: 8\
  \ PID: 204190 at arch/powerpc/net/bpf_jit_comp.c:981 __arch_prepare_bpf_trampoline.isra.0+0xd2c/0xdcc\
  \  which is:    /* Make sure the trampoline generation logic doesn't overflow */   if (image\
  \ && WARN_ON_ONCE(&image[ctx->idx] >   \t\t\t(u32 *)rw_image_end - BPF_INSN_SAFETY)) {  So,\
  \ during the dummy pass, instead of providing some arbitrary image location, account for maximum\
  \ possible instructions if and when there is a dependency with image location for JIT'ing."
