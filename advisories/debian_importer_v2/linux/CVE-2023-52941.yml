summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: isotp: split
  tx timer into transmission and timeout  The timer for the transmission of isotp PDUs formerly
  had two functions: 1. send two consecutive frames with a given time gap 2. monitor the timeouts
  for flow control frames and the echo frames  This led to larger txstate checks and potentially
  to a problem discovered by syzbot which enabled the panic_on_warn feature while testing.  The
  former ''txtimer'' function is split into ''txfrtimer'' and ''txtimer'' to handle the two
  above functionalities with separate timer callbacks.  The two simplified timers now run in
  one-shot mode and make the state transitions (especially with isotp_rcv_echo) better understandable.'
