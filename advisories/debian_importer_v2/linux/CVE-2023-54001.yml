summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  staging: r8712:
  Fix memory leak in _r8712_init_xmit_priv()  In the above mentioned routine, memory is allocated
  in several places. If the first succeeds and a later one fails, the routine will leak memory.
  This patch fixes commit 2865d42c78a9 ("staging: r8712u: Add the new driver to the mainline
  kernel"). A potential memory leak in r8712_xmit_resource_alloc() is also addressed.'
