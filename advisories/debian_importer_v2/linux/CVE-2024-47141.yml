summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  pinmux: Use sequential\
  \ access to access desc->pinmux data  When two client of the same gpio call pinctrl_select_state()\
  \ for the same functionality, we are seeing NULL pointer issue while accessing desc->mux_owner.\
  \  Let's say two processes A, B executing in pin_request() for the same pin and process A\
  \ updates the desc->mux_usecount but not yet updated the desc->mux_owner while process B see\
  \ the desc->mux_usecount which got updated by A path and further executes strcmp and while\
  \ accessing desc->mux_owner it crashes with NULL pointer.  Serialize the access to mux related\
  \ setting with a mutex lock.  \tcpu0 (process A)\t\t\tcpu1(process B)  pinctrl_select_state()\
  \ {\t\t  pinctrl_select_state() {   pin_request() {\t\t\t\tpin_request() {   ... \t\t\t\t\t\
  \t ....     } else {          desc->mux_usecount++;     \t\t\t\t\t\tdesc->mux_usecount &&\
  \ strcmp(desc->mux_owner, owner)) {           if (desc->mux_usecount > 1)                return\
  \ 0;          desc->mux_owner = owner;    }\t\t\t\t\t\t}"
