summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: gso: fix
  ownership in __udp_gso_segment  In __udp_gso_segment the skb destructor is removed before
  segmenting the skb but the socket reference is kept as-is. This is an issue if the original
  skb is later orphaned as we can hit the following bug:    kernel BUG at ./include/linux/skbuff.h:3312!  (skb_orphan)   RIP:
  0010:ip_rcv_core+0x8b2/0xca0   Call Trace:    ip_rcv+0xab/0x6e0    __netif_receive_skb_one_core+0x168/0x1b0    process_backlog+0x384/0x1100    __napi_poll.constprop.0+0xa1/0x370    net_rx_action+0x925/0xe50  The
  above can happen following a sequence of events when using OpenVSwitch, when an OVS_ACTION_ATTR_USERSPACE
  action precedes an OVS_ACTION_ATTR_OUTPUT action:  1. OVS_ACTION_ATTR_USERSPACE is handled
  (in do_execute_actions): the skb    goes through queue_gso_packets and then __udp_gso_segment,
  where its    destructor is removed. 2. The segments'' data are copied and sent to userspace.
  3. OVS_ACTION_ATTR_OUTPUT is handled (in do_execute_actions) and the    same original skb
  is sent to its path. 4. If it later hits skb_orphan, we hit the bug.  Fix this by also removing
  the reference to the socket in __udp_gso_segment.'
