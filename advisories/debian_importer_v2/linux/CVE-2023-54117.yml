summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  s390/dcssblk:
  fix kernel crash with list_add corruption  Commit fb08a1908cb1 ("dax: simplify the dax_device
  <-> gendisk association") introduced new logic for gendisk association, requiring drivers
  to explicitly call dax_add_host() and dax_remove_host().  For dcssblk driver, some dax_remove_host()
  calls were missing, e.g. in device remove path. The commit also broke error handling for out_dax
  case in device add path, resulting in an extra put_device() w/o the previous get_device()
  in that case.  This lead to stale xarray entries after device add / remove cycles. In the
  case when a previously used struct gendisk pointer (xarray index) would be used again, because
  blk_alloc_disk() happened to return such a pointer, the xa_insert() in dax_add_host() would
  fail and go to out_dax, doing the extra put_device() in the error path. In combination with
  an already flawed error handling in dcssblk (device_register() cleanup), which needs to be
  addressed in a separate patch, this resulted in a missing device_del() / klist_del(), and
  eventually in the kernel crash with list_add corruption on a subsequent device_add() / klist_add().  Fix
  this by adding the missing dax_remove_host() calls, and also move the put_device() in the
  error path to restore the previous logic.'
