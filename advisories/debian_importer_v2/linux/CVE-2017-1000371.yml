  - CVE-2017-1000371
summary: The offset2lib patch as used by the Linux Kernel contains a vulnerability, if RLIMIT_STACK
  is set to RLIM_INFINITY and 1 Gigabyte of memory is allocated (the maximum under the 1/4 restriction)
  then the stack will be grown down to 0x80000000, and as the PIE binary is mapped above 0x80000000
  the minimum distance between the end of the PIE binary's read-write segment and the start
  of the stack becomes small enough that the stack guard page can be jumped over by an attacker.
  This affects Linux Kernel version 4.11.5. This is a different issue than CVE-2017-1000370
  and CVE-2017-1000365. This issue appears to be limited to i386 based systems.
