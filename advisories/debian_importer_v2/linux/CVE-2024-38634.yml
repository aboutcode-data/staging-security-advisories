summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  serial: max3100:
  Lock port->lock when calling uart_handle_cts_change()  uart_handle_cts_change() has to be
  called with port lock taken, Since we run it in a separate work, the lock may not be taken
  at the time of running. Make sure that it''s taken by explicitly doing that. Without it we
  got a splat:    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 10 at drivers/tty/serial/serial_core.c:3491 uart_handle_cts_change+0xa6/0xb0   ...   Workqueue:
