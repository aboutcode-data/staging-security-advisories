summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  block: don''t
  use submit_bio_noacct_nocheck in blk_zone_wplug_bio_work  Bios queued up in the zone write
  plug have already gone through all all preparation in the submit_bio path, including the freeze
  protection.  Submitting them through submit_bio_noacct_nocheck duplicates the work and can
  can cause deadlocks when freezing a queue with pending bio write plugs.  Go straight to ->submit_bio
  or blk_mq_submit_bio to bypass the superfluous extra freeze protection and checks.'
