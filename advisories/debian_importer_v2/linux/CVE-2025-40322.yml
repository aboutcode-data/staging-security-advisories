summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fbdev: bitblit:
  bound-check glyph index in bit_putcs*  bit_putcs_aligned()/unaligned() derived the glyph pointer
  from the character value masked by 0xff/0x1ff, which may exceed the actual font''s glyph count
  and read past the end of the built-in font array. Clamp the index to the actual glyph count
  before computing the address.  This fixes a global out-of-bounds read reported by syzbot.'
