  - CVE-2019-15239
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp_output.c change, which was properly incorporated
  into 4.16.12, was incorrectly backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new
  vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was intended to be fixed
  by backporting. Specifically, by adding to a write queue between disconnection and re-connection,
  a local attacker can trigger multiple use-after-free conditions. This can result in a kernel
  crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. NOTE: this affects (for example) Linux distributions
  that use 4.9.x longterm kernels before 4.9.190 or 4.14.x longterm kernels before 4.14.139.'
