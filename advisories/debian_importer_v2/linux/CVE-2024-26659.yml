summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xhci: handle
  isoc Babble and Buffer Overrun events properly  xHCI 4.9 explicitly forbids assuming that
  the xHC has released its ownership of a multi-TRB TD when it reports an error on one of the
  early TRBs. Yet the driver makes such assumption and releases the TD, allowing the remaining
  TRBs to be freed or overwritten by new TDs.  The xHC should also report completion of the
  final TRB due to its IOC flag being set by us, regardless of prior errors. This event cannot
  be recognized if the TD has already been freed earlier, resulting in "Transfer event TRB DMA
  ptr not part of current TD" error message.  Fix this by reusing the logic for processing isoc
  Transaction Errors. This also handles hosts which fail to report the final completion.  Fix
  transfer length reporting on Babble errors. They may be caused by device malfunction, no guarantee
  that the buffer has been filled.'
