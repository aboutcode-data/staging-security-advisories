summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powerpc/lib:
  Validate size for vector operations  Some of the fp/vmx code in sstep.c assume a certain maximum
  size for the instructions being emulated. The size of those operations however is determined
  separately in analyse_instr().  Add a check to validate the assumption on the maximum size
  of the operations, so as to prevent any unintended kernel stack corruption.'
