  - CVE-2016-10723
summary: 'An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.2. Since the page allocator
  does not yield CPU resources to the owner of the oom_lock mutex, a local unprivileged user
  can trivially lock up the system forever by wasting CPU resources from the page allocator
  (e.g., via concurrent page fault events) when the global OOM killer is invoked. NOTE: the
  software maintainer has not accepted certain proposed patches, in part because of a viewpoint
  that "the underlying problem is non-trivial to handle.'
