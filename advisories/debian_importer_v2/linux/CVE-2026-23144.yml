summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/damon/sysfs:
  cleanup attrs subdirs on context dir setup failure  When a context DAMON sysfs directory setup
  is failed after setup of attrs/ directory, subdirectories of attrs/ directory are not cleaned
  up.  As a result, DAMON sysfs interface is nearly broken until the system reboots, and the
  memory for the unremoved directory is leaked.  Cleanup the directories under such failures.'
