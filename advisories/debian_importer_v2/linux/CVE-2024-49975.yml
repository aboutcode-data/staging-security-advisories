summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  uprobes: fix
  kernel info leak via "[uprobes]" vma  xol_add_vma() maps the uninitialized page allocated
  by __create_xol_area() into userspace. On some architectures (x86) this memory is readable
  even without VM_READ, VM_EXEC results in the same pgprot_t as VM_EXEC|VM_READ, although this
  doesn''t really matter, debugger can read this memory anyway.'
