  - CVE-2019-19338
summary: A flaw was found in the fix for CVE-2019-11135, in the Linux upstream kernel versions
  before 5.5 where, the way Intel CPUs handle speculative execution of instructions when a TSX
  Asynchronous Abort (TAA) error occurs. When a guest is running on a host CPU affected by the
  TAA flaw (TAA_NO=0), but is not affected by the MDS issue (MDS_NO=1), the guest was to clear
  the affected buffers by using a VERW instruction mechanism. But when the MDS_NO=1 bit was
  exported to the guests, the guests did not use the VERW mechanism to clear the affected buffers.
  This issue affects guests running on Cascade Lake CPUs and requires that host has 'TSX' enabled.
  Confidentiality of data is the highest threat associated with this vulnerability.
