summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PCI: pnv_php:
  Fix surprise plug detection and recovery  The existing PowerNV hotplug code did not handle
  surprise plug events correctly, leading to a complete failure of the hotplug system after
  device removal and a required reboot to detect new devices.  This comes down to two issues:   1)
  When a device is surprise removed, often the bridge upstream     port will cause a PE freeze
  on the PHB.  If this freeze is not     cleared, the MSI interrupts from the bridge hotplug
  notification     logic will not be received by the kernel, stalling all plug events     on
  all slots associated with the PE.   2) When a device is removed from a slot, regardless of
  surprise or     programmatic removal, the associated PHB/PE ls left frozen.     If this freeze
  is not cleared via a fundamental reset, skiboot     is unable to clear the freeze and cannot
  retrain / rescan the     slot.  This also requires a reboot to clear the freeze and redetect     the
  device in the slot.  Issue the appropriate unfreeze and rescan commands on hotplug events,
  and don''t oops on hotplug if pci_bus_to_OF_node() returns NULL.  [bhelgaas: tidy comments]'
