summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/mlx5e: Fix
  operation precedence bug in port timestamping napi_poll context  Indirection (*) is of lower
  precedence than postfix increment (++). Logic in napi_poll context would cause an out-of-bound
  read by first increment the pointer address by byte address space and then dereference the
  value. Rather, the intended logic was to dereference first and then increment the underlying
  value.'
