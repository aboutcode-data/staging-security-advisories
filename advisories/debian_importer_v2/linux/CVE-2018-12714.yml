  - CVE-2018-12714
summary: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.2. The filter parsing in kernel/trace/trace_events_filter.c
  could be called with no filter, which is an N=0 case when it expected at least one line to
  have been read, thus making the N-1 index invalid. This allows attackers to cause a denial
  of service (slab out-of-bounds write) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted
  perf_event_open and mmap system calls.
