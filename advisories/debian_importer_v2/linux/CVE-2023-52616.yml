  - CVE-2023-52616
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: lib/mpi
  - Fix unexpected pointer access in mpi_ec_init  When the mpi_ec_ctx structure is initialized,
  some fields are not cleared, causing a crash when referencing the field when the structure
  was released. Initially, this issue was ignored because memory for mpi_ec_ctx is allocated
  with the __GFP_ZERO flag. For example, this error will be triggered when calculating the Za
  value for SM2 separately.'
