summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: fix a memory
  leak in the LRU and LRU_PERCPU hash maps  The LRU and LRU_PERCPU maps allocate a new element
  on update before locking the target hash table bucket. Right after that the maps try to lock
  the bucket. If this fails, then maps return -EBUSY to the caller without releasing the allocated
  element. This makes the element untracked: it doesn''t belong to either of free lists, and
  it doesn''t belong to the hash table, so can''t be re-used; this eventually leads to the permanent
  -ENOMEM on LRU map updates, which is unexpected. Fix this by returning the element to the
  local free list if bucket locking fails.'
