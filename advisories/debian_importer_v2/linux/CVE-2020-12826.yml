  - CVE-2020-12826
summary: A signal access-control issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.6.5, aka
  CID-7395ea4e65c2. Because exec_id in include/linux/sched.h is only 32 bits, an integer overflow
  can interfere with a do_notify_parent protection mechanism. A child process can send an arbitrary
  signal to a parent process in a different security domain. Exploitation limitations include
  the amount of elapsed time before an integer overflow occurs, and the lack of scenarios where
  signals to a parent process present a substantial operational threat.
