  - CVE-2019-14835
summary: A buffer overflow flaw was found, in versions from 2.6.34 to 5.2.x, in the way Linux
  kernel's vhost functionality that translates virtqueue buffers to IOVs, logged the buffer
  descriptors during migration. A privileged guest user able to pass descriptors with invalid
  length to the host when migration is underway, could use this flaw to increase their privileges
  on the host.
