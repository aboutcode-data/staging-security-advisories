  - CVE-2021-47153
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i2c: i801: Don''t
  generate an interrupt on bus reset  Now that the i2c-i801 driver supports interrupts, setting
  the KILL bit in a attempt to recover from a timed out transaction triggers an interrupt. Unfortunately,
  the interrupt handler (i801_isr) is not prepared for this situation and will try to process
  the interrupt as if it was signaling the end of a successful transaction. In the case of a
  block transaction, this can result in an out-of-range memory access.  This condition was reproduced
  several times by syzbot: https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=ed71512d469895b5b34e https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=8c8dedc0ba9e03f6c79e

  disable interrupts while trying to reset the bus. Interrupts will be enabled again for the
  following transaction.'
