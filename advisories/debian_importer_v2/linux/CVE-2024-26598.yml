summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: arm64: vgic-its:
  Avoid potential UAF in LPI translation cache  There is a potential UAF scenario in the case
  of an LPI translation cache hit racing with an operation that invalidates the cache, such
  as a DISCARD ITS command. The root of the problem is that vgic_its_check_cache() does not
  elevate the refcount on the vgic_irq before dropping the lock that serializes refcount changes.  Have
  vgic_its_check_cache() raise the refcount on the returned vgic_irq and add the corresponding
  decrement after queueing the interrupt.'
