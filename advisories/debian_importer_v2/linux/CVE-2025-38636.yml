summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rv: Use strings
  in da monitors tracepoints  Using DA monitors tracepoints with KASAN enabled triggers the
  following warning:   BUG: KASAN: global-out-of-bounds in do_trace_event_raw_event_event_da_monitor+0xd6/0x1a0  Read
  of size 32 at addr ffffffffaada8980 by task ...  Call Trace:   <TASK>  [...]   do_trace_event_raw_event_event_da_monitor+0xd6/0x1a0   ?
  __pfx_do_trace_event_raw_event_event_da_monitor+0x10/0x10   ? trace_event_sncid+0x83/0x200   trace_event_sncid+0x163/0x200  [...]  The
  buggy address belongs to the variable:   automaton_snep+0x4e0/0x5e0  This is caused by the
  tracepoints reading 32 bytes __array instead of __string from the automata definition. Such
  strings are literals and reading 32 bytes ends up in out of bound memory accesses (e.g. the
  next automaton''s data in this case). The error is harmless as, while printing the string,
  we stop at the null terminator, but it should still be fixed.  Use the __string facilities
  while defining the tracepoints to avoid reading out of bound memory.'
