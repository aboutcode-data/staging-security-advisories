summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  misc: fastrpc:
  fix possible map leak in fastrpc_put_args  copy_to_user() failure would cause an early return
  without cleaning up the fdlist, which has been updated by the DSP. This could lead to map
  leak. Fix this by redirecting to a cleanup path on failure, ensuring that all mapped buffers
  are properly released before returning.'
