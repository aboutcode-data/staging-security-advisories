summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i2c: i801: Fix
  block process call transactions  According to the Intel datasheets, software must reset the
  block buffer index twice for block process call transactions: once before writing the outgoing
  data to the buffer, and once again before reading the incoming data from the buffer.  The
  driver is currently missing the second reset, causing the wrong portion of the block buffer
  to be read.'
