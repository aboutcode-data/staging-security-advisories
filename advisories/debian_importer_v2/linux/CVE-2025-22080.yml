summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fs/ntfs3: Prevent
  integer overflow in hdr_first_de()  The "de_off" and "used" variables come from the disk so
  they both need to check.  The problem is that on 32bit systems if they''re both greater than
  UINT_MAX - 16 then the check does work as intended because of an integer overflow.'
