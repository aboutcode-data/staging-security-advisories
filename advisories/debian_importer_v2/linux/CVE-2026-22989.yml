summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfsd: check that
  server is running in unlock_filesystem  If we are trying to unlock the filesystem via an administrative
  interface and nfsd isn''t running, it crashes the server. This happens currently because nfsd4_revoke_states()
  access state structures (eg., conf_id_hashtbl) that has been freed as a part of the server
  shutdown.  [   59.465072] Call trace: [   59.465308]  nfsd4_revoke_states+0x1b4/0x898 [nfsd]
  (P) [   59.465830]  write_unlock_fs+0x258/0x440 [nfsd] [   59.466278]  nfsctl_transaction_write+0xb0/0x120

  this can''t happen by taking the nfsd_mutex and checking that the server is still up, and
  then holding the mutex across the call to nfsd4_revoke_states().'
