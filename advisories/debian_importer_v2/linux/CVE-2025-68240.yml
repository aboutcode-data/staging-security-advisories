summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: avoid
  having an active sc_timer before freeing sci  Because kthread_stop did not stop sc_task properly
  and returned -EINTR, the sc_timer was not properly closed, ultimately causing the problem
  [1] reported by syzbot when freeing sci due to the sc_timer not being closed.  Because the
  thread sc_task main function nilfs_segctor_thread() returns 0 when it succeeds, when the return
  value of kthread_stop() is not 0 in nilfs_segctor_destroy(), we believe that it has not properly
  closed sc_timer.  We use timer_shutdown_sync() to sync wait for sc_timer to shutdown, and
  set the value of sc_task to NULL under the protection of lock sc_state_lock, so as to avoid
  the issue caused by sc_timer not being properly shutdowned.  [1] ODEBUG: free active (active
  state 0) object: 00000000dacb411a object type: timer_list hint: nilfs_construction_timeout
