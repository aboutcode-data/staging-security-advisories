summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: qrtr: fix\
  \ OOB Read in qrtr_endpoint_post  Syzbot reported slab-out-of-bounds Read in qrtr_endpoint_post.\
  \ The problem was in wrong _size_ type:  \tif (len != ALIGN(size, 4) + hdrlen) \t\tgoto err;\
  \  If size from qrtr_hdr is 4294967293 (0xfffffffd), the result of ALIGN(size, 4) will be\
  \ 0. In case of len == hdrlen and size == 4294967293 in header this check won't fail and \
  \ \tskb_put_data(skb, data + hdrlen, size);  will read out of bound from data, which is hdrlen\
  \ allocated block."
