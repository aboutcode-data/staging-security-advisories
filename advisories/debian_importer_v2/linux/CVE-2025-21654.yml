summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ovl: support
  encoding fid from inode with no alias  Dmitry Safonov reported that a WARN_ON() assertion
  can be trigered by userspace when calling inotify_show_fdinfo() for an overlayfs watched inode,
  whose dentry aliases were discarded with drop_caches.  The WARN_ON() assertion in inotify_show_fdinfo()
  was removed, because it is possible for encoding file handle to fail for other reason, but
  the impact of failing to encode an overlayfs file handle goes beyond this assertion.  As shown
  in the LTP test case mentioned in the link below, failure to encode an overlayfs file handle
  from a non-aliased inode also leads to failure to report an fid with FAN_DELETE_SELF fanotify
  events.  As Dmitry notes in his analyzis of the problem, ovl_encode_fh() fails if it cannot
  find an alias for the inode, but this failure can be fixed. ovl_encode_fh() seldom uses the
  alias and in the case of non-decodable file handles, as is often the case with fanotify fid
  info, ovl_encode_fh() never needs to use the alias to encode a file handle.  Defer finding
  an alias until it is actually needed so ovl_encode_fh() will not fail in the common case of
  FAN_DELETE_SELF fanotify events.'
