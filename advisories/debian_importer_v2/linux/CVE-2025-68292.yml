summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/memfd: fix
  information leak in hugetlb folios  When allocating hugetlb folios for memfd, three initialization
  steps are missing:  1. Folios are not zeroed, leading to kernel memory disclosure to userspace
  2. Folios are not marked uptodate before adding to page cache 3. hugetlb_fault_mutex is not
  taken before hugetlb_add_to_page_cache()  The memfd allocation path bypasses the normal page
  fault handler (hugetlb_no_page) which would handle all of these initialization steps.  This
  is problematic especially for udmabuf use cases where folios are pinned and directly accessed
  by userspace via DMA.  Fix by matching the initialization pattern used in hugetlb_no_page():
  - Zero the folio using folio_zero_user() which is optimized for huge pages - Mark it uptodate
  with folio_mark_uptodate() - Take hugetlb_fault_mutex before adding to page cache to prevent
  races  The folio_zero_user() change also fixes a potential security issue where uninitialized
  kernel memory could be disclosed to userspace through read() or mmap() operations on the memfd.'
