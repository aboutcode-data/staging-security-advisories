summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: mac80211:
  mlme: fix null-ptr deref on failed assoc  If association to an AP without a link 0 fails,
  then we crash in tracing because it assumes that either ap_mld_addr or link 0 BSS is valid,
  since we clear sdata->vif.valid_links and then don''t add the ap_mld_addr to the struct.  Since
  we clear also sdata->vif.cfg.ap_addr, keep a local copy of it and assign it earlier, before
  clearing valid_links, to fix this.'
