summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: mac80211:
  correctly decode TTLM with default link map  TID-To-Link Mapping (TTLM) elements do not contain
  any link mapping presence indicator if a default mapping is used and parsing needs to be skipped.  Note
  that access points should not explicitly report an advertised TTLM with a default mapping
  as that is the implied mapping if the element is not included, this is even the case when
  switching back to the default mapping. However, mac80211 would incorrectly parse the frame
  and would also read one byte beyond the end of the element.'
