summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sunrpc: fix client
  side handling of tls alerts  A security exploit was discovered in NFS over TLS in tls_alert_recv
  due to its assumption that there is valid data in the msghdr''s iterator''s kvec.  Instead,
  this patch proposes the rework how control messages are setup and used by sock_recvmsg().  If
  no control message structure is setup, kTLS layer will read and process TLS data record types.
  As soon as it encounters a TLS control message, it would return an error. At that point, NFS
  can setup a kvec backed control buffer and read in the control message such as a TLS alert.
  Scott found that a msg iterator can advance the kvec pointer as a part of the copy process
  thus we need to revert the iterator before calling into the tls_alert_recv.'
