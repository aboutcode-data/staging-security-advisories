summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sfc: fix null
  pointer dereference in efx_hard_start_xmit  Trying to get the channel from the tx_queue variable
  here is wrong because we can only be here if tx_queue is NULL, so we shouldn''t dereference
  it. As the above comment in the code says, this is very unlikely to happen, but it''s wrong
  anyway so let''s fix it.  I hit this issue because of a different bug that caused tx_queue
  to be NULL. If that happens, this is the error message that we get here:   BUG: unable to
  handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000020   [...]   RIP: 0010:efx_hard_start_xmit+0x153/0x170
