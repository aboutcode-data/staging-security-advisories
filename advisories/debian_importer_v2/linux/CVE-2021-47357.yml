  - CVE-2021-47357
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  atm: iphase:
  fix possible use-after-free in ia_module_exit()  This module''s remove path calls del_timer().
  However, that function does not wait until the timer handler finishes. This means that the
  timer handler may still be running after the driver''s remove function has finished, which
  would result in a use-after-free.  Fix by calling del_timer_sync(), which makes sure the timer
  handler has finished, and unable to re-schedule itself.'
