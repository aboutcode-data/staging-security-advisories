summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  arm64: cacheinfo:
  Fix incorrect assignment of signed error value to unsigned fw_level  Though acpi_find_last_cache_level()
  always returned signed value and the document states it will return any errors caused by lack
  of a PPTT table, it never returned negative values before.  Commit 0c80f9e165f8 ("ACPI: PPTT:
  Leave the table mapped for the runtime usage") however changed it by returning -ENOENT if
  no PPTT was found. The value returned from acpi_find_last_cache_level() is then assigned to
  unsigned fw_level.  It will result in the number of cache leaves calculated incorrectly as
  a huge value which will then cause the following warning from __alloc_pages as the order would
  be great than MAX_ORDER because of incorrect and huge cache leaves value.    |  WARNING: CPU:
