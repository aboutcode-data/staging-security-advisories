summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: dvbdev:
  adopts refcnt to avoid UAF  dvb_unregister_device() is known that prone to use-after-free.
  That is, the cleanup from dvb_unregister_device() releases the dvb_device even if there are
  pointers stored in file->private_data still refer to it.  This patch adds a reference counter
  into struct dvb_device and delays its deallocation until no pointer refers to the object.'
