summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: ipset:
  Rework long task execution when adding/deleting entries  When adding/deleting large number
  of elements in one step in ipset, it can take a reasonable amount of time and can result in
  soft lockup errors. The patch 5f7b51bf09ba ("netfilter: ipset: Limit the maximal range of
  consecutive elements to add/delete") tried to fix it by limiting the max elements to process
  at all. However it was not enough, it is still possible that we get hung tasks. Lowering the
  limit is not reasonable, so the approach in this patch is as follows: rely on the method used
  at resizing sets and save the state when we reach a smaller internal batch limit, unlock/lock
  and proceed from the saved state. Thus we can avoid long continuous tasks and at the same
  time removed the limit to add/delete large number of elements in one step.  The nfnl mutex
  is held during the whole operation which prevents one to issue other ipset commands in parallel.'
