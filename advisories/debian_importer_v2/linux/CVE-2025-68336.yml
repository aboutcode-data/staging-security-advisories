summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  locking/spinlock/debug:
  Fix data-race in do_raw_write_lock  KCSAN reports:  BUG: KCSAN: data-race in do_raw_write_lock

  1103 Comm: kworker/u4:1 6.1.111  Commit 1a365e822372 ("locking/spinlock/debug: Fix various
  data races") has adressed most of these races, but seems to be not consistent/not complete.  >From
  do_raw_write_lock() only debug_write_lock_after() part has been converted to WRITE_ONCE(),
  but not debug_write_lock_before() part. Do it now.'
