summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: VMX: Fix
  crash due to uninitialized current_vmcs  KVM enables ''Enlightened VMCS'' and ''Enlightened
  MSR Bitmap'' when running as a nested hypervisor on top of Hyper-V. When MSR bitmap is updated,
  evmcs_touch_msr_bitmap function uses current_vmcs per-cpu variable to mark that the msr bitmap
  was changed.  vmx_vcpu_create() modifies the msr bitmap via vmx_disable_intercept_for_msr
  -> vmx_msr_bitmap_l01_changed which in the end calls this function. The function checks for
  current_vmcs if it is null but the check is insufficient because current_vmcs is not initialized.
  Because of this, the code might incorrectly write to the structure pointed by current_vmcs
  value left by another task. Preemption is not disabled, the current task can be preempted
  and moved to another CPU while current_vmcs is accessed multiple times from evmcs_touch_msr_bitmap()
  which leads to crash.  The manipulation of MSR bitmaps by callers happens only for vmcs01
  so the solution is to use vmx->vmcs01.vmcs instead of current_vmcs.    BUG: kernel NULL pointer
