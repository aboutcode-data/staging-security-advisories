summary: Guests can trigger NIC interface reset/abort/crash via netback It is possible for a
  guest to trigger a NIC interface reset/abort/crash in a Linux based network backend by sending
  certain kinds of packets. It appears to be an (unwritten?) assumption in the rest of the Linux
  network stack that packet protocol headers are all contained within the linear section of
  the SKB and some NICs behave badly if this is not the case. This has been reported to occur
  with Cisco (enic) and Broadcom NetXtrem II BCM5780 (bnx2x) though it may be an issue with
  other NICs/drivers as well. In case the frontend is sending requests with split headers, netback
  will forward those violating above mentioned assumption to the networking core, resulting
  in said misbehavior.
