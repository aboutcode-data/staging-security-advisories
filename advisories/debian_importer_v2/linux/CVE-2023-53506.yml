summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  udf: Do not bother
  merging very long extents  When merging very long extents we try to push as much length as
  possible to the first extent. However this is unnecessarily complicated and not really worth
  the trouble. Furthermore there was a bug in the logic resulting in corrupting extents in the
  file as syzbot reproducer shows. So just don''t bother with the merging of extents that are
  too long together.'
