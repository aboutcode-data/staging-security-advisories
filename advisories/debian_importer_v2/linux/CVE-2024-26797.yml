summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display:
  Prevent potential buffer overflow in map_hw_resources  Adds a check in the map_hw_resources
  function to prevent a potential buffer overflow. The function was accessing arrays using an
  index that could potentially be greater than the size of the arrays, leading to a buffer overflow.  Adds
  a check to ensure that the index is within the bounds of the arrays. If the index is out of
  bounds, an error message is printed and break it will continue execution with just ignoring
  extra data early to prevent the buffer overflow.  Reported by smatch: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dml2/dml2_wrapper.c:79
