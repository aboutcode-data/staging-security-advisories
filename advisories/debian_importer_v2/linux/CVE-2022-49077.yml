summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mmmremap.c: avoid
  pointless invalidate_range_start/end on mremap(old_size=0)  If an mremap() syscall with old_size=0
  ends up in move_page_tables(), it will call invalidate_range_start()/invalidate_range_end()
  unnecessarily, i.e.  with an empty range.  This causes a WARN in KVM''s mmu_notifier.  In
  the past, empty ranges have been diagnosed to be off-by-one bugs, hence the WARNing.  Given
  the low (so far) number of unique reports, the benefits of detecting more buggy callers seem
  to outweigh the cost of having to fix cases such as this one, where userspace is doing something
  silly.  In this particular case, an early return from move_page_tables() is enough to fix
  the issue.'
