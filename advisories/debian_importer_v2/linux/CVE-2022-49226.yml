summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: asix: add
  proper error handling of usb read errors  Syzbot once again hit uninit value in asix driver.
  The problem still the same -- asix_read_cmd() reads less bytes, than was requested by caller.  Since
  all read requests are performed via asix_read_cmd() let''s catch usb related error there and
  add __must_check notation to be sure all callers actually check return value.  So, this patch
  adds sanity check inside asix_read_cmd(), that simply checks if bytes read are not less, than
  was requested and adds missing error handling of asix_read_cmd() all across the driver code.'
