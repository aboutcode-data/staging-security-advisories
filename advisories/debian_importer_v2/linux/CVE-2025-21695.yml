summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  platform/x86:
  dell-uart-backlight: fix serdev race  The dell_uart_bl_serdev_probe() function calls devm_serdev_device_open()
  before setting the client ops via serdev_device_set_client_ops(). This ordering can trigger
  a NULL pointer dereference in the serdev controller''s receive_buf handler, as it assumes
  serdev->ops is valid when SERPORT_ACTIVE is set.  This is similar to the issue fixed in commit
  5e700b384ec1 ("platform/chrome: cros_ec_uart: properly fix race condition") where devm_serdev_device_open()
  was called before fully initializing the device.  Fix the race by ensuring client ops are
  set before enabling the port via devm_serdev_device_open().  Note, serdev_device_set_baudrate()
  and serdev_device_set_flow_control() calls should be after the devm_serdev_device_open() call.'
