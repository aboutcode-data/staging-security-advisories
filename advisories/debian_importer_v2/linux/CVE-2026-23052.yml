summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ftrace: Do not
  over-allocate ftrace memory  The pg_remaining calculation in ftrace_process_locs() assumes
  that ENTRIES_PER_PAGE multiplied by 2^order equals the actual capacity of the allocated page
  group. However, ENTRIES_PER_PAGE is PAGE_SIZE / ENTRY_SIZE (integer division). When PAGE_SIZE
  is not a multiple of ENTRY_SIZE (e.g. 4096 / 24 = 170 with remainder 16), high-order allocations
  (like 256 pages) have significantly more capacity than 256 * 170. This leads to pg_remaining
  being underestimated, which in turn makes skip (derived from skipped - pg_remaining) larger
  than expected, causing the WARN(skip != remaining) to trigger.  Extra allocated pages for
  ftrace: 2 with 654 skipped WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 0 at kernel/trace/ftrace.c:7295 ftrace_process_locs+0x5bf/0x5e0  A
  similar problem in ftrace_allocate_records() can result in allocating too many pages. This
  can trigger the second warning in ftrace_process_locs().  Extra allocated pages for ftrace
  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 0 at kernel/trace/ftrace.c:7276 ftrace_process_locs+0x548/0x580  Use
  the actual capacity of a page group to determine the number of pages to allocate. Have ftrace_allocate_pages()
  return the number of allocated pages to avoid having to calculate it. Use the actual page
  group capacity when validating the number of unused pages due to skipped entries. Drop the
  definition of ENTRIES_PER_PAGE since it is no longer used.'
