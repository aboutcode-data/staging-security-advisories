  - CVE-2023-53797
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: wacom: Use
  ktime_t rather than int when dealing with timestamps  Code which interacts with timestamps
  needs to use the ktime_t type returned by functions like ktime_get. The int type does not
  offer enough space to store these values, and attempting to use it is a recipe for problems.
  In this particular case, overflows would occur when calculating/storing timestamps leading
  to incorrect values being reported to userspace. In some cases these bad timestamps cause
  input handling in userspace to appear hung.'
