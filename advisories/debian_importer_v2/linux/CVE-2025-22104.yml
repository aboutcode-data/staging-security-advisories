summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ibmvnic: Use
  kernel helpers for hex dumps  Previously, when the driver was printing hex dumps, the buffer
  was cast to an 8 byte long and printed using string formatters. If the buffer size was not
  a multiple of 8 then a read buffer overflow was possible.  Therefore, create a new ibmvnic
  function that loops over a buffer and calls hex_dump_to_buffer instead.  This patch address
  KASAN reports like the one below:   ibmvnic 30000003 env3: Login Buffer:   ibmvnic 30000003
