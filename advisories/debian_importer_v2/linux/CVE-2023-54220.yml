summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  serial: 8250:
  Fix oops for port->pm on uart_change_pm()  Unloading a hardware specific 8250 driver can produce
  error "Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address" about ten seconds after
  unloading the driver. This happens on uart_hangup() calling uart_change_pm().  Turns out commit
  04e82793f068 ("serial: 8250: Reinit port->pm on port specific driver unbind") was only a partial
  fix. If the hardware specific driver has initialized port->pm function, we need to clear port->pm
  too. Just reinitializing port->ops does not do this. Otherwise serial8250_pm() will call port->pm()
  instead of serial8250_do_pm().'
