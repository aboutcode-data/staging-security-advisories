summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: hisilicon:
  hi3559a: Fix an erroneous devm_kfree()  ''p_clk'' is an array allocated just before the for
  loop for all clk that need to be registered. It is incremented at each loop iteration.  If
  a clk_register() call fails, ''p_clk'' may point to something different from what should be
  freed.  The best we can do, is to avoid this wrong release of memory.'
