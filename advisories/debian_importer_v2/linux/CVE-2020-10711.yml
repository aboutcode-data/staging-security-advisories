  - CVE-2020-10711
summary: A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel's SELinux subsystem in
  versions before 5.7. This flaw occurs while importing the Commercial IP Security Option (CIPSO)
  protocol's category bitmap into the SELinux extensible bitmap via the' ebitmap_netlbl_import'
  routine. While processing the CIPSO restricted bitmap tag in the 'cipso_v4_parsetag_rbm' routine,
  it sets the security attribute to indicate that the category bitmap is present, even if it
  has not been allocated. This issue leads to a NULL pointer dereference issue while importing
  the same category bitmap into SELinux. This flaw allows a remote network user to crash the
  system kernel, resulting in a denial of service.
