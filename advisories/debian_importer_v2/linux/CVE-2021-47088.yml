summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/damon/dbgfs:
  protect targets destructions with kdamond_lock  DAMON debugfs interface iterates current monitoring
  targets in ''dbgfs_target_ids_read()'' while holding the corresponding ''kdamond_lock''.  However,
  it also destructs the monitoring targets in ''dbgfs_before_terminate()'' without holding the
  lock.  This can result in a use_after_free bug.  This commit avoids the race by protecting
  the destruction with the corresponding ''kdamond_lock''.'
