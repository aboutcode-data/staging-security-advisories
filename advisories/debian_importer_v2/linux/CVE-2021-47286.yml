summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bus: mhi: core:
  Validate channel ID when processing command completions  MHI reads the channel ID from the
  event ring element sent by the device which can be any value between 0 and 255. In order to
  prevent any out of bound accesses, add a check against the maximum number of channels supported
  by the controller and those channels not configured yet so as to skip processing of that event
  ring element.'
