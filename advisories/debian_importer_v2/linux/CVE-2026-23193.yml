summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: target:
  iscsi: Fix use-after-free in iscsit_dec_session_usage_count()  In iscsit_dec_session_usage_count(),
  the function calls complete() while holding the sess->session_usage_lock. Similar to the connection
  usage count logic, the waiter signaled by complete() (e.g., in the session release path) may
  wake up and free the iscsit_session structure immediately.  This creates a race condition
  where the current thread may attempt to execute spin_unlock_bh() on a session structure that
  has already been deallocated, resulting in a KASAN slab-use-after-free.  To resolve this,
  release the session_usage_lock before calling complete() to ensure all dereferences of the
  sess pointer are finished before the waiter is allowed to proceed with deallocation.'
