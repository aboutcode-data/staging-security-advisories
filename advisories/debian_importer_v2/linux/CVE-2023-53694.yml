summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  riscv: ftrace:\
  \ Fixup panic by disabling preemption  In RISCV, we must use an AUIPC + JALR pair to encode\
  \ an immediate, forming a jump that jumps to an address over 4K. This may cause errors if\
  \ we want to enable kernel preemption and remove dependency from patching code with stop_machine().\
  \ For example, if a task was switched out on auipc. And, if we changed the ftrace function\
  \ before it was switched back, then it would jump to an address that has updated 11:0 bits\
  \ mixing with previous XLEN:12 part.  p: patched area performed by dynamic ftrace ftrace_prologue:\
  \ p|      REG_S   ra, -SZREG(sp) p|      auipc   ra, 0x? ------------> preempted \t\t\t\t\t\
  ... \t\t\t\tchange ftrace function \t\t\t\t\t... p|      jalr    -?(ra) <------------- switched\
  \ back p|      REG_L   ra, -SZREG(sp) func: \txxx \tret"
