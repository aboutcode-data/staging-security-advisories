  - CVE-2019-19807
summary: In the Linux kernel before 5.3.11, sound/core/timer.c has a use-after-free caused by
  erroneous code refactoring, aka CID-e7af6307a8a5. This is related to snd_timer_open and snd_timer_close_locked.
  The timeri variable was originally intended to be for a newly created timer instance, but
  was used for a different purpose after refactoring.
