summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: qla2xxx:
  Fix improper freeing of purex item  In qla2xxx_process_purls_iocb(), an item is allocated
  via qla27xx_copy_multiple_pkt(), which internally calls qla24xx_alloc_purex_item().  The qla24xx_alloc_purex_item()
  function may return a pre-allocated item from a per-adapter pool for small allocations, instead
  of dynamically allocating memory with kzalloc().  An error handling path in qla2xxx_process_purls_iocb()
  incorrectly uses kfree() to release the item. If the item was from the pre-allocated pool,
  calling kfree() on it is a bug that can lead to memory corruption.  Fix this by using the
  correct deallocation function, qla24xx_free_purex_item(), which properly handles both dynamically
  allocated and pre-allocated items.'
