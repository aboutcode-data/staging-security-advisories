summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: x86: Drop
  WARNs that assert a triple fault never "escapes" from L2  Remove WARNs that sanity check that
  KVM never lets a triple fault for L2 escape and incorrectly end up in L1.  In normal operation,
  the sanity check is perfectly valid, but it incorrectly assumes that it''s impossible for
  userspace to induce KVM_REQ_TRIPLE_FAULT without bouncing through KVM_RUN (which guarantees
  kvm_check_nested_state() will see and handle the triple fault).  The WARN can currently be
  triggered if userspace injects a machine check while L2 is active and CR4.MCE=0.  And a future
  fix to allow save/restore of KVM_REQ_TRIPLE_FAULT, e.g. so that a synthesized triple fault
  isn''t lost on migration, will make it trivially easy for userspace to trigger the WARN.  Clearing
  KVM_REQ_TRIPLE_FAULT when forcibly leaving guest mode is tempting, but wrong, especially if/when
  the request is saved/restored, e.g. if userspace restores events (including a triple fault)
  and then restores nested state (which may forcibly leave guest mode).  Ignoring the fact that
  KVM doesn''t currently provide the necessary APIs, it''s userspace''s responsibility to manage
  pending events during save/restore.    ------------[ cut here ]------------   WARNING: CPU:
