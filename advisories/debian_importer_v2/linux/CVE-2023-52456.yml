summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  serial: imx:
  fix tx statemachine deadlock  When using the serial port as RS485 port, the tx statemachine
  is used to control the RTS pin to drive the RS485 transceiver TX_EN pin. When the TTY port
  is closed in the middle of a transmission (for instance during userland application crash),
  imx_uart_shutdown disables the interface and disables the Transmission Complete interrupt.
  afer that, imx_uart_stop_tx bails on an incomplete transmission, to be retriggered by the
  TC interrupt. This interrupt is disabled and therefore the tx statemachine never transitions
  out of SEND. The statemachine is in deadlock now, and the TX_EN remains low, making the interface
  useless.  imx_uart_stop_tx now checks for incomplete transmission AND whether TC interrupts
  are enabled before bailing to be retriggered. This makes sure the state machine handling is
  reached, and is properly set to WAIT_AFTER_SEND.'
