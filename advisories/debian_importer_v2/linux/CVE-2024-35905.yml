summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Protect
  against int overflow for stack access size  This patch re-introduces protection against the
  size of access to stack memory being negative; the access size can appear negative as a result
  of overflowing its signed int representation. This should not actually happen, as there are
  other protections along the way, but we should protect against it anyway. One code path was
  missing such protections (fixed in the previous patch in the series), causing out-of-bounds
  array accesses in check_stack_range_initialized(). This patch causes the verification of a
  program with such a non-sensical access size to fail.  This check used to exist in a more
  indirect way, but was inadvertendly removed in a833a17aeac7.'
