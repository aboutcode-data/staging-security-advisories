summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  eth: alx: take
  rtnl_lock on resume  Zbynek reports that alx trips an rtnl assertion on resume:   RTNL: assertion
  failed at net/core/dev.c (2891)  RIP: 0010:netif_set_real_num_tx_queues+0x1ac/0x1c0  Call
  Trace:   <TASK>   __alx_open+0x230/0x570 [alx]   alx_resume+0x54/0x80 [alx]   ? pci_legacy_resume+0x80/0x80   dpm_run_callback+0x4a/0x150   device_resume+0x8b/0x190   async_resume+0x19/0x30   async_run_entry_fn+0x30/0x130   process_one_work+0x1e5/0x3b0  indeed
  the driver does not hold rtnl_lock during its internal close and re-open functions during
  suspend/resume. Note that this is not a huge bug as the driver implements its own locking,
  and does not implement changing the number of queues, but we need to silence the splat.'
