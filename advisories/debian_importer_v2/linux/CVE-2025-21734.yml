summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  misc: fastrpc:
  Fix copy buffer page size  For non-registered buffer, fastrpc driver copies the buffer and
  pass it to the remote subsystem. There is a problem with current implementation of page size
  calculation which is not considering the offset in the calculation. This might lead to passing
  of improper and out-of-bounds page size which could result in memory issue. Calculate page
  start and page end using the offset adjusted address instead of absolute address.'
