summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tmpfs: fix race\
  \ on handling dquot rbtree  A syzkaller reproducer found a race while attempting to remove\
  \ dquot information from the rb tree.  Fetching the rb_tree root node must also be protected\
  \ by the dqopt->dqio_sem, otherwise, giving the right timing, shmem_release_dquot() will trigger\
  \ a warning because it couldn't find a node in the tree, when the real reason was the root\
  \ node changing before the search starts:  Thread 1\t\t\t\tThread 2 - shmem_release_dquot()\t\
  \t\t- shmem_{acquire,release}_dquot()  - fetch ROOT\t\t\t\t- Fetch ROOT  \t\t\t\t\t- acquire\
  \ dqio_sem - wait dqio_sem  \t\t\t\t\t- do something, triger a tree rebalance \t\t\t\t\t-\
  \ release dqio_sem  - acquire dqio_sem - start searching for the node, but   from the wrong\
  \ location, missing   the node, and triggering a warning."
