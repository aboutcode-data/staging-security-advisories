summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/v3d: Validate
  passed in drm syncobj handles in the timestamp extension  If userspace provides an unknown
  or invalid handle anywhere in the handle array the rest of the driver will not handle that
  well.  Fix it by checking handle was looked up successfully or otherwise fail the extension
  by jumping into the existing unwind.  (cherry picked from commit 8d1276d1b8f738c3afe1457d4dff5cc66fc848a3)'
