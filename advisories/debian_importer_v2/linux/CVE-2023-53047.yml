summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tee: amdtee:
  fix race condition in amdtee_open_session  There is a potential race condition in amdtee_open_session
  that may lead to use-after-free. For instance, in amdtee_open_session() after sess->sess_mask
  is set, and before setting:      sess->session_info[i] = session_info;  if amdtee_close_session()
  closes this same session, then ''sess'' data structure will be released, causing kernel panic
  when ''sess'' is accessed within amdtee_open_session().  The solution is to set the bit sess->sess_mask
  as the last step in amdtee_open_session().'
