summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  arm64: dts: qcom:
  msm8998: Fix CPU/L2 idle state latency and residency  The entry/exit latency and minimum residency
  in state for the idle states of MSM8998 were ..bad: first of all, for all of them the timings
  were written for CPU sleep but the min-residency-us param was miscalculated (supposedly, while
  porting this from downstream); Then, the power collapse states are setting PC on both the
  CPU cluster *and* the L2 cache, which have different timings: in the specific case of L2 the
  times are higher so these ones should be taken into account instead of the CPU ones.  This
  parameter misconfiguration was not giving particular issues because on MSM8998 there was no
  CPU scaling at all, so cluster/L2 power collapse was rarely (if ever) hit. When CPU scaling
  is enabled, though, the wrong timings will produce SoC unstability shown to the user as random,
  apparently error-less, sudden reboots and/or lockups.  This set of parameters are stabilizing
  the SoC when CPU scaling is ON and when power collapse is frequently hit.'
