summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  binder: fix UAF
  in binder_netlink_report()  Oneway transactions sent to frozen targets via binder_proc_transaction()
  return a BR_TRANSACTION_PENDING_FROZEN error but they are still treated as successful since
  the target is expected to thaw at some point. It is then not safe to access ''t'' after BR_TRANSACTION_PENDING_FROZEN
  errors as the transaction could have been consumed by the now thawed target.  This is the
  case for binder_netlink_report() which derreferences ''t'' after a pending frozen error, as
  pointed out by the following KASAN report:    ==================================================================   BUG:
  KASAN: slab-use-after-free in binder_netlink_report.isra.0+0x694/0x6c8   Read of size 8 at

  make a transaction copy so the data can be safely accessed by binder_netlink_report() after
  a pending frozen error. While here, add a comment about not using t->buffer in binder_netlink_report().'
