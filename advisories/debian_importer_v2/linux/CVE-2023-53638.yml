  - CVE-2023-53638
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  octeon_ep: cancel
  queued works in probe error path  If it fails to get the devices''s MAC address, octep_probe
  exits while leaving the delayed work intr_poll_task queued. When the work later runs, it''s
  a use after free.  Move the cancelation of intr_poll_task from octep_remove into octep_device_cleanup.
  This does not change anything in the octep_remove flow, but octep_device_cleanup is called
  also in the octep_probe error path, where the cancelation is needed.  Note that the cancelation
  of ctrl_mbox_task has to follow intr_poll_task''s, because the ctrl_mbox_task may be queued
  by intr_poll_task.'
