  - CVE-2022-49562
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: x86: Use
  __try_cmpxchg_user() to update guest PTE A/D bits  Use the recently introduced __try_cmpxchg_user()
  to update guest PTE A/D bits instead of mapping the PTE into kernel address space.  The VM_PFNMAP
  path is broken as it assumes that vm_pgoff is the base pfn of the mapped VMA range, which
  is conceptually wrong as vm_pgoff is the offset relative to the file and has nothing to do
  with the pfn.  The horrific hack worked for the original use case (backing guest memory with
  /dev/mem), but leads to accessing "random" pfns for pretty much any other VM_PFNMAP case.'
