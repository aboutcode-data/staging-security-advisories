summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/msm/dp: Free
  resources after unregistering them  The DP component''s unbind operation walks through the
  submodules to unregister and clean things up. But if the unbind happens because the DP controller
  itself is being removed, all the memory for those submodules has just been freed.  Change
  the order of these operations to avoid the many use-after-free that otherwise happens in this
  code path.  Patchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/542166/'
