summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fs/ntfs3: don''t
  hold ni_lock when calling truncate_setsize()  syzbot is reporting hung task at do_user_addr_fault()
  [1], for there is a silent deadlock between PG_locked bit and ni_lock lock.  Since filemap_update_page()
  calls filemap_read_folio() after calling folio_trylock() which will set PG_locked bit, ntfs_truncate()
  must not call truncate_setsize() which will wait for PG_locked bit to be cleared when holding
  ni_lock lock.'
