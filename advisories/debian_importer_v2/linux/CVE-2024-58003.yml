  - CVE-2024-58003
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: i2c: ds90ub9x3:
  Fix extra fwnode_handle_put()  The ub913 and ub953 drivers call fwnode_handle_put(priv->sd.fwnode)
  as part of their remove process, and if the driver is removed multiple times, eventually leads
  to put "overflow", possibly causing memory corruption or crash.  The fwnode_handle_put() is
  a leftover from commit 905f88ccebb1 ("media: i2c: ds90ub9x3: Fix sub-device matching"), which
  changed the code related to the sd.fwnode, but missed removing these fwnode_handle_put() calls.'
