summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfsd: fix handling
  of cached open files in nfsd4_open codepath  Commit fb70bf124b05 ("NFSD: Instantiate a struct
  file when creating a regular NFSv4 file") added the ability to cache an open fd over a compound.
  There are a couple of problems with the way this currently works:  It''s racy, as a newly-created
  nfsd_file can end up with its PENDING bit cleared while the nf is hashed, and the nf_file
  pointer is still zeroed out. Other tasks can find it in this state and they expect to see
  a valid nf_file, and can oops if nf_file is NULL.  Also, there is no guarantee that we''ll
  end up creating a new nfsd_file if one is already in the hash. If an extant entry is in the
  hash with a valid nf_file, nfs4_get_vfs_file will clobber its nf_file pointer with the value
  of op_file and the old nf_file will leak.  Fix both issues by making a new nfsd_file_acquirei_opened
  variant that takes an optional file pointer. If one is present when this is called, we''ll
  take a new reference to it instead of trying to open the file. If the nfsd_file already has
  a valid nf_file, we''ll just ignore the optional file and pass the nfsd_file back as-is.  Also
  rework the tracepoints a bit to allow for an "opened" variant and don''t try to avoid counting
  acquisitions in the case where we already have a cached open file.'
