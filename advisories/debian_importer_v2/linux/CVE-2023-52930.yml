summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/i915: Fix
  potential bit_17 double-free  A userspace with multiple threads racing I915_GEM_SET_TILING
  to set the tiling to I915_TILING_NONE could trigger a double free of the bit_17 bitmask.  (Or
  conversely leak memory on the transition to tiled.)  Move allocation/free''ing of the bitmask
  within the section protected by the obj lock.  [tursulin: Correct fixes tag and added cc stable.]
  (cherry picked from commit 10e0cbaaf1104f449d695c80bcacf930dcd3c42e)'
