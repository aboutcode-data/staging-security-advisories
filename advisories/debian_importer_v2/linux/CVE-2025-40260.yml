summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sched_ext: Fix
  scx_enable() crash on helper kthread creation failure  A crash was observed when the sched_ext
  selftests runner was terminated with Ctrl+\ while test 15 was running:  NIP [c00000000028fa58]
  scx_enable.constprop.0+0x358/0x12b0 LR [c00000000028fa2c] scx_enable.constprop.0+0x32c/0x12b0
  Call Trace: scx_enable.constprop.0+0x32c/0x12b0 (unreliable) bpf_struct_ops_link_create+0x18c/0x22c
  __sys_bpf+0x23f8/0x3044 sys_bpf+0x2c/0x6c system_call_exception+0x124/0x320 system_call_vectored_common+0x15c/0x2ec  kthread_run_worker()
  returns an ERR_PTR() on failure rather than NULL, but the current code in scx_alloc_and_add_sched()
  only checks for a NULL helper. Incase of failure on SIGQUIT, the error is not handled in scx_alloc_and_add_sched()
  and scx_enable() ends up dereferencing an error pointer.  Error handling is fixed in scx_alloc_and_add_sched()
  to propagate PTR_ERR() into ret, so that scx_enable() jumps to the existing error path, avoiding
  random dereference on failure.'
