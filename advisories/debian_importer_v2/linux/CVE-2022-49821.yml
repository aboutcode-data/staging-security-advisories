summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mISDN: fix possible
  memory leak in mISDN_dsp_element_register()  Afer commit 1fa5ae857bb1 ("driver core: get rid
  of struct device''s bus_id string array"), the name of device is allocated dynamically, use
  put_device() to give up the reference, so that the name can be freed in kobject_cleanup()
  when the refcount is 0.  The ''entry'' is going to be freed in mISDN_dsp_dev_release(), so
  the kfree() is removed. list_del() is called in mISDN_dsp_dev_release(), so it need be initialized.'
