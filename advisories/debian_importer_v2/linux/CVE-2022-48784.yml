summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cfg80211: fix
  race in netlink owner interface destruction  My previous fix here to fix the deadlock left
  a race where the exact same deadlock (see the original commit referenced below) can still
  happen if cfg80211_destroy_ifaces() already runs while nl80211_netlink_notify() is still marking
  some interfaces as nl_owner_dead.  The race happens because we have two loops here - first
  we dev_close() all the netdevs, and then we destroy them. If we also have two netdevs (first
  one need only be a wdev though) then we can find one during the first iteration, close it,
  and go to the second iteration -- but then find two, and try to destroy also the one we didn''t
  close yet.  Fix this by only iterating once.'
