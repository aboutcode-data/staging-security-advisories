summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cdx: Fix possible
  UAF error in driver_override_show()  Fixed a possible UAF problem in driver_override_show()
  in drivers/cdx/cdx.c  This function driver_override_show() is part of DEVICE_ATTR_RW, which
  includes both driver_override_show() and driver_override_store(). These functions can be executed
  concurrently in sysfs.  The driver_override_store() function uses driver_set_override() to
  update the driver_override value, and driver_set_override() internally locks the device (device_lock(dev)).
  If driver_override_show() reads cdx_dev->driver_override without locking, it could potentially
  access a freed pointer if driver_override_store() frees the string concurrently. This could
  lead to printing a kernel address, which is a security risk since DEVICE_ATTR can be read
  by all users.  Additionally, a similar pattern is used in drivers/amba/bus.c, as well as many
  other bus drivers, where device_lock() is taken in the show function, and it has been working
  without issues.  This potential bug was detected by our experimental static analysis tool,
  which analyzes locking APIs and paired functions to identify data races and atomicity violations.'
