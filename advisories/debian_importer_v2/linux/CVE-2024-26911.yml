summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/buddy: Fix
  alloc_range() error handling code  Few users have observed display corruption when they boot
  the machine to KDE Plasma or playing games. We have root caused the problem that whenever
  alloc_range() couldn''t find the required memory blocks the function was returning SUCCESS
  in some of the corner cases.  The right approach would be if the total allocated size is less
  than the required size, the function should return -ENOSPC.'
