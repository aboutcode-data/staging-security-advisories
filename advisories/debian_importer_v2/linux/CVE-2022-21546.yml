  - CVE-2022-21546
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: target:
  Fix WRITE_SAME No Data Buffer crash  In newer version of the SBC specs, we have a NDOB bit
  that indicates there is no data buffer that gets written out. If this bit is set using commands
  like "sg_write_same --ndob" we will crash in target_core_iblock/file''s execute_write_same
  handlers when we go to access the se_cmd->t_data_sg because its NULL.  This patch adds a check
  for the NDOB bit in the common WRITE SAME code because we don''t support it. And, it adds
  a check for zero SG elements in each handler in case the initiator tries to send a normal
  WRITE SAME with no data buffer.'
