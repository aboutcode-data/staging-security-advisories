summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  pipe: wakeup
  wr_wait after setting max_usage  Commit c73be61cede5 ("pipe: Add general notification queue
  support") a regression was introduced that would lock up resized pipes under certain conditions.
  See the reproducer in [1].  The commit resizing the pipe ring size was moved to a different
  function, doing that moved the wakeup for pipe->wr_wait before actually raising pipe->max_usage.
  If a pipe was full before the resize occured it would result in the wakeup never actually
  triggering pipe_write.  Set @max_usage and @nr_accounted before waking writers if this isn''t
  a watch queue.  [Christian Brauner <brauner@kernel.org>: rewrite to account for watch queues]'
