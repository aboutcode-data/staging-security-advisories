summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath9k:
  hif_usb: fix memory leak of urbs in ath9k_hif_usb_dealloc_tx_urbs()  Syzkaller reports a long-known
  leak of urbs in ath9k_hif_usb_dealloc_tx_urbs().  The cause of the leak is that usb_get_urb()
  is called but usb_free_urb() (or usb_put_urb()) is not called inside usb_kill_urb() as urb->dev
  or urb->ep fields have not been initialized and usb_kill_urb() returns immediately.  The patch
  removes trying to kill urbs located in hif_dev->tx.tx_buf because hif_dev->tx.tx_buf is not
  supposed to contain urbs which are in pending state (the pending urbs are stored in hif_dev->tx.tx_pending).
  The tx.tx_lock is acquired so there should not be any changes in the list.  Found by Linux
  Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.'
