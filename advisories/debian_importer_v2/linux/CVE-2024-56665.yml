summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf,perf: Fix
  invalid prog_array access in perf_event_detach_bpf_prog  Syzbot reported [1] crash that happens
  for following tracing scenario:    - create tracepoint perf event with attr.inherit=1, attach
  it to the     process and set bpf program to it   - attached process forks -> chid creates
  inherited event      the new child event shares the parent''s bpf program and tp_event     (hence
  prog_array) which is global for tracepoint    - exit both process and its child -> release
  both events   - first perf_event_detach_bpf_prog call will release tp_event->prog_array     and
  second perf_event_detach_bpf_prog will crash, because     tp_event->prog_array is NULL  The
  fix makes sure the perf_event_detach_bpf_prog checks prog_array is valid before it tries to
  remove the bpf program from it.  [1] https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/Z1MR6dCIKajNS6nU@krava/T/#m91dbf0688221ec7a7fc95e896a7ef9ff93b0b8ad'
