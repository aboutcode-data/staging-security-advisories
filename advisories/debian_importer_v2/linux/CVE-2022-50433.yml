summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  efi: ssdt: Don''t
  free memory if ACPI table was loaded successfully  Amadeusz reports KASAN use-after-free errors
  introduced by commit 3881ee0b1edc ("efi: avoid efivars layer when loading SSDTs from variables").
  The problem appears to be that the memory that holds the new ACPI table is now freed unconditionally,
  instead of only when the ACPI core reported a failure to load the table.  So let''s fix this,
  by omitting the kfree() on success.'
