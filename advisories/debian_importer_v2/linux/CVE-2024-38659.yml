summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  enic: Validate
  length of nl attributes in enic_set_vf_port  enic_set_vf_port assumes that the nl attribute
  IFLA_PORT_PROFILE is of length PORT_PROFILE_MAX and that the nl attributes IFLA_PORT_INSTANCE_UUID,
  IFLA_PORT_HOST_UUID are of length PORT_UUID_MAX. These attributes are validated (in the function
  do_setlink in rtnetlink.c) using the nla_policy ifla_port_policy. The policy defines IFLA_PORT_PROFILE
  as NLA_STRING, IFLA_PORT_INSTANCE_UUID as NLA_BINARY and IFLA_PORT_HOST_UUID as NLA_STRING.
  That means that the length validation using the policy is for the max size of the attributes
  and not on exact size so the length of these attributes might be less than the sizes that
  enic_set_vf_port expects. This might cause an out of bands read access in the memcpys of the
  data of these attributes in enic_set_vf_port.'
