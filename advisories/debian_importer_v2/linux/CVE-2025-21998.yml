summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  firmware: qcom:
  uefisecapp: fix efivars registration race  Since the conversion to using the TZ allocator,
  the efivars service is registered before the memory pool has been allocated, something which
  can lead to a NULL-pointer dereference in case of a racing EFI variable access.  Make sure
  that all resources have been set up before registering the efivars.'
