  - CVE-2025-71131
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: seqiv
  - Do not use req->iv after crypto_aead_encrypt  As soon as crypto_aead_encrypt is called,
  the underlying request may be freed by an asynchronous completion.  Thus dereferencing req->iv
  after it returns is invalid.  Instead of checking req->iv against info, create a new variable
  unaligned_info and use it for that purpose instead.'
