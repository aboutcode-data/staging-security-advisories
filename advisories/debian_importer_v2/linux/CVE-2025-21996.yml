summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/radeon: fix
  uninitialized size issue in radeon_vce_cs_parse()  On the off chance that command stream passed
  from userspace via ioctl() call to radeon_vce_cs_parse() is weirdly crafted and first command
  to execute is to encode (case 0x03000001), the function in question will attempt to call radeon_vce_cs_reloc()
  with size argument that has not been properly initialized. Specifically, ''size'' will point
  to ''tmp'' variable before the latter had a chance to be assigned any value.  Play it safe
  and init ''tmp'' with 0, thus ensuring that radeon_vce_cs_reloc() will catch an early error
  in cases like these.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with static analysis
  tool SVACE.  (cherry picked from commit 2d52de55f9ee7aaee0e09ac443f77855989c6b68)'
