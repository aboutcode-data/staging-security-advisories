summary: An issue found in linux-kernel that leads to a race condition in rose_connect(). The
  rose driver uses rose_neigh->use to represent how many objects are using the rose_neigh. When
  a user wants to delete a rose_route via rose_ioctl(), the rose driver calls rose_del_node()
  and removes neighbours only if their “count” and “use” are zero.
