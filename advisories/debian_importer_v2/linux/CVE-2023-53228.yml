summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amdgpu: drop
  redundant sched job cleanup when cs is aborted  Once command submission failed due to userptr
  invalidation in amdgpu_cs_submit, legacy code will perform cleanup of scheduler job. However,
  it''s not needed at all, as former commit has integrated job cleanup stuff into amdgpu_job_free.
  Otherwise, because of double free, a NULL pointer dereference will occur in such scenario.  Bug:
  https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/2457'
