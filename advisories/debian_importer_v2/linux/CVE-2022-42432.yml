  - CVE-2022-42432
summary: This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected
  installations of the Linux Kernel 6.0-rc2. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute
  high-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific
  flaw exists within the nft_osf_eval function. The issue results from the lack of proper initialization
  of memory prior to accessing it. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities
  to execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel. Was ZDI-CAN-18540.
