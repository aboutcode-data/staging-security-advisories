summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommu/omap: Fix
  buffer overflow in debugfs  There are two issues here:  1) The "len" variable needs to be
  checked before the very first write.    Otherwise if omap2_iommu_dump_ctx() with "bytes" less
  than 32 it is a    buffer overflow. 2) The snprintf() function returns the number of bytes
  that *would* have    been copied if there were enough space.  But we want to know the    number
  of bytes which were *actually* copied so use scnprintf()    instead.'
