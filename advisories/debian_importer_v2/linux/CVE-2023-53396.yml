summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ubifs: Fix memory
  leak in do_rename  If renaming a file in an encrypted directory, function fscrypt_setup_filename
  allocates memory for a file name. This name is never used, and before returning to the caller
  the memory for it is not freed.  When running kmemleak on it we see that it is registered
  as a leak. The report below is triggered by a simple program ''rename'' that renames a file
  in an encrypted directory:    unreferenced object 0xffff888101502840 (size 32):     comm "rename",
  pid 9404, jiffies 4302582475 (age 435.735s)     backtrace:       __kmem_cache_alloc_node       __kmalloc       fscrypt_setup_filename       do_rename       ubifs_rename       vfs_rename       do_renameat2  To
  fix this we can remove the call to fscrypt_setup_filename as it''s not needed.'
