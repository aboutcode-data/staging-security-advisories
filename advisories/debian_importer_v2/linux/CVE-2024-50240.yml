summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  phy: qcom: qmp-usb:
  fix NULL-deref on runtime suspend  Commit 413db06c05e7 ("phy: qcom-qmp-usb: clean up probe
  initialisation") removed most users of the platform device driver data, but mistakenly also
  removed the initialisation despite the data still being used in the runtime PM callbacks.  Restore
  the driver data initialisation at probe to avoid a NULL-pointer dereference on runtime suspend.  Apparently
  no one uses runtime PM, which currently needs to be enabled manually through sysfs, with this
  driver.'
