summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  USB: usbfs: Don''t
  WARN about excessively large memory allocations  Syzbot found that the kernel generates a
  WARNing if the user tries to submit a bulk transfer through usbfs with a buffer that is way
  too large.  This isn''t a bug in the kernel; it''s merely an invalid request from the user
  and the usbfs code does handle it correctly.  In theory the same thing can happen with async
  transfers, or with the packet descriptor table for isochronous transfers.  To prevent the
  MM subsystem from complaining about these bad allocation requests, add the __GFP_NOWARN flag
  to the kmalloc calls for these buffers.'
