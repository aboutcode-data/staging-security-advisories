summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/xe/ct: prevent
  UAF in send_recv()  Ensure we serialize with completion side to prevent UAF with fence going
  out of scope on the stack, since we have no clue if it will fire after the timeout before
  we can erase from the xa. Also we have some dependent loads and stores for which we need the
  correct ordering, and we lack the needed barriers. Fix this by grabbing the ct->lock after
  the wait, which is also held by the completion side.  v2 (Badal):  - Also print done after
  acquiring the lock and seeing timeout.  (cherry picked from commit 52789ce35c55ccd30c4b67b9cc5b2af55e0122ea)'
