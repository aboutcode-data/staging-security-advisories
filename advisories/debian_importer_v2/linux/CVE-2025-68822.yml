summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Input: alps -
  fix use-after-free bugs caused by dev3_register_work  The dev3_register_work delayed work
  item is initialized within alps_reconnect() and scheduled upon receipt of the first bare PS/2
  packet from an external PS/2 device connected to the ALPS touchpad. During device detachment,
  the original implementation calls flush_workqueue() in psmouse_disconnect() to ensure completion
  of dev3_register_work. However, the flush_workqueue() in psmouse_disconnect() only blocks
  and waits for work items that were already queued to the workqueue prior to its invocation.
  Any work items submitted after flush_workqueue() is called are not included in the set of
  tasks that the flush operation awaits. This means that after flush_workqueue() has finished
  executing, the dev3_register_work could still be scheduled. Although the psmouse state is
  set to PSMOUSE_CMD_MODE in psmouse_disconnect(), the scheduling of dev3_register_work remains
  unaffected.  The race condition can occur as follows:  CPU 0 (cleanup path)     | CPU 1 (delayed
  work) psmouse_disconnect()     |   psmouse_set_state()    |   flush_workqueue()      | alps_report_bare_ps2_packet()   alps_disconnect()      |   psmouse_queue_work()     kfree(priv);
  // FREE | alps_register_bare_ps2_mouse()                          |   priv = container_of(work...);
  // USE                          |   priv->dev3 // USE  Add disable_delayed_work_sync() in
  alps_disconnect() to ensure that dev3_register_work is properly canceled and prevented from
  executing after the alps_data structure has been deallocated.  This bug is identified by static
  analysis.'
