  - CVE-2025-68246
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ksmbd: close
  accepted socket when per-IP limit rejects connection  When the per-IP connection limit is
  exceeded in ksmbd_kthread_fn(), the code sets ret = -EAGAIN and continues the accept loop
  without closing the just-accepted socket. That leaks one socket per rejected attempt from
  a single IP and enables a trivial remote DoS.  Release client_sk before continuing.  This
  bug was found with ZeroPath.'
