summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: wwan: t7xx:
  fix potential skb->frags overflow in RX path  When receiving data in the DPMAIF RX path, the
  t7xx_dpmaif_set_frag_to_skb() function adds page fragments to an skb without checking if the
  number of fragments has exceeded MAX_SKB_FRAGS. This could lead to a buffer overflow in skb_shinfo(skb)->frags[]
  array, corrupting adjacent memory and potentially causing kernel crashes or other undefined
  behavior.  This issue was identified through static code analysis by comparing with a similar
  vulnerability fixed in the mt76 driver commit b102f0c522cf ("mt76: fix array overflow on receiving
  too many fragments for a packet").  The vulnerability could be triggered if the modem firmware
  sends packets with excessive fragments. While under normal protocol conditions (MTU 3080 bytes,
  BAT buffer 3584 bytes), a single packet should not require additional fragments, the kernel
  should not blindly trust firmware behavior. Malicious, buggy, or compromised firmware could
  potentially craft packets with more fragments than the kernel expects.  Fix this by adding
  a bounds check before calling skb_add_rx_frag() to ensure nr_frags does not exceed MAX_SKB_FRAGS.  The
  check must be performed before unmapping to avoid a page leak and double DMA unmap during
  device teardown.'
