summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/xe: prevent
  UAF around preempt fence  The fence lock is part of the queue, therefore in the current design
  anything locking the fence should then also hold a ref to the queue to prevent the queue from
  being freed.  However, currently it looks like we signal the fence and then drop the queue
  ref, but if something is waiting on the fence, the waiter is kicked to wake up at some later
  point, where upon waking up it first grabs the lock before checking the fence state. But if
  we have already dropped the queue ref, then the lock might already be freed as part of the
  queue, leading to uaf.  To prevent this, move the fence lock into the fence itself so we don''t
  run into lifetime issues. Alternative might be to have device level lock, or only release
  the queue in the fence release callback, however that might require pushing to another worker
  to avoid locking issues.  References: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/xe/kernel/-/issues/2454
