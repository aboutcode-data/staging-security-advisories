summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rxrpc: Fix handling
  of received connection abort  Fix the handling of a connection abort that we''ve received.  Though
  the abort is at the connection level, it needs propagating to the calls on that connection.  Whilst
  the propagation bit is performed, the calls aren''t then woken up to go and process their
  termination, and as no further input is forthcoming, they just hang.  Also add some tracing
  for the logging of connection aborts.'
