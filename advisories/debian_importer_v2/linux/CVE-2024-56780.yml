summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  quota: flush
  quota_release_work upon quota writeback  One of the paths quota writeback is called from is:  freeze_super()   sync_filesystem()     ext4_sync_fs()       dquot_writeback_dquots()  Since
  we currently don''t always flush the quota_release_work queue in this path, we can end up
  with the following race:   1. dquot are added to releasing_dquots list during regular operations.  2.
  FS Freeze starts, however, this does not flush the quota_release_work queue.  3. Freeze completes.  4.
  Kernel eventually tries to flush the workqueue while FS is frozen which     hits a WARN_ON
  since transaction gets started during frozen state:    ext4_journal_check_start+0x28/0x110
  [ext4] (unreliable)   __ext4_journal_start_sb+0x64/0x1c0 [ext4]   ext4_release_dquot+0x90/0x1d0
  [ext4]   quota_release_workfn+0x43c/0x4d0  Which is the following line:    WARN_ON(sb->s_writers.frozen
  == SB_FREEZE_COMPLETE);  Which ultimately results in generic/390 failing due to dmesg noise.
  This was detected on powerpc machine 15 cores.  To avoid this, make sure to flush the workqueue
  during dquot_writeback_dquots() so we dont have any pending workitems after freeze.'
