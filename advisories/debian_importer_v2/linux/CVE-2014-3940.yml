  - CVE-2014-3940
summary: The Linux kernel through 3.14.5 does not properly consider the presence of hugetlb
  entries, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or system
  crash) by accessing certain memory locations, as demonstrated by triggering a race condition
  via numa_maps read operations during hugepage migration, related to fs/proc/task_mmu.c and
  mm/mempolicy.c.
