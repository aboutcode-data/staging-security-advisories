summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ice: add NULL
  check in eswitch lag check  The function ice_lag_is_switchdev_running() is being called from
  outside of the LAG event handler code.  This results in the lag->upper_netdev being NULL sometimes.  To
  avoid a NULL-pointer dereference, there needs to be a check before it is dereferenced.'
