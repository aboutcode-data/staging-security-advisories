summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/shmem, swap:
  fix race of truncate and swap entry split  The helper for shmem swap freeing is not handling
  the order of swap entries correctly.  It uses xa_cmpxchg_irq to erase the swap entry, but
  it gets the entry order before that using xa_get_order without lock protection, and it may
  get an outdated order value if the entry is split or changed in other ways after the xa_get_order
  and before the xa_cmpxchg_irq.  And besides, the order could grow and be larger than expected,
  and cause truncation to erase data beyond the end border.  For example, if the target entry
  and following entries are swapped in or freed, then a large folio was added in place and swapped
  out, using the same entry, the xa_cmpxchg_irq will still succeed, it''s very unlikely to happen
  though.  To fix that, open code the Xarray cmpxchg and put the order retrieval and value checking
  in the same critical section.  Also, ensure the order won''t exceed the end border, skip it
  if the entry goes across the border.  Skipping large swap entries crosses the end border is
  safe here.  Shmem truncate iterates the range twice, in the first iteration, find_lock_entries
  already filtered such entries, and shmem will swapin the entries that cross the end border
  and partially truncate the folio (split the folio or at least zero part of it).  So in the
  second loop here, if we see a swap entry that crosses the end order, it must at least have
  its content erased already.  I observed random swapoff hangs and kernel panics when stress
  testing ZSWAP with shmem.  After applying this patch, all problems are gone.'
