summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  remoteproc: qcom:
  pas: Shutdown lite ADSP DTB on X1E  The ADSP firmware on X1E has separate firmware binaries
  for the main firmware and the DTB. The same applies for the "lite" firmware loaded by the
  boot firmware.  When preparing to load the new ADSP firmware we shutdown the lite_pas_id for
  the main firmware, but we don''t shutdown the corresponding lite pas_id for the DTB. The fact
  that we''re leaving it "running" forever becomes obvious if you try to reuse (or just access)
  the memory region used by the "lite" firmware: The &adsp_boot_mem is accessible, but accessing
  the &adsp_boot_dtb_mem results in a crash.  We don''t support reusing the memory regions currently,
  but nevertheless we should not keep part of the lite firmware running. Fix this by adding
  the lite_dtb_pas_id and shutting it down as well.  We don''t have a way to detect if the lite
  firmware is actually running yet, so ignore the return status of qcom_scm_pas_shutdown() for
  now. This was already the case before, the assignment to "ret" is not used anywhere.'
