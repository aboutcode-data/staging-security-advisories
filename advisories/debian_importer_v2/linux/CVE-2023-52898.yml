summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xhci: Fix null
  pointer dereference when host dies  Make sure xhci_free_dev() and xhci_kill_endpoint_urbs()
  do not race and cause null pointer dereference when host suddenly dies.  Usb core may call
  xhci_free_dev() which frees the xhci->devs[slot_id] virt device at the same time that xhci_kill_endpoint_urbs()
  tries to loop through all the device''s endpoints, checking if there are any cancelled urbs
  left to give back.  hold the xhci spinlock while freeing the virt device'
