summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  NFSD: Avoid calling
  OPDESC() with ops->opnum == OP_ILLEGAL  OPDESC() simply indexes into nfsd4_ops[] by the op''s
  operation number, without range checking that value. It assumes callers are careful to avoid
  calling it with an out-of-bounds opnum value.  nfsd4_decode_compound() is not so careful,
  and can invoke OPDESC() with opnum set to OP_ILLEGAL, which is 10044 -- well beyond the end
  of nfsd4_ops[].'
