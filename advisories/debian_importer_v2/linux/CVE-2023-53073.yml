summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  perf/x86/amd/core:
  Always clear status for idx  The variable ''status'' (which contains the unhandled overflow
  bits) is not being properly masked in some cases, displaying the following warning:    WARNING:
  CPU: 156 PID: 475601 at arch/x86/events/amd/core.c:972 amd_pmu_v2_handle_irq+0x216/0x270  This
  seems to be happening because the loop is being continued before the status bit being unset,
  in case x86_perf_event_set_period() returns 0. This is also causing an inconsistency because
  the "handled" counter is incremented, but the status bit is not cleaned.  Move the bit cleaning
  together above, together when the "handled" counter is incremented.'
