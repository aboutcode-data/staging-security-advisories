summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/mlx5e: kTLS,
  Fix crash in RX resync flow  For the TLS RX resync flow, we maintain a list of TLS contexts
  that require some attention, to communicate their resync information to the HW. Here we fix
  list corruptions, by protecting the entries against movements coming from resync_handle_seq_match(),
  until their resync handling in napi is fully completed.'
