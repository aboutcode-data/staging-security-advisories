summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/tdx: Fix
  data leak in mmio_read()  The mmio_read() function makes a TDVMCALL to retrieve MMIO data
  for an address from the VMM.  Sean noticed that mmio_read() unintentionally exposes the value
  of an initialized variable (val) on the stack to the VMM.  This variable is only needed as
  an output value. It did not need to be passed to the VMM in the first place.  Do not send
  the original value of *val to the VMM.  [ dhansen: clarify what ''val'' is used for. ]'
