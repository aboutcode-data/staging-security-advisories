summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gfs2: Fix possible
  data races in gfs2_show_options()  Some fields such as gt_logd_secs of the struct gfs2_tune
  are accessed without holding the lock gt_spin in gfs2_show_options():    val = sdp->sd_tune.gt_logd_secs;   if
  (val != 30)     seq_printf(s, ",commit=%d", val);  And thus can cause data races when gfs2_show_options()
  and other functions such as gfs2_reconfigure() are concurrently executed:    spin_lock(&gt->gt_spin);   gt->gt_logd_secs
  = newargs->ar_commit;  To fix these possible data races, the lock sdp->sd_tune.gt_spin is
  acquired before accessing the fields of gfs2_tune and released after these accesses.  Further
  changes by Andreas:  - Don''t hold the spin lock over the seq_printf operations.'
