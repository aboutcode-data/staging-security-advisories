summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scs: fix a wrong
  parameter in __scs_magic  __scs_magic() needs a ''void *'' variable, but a ''struct task_struct
  *'' is given.  ''task_scs(tsk)'' is the starting address of the task''s shadow call stack,
  and ''__scs_magic(task_scs(tsk))'' is the end address of the task''s shadow call stack.  Here
  should be ''__scs_magic(task_scs(tsk))''.  The user-visible effect of this bug is that when
  CONFIG_DEBUG_STACK_USAGE is enabled, the shadow call stack usage checking function (scs_check_usage)
  would scan an incorrect memory range.  This could lead  1. **Inaccurate stack usage reporting**:
  The function would calculate    wrong usage statistics for the shadow call stack, potentially
  showing    incorrect value in kmsg.  2. **Potential kernel crash**: If the value of __scs_magic(tsk)is    greater
  than that of __scs_magic(task_scs(tsk)), the for loop may    access unmapped memory, potentially
  causing a kernel panic.  However,    this scenario is unlikely because task_struct is allocated
  via the slab    allocator (which typically returns lower addresses), while the shadow    call
  stack returned by task_scs(tsk) is allocated via vmalloc(which    typically returns higher
  addresses).  However, since this is purely a debugging feature (CONFIG_DEBUG_STACK_USAGE),
  normal production systems should be not unaffected.  The bug only impacts developers and testers
  who are actively debugging stack usage with this configuration enabled.'
