summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/vmwgfx: Remove
  rcu locks from user resources  User resource lookups used rcu to avoid two extra atomics.
  Unfortunately the rcu paths were buggy and it was easy to make the driver crash by submitting
  command buffers from two different threads. Because the lookups never show up in performance
  profiles replace them with a regular spin lock which fixes the races in accesses to those
  shared resources.  Fixes kernel oops''es in IGT''s vmwgfx execution_buffer stress test and
  seen crashes with apps using shared resources.'
