aliases:
  - CVE-2018-19854
summary: 'An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.19.3. crypto_report_one() and
  related functions in crypto/crypto_user.c (the crypto user configuration API) do not fully
  initialize structures that are copied to userspace, potentially leaking sensitive memory to
  user programs. NOTE: this is a CVE-2013-2547 regression but with easier exploitability because
  the attacker does not need a capability (however, the system must have the CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER
  kconfig option).'
