summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mmc: via-sdmmc:
  fix return value check of mmc_add_host()  mmc_add_host() may return error, if we ignore its
  return value, it will lead two issues: 1. The memory that allocated in mmc_alloc_host() is
  leaked. 2. In the remove() path, mmc_remove_host() will be called to    delete device, but
  it''s not added yet, it will lead a kernel    crash because of null-ptr-deref in device_del().  Fix
  this by checking the return value and goto error path which will call mmc_free_host().'
