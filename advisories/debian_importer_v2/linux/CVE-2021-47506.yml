summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfsd: fix use-after-free
  due to delegation race  A delegation break could arrive as soon as we''ve called vfs_setlease.  A
  delegation break runs a callback which immediately (in nfsd4_cb_recall_prepare) adds the delegation
  to del_recall_lru.  If we then exit nfs4_set_delegation without hashing the delegation, it
  will be freed as soon as the callback is done with it, without ever being removed from del_recall_lru.  Symptoms
  show up later as use-after-free or list corruption warnings, usually in the laundromat thread.  I
  suspect aba2072f4523 "nfsd: grant read delegations to clients holding writes" made this bug
  easier to hit, but I looked as far back as v3.0 and it looks to me it already had the same
  problem.  So I''m not sure where the bug was introduced; it may have been there from the beginning.'
