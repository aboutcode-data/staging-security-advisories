summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: mediatek:
  vcodec: Use spinlock for context list protection lock  Previously a mutex was added to protect
  the encoder and decoder context lists from unexpected changes originating from the SCP IP
  block, causing the context pointer to go invalid, resulting in a NULL pointer dereference
  in the IPI handler.  Turns out on the MT8173, the VPU IPI handler is called from hard IRQ
  context. This causes a big warning from the scheduler. This was first reported downstream
  on the ChromeOS kernels, but is also reproducible on mainline using Fluster with the FFmpeg
  v4l2m2m decoders. Even though the actual capture format is not supported, the affected code
  paths are triggered.  Since this lock just protects the context list and operations on it
  are very fast, it should be OK to switch to a spinlock.'
