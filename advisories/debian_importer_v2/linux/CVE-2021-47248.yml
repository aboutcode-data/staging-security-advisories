summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  udp: fix race
  between close() and udp_abort()  Kaustubh reported and diagnosed a panic in udp_lib_lookup().
  The root cause is udp_abort() racing with close(). Both racing functions acquire the socket
  lock, but udp{v6}_destroy_sock() release it before performing destructive actions.  We can''t
  easily extend the socket lock scope to avoid the race, instead use the SOCK_DEAD flag to prevent
  udp_abort from doing any action when the critical race happens.  Diagnosed-and-tested-by:
  Kaustubh Pandey <kapandey@codeaurora.org>'
