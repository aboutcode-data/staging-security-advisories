summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: qgroup:
  fix quota root leak after quota disable failure  If during the quota disable we fail when
  cleaning the quota tree or when deleting the root from the root tree, we jump to the ''out''
  label without ever dropping the reference on the quota root, resulting in a leak of the root
  since fs_info->quota_root is no longer pointing to the root (we have set it to NULL just before
  those steps).  Fix this by always doing a btrfs_put_root() call under the ''out'' label. This
  is a problem that exists since qgroups were first added in 2012 by commit bed92eae26cc ("Btrfs:
  qgroup implementation and prototypes"), but back then we missed a kfree on the quota root
  and free_extent_buffer() calls on its root and commit root nodes, since back then roots were
  not yet reference counted.'
