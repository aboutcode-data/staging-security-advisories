  the reference count of the first                          phy_device is 4, others are 3     register_netdev   <-
  fault inject succeeded, goto error handling path      // error handling path     err_out_mdio_unregister:       mdiobus_unregister(lp->mii_bus);     err_out_mdio:       mdiobus_free(lp->mii_bus);    <-
  the reference count of the first                                        phy_device is 1, it
  is not released                                        and other phy_devices are released   //
  similarly, the remove process also has the same problem  The root cause is traced to the phy_device
  is not disconnected when removes one r6040 device in r6040_remove_one() or on error handling
  path after r6040_mii probed successfully. In r6040_mii_probe(), a net ethernet device is connected
  to the first PHY device of mii_bus, in order to notify the connected driver when the link
  status changes, which is the default behavior of the PHY infrastructure to handle everything.
  Therefore the phy_device should be disconnected when removes one r6040 device or on error
  handling path.  Fix it by adding phy_disconnect() when removes one r6040 device or on error
  handling path after r6040_mii probed successfully.'
