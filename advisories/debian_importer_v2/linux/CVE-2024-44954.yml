summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: line6:
  Fix racy access to midibuf  There can be concurrent accesses to line6 midibuf from both the
  URB completion callback and the rawmidi API access.  This could be a cause of KMSAN warning
  triggered by syzkaller below (so put as reported-by here).  This patch protects the midibuf
  call of the former code path with a spinlock for avoiding the possible races.'
