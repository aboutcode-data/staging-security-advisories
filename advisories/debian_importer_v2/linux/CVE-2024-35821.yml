  - CVE-2024-35821
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ubifs: Set page
  uptodate in the correct place  Page cache reads are lockless, so setting the freshly allocated
  page uptodate before we''ve overwritten it with the data it''s supposed to have in it will
  allow a simultaneous reader to see old data.  Move the call to SetPageUptodate into ubifs_write_end(),
  which is after we copied the new data into the page.'
