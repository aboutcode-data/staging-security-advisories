summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: qat -
  ADF_STATUS_PF_RUNNING should be set after adf_dev_init  ADF_STATUS_PF_RUNNING is (only) used
  and checked by adf_vf2pf_shutdown() before calling adf_iov_putmsg()->mutex_lock(vf2pf_lock),
  however the vf2pf_lock is initialized in adf_dev_init(), which can fail and when it fail,
  the vf2pf_lock is either not initialized or destroyed, a subsequent use of vf2pf_lock will
  cause issue. To fix this issue, only set this flag if adf_dev_init() returns 0.  [    7.178404]
