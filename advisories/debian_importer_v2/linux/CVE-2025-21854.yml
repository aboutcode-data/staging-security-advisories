summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sockmap, vsock:
  For connectible sockets allow only connected  sockmap expects all vsocks to have a transport
  assigned, which is expressed in vsock_proto::psock_update_sk_prot(). However, there is an
  edge case where an unconnected (connectible) socket may lose its previously assigned transport.
  This is handled with a NULL check in the vsock/BPF recv path.  Another design detail is that
  listening vsocks are not supposed to have any transport assigned at all. Which implies they
  are not supported by the sockmap. But this is complicated by the fact that a socket, before
  switching to TCP_LISTEN, may have had some transport assigned during a failed connect() attempt.
  Hence, we may end up with a listening vsock in a sockmap, which blows up quickly:  KASAN:

  connectible sockets, instead of relying solely on the state of vsk->transport, tell sockmap
  to only allow those representing established connections. This aligns with the behaviour for
  AF_INET and AF_UNIX.'
