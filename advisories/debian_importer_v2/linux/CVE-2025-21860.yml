summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/zswap: fix\
  \ inconsistency when zswap_store_page() fails  Commit b7c0ccdfbafd (\"mm: zswap: support large\
  \ folios in zswap_store()\") skips charging any zswap entries when it failed to zswap the\
  \ entire folio.  However, when some base pages are zswapped but it failed to zswap the entire\
  \ folio, the zswap operation is rolled back.  When freeing zswap entries for those pages,\
  \ zswap_entry_free() uncharges the zswap entries that were not previously charged, causing\
  \ zswap charging to become inconsistent.  This inconsistency triggers two warnings with following\
  \ steps:   # On a machine with 64GiB of RAM and 36GiB of zswap   $ stress-ng --bigheap 2 #\
  \ wait until the OOM-killer kills stress-ng   $ sudo reboot    The two warnings are:     in\
  \ mm/memcontrol.c:163, function obj_cgroup_release():       WARN_ON_ONCE(nr_bytes & (PAGE_SIZE\
  \ - 1));      in mm/page_counter.c:60, function page_counter_cancel():       if (WARN_ONCE(new\
  \ < 0, \"page_counter underflow: %ld nr_pages=%lu\\n\", \t  new, nr_pages))  zswap_stored_pages\
  \ also becomes inconsistent in the same way.  As suggested by Kanchana, increment zswap_stored_pages\
  \ and charge zswap entries within zswap_store_page() when it succeeds.  This way, zswap_entry_free()\
  \ will decrement the counter and uncharge the entries when it failed to zswap the entire folio.\
  \  While this could potentially be optimized by batching objcg charging and incrementing the\
  \ counter, let's focus on fixing the bug this time and leave the optimization for later after\
  \ some evaluation.  After resolving the inconsistency, the warnings disappear.  [42.hyeyoo@gmail.com:\
