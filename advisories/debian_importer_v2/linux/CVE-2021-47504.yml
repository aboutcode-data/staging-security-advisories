  - CVE-2021-47504
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring: ensure
  task_work gets run as part of cancelations  If we successfully cancel a work item but that
  work item needs to be processed through task_work, then we can be sleeping uninterruptibly
  in io_uring_cancel_generic() and never process it. Hence we don''t make forward progress and
  we end up with an uninterruptible sleep warning.  While in there, correct a comment that should
  be IFF, not IIF.'
