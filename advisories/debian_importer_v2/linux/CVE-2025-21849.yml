summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/i915/gt:
  Use spin_lock_irqsave() in interruptible context  spin_lock/unlock() functions used in interrupt
  contexts could result in a deadlock, as seen in GitLab issue #13399, which occurs when interrupt
  comes in while holding a lock.  Try to remedy the problem by saving irq state before spin
  lock acquisition.  v2: add irqs'' state save/restore calls to all locks/unlocks in  signal_irq_work()
  execution (Maciej)  v3: use with spin_lock_irqsave() in guc_lrc_desc_unpin() instead  of other
  lock/unlock calls and add Fixes and Cc tags (Tvrtko);  change title and commit message  (cherry
  picked from commit c088387ddd6482b40f21ccf23db1125e8fa4af7e)'
