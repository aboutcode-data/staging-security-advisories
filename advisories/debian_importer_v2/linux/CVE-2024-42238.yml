  - CVE-2024-42238
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  firmware: cs_dsp:
  Return error if block header overflows file  Return an error from cs_dsp_power_up() if a block
  header is longer than the amount of data left in the file.  The previous code in cs_dsp_load()
  and cs_dsp_load_coeff() would loop while there was enough data left in the file for a valid
  region. This protected against overrunning the end of the file data, but it didn''t abort
  the file processing with an error.'
