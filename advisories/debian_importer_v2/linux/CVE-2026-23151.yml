summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: MGMT:
  Fix memory leak in set_ssp_complete  Fix memory leak in set_ssp_complete() where mgmt_pending_cmd
  structures are not freed after being removed from the pending list.  Commit 302a1f674c00 ("Bluetooth:
  MGMT: Fix possible UAFs") replaced mgmt_pending_foreach() calls with individual command handling
  but missed adding mgmt_pending_free() calls in both error and success paths of set_ssp_complete().
  Other completion functions like set_le_complete() were fixed correctly in the same commit.  This
  causes a memory leak of the mgmt_pending_cmd structure and its associated parameter data for
  each SSP command that completes.  Add the missing mgmt_pending_free(cmd) calls in both code
  paths to fix the memory leak. Also fix the same issue in set_advertising_complete().'
