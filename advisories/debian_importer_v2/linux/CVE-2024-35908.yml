summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tls: get psock
  ref after taking rxlock to avoid leak  At the start of tls_sw_recvmsg, we take a reference
  on the psock, and then call tls_rx_reader_lock. If that fails, we return directly without
  releasing the reference.  Instead of adding a new label, just take the reference after locking
  has succeeded, since we don''t need it before.'
