summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/fpu: Fix
  NULL dereference in avx512_status()  Problem ------- With CONFIG_X86_DEBUG_FPU enabled, reading
  /proc/[kthread]/arch_status causes a warning and a NULL pointer dereference.  This is because
  the AVX-512 timestamp code uses x86_task_fpu() but doesn''t check it for NULL. CONFIG_X86_DEBUG_FPU
  addles that function for kernel threads (PF_KTHREAD specifically), making it return NULL.  The
  point of the warning was to ensure that kernel threads only access task->fpu after going through
  kernel_fpu_begin()/_end(). Note: all kernel tasks exposed in /proc have a valid task->fpu.  Solution
  -------- One option is to silence the warning and check for NULL from x86_task_fpu(). However,
  that warning is fairly fresh and seems like a defense against misuse of the FPU state in kernel
  threads.  Instead, stop outputting AVX-512_elapsed_ms for kernel threads altogether. The data
  was garbage anyway because avx512_timestamp is only updated for user threads, not kernel threads.  If
  anyone ever wants to track kernel thread AVX-512 use, they can come back later and do it properly,
  separate from this bug fix.  [ dhansen: mostly rewrite changelog ]'
