summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfsd: fix NULL
  dereference in nfs3svc_encode_getaclres  In error cases the dentry may be NULL.  Before 20798dfe249a,
  the encoder also checked dentry and d_really_is_positive(dentry), but that looks like overkill
  to me--zero status should be enough to guarantee a positive dentry.  This isn''t the first
  time we''ve seen an error-case NULL dereference hidden in the initialization of a local variable
  in an xdr encoder.  But I went back through the other recent rewrites and didn''t spot any
  similar bugs.'
