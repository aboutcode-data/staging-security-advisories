summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring: prevent
  reg-wait speculations  With *ENTER_EXT_ARG_REG instead of passing a user pointer with arguments
  for the waiting loop the user can specify an offset into a pre-mapped region of memory, in
  which case the [offset, offset + sizeof(io_uring_reg_wait)) will be intepreted as the argument.  As
  we address a kernel array using a user given index, it''d be a subject to speculation type
  of exploits. Use array_index_nospec() to prevent that. Make sure to pass not the full region
  size but truncate by the maximum offset allowed considering the structure size.'
