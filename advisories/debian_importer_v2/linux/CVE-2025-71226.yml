summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: iwlwifi:
  Implement settime64 as stub for MVM/MLD PTP  Since commit dfb073d32cac ("ptp: Return -EINVAL
  on ptp_clock_register if required ops are NULL"), PTP clock registered through ptp_clock_register
  is required to have ptp_clock_info.settime64 set, however, neither MVM nor MLD''s PTP clock
  implementation sets it, resulting in warnings when the interface starts up, like  WARNING:
  drivers/ptp/ptp_clock.c:325 at ptp_clock_register+0x2c8/0x6b8, CPU#1: wpa_supplicant/469 CPU:
  1 UID: 0 PID: 469 Comm: wpa_supplicant Not tainted 6.18.0+ #101 PREEMPT(full) ra: ffff800002732cd4
  iwl_mvm_ptp_init+0x114/0x188 [iwlmvm] ERA: 9000000002fdc468 ptp_clock_register+0x2c8/0x6b8
  iwlwifi 0000:01:00.0: Failed to register PHC clock (-22)  I don''t find an appropriate firmware
  interface to implement settime64() for iwlwifi MLD/MVM, thus instead create a stub that returns
  -EOPTNOTSUPP only, suppressing the warning and allowing the PTP clock to be registered.'
