summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/kvm: Teardown
  PV features on boot CPU as well  Various PV features (Async PF, PV EOI, steal time) work through
  memory shared with hypervisor and when we restore from hibernation we must properly teardown
  all these features to make sure hypervisor doesn''t write to stale locations after we jump
  to the previously hibernated kernel (which can try to place anything there). For secondary
  CPUs the job is already done by kvm_cpu_down_prepare(), register syscore ops to do the same
  for boot CPU.'
