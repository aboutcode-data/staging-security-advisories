summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  flex_proportions:\
  \ make fprop_new_period() hardirq safe  Bernd has reported a lockdep splat from flexible proportions\
  \ code that is essentially complaining about the following race:  <timer fires> run_timer_softirq\
  \ - we are in softirq context   call_timer_fn     writeout_period       fprop_new_period \
  \        write_seqcount_begin(&p->sequence);          <hardirq is raised>         ...    \
  \     blk_mq_end_request() \t  blk_update_request() \t    ext4_end_bio() \t      folio_end_writeback()\
  \ \t\t__wb_writeout_add() \t\t  __fprop_add_percpu_max() \t\t    if (unlikely(max_frac < FPROP_FRAC_BASE))\
  \ { \t\t      fprop_fraction_percpu() \t\t\tseq = read_seqcount_begin(&p->sequence); \t\t\t\
  \  - sees odd sequence so loops indefinitely  Note that a deadlock like this is only possible\
  \ if the bdi has configured maximum fraction of writeout throughput which is very rare in\
  \ general but frequent for example for FUSE bdis.  To fix this problem we have to make sure\
  \ write section of the sequence counter is irqsafe."
