summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: cfg80211:
  cancel wiphy_work before freeing wiphy  A wiphy_work can be queued from the moment the wiphy
  is allocated and initialized (i.e. wiphy_new_nm). When a wiphy_work is queued, the rdev::wiphy_work
  is getting queued.  If wiphy_free is called before the rdev::wiphy_work had a chance to run,
  the wiphy memory will be freed, and then when it eventally gets to run it''ll use invalid
  memory.  Fix this by canceling the work before freeing the wiphy.'
