summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nvme-tcp: fix
  potential memory corruption in nvme_tcp_recv_pdu()  nvme_tcp_recv_pdu() doesn''t check the
  validity of the header length. When header digests are enabled, a target might send a packet
  with an invalid header length (e.g. 255), causing nvme_tcp_verify_hdgst() to access memory
  outside the allocated area and cause memory corruptions by overwriting it with the calculated
  digest.  Fix this by rejecting packets with an unexpected header length.'
