  - CVE-2018-16885
summary: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel that allows the userspace to call memcpy_fromiovecend()
  and similar functions with a zero offset and buffer length which causes the read beyond the
  buffer boundaries, in certain cases causing a memory access fault and a system halt by accessing
  invalid memory address. This issue only affects kernel version 3.10.x as shipped with Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 7.
