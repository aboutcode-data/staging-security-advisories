  - CVE-2019-10125
summary: An issue was discovered in aio_poll() in fs/aio.c in the Linux kernel through 5.0.4.
  A file may be released by aio_poll_wake() if an expected event is triggered immediately (e.g.,
  by the close of a pair of pipes) after the return of vfs_poll(), and this will cause a use-after-free.
