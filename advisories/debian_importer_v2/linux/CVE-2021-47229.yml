summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PCI: aardvark:
  Fix kernel panic during PIO transfer  Trying to start a new PIO transfer by writing value
  0 in PIO_START register when previous transfer has not yet completed (which is indicated by
  value 1 in PIO_START) causes an External Abort on CPU, which results in kernel panic:      SError
  Interrupt on CPU0, code 0xbf000002 -- SError     Kernel panic - not syncing: Asynchronous
  SError Interrupt  To prevent kernel panic, it is required to reject a new PIO transfer when
  previous one has not finished yet.  If previous PIO transfer is not finished yet, the kernel
  may issue a new PIO request only if the previous PIO transfer timed out.  In the past the
  root cause of this issue was incorrectly identified (as it often happens during link retraining
  or after link down event) and special hack was implemented in Trusted Firmware to catch all
  SError events in EL3, to ignore errors with code 0xbf000002 and not forwarding any other errors
  to kernel and instead throw panic from EL3 Trusted Firmware handler.  Links to discussion
  and patches about this issue: https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a.git/commit/?id=3c7dcdac5c50

  https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/1541  But the real cause was
  the fact that during link retraining or after link down event the PIO transfer may take longer
  time, up to the 1.44s until it times out. This increased probability that a new PIO transfer
  would be issued by kernel while previous one has not finished yet.  After applying this change
  into the kernel, it is possible to revert the mentioned TF-A hack and SError events do not
  have to be caught in TF-A EL3.'
