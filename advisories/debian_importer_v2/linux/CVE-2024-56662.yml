summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  acpi: nfit: vmalloc-out-of-bounds
  Read in acpi_nfit_ctl  Fix an issue detected by syzbot with KASAN:  BUG: KASAN: vmalloc-out-of-bounds
  in cmd_to_func drivers/acpi/nfit/ core.c:416 [inline] BUG: KASAN: vmalloc-out-of-bounds in
  acpi_nfit_ctl+0x20e8/0x24a0 drivers/acpi/nfit/core.c:459  The issue occurs in cmd_to_func
  when the call_pkg->nd_reserved2 array is accessed without verifying that call_pkg points to
  a buffer that is appropriately sized as a struct nd_cmd_pkg. This can lead to out-of-bounds
  access and undefined behavior if the buffer does not have sufficient space.  To address this,
  a check was added in acpi_nfit_ctl() to ensure that buf is not NULL and that buf_len is less
  than sizeof(*call_pkg) before accessing it. This ensures safe access to the members of call_pkg,
  including the nd_reserved2 array.'
