summary: Linux kernel 2.4 and 2.6 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion
  and panic) by creating a large number of connected file descriptors or socketpairs and setting
  a large data transfer buffer, then preventing Linux from being able to finish the transfer
  by causing the process to become a zombie, or closing the file descriptor without closing
  an associated reference.
