  - CVE-2015-8543
summary: The networking implementation in the Linux kernel through 4.3.3, as used in Android
  and other products, does not validate protocol identifiers for certain protocol families,
  which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL function pointer dereference and
  system crash) or possibly gain privileges by leveraging CLONE_NEWUSER support to execute a
  crafted SOCK_RAW application.
