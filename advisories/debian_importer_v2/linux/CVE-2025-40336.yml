summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/gpusvm: fix
  hmm_pfn_to_map_order() usage  Handle the case where the hmm range partially covers a huge
  page (like 2M), otherwise we can potentially end up doing something nasty like mapping memory
  which is outside the range, and maybe not even mapped by the mm. Fix is based on the xe userptr
  code, which in a future patch will directly use gpusvm, so needs alignment here.  v2:   -
  Add kernel-doc (Matt B)   - s/fls/ilog2/ (Thomas)'
