summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: ipu3-imgu:
  Fix NULL pointer dereference in active selection access  What the IMGU driver did was that
  it first acquired the pointers to active and try V4L2 subdev state, and only then figured
  out which one to use.  The problem with that approach and a later patch (see Fixes: tag) is
  that as sd_state argument to v4l2_subdev_get_try_crop() et al is NULL, there is now an attempt
  to dereference that.  Fix this.  Also rewrap lines a little.'
