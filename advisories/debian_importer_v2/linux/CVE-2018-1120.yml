  - CVE-2018-1120
summary: A flaw was found affecting the Linux kernel before version 4.17. By mmap()ing a FUSE-backed
  file onto a process's memory containing command line arguments (or environment strings), an
  attacker can cause utilities from psutils or procps (such as ps, w) or any other program which
  makes a read() call to the /proc/<pid>/cmdline (or /proc/<pid>/environ) files to block indefinitely
  (denial of service) or for some controlled time (as a synchronization primitive for other
  attacks).
