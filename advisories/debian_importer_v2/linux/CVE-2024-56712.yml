summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  udmabuf: fix
  memory leak on last export_udmabuf() error path  In export_udmabuf(), if dma_buf_fd() fails
  because the FD table is full, a dma_buf owning the udmabuf has already been created; but the
  error handling in udmabuf_create() will tear down the udmabuf without doing anything about
  the containing dma_buf.  This leaves a dma_buf in memory that contains a dangling pointer;
  though that doesn''t seem to lead to anything bad except a memory leak.  Fix it by moving
  the dma_buf_fd() call out of export_udmabuf() so that we can give it different error handling.  Note
  that the shape of this code changed a lot in commit 5e72b2b41a21 ("udmabuf: convert udmabuf
  driver to use folios"); but the memory leak seems to have existed since the introduction of
  udmabuf.'
