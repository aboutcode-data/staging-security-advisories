aliases:
  - CVE-2020-8835
summary: In the Linux kernel 5.5.0 and newer, the bpf verifier (kernel/bpf/verifier.c) did not
  properly restrict the register bounds for 32-bit operations, leading to out-of-bounds reads
  and writes in kernel memory. The vulnerability also affects the Linux 5.4 stable series, starting
  with v5.4.7, as the introducing commit was backported to that branch. This vulnerability was
  fixed in 5.6.1, 5.5.14, and 5.4.29. (issue is aka ZDI-CAN-10780)
