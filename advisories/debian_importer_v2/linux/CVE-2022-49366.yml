summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ksmbd: fix reference
  count leak in smb_check_perm_dacl()  The issue happens in a specific path in smb_check_perm_dacl().
  When "id" and "uid" have the same value, the function simply jumps out of the loop without
  decrementing the reference count of the object "posix_acls", which is increased by get_acl()
  earlier. This may result in memory leaks.  Fix it by decreasing the reference count of "posix_acls"
  before jumping to label "check_access_bits".'
