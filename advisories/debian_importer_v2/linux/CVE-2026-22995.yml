summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ublk: fix use-after-free
  in ublk_partition_scan_work  A race condition exists between the async partition scan work
  and device teardown that can lead to a use-after-free of ub->ub_disk:  1. ublk_ctrl_start_dev()
  schedules partition_scan_work after add_disk() 2. ublk_stop_dev() calls ublk_stop_dev_unlocked()
  which does:    - del_gendisk(ub->ub_disk)    - ublk_detach_disk() sets ub->ub_disk = NULL    -
  put_disk() which may free the disk 3. The worker ublk_partition_scan_work() then dereferences
  ub->ub_disk    leading to UAF  Fix this by using ublk_get_disk()/ublk_put_disk() in the worker
  to hold a reference to the disk during the partition scan. The spinlock in ublk_get_disk()
  synchronizes with ublk_detach_disk() ensuring the worker either gets a valid reference or
  sees NULL and exits early.  Also change flush_work() to cancel_work_sync() to avoid running
  the partition scan work unnecessarily when the disk is already detached.'
