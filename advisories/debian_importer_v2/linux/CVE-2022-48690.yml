summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ice: Fix DMA\
  \ mappings leak  Fix leak, when user changes ring parameters. During reallocation of RX buffers,\
  \ new DMA mappings are created for those buffers. New buffers with different RX ring count\
  \ should substitute older ones, but those buffers were freed in ice_vsi_cfg_rxq and reallocated\
  \ again with ice_alloc_rx_buf. kfree on rx_buf caused leak of already mapped DMA. Reallocate\
  \ ZC with xdp_buf struct, when BPF program loads. Reallocate back to rx_buf, when BPF program\
  \ unloads. If BPF program is loaded/unloaded and XSK pools are created, reallocate RX queues\
  \ accordingly in XDP_SETUP_XSK_POOL handler.  Steps for reproduction: while : do \tfor ((i=0;\
  \ i<=8160; i=i+32)) \tdo \t\tethtool -G enp130s0f0 rx $i tx $i \t\tsleep 0.5 \t\tethtool -g\
  \ enp130s0f0 \tdone done"
