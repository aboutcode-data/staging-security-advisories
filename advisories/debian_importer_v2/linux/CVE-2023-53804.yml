summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix use-after-free
  bug of nilfs_root in nilfs_evict_inode()  During unmount process of nilfs2, nothing holds
  nilfs_root structure after nilfs2 detaches its writer in nilfs_detach_log_writer().  However,
  since nilfs_evict_inode() uses nilfs_root for some cleanup operations, it may cause use-after-free
  read if inodes are left in "garbage_list" and released by nilfs_dispose_list() at the end
  of nilfs_detach_log_writer().  Fix this issue by modifying nilfs_evict_inode() to only clear
  inode without additional metadata changes that use nilfs_root if the file system is degraded
  to read-only or the writer is detached.'
