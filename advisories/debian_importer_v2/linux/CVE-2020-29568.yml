  - CVE-2020-29568
summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Some OSes (such as Linux, FreeBSD, and
  NetBSD) are processing watch events using a single thread. If the events are received faster
  than the thread is able to handle, they will get queued. As the queue is unbounded, a guest
  may be able to trigger an OOM in the backend. All systems with a FreeBSD, Linux, or NetBSD
  (any version) dom0 are vulnerable.
