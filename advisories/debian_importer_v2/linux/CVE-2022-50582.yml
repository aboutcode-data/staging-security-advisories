summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  regulator: core:
  Prevent integer underflow  By using a ratio of delay to poll_enabled_time that is not integer
  time_remaining underflows and does not exit the loop as expected. As delay could be derived
  from DT and poll_enabled_time is defined in the driver this can easily happen.  Use a signed
  iterator to make sure that the loop exits once the remaining time is negative.'
