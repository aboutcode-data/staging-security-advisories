summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: fix removing
  a namespace with conflicting altnames  Mark reports a BUG() when a net namespace is removed.      kernel
  BUG at net/core/dev.c:11520!  Physical interfaces moved outside of init_net get "refunded"
  to init_net when that namespace disappears. The main interface name may get overwritten in
  the process if it would have conflicted. We need to also discard all conflicting altnames.
  Recent fixes addressed ensuring that altnames get moved with the main interface, which surfaced
  this problem.'
