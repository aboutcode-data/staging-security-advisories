summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iio: adc: ad4851:
  fix ad4858 chan pointer handling  The pointer returned from ad4851_parse_channels_common()
  is incremented internally as each channel is populated. In ad4858_parse_channels(), the same
  pointer was further incremented while setting ext_scan_type fields for each channel. This
  resulted in indio_dev->channels being set to a pointer past the end of the allocated array,
  potentially causing memory corruption or undefined behavior.  Fix this by iterating over the
  channels using an explicit index instead of incrementing the pointer. This preserves the original
  base pointer and ensures all channel metadata is set correctly.'
