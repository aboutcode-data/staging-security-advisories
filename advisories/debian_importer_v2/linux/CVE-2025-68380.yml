summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath11k:\
  \ fix peer HE MCS assignment  In ath11k_wmi_send_peer_assoc_cmd(), peer's transmit MCS is\
  \ sent to firmware as receive MCS while peer's receive MCS sent as transmit MCS, which goes\
  \ against firmwire's definition.  While connecting to a misbehaved AP that advertises 0xffff\
  \ (meaning not supported) for 160 MHz transmit MCS map, firmware crashes due to 0xffff is\
  \ assigned to he_mcs->rx_mcs_set field.  \tExt Tag: HE Capabilities \t    [...] \t    Supported\
  \ HE-MCS and NSS Set \t\t[...] \t        Rx and Tx MCS Maps 160 MHz \t\t    [...] \t     \
  \       Tx HE-MCS Map 160 MHz: 0xffff  Swap the assignment to fix this issue.  As the HE rate\
  \ control mask is meant to limit our own transmit MCS, it needs to go via he_mcs->rx_mcs_set\
  \ field. With the aforementioned swapping done, change is needed as well to apply it to the\
  \ peer's receive MCS.  Tested-on: WCN6855 hw2.1 PCI WLAN.HSP.1.1-03125-QCAHSPSWPL_V1_V2_SILICONZ_LITE-3.6510.41\
  \ Tested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.4.1-00199-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1"
