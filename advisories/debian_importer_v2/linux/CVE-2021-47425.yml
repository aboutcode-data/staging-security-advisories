summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i2c: acpi: fix
  resource leak in reconfiguration device addition  acpi_i2c_find_adapter_by_handle() calls
  bus_find_device() which takes a reference on the adapter which is never released which will
  result in a reference count leak and render the adapter unremovable.  Make sure to put the
  adapter after creating the client in the same manner that we do for OF.  [wsa: fixed title]'
