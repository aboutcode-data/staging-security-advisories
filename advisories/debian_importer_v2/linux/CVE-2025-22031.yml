summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PCI/bwctrl: Fix
  NULL pointer dereference on bus number exhaustion  When BIOS neglects to assign bus numbers
  to PCI bridges, the kernel attempts to correct that during PCI device enumeration.  If it
  runs out of bus numbers, no pci_bus is allocated and the "subordinate" pointer in the bridge''s
  pci_dev remains NULL.  The PCIe bandwidth controller erroneously does not check for a NULL
  subordinate pointer and dereferences it on probe.  Bandwidth control of unusable devices below
  the bridge is of questionable utility, so simply error out instead.  This mirrors what PCIe
  hotplug does since commit 62e4492c3063 ("PCI: Prevent NULL dereference during pciehp probe").  The
  PCI core emits a message with KERN_INFO severity if it has run out of bus numbers.  PCIe hotplug
  emits an additional message with KERN_ERR severity to inform the user that hotplug functionality
  is disabled at the bridge.  A similar message for bandwidth control does not seem merited,
  given that its only purpose so far is to expose an up-to-date link speed in sysfs and throttle
  the link speed on certain laptops with limited Thermal Design Power.  So error out silently.  User-visible
  messages:    pci 0000:16:02.0: bridge configuration invalid ([bus 00-00]), reconfiguring   [...]   pci_bus
