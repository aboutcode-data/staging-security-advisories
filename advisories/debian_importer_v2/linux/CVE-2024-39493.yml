summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: qat -
  Fix ADF_DEV_RESET_SYNC memory leak  Using completion_done to determine whether the caller
  has gone away only works after a complete call.  Furthermore it''s still possible that the
  caller has not yet called wait_for_completion, resulting in another potential UAF.  Fix this
  by making the caller use cancel_work_sync and then freeing the memory safely.'
