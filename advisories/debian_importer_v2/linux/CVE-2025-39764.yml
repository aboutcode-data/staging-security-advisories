  - CVE-2025-39764
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: ctnetlink:
  remove refcounting in expectation dumpers  Same pattern as previous patch: do not keep the
  expectation object alive via refcount, only store a cookie value and then use that as the
  skip hint for dump resumption.  AFAICS this has the same issue as the one resolved in the
  conntrack dumper, when we do   if (!refcount_inc_not_zero(&exp->use))  to increment the refcount,
  there is a chance that exp == last, which causes a double-increment of the refcount and subsequent
  memory leak.'
