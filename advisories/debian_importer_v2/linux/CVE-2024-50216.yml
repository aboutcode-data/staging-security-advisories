summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xfs: fix finding
  a last resort AG in xfs_filestream_pick_ag  When the main loop in xfs_filestream_pick_ag fails
  to find a suitable AG it tries to just pick the online AG.  But the loop for that uses args->pag
  as loop iterator while the later code expects pag to be set.  Fix this by reusing the max_pag
  case for this last resort, and also add a check for impossible case of no AG just to make
  sure that the uninitialized pag doesn''t even escape in theory.'
