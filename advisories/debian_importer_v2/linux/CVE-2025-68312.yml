summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usbnet: Prevents
  free active kevent  The root cause of this issue are: 1. When probing the usbnet device, executing
  usbnet_link_change(dev, 0, 0); put the kevent work in global workqueue. However, the kevent
  has not yet been scheduled when the usbnet device is unregistered. Therefore, executing free_netdev()
  results in the "free active object (kevent)" error reported here.  2. Another factor is that
  when calling usbnet_disconnect()->unregister_netdev(), if the usbnet device is up, ndo_stop()
  is executed to cancel the kevent. However, because the device is not up, ndo_stop() is not
  executed.  The solution to this problem is to cancel the kevent before executing free_netdev().'
