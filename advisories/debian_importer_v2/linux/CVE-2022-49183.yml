summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/sched: act_ct:
  fix ref leak when switching zones  When switching zones or network namespaces without doing
  a ct clear in between, it is now leaking a reference to the old ct entry. That''s because
  tcf_ct_skb_nfct_cached() returns false and tcf_ct_flow_table_lookup() may simply overwrite
  it.  The fix is to, as the ct entry is not reusable, free it already at tcf_ct_skb_nfct_cached().'
