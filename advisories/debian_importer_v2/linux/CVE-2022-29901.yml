summary: Intel microprocessor generations 6 to 8 are affected by a new Spectre variant that
  is able to bypass their retpoline mitigation in the kernel to leak arbitrary data. An attacker
  with unprivileged user access can hijack return instructions to achieve arbitrary speculative
  code execution under certain microarchitecture-dependent conditions.
