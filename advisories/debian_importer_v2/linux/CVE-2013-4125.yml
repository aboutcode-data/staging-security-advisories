  - CVE-2013-4125
summary: The fib6_add_rt2node function in net/ipv6/ip6_fib.c in the IPv6 stack in the Linux
  kernel through 3.10.1 does not properly handle Router Advertisement (RA) messages in certain
  circumstances involving three routes that initially qualified for membership in an ECMP route
  set until a change occurred for one of the first two routes, which allows remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service (system crash) via a crafted sequence of messages.
