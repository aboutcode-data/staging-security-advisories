  - CVE-2023-53032
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: ipset:
  Fix overflow before widen in the bitmap_ip_create() function.  When first_ip is 0, last_ip
  is 0xFFFFFFFF, and netmask is 31, the value of an arithmetic expression 2 << (netmask - mask_bits
  - 1) is subject to overflow due to a failure casting operands to a larger data type before
  performing the arithmetic.  Note that it''s harmless since the value will be checked at the
  next step.  Found by InfoTeCS on behalf of Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with
  SVACE.'
