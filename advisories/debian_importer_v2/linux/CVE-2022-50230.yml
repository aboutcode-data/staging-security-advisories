summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  arm64: set UXN
  on swapper page tables  [ This issue was fixed upstream by accident in c3cee924bd85 ("arm64:   head:
  cover entire kernel image in initial ID map") as part of a   large refactoring of the arm64
  boot flow. This simple fix is therefore   preferred for -stable backporting ]  On a system
  that implements FEAT_EPAN, read/write access to the idmap is denied because UXN is not set
  on the swapper PTEs. As a result, idmap_kpti_install_ng_mappings panics the kernel when accessing
  __idmap_kpti_flag. Fix it by setting UXN on these PTEs.'
