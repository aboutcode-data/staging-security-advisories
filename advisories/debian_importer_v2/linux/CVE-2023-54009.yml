summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i2c: cadence:
  cdns_i2c_master_xfer(): Fix runtime PM leak on error path  The cdns_i2c_master_xfer() function
  gets a runtime PM reference when the function is entered. This reference is released when
  the function is exited. There is currently one error path where the function exits directly,
  which leads to a leak of the runtime PM reference.  Make sure that this error path also releases
  the runtime PM reference.'
