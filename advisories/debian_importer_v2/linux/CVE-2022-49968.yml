summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ieee802154/adf7242:
  defer destroy_workqueue call  There is a possible race condition (use-after-free) like below    (FREE)                     |  (USE)   adf7242_remove             |  adf7242_channel    cancel_delayed_work_sync  |     destroy_workqueue
  (1)    |   adf7242_cmd_rx                              |    mod_delayed_work (2)                              |  The
  root cause for this race is that the upper layer (ieee802154) is unaware of this detaching
  event and the function adf7242_channel can be called without any checks.  To fix this, we
  can add a flag write at the beginning of adf7242_remove and add flag check in adf7242_channel.
  Or we can just defer the destructive operation like other commit 3e0588c291d6 ("hamradio:
  defer ax25 kfree after unregister_netdev") which let the ieee802154_unregister_hw() to handle
  the synchronization. This patch takes the second option.  runs")'
