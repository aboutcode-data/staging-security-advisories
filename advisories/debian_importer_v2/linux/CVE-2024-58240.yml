summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tls: separate
  no-async decryption request handling from async  If we''re not doing async, the handling is
  much simpler. There''s no reference counting, we just need to wait for the completion to wake
  us up and return its result.  We should preferably also use a separate crypto_wait. I''m not
  seeing a UAF as I did in the past, I think aec7961916f3 ("tls: fix race between async notify
  and socket close") took care of it.  This will make the next fix easier.'
