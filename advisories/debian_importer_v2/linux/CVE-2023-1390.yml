  - CVE-2023-1390
summary: A remote denial of service vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel’s TIPC kernel
  module. The while loop in tipc_link_xmit() hits an unknown state while attempting to parse
  SKBs, which are not in the queue. Sending two small UDP packets to a system with a UDP bearer
  results in the CPU utilization for the system to instantly spike to 100%, causing a denial
  of service condition.
