summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cxl/pmem: Fix
  cxl_pmem_region and cxl_memdev leak  When a cxl_nvdimm object goes through a ->remove() event
  (device physically removed, nvdimm-bridge disabled, or nvdimm device disabled), then any associated
  regions must also be disabled. As highlighted by the cxl-create-region.sh test [1], a single
  device may host multiple regions, but the driver was only tracking one region at a time. This
  leads to a situation where only the last enabled region per nvdimm device is cleaned up properly.
  Other regions are leaked, and this also causes cxl_memdev reference leaks.  Fix the tracking
  by allowing cxl_nvdimm objects to track multiple region associations.'
