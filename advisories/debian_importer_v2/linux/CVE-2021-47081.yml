summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  habanalabs/gaudi:
  Fix a potential use after free in gaudi_memset_device_memory  Our code analyzer reported a
  uaf.  In gaudi_memset_device_memory, cb is get via hl_cb_kernel_create() with 2 refcount.
  If hl_cs_allocate_job() failed, the execution runs into release_cb branch. One ref of cb is
  dropped by hl_cb_put(cb) and could be freed if other thread also drops one ref. Then cb is
  used by cb->id later, which is a potential uaf.  My patch add a variable ''id'' to accept
  the value of cb->id before the hl_cb_put(cb) is called, to avoid the potential uaf.'
