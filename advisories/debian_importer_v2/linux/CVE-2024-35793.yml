summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  debugfs: fix
  wait/cancellation handling during remove  Ben Greear further reports deadlocks during concurrent
  debugfs remove while files are being accessed, even though the code in question now uses debugfs
  cancellations. Turns out that despite all the review on the locking, we missed completely
  that the logic is wrong: if the refcount hits zero we can finish (and need not wait for the
  completion), but if it doesn''t we have to trigger all the cancellations. As written, we can
  _never_ get into the loop triggering the cancellations. Fix this, and explain it better while
  at it.'
