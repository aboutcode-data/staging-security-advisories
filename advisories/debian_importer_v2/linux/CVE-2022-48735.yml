summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: hda: Fix
  UAF of leds class devs at unbinding  The LED class devices that are created by HD-audio codec
  drivers are registered via devm_led_classdev_register() and associated with the HD-audio codec
  device.  Unfortunately, it turned out that the devres release doesn''t work for this case;
  namely, since the codec resource release happens before the devm call chain, it triggers a
  NULL dereference or a UAF for a stale set_brightness_delay callback.  For fixing the bug,
  this patch changes the LED class device register and unregister in a manual manner without
  devres, keeping the instances in hda_gen_spec.'
