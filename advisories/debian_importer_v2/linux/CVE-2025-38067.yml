summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rseq: Fix segfault
  on registration when rseq_cs is non-zero  The rseq_cs field is documented as being set to
  0 by user-space prior to registration, however this is not currently enforced by the kernel.
  This can result in a segfault on return to user-space if the value stored in the rseq_cs field
  doesn''t point to a valid struct rseq_cs.  The correct solution to this would be to fail the
  rseq registration when the rseq_cs field is non-zero. However, some older versions of glibc
  will reuse the rseq area of previous threads without clearing the rseq_cs field and will also
  terminate the process if the rseq registration fails in a secondary thread. This wasn''t caught
  in testing because in this case the leftover rseq_cs does point to a valid struct rseq_cs.  What
  we can do is clear the rseq_cs field on registration when it''s non-zero which will prevent
  segfaults on registration and won''t break the glibc versions that reuse rseq areas on thread
  creation.'
