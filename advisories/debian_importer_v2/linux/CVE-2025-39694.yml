summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  s390/sclp: Fix
  SCCB present check  Tracing code called by the SCLP interrupt handler contains early exits
  if the SCCB address associated with an interrupt is NULL. This check is performed after physical
  to virtual address translation.  If the kernel identity mapping does not start at address
  zero, the resulting virtual address is never zero, so that the NULL checks won''t work. Subsequently
  this may result in incorrect accesses to the first page of the identity mapping.  Fix this
  by introducing a function that handles the NULL case before address translation.'
