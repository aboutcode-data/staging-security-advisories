summary: A Red Hat only CVE-2020-12352 regression issue was found in the way the Linux kernel's
  Bluetooth stack implementation handled the initialization of stack memory when handling certain
  AMP packets. This flaw allows a remote attacker in an adjacent range to leak small portions
  of stack memory on the system by sending specially crafted AMP packets. The highest threat
  from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.
