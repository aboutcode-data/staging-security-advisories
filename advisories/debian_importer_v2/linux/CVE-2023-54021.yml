summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: set goal
  start correctly in ext4_mb_normalize_request  We need to set ac_g_ex to notify the goal start
  used in ext4_mb_find_by_goal. Set ac_g_ex instead of ac_f_ex in ext4_mb_normalize_request.
  Besides we should assure goal start is in range [first_data_block, blocks_count) as ext4_mb_initialize_context
  does.  [ Added a check to make sure size is less than ar->pright; otherwise   we could end
  up passing an underflowed value of ar->pright - size to   ext4_get_group_no_and_offset(),
  which will trigger a BUG_ON later on.   - TYT ]'
