  - CVE-2024-56564
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ceph: pass cred
  pointer to ceph_mds_auth_match()  This eliminates a redundant get_current_cred() call, because
  ceph_mds_check_access() has already obtained this pointer.  As a side effect, this also fixes
  a reference leak in ceph_mds_auth_match(): by omitting the get_current_cred() call, no additional
  cred reference is taken.'
