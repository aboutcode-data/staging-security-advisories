  - CVE-2020-10769
summary: A buffer over-read flaw was found in RH kernel versions before 5.0 in crypto_authenc_extractkeys
  in crypto/authenc.c in the IPsec Cryptographic algorithm's module, authenc. When a payload
  longer than 4 bytes, and is not following 4-byte alignment boundary guidelines, it causes
  a buffer over-read threat, leading to a system crash. This flaw allows a local attacker with
  user privileges to cause a denial of service.
