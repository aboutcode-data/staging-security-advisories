summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/nouveau:
  keep DMA buffers required for suspend/resume  Nouveau deallocates a few buffers post GPU init
  which are required for GPU suspend/resume to function correctly. This is likely not as big
  an issue on systems where the NVGPU is the only GPU, but on multi-GPU set ups it leads to
  a regression where the kernel module errors and results in a system-wide rendering freeze.  This
  commit addresses that regression by moving the two buffers required for suspend and resume
  to be deallocated at driver unload instead of post init.'
