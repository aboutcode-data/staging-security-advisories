  - CVE-2018-10901
summary: A flaw was found in Linux kernel's KVM virtualization subsystem. The VMX code does
  not restore the GDT.LIMIT to the previous host value, but instead sets it to 64KB. With a
  corrupted GDT limit a host's userspace code has an ability to place malicious entries in the
  GDT, particularly to the per-cpu variables. An attacker can use this to escalate their privileges.
