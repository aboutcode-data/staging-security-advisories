  - CVE-2025-37898
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powerpc64/ftrace:
  fix module loading without patchable function entries  get_stubs_size assumes that there must
  always be at least one patchable function entry, which is not always the case (modules that
  export data but no code), otherwise it returns -ENOEXEC and thus the section header sh_size
  is set to that value. During module_memory_alloc() the size is passed to execmem_alloc() after
  being page-aligned and thus set to zero which will cause it to fail the allocation (and thus
  module loading) as __vmalloc_node_range() checks for zero-sized allocs and returns null:  [  115.466896]
  module_64: cast_common: doesn''t contain __patchable_function_entries. [  115.469189] ------------[
  cut here ]------------ [  115.469496] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 274 at mm/vmalloc.c:3778 __vmalloc_node_range_noprof+0x8b4/0x8f0
  ... [  115.478574] ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]--- [  115.479545] execmem: unable to
  allocate memory  Fix this by removing the check completely, since it is anyway not helpful
  to propagate this as an error upwards.'
