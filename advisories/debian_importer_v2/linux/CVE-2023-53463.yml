summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ibmvnic: Do not
  reset dql stats on NON_FATAL err  All ibmvnic resets, make a call to netdev_tx_reset_queue()
  when re-opening the device. netdev_tx_reset_queue() resets the num_queued and num_completed
  byte counters. These stats are used in Byte Queue Limit (BQL) algorithms. The difference between
  these two stats tracks the number of bytes currently sitting on the physical NIC. ibmvnic
  increases the number of queued bytes though calls to netdev_tx_sent_queue() in the drivers
  xmit function. When, VIOS reports that it is done transmitting bytes, the ibmvnic device increases
  the number of completed bytes through calls to netdev_tx_completed_queue(). It is important
  to note that the driver batches its transmit calls and num_queued is increased every time
  that an skb is added to the next batch, not necessarily when the batch is sent to VIOS for
  transmission.  Unlike other reset types, a NON FATAL reset will not flush the sub crq tx buffers.
  Therefore, it is possible for the batched skb array to be partially full. So if there is call
  to netdev_tx_reset_queue() when re-opening the device, the value of num_queued (0) would not
  account for the skb''s that are currently batched. Eventually, when the batch is sent to VIOS,
  the call to netdev_tx_completed_queue() would increase num_completed to a value greater than
  the num_queued. This causes a BUG_ON crash:  ibmvnic 30000002: Firmware reports error, cause:
  adapter problem. Starting recovery... ibmvnic 30000002: tx error 600 ibmvnic 30000002: tx
