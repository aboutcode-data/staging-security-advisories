summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: ipset:
  fix region locking in hash types  Region locking introduced in v5.6-rc4 contained three macros
  to handle the region locks: ahash_bucket_start(), ahash_bucket_end() which gave back the start
  and end hash bucket values belonging to a given region lock and ahash_region() which should
  give back the region lock belonging to a given hash bucket. The latter was incorrect which
  can lead to a race condition between the garbage collector and adding new elements when a
  hash type of set is defined with timeouts.'
