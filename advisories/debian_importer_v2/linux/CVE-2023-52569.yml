  - CVE-2023-52569
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: remove
  BUG() after failure to insert delayed dir index item  Instead of calling BUG() when we fail
  to insert a delayed dir index item into the delayed node''s tree, we can just release all
  the resources we have allocated/acquired before and return the error to the caller. This is
  fine because all existing call chains undo anything they have done before calling btrfs_insert_delayed_dir_index()
  or BUG_ON (when creating pending snapshots in the transaction commit path).  So remove the
  BUG() call and do proper error handling.  This relates to a syzbot report linked below, but
  does not fix it because it only prevents hitting a BUG(), it does not fix the issue where
  somehow we attempt to use twice the same index number for different index items.'
