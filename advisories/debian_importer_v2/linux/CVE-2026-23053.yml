summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  NFS: Fix a deadlock
  involving nfs_release_folio()  Wang Zhaolong reports a deadlock involving NFSv4.1 state recovery
  waiting on kthreadd, which is attempting to reclaim memory by calling nfs_release_folio().
  The latter cannot make progress due to state recovery being needed.  It seems that the only
  safe thing to do here is to kick off a writeback of the folio, without waiting for completion,
  or else kicking off an asynchronous commit.'
