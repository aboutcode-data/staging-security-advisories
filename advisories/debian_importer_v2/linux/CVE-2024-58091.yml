summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/fbdev-dma:
  Add shadow buffering for deferred I/O  DMA areas are not necessarily backed by struct page,
  so we cannot rely on it for deferred I/O. Allocate a shadow buffer for drivers that require
  deferred I/O and use it as framebuffer memory.  Fixes driver errors about being "Unable to
  handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address" or "Unable to handle kernel paging
  request at virtual address".  The patch splits drm_fbdev_dma_driver_fbdev_probe() in an initial
  allocation, which creates the DMA-backed buffer object, and a tail that sets up the fbdev
  data structures. There is a tail function for direct memory mappings and a tail function for
  deferred I/O with the shadow buffer.  It is no longer possible to use deferred I/O without
  shadow buffer. It can be re-added if there exists a reliably test for usable struct page in
  the allocated DMA-backed buffer object.'
