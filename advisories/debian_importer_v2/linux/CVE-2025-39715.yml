summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  parisc: Revise
  gateway LWS calls to probe user read access  We use load and stbys,e instructions to trigger
  memory reference interruptions without writing to memory. Because of the way read access support
  is implemented, read access interruptions are only triggered at privilege levels 2 and 3.
  The kernel and gateway page execute at privilege level 0, so this code never triggers a read
  access interruption. Thus, it is currently possible for user code to execute a LWS compare
  and swap operation at an address that is read protected at privilege level 3 (PRIV_USER).  Fix
  this by probing read access rights at privilege level 3 and branching to lws_fault if access
  isn''t allowed.'
