summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bluetooth/l2cap:\
  \ sync sock recv cb and release  The problem occurs between the system call to close the sock\
  \ and hci_rx_work, where the former releases the sock and the latter accesses it without lock\
  \ protection.             CPU0                       CPU1            ----                \
  \       ----            sock_close                 hci_rx_work \t   l2cap_sock_release   \
  \      hci_acldata_packet \t   l2cap_sock_kill            l2cap_recv_frame \t   sk_free  \
  \                  l2cap_conless_channel \t                              l2cap_sock_recv_cb\
  \  If hci_rx_work processes the data that needs to be received before the sock is closed,\
  \ then everything is normal; Otherwise, the work thread may access the released sock when\
  \ receiving data.  Add a chan mutex in the rx callback of the sock to achieve synchronization\
  \ between the sock release and recv cb.  Sock is dead, so set chan data to NULL, avoid others\
  \ use invalid sock pointer."
