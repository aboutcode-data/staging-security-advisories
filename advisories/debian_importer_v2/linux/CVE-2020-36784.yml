summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i2c: cadence:
  fix reference leak when pm_runtime_get_sync fails  The PM reference count is not expected
  to be incremented on return in functions cdns_i2c_master_xfer and cdns_reg_slave.  However,
  pm_runtime_get_sync will increment pm usage counter even failed. Forgetting to putting operation
  will result in a reference leak here.  Replace it with pm_runtime_resume_and_get to keep usage
  counter balanced.'
