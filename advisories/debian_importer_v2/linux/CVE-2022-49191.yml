summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mxser: fix xmit_buf
  leak in activate when LSR == 0xff  When LSR is 0xff in ->activate() (rather unlike), we return
  an error. Provided ->shutdown() is not called when ->activate() fails, nothing actually frees
  the buffer in this case.  Fix this by properly freeing the buffer in a designated label. We
  jump there also from the "!info->type" if now too.'
