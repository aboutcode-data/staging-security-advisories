summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dm btree remove:
  assign new_root only when removal succeeds  remove_raw() in dm_btree_remove() may fail due
  to IO read error (e.g. read the content of origin block fails during shadowing), and the value
  of shadow_spine::root is uninitialized, but the uninitialized value is still assign to new_root
  in the end of dm_btree_remove().  For dm-thin, the value of pmd->details_root or pmd->root
  will become an uninitialized value, so if trying to read details_info tree again out-of-bound
  memory may occur as showed below:    general protection fault, probably for non-canonical
