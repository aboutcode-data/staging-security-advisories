summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Revert "Revert
  "block, bfq: honor already-setup queue merges""  A crash [1] happened to be triggered in conjunction
  with commit 2d52c58b9c9b ("block, bfq: honor already-setup queue merges"). The latter was
  then reverted by commit ebc69e897e17 ("Revert "block, bfq: honor already-setup queue merges"").
  Yet, the reverted commit was not the one introducing the bug. In fact, it actually triggered
  a UAF introduced by a different commit, and now fixed by commit d29bd41428cf ("block, bfq:
  reset last_bfqq_created on group change").  So, there is no point in keeping commit 2d52c58b9c9b
  ("block, bfq: honor already-setup queue merges") out. This commit restores it.  [1] https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214503'
