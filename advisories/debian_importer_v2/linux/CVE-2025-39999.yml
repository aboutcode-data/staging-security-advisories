summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  blk-mq: fix blk_mq_tags
  double free while nr_requests grown  In the case user trigger tags grow by queue sysfs attribute
  nr_requests, hctx->sched_tags will be freed directly and replaced with a new allocated tags,
  see blk_mq_tag_update_depth().  The problem is that hctx->sched_tags is from elevator->et->tags,
  while et->tags is still the freed tags, hence later elevator exit will try to free the tags
  again, causing kernel panic.  Fix this problem by replacing et->tags with new allocated tags
  as well.  Noted there are still some long term problems that will require some refactor to
  be fixed thoroughly[1].  [1] https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250815080216.410665-1-yukuai1@huaweicloud.com/'
