summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  riscv: fix race
  when vmap stack overflow  Currently, when detecting vmap stack overflow, riscv firstly switches
  to the so called shadow stack, then use this shadow stack to call the get_overflow_stack()
  to get the overflow stack. However, there''s a race here if two or more harts use the same
  shadow stack at the same time.  To solve this race, we introduce spin_shadow_stack atomic
  var, which will be swap between its own address and 0 in atomic way, when the var is set,
  it means the shadow_stack is being used; when the var is cleared, it means the shadow_stack
  isn''t being used.  [Palmer: Add AQ to the swap, and also some comments.]'
