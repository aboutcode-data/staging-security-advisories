summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nommu: pass NULL
  argument to vma_iter_prealloc()  When deleting a vma entry from a maple tree, it has to pass
  NULL to vma_iter_prealloc() in order to calculate internal state of the tree, but it passed
  a wrong argument.  As a result, nommu kernels crashed upon accessing a vma iterator, such
  as acct_collect() reading the size of vma entries after do_munmap().  This commit fixes this
  issue by passing a right argument to the preallocation call.'
