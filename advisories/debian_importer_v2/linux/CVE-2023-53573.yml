summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: rs9: Fix
  suspend/resume  Disabling the cache in commit 2ff4ba9e3702 ("clk: rs9: Fix I2C accessors")
  without removing cache synchronization in resume path results in a kernel panic as map->cache_ops

  and cannot be provided in software.'
