summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  memcg: fix possible
  use-after-free in memcg_write_event_control()  memcg_write_event_control() accesses the dentry->d_name
  of the specified control fd to route the write call.  As a cgroup interface file can''t be
  renamed, it''s safe to access d_name as long as the specified file is a regular cgroup file.  Also,
  as these cgroup interface files can''t be removed before the directory, it''s safe to access
  the parent too.  Prior to 347c4a874710 ("memcg: remove cgroup_event->cft"), there was a call
  to __file_cft() which verified that the specified file is a regular cgroupfs file before further
  accesses.  The cftype pointer returned from __file_cft() was no longer necessary and the commit
  inadvertently dropped the file type check with it allowing any file to slip through.  With
  the invarients broken, the d_name and parent accesses can now race against renames and removals
  of arbitrary files and cause use-after-free''s.  Fix the bug by resurrecting the file type
  check in __file_cft().  Now that cgroupfs is implemented through kernfs, checking the file
  operations needs to go through a layer of indirection.  Instead, let''s check the superblock
  and dentry type.'
