summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powerpc/64: Fix
  the definition of the fixmap area  At the time being, the fixmap area is defined at the top
  of the address space or just below KASAN.  This definition is not valid for PPC64.  For PPC64,
  use the top of the I/O space.  Because of circular dependencies, it is not possible to include
  asm/fixmap.h in asm/book3s/64/pgtable.h , so define a fixed size AREA at the top of the I/O
  space for fixmap and ensure during build that the size is big enough.'
