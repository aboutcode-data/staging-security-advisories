  - CVE-2025-37822
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  riscv: uprobes:
  Add missing fence.i after building the XOL buffer  The XOL (execute out-of-line) buffer is
  used to single-step the replaced instruction(s) for uprobes. The RISC-V port was missing a
  proper fence.i (i$ flushing) after constructing the XOL buffer, which can result in incorrect
  execution of stale/broken instructions.  This was found running the BPF selftests "test_progs:
  uprobe_autoattach, attach_probe" on the Spacemit K1/X60, where the uprobes tests randomly
  blew up.'
