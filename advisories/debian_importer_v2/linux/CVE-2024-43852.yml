summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  hwmon: (ltc2991)
  re-order conditions to fix off by one bug  LTC2991_T_INT_CH_NR is 4.  The st->temp_en[] array
  has LTC2991_MAX_CHANNEL (4) elements.  Thus if "channel" is equal to LTC2991_T_INT_CH_NR then
  we have read one element beyond the end of the array.  Flip the conditions around so that
  we check if "channel" is valid before using it as an array index.'
