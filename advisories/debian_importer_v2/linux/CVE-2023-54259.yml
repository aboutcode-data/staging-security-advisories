summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  soundwire: bus:
  Fix unbalanced pm_runtime_put() causing usage count underflow  This reverts commit 443a98e649b4
  ("soundwire: bus: use pm_runtime_resume_and_get()")  Change calls to pm_runtime_resume_and_get()
  back to pm_runtime_get_sync(). This fixes a usage count underrun caused by doing a pm_runtime_put()
  even though pm_runtime_resume_and_get() returned an error.  The three affected functions ignore
  -EACCES error from trying to get pm_runtime, and carry on, including a put at the end of the
  function. But pm_runtime_resume_and_get() does not increment the usage count if it returns
  an error. So in the -EACCES case you must not call pm_runtime_put().  The documentation for
  pm_runtime_get_sync() says:  "Consider using pm_runtime_resume_and_get() ...  as this is likely
  to  result in cleaner code."  In this case I don''t think it results in cleaner code because
  the pm_runtime_put() at the end of the function would have to be conditional on the return
  value from pm_runtime_resume_and_get() at the top of the function.  pm_runtime_get_sync()
  doesn''t have this problem because it always increments the count, so always needs a put.
  The code can just flow through and do the pm_runtime_put() unconditionally.'
