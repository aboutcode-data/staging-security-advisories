summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix kernel
  bug due to missing clearing of checked flag  Syzbot reported that in directory operations
  after nilfs2 detects filesystem corruption and degrades to read-only, __block_write_begin_int(),
  which is called to prepare block writes, may fail the BUG_ON check for accesses exceeding
  the folio/page size, triggering a kernel bug.  This was found to be because the "checked"
  flag of a page/folio was not cleared when it was discarded by nilfs2''s own routine, which
  causes the sanity check of directory entries to be skipped when the directory page/folio is
  reloaded.  So, fix that.  This was necessary when the use of nilfs2''s own page discard routine
  was applied to more than just metadata files.'
