summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  LSM: general
  protection fault in legacy_parse_param  The usual LSM hook "bail on fail" scheme doesn''t
  work for cases where a security module may return an error code indicating that it does not
  recognize an input.  In this particular case Smack sees a mount option that it recognizes,
  and returns 0. A call to a BPF hook follows, which returns -ENOPARAM, which confuses the caller
  because Smack has processed its data.  The SELinux hook incorrectly returns 1 on success.
  There was a time when this was correct, however the current expectation is that it return
  0 on success. This is repaired.'
