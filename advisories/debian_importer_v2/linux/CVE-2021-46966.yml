summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ACPI: custom_method:
  fix potential use-after-free issue  In cm_write(), buf is always freed when reaching the end
  of the function.  If the requested count is less than table.length, the allocated buffer will
  be freed but subsequent calls to cm_write() will still try to access it.  Remove the unconditional
  kfree(buf) at the end of the function and set the buf to NULL in the -EINVAL error path to
  match the rest of function.'
