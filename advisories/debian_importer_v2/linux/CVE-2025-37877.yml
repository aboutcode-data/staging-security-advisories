summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommu: Clear
  iommu-dma ops on cleanup  If iommu_device_register() encounters an error, it can end up tearing
  down already-configured groups and default domains, however this currently still leaves devices
  hooked up to iommu-dma (and even historically the behaviour in this area was at best inconsistent
  across architectures/drivers...) Although in the case that an IOMMU is present whose driver
  has failed to probe, users cannot necessarily expect DMA to work anyway, it''s still arguable
  that we should do our best to put things back as if the IOMMU driver was never there at all,
  and certainly the potential for crashing in iommu-dma itself is undesirable. Make sure we
  clean up the dev->dma_iommu flag along with everything else.'
