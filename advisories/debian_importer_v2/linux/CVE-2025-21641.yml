  - CVE-2025-21641
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mptcp: sysctl:
  blackhole timeout: avoid using current->nsproxy  As mentioned in the previous commit, using
  the ''net'' structure via ''current'' is not recommended for different reasons:  - Inconsistency:
  getting info from the reader''s/writer''s netns vs only   from the opener''s netns.  - current->nsproxy
  can be NULL in some cases, resulting in an ''Oops''   (null-ptr-deref), e.g. when the current
  task is exiting, as spotted by   syzbot [1] using acct(2).  The ''pernet'' structure can be
  obtained from the table->data using container_of().'
