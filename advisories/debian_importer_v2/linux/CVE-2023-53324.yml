summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/msm/mdp5:
  Don''t leak some plane state  Apparently no one noticed that mdp5 plane states leak like a
  sieve ever since we introduced plane_state->commit refcount a few years ago in 21a01abbe32a
  ("drm/atomic: Fix freeing connector/plane state too early by tracking commits, v3.")  Fix
  it by using the right helpers.  Patchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/551236/'
