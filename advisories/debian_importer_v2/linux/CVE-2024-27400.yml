summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amdgpu: once
  more fix the call oder in amdgpu_ttm_move() v2  This reverts drm/amdgpu: fix ftrace event
  amdgpu_bo_move always move on same heap. The basic problem here is that after the move the
  old location is simply not available any more.  Some fixes were suggested, but essentially
  we should call the move notification before actually moving things because only this way we
  have the correct order for DMA-buf and VM move notifications as well.  Also rework the statistic
  handling so that we don''t update the eviction counter before the move.  v2: add missing NULL
  check'
