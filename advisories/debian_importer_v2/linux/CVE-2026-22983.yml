summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: do not write
  to msg_get_inq in callee  NULL pointer dereference fix.  msg_get_inq is an input field from
  caller to callee. Don''t set it in the callee, as the caller may not clear it on struct reuse.  This
  is a kernel-internal variant of msghdr only, and the only user does reinitialize the field.
  So this is not critical for that reason. But it is more robust to avoid the write, and slightly
  simpler code. And it fixes a bug, see below.  Callers set msg_get_inq to request the input
  queue length to be returned in msg_inq. This is equivalent to but independent from the SO_INQ
  request to return that same info as a cmsg (tp->recvmsg_inq). To reduce branching in the hot
  path the second also sets the msg_inq. That is WAI.  This is a fix to commit 4d1442979e4a
  ("af_unix: don''t post cmsg for SO_INQ unless explicitly asked for"), which fixed the inverse.  Also
  avoid NULL pointer dereference in unix_stream_read_generic if state->msg is NULL and msg->msg_get_inq
  is written. A NULL state->msg can happen when splicing as of commit 2b514574f7e8 ("net: af_unix:
  implement splice for stream af_unix sockets").  Also collapse two branches using a bitwise
  or.'
