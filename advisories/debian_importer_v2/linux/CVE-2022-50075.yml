summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tracing/eprobes:
  Have event probes be consistent with kprobes and uprobes  Currently, if a symbol "@" is attempted
  to be used with an event probe (eprobes), it will cause a NULL pointer dereference crash.  Both
  kprobes and uprobes can reference data other than the main registers. Such as immediate address,
  symbols and the current task name. Have eprobes do the same thing.  For "comm", if "comm"
  is used and the event being attached to does not have the "comm" field, then make it the "$comm"
  that kprobes has. This is consistent to the way histograms and filters work.'
