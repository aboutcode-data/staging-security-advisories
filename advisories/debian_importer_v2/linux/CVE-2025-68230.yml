summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amdgpu: fix
  gpu page fault after hibernation on PF passthrough  On PF passthrough environment, after hibernate
  and then resume, coralgemm will cause gpu page fault.  Mode1 reset happens during hibernate,
  but partition mode is not restored on resume, register mmCP_HYP_XCP_CTL and mmCP_PSP_XCP_CTL
  is not right after resume. When CP access the MQD BO, wrong stride size is used, this will
  cause out of bound access on the MQD BO, resulting page fault.  The fix is to ensure gfx_v9_4_3_switch_compute_partition()
  is called when resume from a hibernation. KFD resume is called separately during a reset recovery
  or resume from suspend sequence. Hence it''s not required to be called as part of partition
  switch.  (cherry picked from commit 5d1b32cfe4a676fe552416cb5ae847b215463a1a)'
