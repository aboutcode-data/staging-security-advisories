summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dpll: Prevent
  duplicate registrations  Modify the internal registration helpers dpll_xa_ref_{dpll,pin}_add()
  to reject duplicate registration attempts.  Previously, if a caller attempted to register
  the same pin multiple times (with the same ops, priv, and cookie) on the same device, the
  core silently increments the reference count and return success. This behavior is incorrect
  because if the caller makes these duplicate registrations then for the first one dpll_pin_registration
  is allocated and for others the associated dpll_pin_ref.refcount is incremented. During the
  first unregistration the associated dpll_pin_registration is freed and for others WARN is
  fired.  Fix this by updating the logic to return `-EEXIST` if a matching registration is found
  to enforce a strict "register once" policy.'
