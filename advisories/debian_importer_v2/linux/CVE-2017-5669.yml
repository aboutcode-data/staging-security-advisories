aliases:
  - CVE-2017-5669
summary: The do_shmat function in ipc/shm.c in the Linux kernel through 4.9.12 does not restrict
  the address calculated by a certain rounding operation, which allows local users to map page
  zero, and consequently bypass a protection mechanism that exists for the mmap system call,
  by making crafted shmget and shmat system calls in a privileged context.
