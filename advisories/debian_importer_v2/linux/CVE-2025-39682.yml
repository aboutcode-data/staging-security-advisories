  - CVE-2025-39682
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tls: fix handling
  of zero-length records on the rx_list  Each recvmsg() call must process either  - only contiguous
  DATA records (any number of them)  - one non-DATA record  If the next record has different
  type than what has already been processed we break out of the main processing loop. If the
  record has already been decrypted (which may be the case for TLS 1.3 where we don''t know
  type until decryption) we queue the pending record to the rx_list. Next recvmsg() will pick
  it up from there.  Queuing the skb to rx_list after zero-copy decrypt is not possible, since
  in that case we decrypted directly to the user space buffer, and we don''t have an skb to
  queue (darg.skb points to the ciphertext skb for access to metadata like length).  Only data
  records are allowed zero-copy, and we break the processing loop after each non-data record.
  So we should never zero-copy and then find out that the record type has changed. The corner
  case we missed is when the initial record comes from rx_list, and it''s zero length.'
