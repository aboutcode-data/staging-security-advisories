  - CVE-2024-35789
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: mac80211:
  check/clear fast rx for non-4addr sta VLAN changes  When moving a station out of a VLAN and
  deleting the VLAN afterwards, the fast_rx entry still holds a pointer to the VLAN''s netdev,
  which can cause use-after-free bugs. Fix this by immediately calling ieee80211_check_fast_rx
  after the VLAN change.'
