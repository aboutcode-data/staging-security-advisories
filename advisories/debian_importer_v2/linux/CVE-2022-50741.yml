summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: imx-jpeg:
  Disable useless interrupt to avoid kernel panic  There is a hardware bug that the interrupt
  STMBUF_HALF may be triggered after or when disable interrupt. It may led to unexpected kernel
  panic. And interrupt STMBUF_HALF and STMBUF_RTND have no other effect. So disable them and
  the unused interrupts.  meanwhile clear the interrupt status when disable interrupt.'
