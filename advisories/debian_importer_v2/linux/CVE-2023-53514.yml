summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gpu: host1x:
  Fix memory leak of device names  The device names allocated by dev_set_name() need be freed
  before module unloading, but they can not be freed because the kobject''s refcount which was
  set in device_initialize() has not be decreased to 0.  As comment of device_add() says, if
  it fails, use only put_device() drop the refcount, then the name will be freed in kobejct_cleanup().  device_del()
  and put_device() can be replaced with device_unregister(), so call it to unregister the added
  successfully devices, and just call put_device() to the not added device.  Add a release()
  function to device to avoid null release() function WARNING in device_release(), it''s empty,
  because the context devices are freed together in host1x_memory_context_list_free().'
