summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dma-buf/dma-resv:
  Stop leaking on krealloc() failure  Currently dma_resv_get_fences() will leak the previously
  allocated array if the fence iteration got restarted and the krealloc_array() fails.  Free
  the old array by hand, and make sure we still clear the returned *fences so the caller won''t
  end up accessing freed memory. Some (but not all) of the callers of dma_resv_get_fences()
  seem to still trawl through the array even when dma_resv_get_fences() failed. And let''s zero
  out *num_fences as well for good measure.'
