summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: stmmac:\
  \ dwmac-rk: fix oob read in rk_gmac_setup  KASAN reports an out-of-bounds read in rk_gmac_setup\
  \ on the line:  \twhile (ops->regs[i]) {  This happens for most platforms since the regs flexible\
  \ array member is empty, so the memory after the ops structure is being read here.  It seems\
  \ that mostly this happens to contain zero anyway, so we get lucky and everything still works.\
  \  To avoid adding redundant data to nearly all the ops structures, add a new flag to indicate\
  \ whether the regs field is valid and avoid this loop when it is not."
