summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: vidtv:
  Fix use-after-free in vidtv_bridge_dvb_init()  KASAN reports a use-after-free: BUG: KASAN:

  is because the error handling in vidtv_bridge_dvb_init() is wrong.  First, vidtv_bridge_dmx(dev)_init()
  will clean themselves when fail, but goto fail_dmx(_dev): calls release functions again, which
  causes use-after-free.  Also, in fail_fe, fail_tuner_probe and fail_demod_probe, j = i will
  cause out-of-bound when i finished its loop (i == NUM_FE). And the loop releasing is wrong,
  although now NUM_FE is 1 so it won''t cause problem.  Fix this by correctly releasing everything.'
