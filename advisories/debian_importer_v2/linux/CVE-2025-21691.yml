summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cachestat: fix
  page cache statistics permission checking  When the ''cachestat()'' system call was added
  in commit cf264e1329fb ("cachestat: implement cachestat syscall"), it was meant to be a much
  more convenient (and performant) version of mincore() that didn''t need mapping things into
  the user virtual address space in order to work.  But it ended up missing the "check for writability
  or ownership" fix for mincore(), done in commit 134fca9063ad ("mm/mincore.c: make mincore()
  more conservative").  This just adds equivalent logic to ''cachestat()'', modified for the
  file context (rather than vma).'
