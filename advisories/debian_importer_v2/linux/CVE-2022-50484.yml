summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: usb-audio:
  Fix potential memory leaks  When the driver hits -ENOMEM at allocating a URB or a buffer,
  it aborts and goes to the error path that releases the all previously allocated resources.  However,
  when -ENOMEM hits at the middle of the sync EP URB allocation loop, the partially allocated
  URBs might be left without released, because ep->nurbs is still zero at that point.  Fix it
  by setting ep->nurbs at first, so that the error handler loops over the full URB list.'
