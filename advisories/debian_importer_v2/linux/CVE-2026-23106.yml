summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  timekeeping:
  Adjust the leap state for the correct auxiliary timekeeper  When __do_ajdtimex() was introduced
  to handle adjtimex for any timekeeper, this reference to tk_core was not updated. When called
  on an auxiliary timekeeper, the core timekeeper would be updated incorrectly.  This gets caught
  by the lock debugging diagnostics because the timekeepers sequence lock gets written to without
  holding its associated spinlock:  WARNING: include/linux/seqlock.h:226 at __do_adjtimex+0x394/0x3b0,
  CPU#2: test/125 aux_clock_adj (kernel/time/timekeeping.c:2979) __do_sys_clock_adjtime (kernel/time/posix-timers.c:1161
