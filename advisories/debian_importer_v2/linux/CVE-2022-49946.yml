summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: bcm: rpi:
  Prevent out-of-bounds access  The while loop in raspberrypi_discover_clocks() relies on the
  assumption that the id of the last clock element is zero. Because this data comes from the
  Videocore firmware and it doesn''t guarantuee such a behavior this could lead to out-of-bounds
  access. So fix this by providing a sentinel element.'
