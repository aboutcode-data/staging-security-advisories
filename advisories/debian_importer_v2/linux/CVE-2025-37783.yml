summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/msm/dpu:
  Fix error pointers in dpu_plane_virtual_atomic_check  The function dpu_plane_virtual_atomic_check
  was dereferencing pointers returned by drm_atomic_get_plane_state without checking for errors.
  This could lead to undefined behavior if the function returns an error pointer.  This commit
  adds checks using IS_ERR to ensure that plane_state is valid before dereferencing them.  Similar
  to commit da29abe71e16 ("drm/amd/display: Fix error pointers in amdgpu_dm_crtc_mem_type_changed").  Patchwork:
  https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/643132/'
