summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm: bridge:
  dw_hdmi: fix connector access for scdc  Commit 5d844091f237 ("drm/scdc-helper: Pimp SCDC debugs")
  changed the scdc interface to pick up an i2c adapter from a connector instead. However, in
  the case of dw-hdmi, the wrong connector was being used to pass i2c adapter information, since
  dw-hdmi''s embedded connector structure is only populated when the bridge attachment callback
  explicitly asks for it.  drm-meson is handling connector creation, so this won''t happen,
  leading to a NULL pointer dereference.  Fix it by having scdc functions access dw-hdmi''s
  current connector pointer instead, which is assigned during the bridge enablement stage.  [narmstrong:
  moved Fixes tag before first S-o-b and added Reported-by tag]'
