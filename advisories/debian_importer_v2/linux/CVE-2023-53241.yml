  - CVE-2023-53241
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfsd: call op_release,
  even when op_func returns an error  For ops with "trivial" replies, nfsd4_encode_operation
  will shortcut most of the encoding work and skip to just marshalling up the status. One of
  the things it skips is calling op_release. This could cause a memory leak in the layoutget
  codepath if there is an error at an inopportune time.  Have the compound processing engine
  always call op_release, even when op_func sets an error in op->status. With this change, we
  also need nfsd4_block_get_device_info_scsi to set the gd_device pointer to NULL on error to
  avoid a double free.'
