summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix WARNING
  in mark_buffer_dirty due to discarded buffer reuse  A syzbot stress test using a corrupted
  disk image reported that mark_buffer_dirty() called from __nilfs_mark_inode_dirty() or nilfs_palloc_commit_alloc_entry()
  may output a kernel warning, and can panic if the kernel is booted with panic_on_warn.  This
  is because nilfs2 keeps buffer pointers in local structures for some metadata and reuses them,
  but such buffers may be forcibly discarded by nilfs_clear_dirty_page() in some critical situations.  This
  issue is reported to appear after commit 28a65b49eb53 ("nilfs2: do not write dirty data after
  degenerating to read-only"), but the issue has potentially existed before.  Fix this issue
  by checking the uptodate flag when attempting to reuse an internally held buffer, and reloading
  the metadata instead of reusing the buffer if the flag was lost.'
