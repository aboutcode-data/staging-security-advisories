summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  block: don't\
  \ allow the same type rq_qos add more than once  In our test of iocost, we encountered some\
  \ list add/del corruptions of inner_walk list in ioc_timer_fn.  The reason can be described\
  \ as follows:  cpu 0\t\t\t\t\tcpu 1 ioc_qos_write\t\t\t\tioc_qos_write  ioc = q_to_ioc(queue);\
  \ if (!ioc) {         ioc = kzalloc(); \t\t\t\t\tioc = q_to_ioc(queue); \t\t\t\t\tif (!ioc)\
  \ { \t\t\t\t\t\tioc = kzalloc(); \t\t\t\t\t\t... \t\t\t\t\t\trq_qos_add(q, rqos); \t\t\t\t\
  \t}         ...         rq_qos_add(q, rqos);         ... }  When the io.cost.qos file is written\
  \ by two cpus concurrently, rq_qos may be added to one disk twice. In that case, there will\
  \ be two iocs enabled and running on one disk. They own different iocgs on their active list.\
  \ In the ioc_timer_fn function, because of the iocgs from two iocs have the same root iocg,\
  \ the root iocg's walk_list may be overwritten by each other and this leads to list add/del\
  \ corruptions in building or destroying the inner_walk list.  And so far, the blk-rq-qos framework\
  \ works in case that one instance for one type rq_qos per queue by default. This patch make\
  \ this explicit and also fix the crash above."
