summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: vxlan: prevent
  NULL deref in vxlan_xmit_one  Neither sock4 nor sock6 pointers are guaranteed to be non-NULL
  in vxlan_xmit_one, e.g. if the iface is brought down. This can lead to the following NULL
  dereference:    BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000010   Oops: Oops:
  0000 [#1] SMP NOPTI   RIP: 0010:vxlan_xmit_one+0xbb3/0x1580   Call Trace:    vxlan_xmit+0x429/0x610    dev_hard_start_xmit+0x55/0xa0    __dev_queue_xmit+0x6d0/0x7f0    ip_finish_output2+0x24b/0x590    ip_output+0x63/0x110  Mentioned
  commits changed the code path in vxlan_xmit_one and as a side effect the sock4/6 pointer validity
  checks in vxlan(6)_get_route were lost. Fix this by adding back checks.  Since both commits
  being fixed were released in the same version (v6.7) and are strongly related, bundle the
  fixes in a single commit.'
