  - CVE-2023-54185
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: remove
  BUG_ON()''s in add_new_free_space()  At add_new_free_space() we have these BUG_ON()''s that
  are there to deal with any failure to add free space to the in memory free space cache. Such
  failures are mostly -ENOMEM that should be very rare. However there''s no need to have these
  BUG_ON()''s, we can just return any error to the caller and all callers and their upper call
  chain are already dealing with errors.  So just make add_new_free_space() return any errors,
  while removing the BUG_ON()''s, and returning the total amount of added free space to an optional
  u64 pointer argument.'
