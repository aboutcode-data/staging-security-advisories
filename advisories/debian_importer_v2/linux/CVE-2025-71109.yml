summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  MIPS: ftrace:
  Fix memory corruption when kernel is located beyond 32 bits  Since commit e424054000878 ("MIPS:
  Tracing: Reduce the overhead of dynamic Function Tracer"), the macro UASM_i_LA_mostly has
  been used, and this macro can generate more than 2 instructions. At the same time, the code
  in ftrace assumes that no more than 2 instructions can be generated, which is why it stores
  them in an int[2] array. However, as previously noted, the macro UASM_i_LA_mostly (and now
  UASM_i_LA) causes a buffer overflow when _mcount is beyond 32 bits. This leads to corruption
  of the variables located in the __read_mostly section.  This corruption was observed because
  the variable __cpu_primary_thread_mask was corrupted, causing a hang very early during boot.  This
  fix prevents the corruption by avoiding the generation of instructions if they could exceed
  2 instructions in length. Fortunately, insn_la_mcount is only used if the instrumented code
  is located outside the kernel code section, so dynamic ftrace can still be used, albeit in
  a more limited scope. This is still preferable to corrupting memory and/or crashing the kernel.'
