summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: usb: aqc111:
  Fix out-of-bounds accesses in RX fixup  aqc111_rx_fixup() contains several out-of-bounds accesses
  that can be triggered by a malicious (or defective) USB device, in particular:   - The metadata
  array (desc_offset..desc_offset+2*pkt_count) can be out of bounds,    causing OOB reads and
  (on big-endian systems) OOB endianness flips.  - A packet can overlap the metadata array,
  causing a later OOB    endianness flip to corrupt data used by a cloned SKB that has already    been
  handed off into the network stack.  - A packet SKB can be constructed whose tail is far beyond
  its end,    causing out-of-bounds heap data to be considered part of the SKB''s    data.  Found
  doing variant analysis. Tested it with another driver (ax88179_178a), since I don''t have
  a aqc111 device to test it, but the code looks very similar.'
