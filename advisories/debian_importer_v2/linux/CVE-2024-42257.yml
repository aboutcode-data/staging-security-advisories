summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: use memtostr_pad()
  for s_volume_name  As with the other strings in struct ext4_super_block, s_volume_name is
  not NUL terminated. The other strings were marked in commit 072ebb3bffe6 ("ext4: add nonstring
  annotations to ext4.h"). Using strscpy() isn''t the right replacement for strncpy(); it should
  use memtostr_pad() instead.'
