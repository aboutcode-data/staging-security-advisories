summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: SVM: Flush
  pages under kvm->lock to fix UAF in svm_register_enc_region()  Do the cache flush of converted
  pages in svm_register_enc_region() before dropping kvm->lock to fix use-after-free issues
  where region and/or its array of pages could be freed by a different task, e.g. if userspace
  has __unregister_enc_region_locked() already queued up for the region.  Note, the "obvious"
  alternative of using local variables doesn''t fully resolve the bug, as region->pages is also
  dynamically allocated.  I.e. the region structure itself would be fine, but region->pages
  could be freed.  Flushing multiple pages under kvm->lock is unfortunate, but the entire flow
  is a rare slow path, and the manual flush is only needed on CPUs that lack coherency for encrypted
  memory.'
