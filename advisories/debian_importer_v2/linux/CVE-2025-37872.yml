summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: txgbe: fix
  memory leak in txgbe_probe() error path  When txgbe_sw_init() is called, memory is allocated
  for wx->rss_key in wx_init_rss_key(). However, in txgbe_probe() function, the subsequent error
  paths after txgbe_sw_init() don''t free the rss_key. Fix that by freeing it in error path
  along with wx->mac_table.  Also change the label to which execution jumps when txgbe_sw_init()
  fails, because otherwise, it could lead to a double free for rss_key, when the mac_table allocation
  fails in wx_sw_init().'
