  - CVE-2024-36477
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tpm_tis_spi:
  Account for SPI header when allocating TPM SPI xfer buffer  The TPM SPI transfer mechanism
  uses MAX_SPI_FRAMESIZE for computing the maximum transfer length and the size of the transfer
  buffer. As such, it does not account for the 4 bytes of header that prepends the SPI data
  frame. This can result in out-of-bounds accesses and was confirmed with KASAN.  Introduce
  SPI_HDRSIZE to account for the header and use to allocate the transfer buffer.'
