summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PCI: tegra194:
  Move controller cleanups to pex_ep_event_pex_rst_deassert()  Currently, the endpoint cleanup
  function dw_pcie_ep_cleanup() and EPF deinit notify function pci_epc_deinit_notify() are called
  during the execution of pex_ep_event_pex_rst_assert() i.e., when the host has asserted PERST#.
  But quickly after this step, refclk will also be disabled by the host.  All of the tegra194
  endpoint SoCs supported as of now depend on the refclk from the host for keeping the controller
  operational. Due to this limitation, any access to the hardware registers in the absence of
  refclk will result in a whole endpoint crash. Unfortunately, most of the controller cleanups
  require accessing the hardware registers (like eDMA cleanup performed in dw_pcie_ep_cleanup(),
  etc...). So these cleanup functions can cause the crash in the endpoint SoC once host asserts
  PERST#.  One way to address this issue is by generating the refclk in the endpoint itself
  and not depending on the host. But that is not always possible as some of the endpoint designs
  do require the endpoint to consume refclk from the host.  Thus, fix this crash by moving the
  controller cleanups to the start of the pex_ep_event_pex_rst_deassert() function. This function
  is called whenever the host has deasserted PERST# and it is guaranteed that the refclk would
  be active at this point. So at the start of this function (after enabling resources) the controller
  cleanup can be performed. Once finished, rest of the code execution for PERST# deassert can
  continue as usual.'
