summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/handshake:
  duplicate handshake cancellations leak socket  When a handshake request is cancelled it is
  removed from the handshake_net->hn_requests list, but it is still present in the handshake_rhashtbl
  until it is destroyed.  If a second cancellation request arrives for the same handshake request,
  then remove_pending() will return false... and assuming HANDSHAKE_F_REQ_COMPLETED isn''t set
  in req->hr_flags, we''ll continue processing through the out_true label, where we put another
  reference on the sock and a refcount underflow occurs.  This can happen for example if a handshake
  times out - particularly if the SUNRPC client sends the AUTH_TLS probe to the server but doesn''t
  follow it up with the ClientHello due to a problem with tlshd.  When the timeout is hit on
  the server, the server will send a FIN, which triggers a cancellation request via xs_reset_transport().  When
  the timeout is hit on the client, another cancellation request happens via xs_tls_handshake_sync().  Add
  a test_and_set_bit(HANDSHAKE_F_REQ_COMPLETED) in the pending cancel path so duplicate cancels
  can be detected.'
