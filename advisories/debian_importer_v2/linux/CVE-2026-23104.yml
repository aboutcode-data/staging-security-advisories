summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ice: fix devlink
  reload call trace  Commit 4da71a77fc3b ("ice: read internal temperature sensor") introduced
  internal temperature sensor reading via HWMON. ice_hwmon_init() was added to ice_init_feature()
  and ice_hwmon_exit() was added to ice_remove(). As a result if devlink reload is used to reinit
  the device and then the driver is removed, a call trace can occur.  BUG: unable to handle
  page fault for address: ffffffffc0fd4b5d Call Trace:  string+0x48/0xe0  vsnprintf+0x1f9/0x650  sprintf+0x62/0x80  name_show+0x1f/0x30  dev_attr_show+0x19/0x60  The
  call trace repeats approximately every 10 minutes when system monitoring tools (e.g., sadc)
  attempt to read the orphaned hwmon sysfs attributes that reference freed module memory.  The
  sequence is: 1. Driver load, ice_hwmon_init() gets called from ice_init_feature() 2. Devlink
  reload down, flow does not call ice_remove() 3. Devlink reload up, ice_hwmon_init() gets called
  from    ice_init_feature() resulting in a second instance 4. Driver unload, ice_hwmon_exit()
  called from ice_remove() leaving the    first hwmon instance orphaned with dangling pointer  Fix
  this by moving ice_hwmon_exit() from ice_remove() to ice_deinit_features() to ensure proper
  cleanup symmetry with ice_hwmon_init().'
