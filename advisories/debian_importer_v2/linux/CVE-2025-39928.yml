summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i2c: rtl9300:
  ensure data length is within supported range  Add an explicit check for the xfer length to
  ''rtl9300_i2c_config_xfer'' to ensure the data length isn''t within the supported range. In
  particular a data length of 0 is not supported by the hardware and causes unintended or destructive
  behaviour.  This limitation becomes obvious when looking at the register documentation [1].
  4 bits are reserved for DATA_WIDTH and the value of these 4 bits is used as N + 1, allowing
  a data length range of 1 <= len <= 16.  Affected by this is the SMBus Quick Operation which
  works with a data length of 0. Passing 0 as the length causes an underflow of the value due
  to:  (len - 1) & 0xf  and effectively specifying a transfer length of 16 via the registers.
  This causes a 16-byte write operation instead of a Quick Write. For example, on SFP modules
  without write-protected EEPROM this soft-bricks them by overwriting some initial bytes.  For
  completeness, also add a quirk for the zero length.  [1] https://svanheule.net/realtek/longan/register/i2c_mst1_ctrl2'
