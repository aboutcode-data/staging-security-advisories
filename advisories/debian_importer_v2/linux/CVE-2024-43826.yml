  - CVE-2024-43826
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfs: pass explicit
  offset/count to trace events  nfs_folio_length is unsafe to use without having the folio locked
  and a check for a NULL ->f_mapping that protects against truncations and can lead to kernel
  crashes.  E.g. when running xfstests generic/065 with all nfs trace points enabled.  Follow
  the model of the XFS trace points and pass in an explіcit offset and length.  This has the
  additional benefit that these values can be more accurate as some of the users touch partial
  folio ranges.'
