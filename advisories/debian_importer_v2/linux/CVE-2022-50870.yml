summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powerpc/rtas:
  avoid device tree lookups in rtas_os_term()  rtas_os_term() is called during panic. Its behavior
  depends on a couple of conditions in the /rtas node of the device tree, the traversal of which
  entails locking and local IRQ state changes. If the kernel panics while devtree_lock is held,
  rtas_os_term() as currently written could hang.  Instead of discovering the relevant characteristics
  at panic time, cache them in file-static variables at boot. Note the lookup for "ibm,extended-os-term"
  is converted to of_property_read_bool() since it is a boolean property, not an RTAS function
  token.  [mpe: Incorporate suggested change from Nick]'
