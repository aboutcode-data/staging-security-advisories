  - CVE-2018-13093
summary: An issue was discovered in fs/xfs/xfs_icache.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3.
  There is a NULL pointer dereference and panic in lookup_slow() on a NULL inode->i_ops pointer
  when doing pathwalks on a corrupted xfs image. This occurs because of a lack of proper validation
  that cached inodes are free during allocation.
