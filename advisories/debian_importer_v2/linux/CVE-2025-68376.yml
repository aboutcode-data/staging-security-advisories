summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  coresight: ETR:
  Fix ETR buffer use-after-free issue  When ETR is enabled as CS_MODE_SYSFS, if the buffer size
  is changed and enabled again, currently sysfs_buf will point to the newly allocated memory(buf_new)
  and free the old memory(buf_old). But the etr_buf that is being used by the ETR remains pointed
  to buf_old, not updated to buf_new. In this case, it will result in a memory use-after-free
  issue.  Fix this by checking ETR''s mode before updating and releasing buf_old, if the mode
  is CS_MODE_SYSFS, then skip updating and releasing it.'
