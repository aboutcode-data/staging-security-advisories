summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  w1: fix NULL
  pointer dereference in probe  The w1_uart_probe() function calls w1_uart_serdev_open() (which
  includes devm_serdev_device_open()) before setting the client ops via serdev_device_set_client_ops().
  This ordering can trigger a NULL pointer dereference in the serdev controller''s receive_buf
  handler, as it assumes serdev->ops is valid when SERPORT_ACTIVE is set.  This is similar to
  the issue fixed in commit 5e700b384ec1 ("platform/chrome: cros_ec_uart: properly fix race
  condition") where devm_serdev_device_open() was called before fully initializing the device.  Fix
  the race by ensuring client ops are set before enabling the port via w1_uart_serdev_open().'
