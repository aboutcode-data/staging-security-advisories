summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  hid: cp2112:
  Fix duplicate workqueue initialization  Previously the cp2112 driver called INIT_DELAYED_WORK
  within cp2112_gpio_irq_startup, resulting in duplicate initilizations of the workqueue on
  subsequent IRQ startups following an initial request. This resulted in a warning in set_work_data
  in workqueue.c, as well as a rare NULL dereference within process_one_work in workqueue.c.  Initialize
  the workqueue within _probe instead.'
