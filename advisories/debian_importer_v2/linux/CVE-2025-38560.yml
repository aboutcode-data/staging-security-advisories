summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/sev: Evict
  cache lines during SNP memory validation  An SNP cache coherency vulnerability requires a
  cache line eviction mitigation when validating memory after a page state change to private.
  The specific mitigation is to touch the first and last byte of each 4K page that is being
  validated. There is no need to perform the mitigation when performing a page state change
  to shared and rescinding validation.  CPUID bit Fn8000001F_EBX[31] defines the COHERENCY_SFW_NO
  CPUID bit that, when set, indicates that the software mitigation for this vulnerability is
  not needed.  Implement the mitigation and invoke it when validating memory (making it private)
  and the COHERENCY_SFW_NO bit is not set, indicating the SNP guest is vulnerable.'
