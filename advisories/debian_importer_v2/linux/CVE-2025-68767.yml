summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  hfsplus: Verify
  inode mode when loading from disk  syzbot is reporting that S_IFMT bits of inode->i_mode can
  become bogus when the S_IFMT bits of the 16bits "mode" field loaded from disk are corrupted.  According
  to [1], the permissions field was treated as reserved in Mac OS 8 and 9. According to [2],
  the reserved field was explicitly initialized with 0, and that field must remain 0 as long
  as reserved. Therefore, when the "mode" field is not 0 (i.e. no longer reserved), the file
  must be S_IFDIR if dir == 1, and the file must be one of S_IFREG/S_IFLNK/S_IFCHR/ S_IFBLK/S_IFIFO/S_IFSOCK
  if dir == 0.'
