summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: hda: cs35l56:
  Fix lifetime of cs_dsp instance  The cs_dsp instance is initialized in the driver probe()
  so it should be freed in the driver remove(). Also fix a missing call to cs_dsp_remove() in
  the error path of cs35l56_hda_common_probe().  The call to cs_dsp_remove() was being done
  in the component unbind callback cs35l56_hda_unbind(). This meant that if the driver was unbound
  and then re-bound it would be using an uninitialized cs_dsp instance.  It is best to initialize
  the cs_dsp instance in probe() so that it can return an error if it fails. The component binding
  API doesn''t have any error handling so there''s no way to handle a failure if cs_dsp was
  initialized in the bind.'
