summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vt: fix memory
  overlapping when deleting chars in the buffer  A memory overlapping copy occurs when deleting
  a long line. This memory overlapping copy can cause data corruption when scr_memcpyw is optimized
  to memcpy because memcpy does not ensure its behavior if the destination buffer overlaps with
  the source buffer. The line buffer is not always broken, because the memcpy utilizes the hardware
  acceleration, whose result is not deterministic.  Fix this problem by using replacing the
  scr_memcpyw with scr_memmovew.'
