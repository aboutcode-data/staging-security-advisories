summary: 'An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 3.2 through 5.10.16, as used by Xen. Grant
  mapping operations often occur in batch hypercalls, where a number of operations are done
  in a single hypercall, the success or failure of each one is reported to the backend driver,
  and the backend driver then loops over the results, performing follow-up actions based on
  the success or failure of each operation. Unfortunately, when running in PV mode, the Linux
  backend drivers mishandle this: Some errors are ignored, effectively implying their success
  from the success of related batch elements. In other cases, errors resulting from one batch
  element lead to further batch elements not being inspected, and hence successful ones to not
  be possible to properly unmap upon error recovery. Only systems with Linux backends running
  in PV mode are vulnerable. Linux backends run in HVM / PVH modes are not vulnerable. This
  affects arch/*/xen/p2m.c and drivers/xen/gntdev.c.'
