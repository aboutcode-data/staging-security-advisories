summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: ufs: core:
  Fix invalid probe error return value  After DME Link Startup, the error return value is set
  to the MIPI UniPro GenericErrorCode which can be 0 (SUCCESS) or 1 (FAILURE).  Upon failure
  during driver probe, the error code 1 is propagated back to the driver probe function which
  must return a negative value to indicate an error, but 1 is not negative, so the probe is
  considered to be successful even though it failed.  Subsequently, removing the driver results
  in an oops because it is not in a valid state.  This happens because none of the callers of
  ufshcd_init() expect a non-negative error code.  Fix the return value and documentation to
  match actual usage.'
