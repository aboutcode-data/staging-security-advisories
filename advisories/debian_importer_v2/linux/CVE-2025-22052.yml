summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  staging: gpib:
  Fix Oops after disconnect in ni_usb  If the usb dongle is disconnected subsequent calls to
  the driver cause a NULL dereference Oops as the bus_interface is set to NULL on disconnect.  This
  problem was introduced by setting usb_dev from the bus_interface for dev_xxx messages.  Previously
  bus_interface was checked for NULL only in the the functions directly calling usb_fill_bulk_urb
  or usb_control_msg.  Check for valid bus_interface on all interface entry points and return
  -ENODEV if it is NULL.'
