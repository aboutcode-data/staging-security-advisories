summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  phy: hisilicon:
  Fix an out of bounds check in hisi_inno_phy_probe()  The size of array ''priv->ports[]'' is
  INNO_PHY_PORT_NUM.  In the for loop, ''i'' is used as the index for array ''priv->ports[]''
  with a check (i > INNO_PHY_PORT_NUM) which indicates that INNO_PHY_PORT_NUM is allowed value
  for ''i'' in the same loop.  This > comparison needs to be changed to >=, otherwise it potentially
  leads to an out of bounds write on the next iteration through the loop'
