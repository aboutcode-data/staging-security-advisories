summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  block: fix memory
  leak in __blkdev_issue_zero_pages  Move the fatal signal check before bio_alloc() to prevent
  a memory leak when BLKDEV_ZERO_KILLABLE is set and a fatal signal is pending.  Previously,
  the bio was allocated before checking for a fatal signal. If a signal was pending, the code
  would break out of the loop without freeing or chaining the just-allocated bio, causing a
  memory leak.  This matches the pattern already used in __blkdev_issue_write_zeroes() where
  the signal check precedes the allocation.'
