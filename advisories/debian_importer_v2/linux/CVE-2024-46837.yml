summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/panthor:
  Restrict high priorities on group_create  We were allowing any users to create a high priority
  group without any permission checks. As a result, this was allowing possible denial of service.  We
  now only allow the DRM master or users with the CAP_SYS_NICE capability to set higher priorities
  than PANTHOR_GROUP_PRIORITY_MEDIUM.  As the sole user of that uAPI lives in Mesa and hardcode
  a value of MEDIUM [1], this should be safe to do.  Additionally, as those checks are performed
  at the ioctl level, panthor_group_create now only check for priority level validity.  [1]https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/blob/f390835074bdf162a63deb0311d1a6de527f9f89/src/gallium/drivers/panfrost/pan_csf.c#L1038'
