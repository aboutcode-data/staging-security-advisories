summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/panthor:
  Fix UAF in panthor_gem_create_with_handle() debugfs code  The object is potentially already
  gone after the drm_gem_object_put(). In general the object should be fully constructed before
  calling drm_gem_handle_create(), except the debugfs tracking uses a separate lock and list
  and separate flag to denotate whether the object is actually initialized.  Since I''m touching
  this all anyway simplify this by only adding the object to the debugfs when it''s ready for
  that, which allows us to delete that separate flag. panthor_gem_debugfs_bo_rm() already checks
  whether we''ve actually been added to the list or this is some error path cleanup.  v2: Fix
  build issues for !CONFIG_DEBUGFS (Adrián)  v3: Add linebreak and remove outdated comment (Liviu)'
