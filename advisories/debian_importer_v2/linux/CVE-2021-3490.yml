summary: 'The eBPF ALU32 bounds tracking for bitwise ops (AND, OR and XOR) in the Linux kernel
  did not properly update 32-bit bounds, which could be turned into out of bounds reads and
  writes in the Linux kernel and therefore, arbitrary code execution. This issue was fixed via
  commit 049c4e13714e ("bpf: Fix alu32 const subreg bound tracking on bitwise operations") (v5.13-rc4)
  and backported to the stable kernels in v5.12.4, v5.11.21, and v5.10.37. The AND/OR issues
  were introduced by commit 3f50f132d840 ("bpf: Verifier, do explicit ALU32 bounds tracking")
  (5.7-rc1) and the XOR variant was introduced by 2921c90d4718 ("bpf:Fix a verifier failure
  with xor") ( 5.10-rc1).'
