  - CVE-2022-3028
summary: A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's IP framework for transforming packets
  (XFRM subsystem) when multiple calls to xfrm_probe_algs occurred simultaneously. This flaw
  could allow a local attacker to potentially trigger an out-of-bounds write or leak kernel
  heap memory by performing an out-of-bounds read and copying it into a socket.
