summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm: fix unexpected
  zeroed page mapping with zram swap  Two processes under CLONE_VM cloning, user process can
  be corrupted by seeing zeroed page unexpectedly.        CPU A                        CPU B    do_swap_page                do_swap_page   SWP_SYNCHRONOUS_IO
  path     SWP_SYNCHRONOUS_IO path   swap_readpage valid data     swap_slot_free_notify       delete
  zram entry                               swap_readpage zeroed(invalid) data                               pte_lock                               map
  the *zero data* to userspace                               pte_unlock   pte_lock   if (!pte_same)     goto
  out_nomap;   pte_unlock   return and next refault will   read zeroed data  The swap_slot_free_notify
  is bogus for CLONE_VM case since it doesn''t increase the refcount of swap slot at copy_mm
  so it couldn''t catch up whether it''s safe or not to discard data from backing device.  In
  the case, only the lock it could rely on to synchronize swap slot freeing is page table lock.  Thus,
  this patch gets rid of the swap_slot_free_notify function.  With this patch, CPU A will see
  correct data.        CPU A                        CPU B    do_swap_page                do_swap_page   SWP_SYNCHRONOUS_IO
  path     SWP_SYNCHRONOUS_IO path                               swap_readpage original data                               pte_lock                               map
  the original data                               swap_free                                 swap_range_free                                   bd_disk->fops->swap_slot_free_notify   swap_readpage
  read zeroed data                               pte_unlock   pte_lock   if (!pte_same)     goto
  out_nomap;   pte_unlock   return   on next refault will see mapped data by CPU B  The concern
  of the patch would increase memory consumption since it could keep wasted memory with compressed
  form in zram as well as uncompressed form in address space.  However, most of cases of zram
  uses no readahead and do_swap_page is followed by swap_free so it will free the compressed
  form from in zram quickly.'
