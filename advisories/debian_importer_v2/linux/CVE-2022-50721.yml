summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dmaengine: qcom-adm:
  fix wrong calling convention for prep_slave_sg  The calling convention for pre_slave_sg is
  to return NULL on error and provide an error log to the system. Qcom-adm instead provide error
  pointer when an error occur. This indirectly cause kernel panic for example for the nandc
  driver that checks only if the pointer returned by device_prep_slave_sg is not NULL. Returning
  an error pointer makes nandc think the device_prep_slave_sg function correctly completed and
  makes the kernel panics later in the code.  While nandc is the one that makes the kernel crash,
  it was pointed out that the real problem is qcom-adm not following calling convention for
  that function.  To fix this, drop returning error pointer and return NULL with an error log.'
