summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  binder: fix async_free_space
  accounting for empty parcels  In 4.13, commit 74310e06be4d ("android: binder: Move buffer
  out of area shared with user space") fixed a kernel structure visibility issue. As part of
  that patch, sizeof(void *) was used as the buffer size for 0-length data payloads so the driver
  could detect abusive clients sending 0-length asynchronous transactions to a server by enforcing
  limits on async_free_size.  Unfortunately, on the "free" side, the accounting of async_free_space
  did not add the sizeof(void *) back. The result was that up to 8-bytes of async_free_space
  were leaked on every async transaction of 8-bytes or less.  These small transactions are uncommon,
  so this accounting issue has gone undetected for several years.  The fix is to use "buffer_size"
  (the allocated buffer size) instead of "size" (the logical buffer size) when updating the
  async_free_space during the free operation. These are the same except for this corner case
  of asynchronous transactions with payloads < 8 bytes.'
