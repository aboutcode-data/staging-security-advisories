  - CVE-2025-21817
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  block: mark GFP_NOIO
  around sysfs ->store()  sysfs ->store is called with queue freezed, meantime we have several
  ->store() callbacks(update_nr_requests, wbt, scheduler) to allocate memory with GFP_KERNEL
  which may run into direct reclaim code path, then potential deadlock can be caused.  Fix the
  issue by marking NOIO around sysfs ->store()'
