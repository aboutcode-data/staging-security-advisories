summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  binder: signal
  epoll threads of self-work  In (e)poll mode, threads often depend on I/O events to determine
  when data is ready for consumption. Within binder, a thread may initiate a command via BINDER_WRITE_READ
  without a read buffer and then make use of epoll_wait() or similar to consume any responses
  afterwards.  It is then crucial that epoll threads are signaled via wakeup when they queue
  their own work. Otherwise, they risk waiting indefinitely for an event leaving their work
  unhandled. What is worse, subsequent commands won''t trigger a wakeup either as the thread
  has pending work.'
