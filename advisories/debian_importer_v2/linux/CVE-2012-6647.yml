aliases:
  - CVE-2012-6647
summary: The futex_wait_requeue_pi function in kernel/futex.c in the Linux kernel before 3.5.1
  does not ensure that calls have two different futex addresses, which allows local users to
  cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified
  other impact via a crafted FUTEX_WAIT_REQUEUE_PI command.
