summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/xe: Fix oops
  in xe_gem_fault when running core_hotunplug test.  I saw an oops in xe_gem_fault when running
  the xe-fast-feedback testlist against the realtime kernel without debug options enabled.  The
  panic happens after core_hotunplug unbind-rebind finishes. Presumably what happens is that
  a process mmaps, unlocks because of the FAULT_FLAG_RETRY_NOWAIT logic, has no process memory
  left, causing ttm_bo_vm_dummy_page() to return VM_FAULT_NOPAGE, since there was nothing left
  to populate, and then oopses in "mem_type_is_vram(tbo->resource->mem_type)" because tbo->resource
  is NULL.  It''s convoluted, but fits the data and explains the oops after the test exits.'
