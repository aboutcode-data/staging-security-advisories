summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bnxt: Do not
  read past the end of test names  Test names were being concatenated based on a offset beyond
  the end of the first name, which tripped the buffer overflow detection logic:   detected buffer
  overflow in strnlen  [...]  Call Trace:  bnxt_ethtool_init.cold+0x18/0x18  Refactor struct
  hwrm_selftest_qlist_output to use an actual array, and adjust the concatenation to use snprintf()
  rather than a series of strncat() calls.'
