  - CVE-2021-3444
summary: 'The bpf verifier in the Linux kernel did not properly handle mod32 destination register
  truncation when the source register was known to be 0. A local attacker with the ability to
  load bpf programs could use this gain out-of-bounds reads in kernel memory leading to information
  disclosure (kernel memory), and possibly out-of-bounds writes that could potentially lead
  to code execution. This issue was addressed in the upstream kernel in commit 9b00f1b78809
  ("bpf: Fix truncation handling for mod32 dst reg wrt zero") and in Linux stable kernels 5.11.2,
  5.10.19, and 5.4.101.'
