summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: uvcvideo:
  Remove dangling pointers  When an async control is written, we copy a pointer to the file
  handle that started the operation. That pointer will be used when the device is done. Which
  could be anytime in the future.  If the user closes that file descriptor, its structure will
  be freed, and there will be one dangling pointer per pending async control, that the driver
  will try to use.  Clean all the dangling pointers during release().  To avoid adding a performance
  penalty in the most common case (no async operation), a counter has been introduced with some
  logic to make sure that it is properly handled.'
