summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  s390/pci: Fix
  potential double remove of hotplug slot  In commit 6ee600bfbe0f ("s390/pci: remove hotplug
  slot when releasing the device") the zpci_exit_slot() was moved from zpci_device_reserved()
  to zpci_release_device() with the intention of keeping the hotplug slot around until the device
  is actually removed.  Now zpci_release_device() is only called once all references are dropped.
  Since the zPCI subsystem only drops its reference once the device is in the reserved state
  it follows that zpci_release_device() must only deal with devices in the reserved state. Despite
  that it contains code to tear down from both configured and standby state. For the standby
  case this already includes the removal of the hotplug slot so would cause a double removal
  if a device was ever removed in either configured or standby state.  Instead of causing a
  potential double removal in a case that should never happen explicitly WARN_ON() if a device
  in non-reserved state is released and get rid of the dead code cases.'
