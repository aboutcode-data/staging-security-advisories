summary: A race problem was seen in the vt_k_ioctl in drivers/tty/vt/vt_ioctl.c in the Linux
  kernel, which may cause an out of bounds read in vt as the write access to vc_mode is not
  protected by lock-in vt_ioctl (KDSETMDE). The highest threat from this vulnerability is to
  data confidentiality.
