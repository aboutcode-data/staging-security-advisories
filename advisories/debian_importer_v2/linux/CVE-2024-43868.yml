summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  riscv/purgatory:
  align riscv_kernel_entry  When alignment handling is delegated to the kernel, everything must
  be word-aligned in purgatory, since the trap handler is then set to the kexec one. Without
  the alignment, hitting the exception would ultimately crash. On other occasions, the kernel''s
  handler would take care of exceptions. This has been tested on a JH7110 SoC with oreboot and
  its SBI delegating unaligned access exceptions and the kernel configured to handle them.'
