summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  perf/dwc_pcie:
  fix duplicate pci_dev devices  During platform_device_register, wrongly using struct device
  pci_dev as platform_data caused a kmemdup copy of pci_dev. Worse still, accessing the duplicated
  device leads to list corruption as its mutex content (e.g., list, magic) remains the same
  as the original.'
