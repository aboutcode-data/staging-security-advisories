summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  erofs: fix out-of-bound
  access when z_erofs_gbuf_growsize() partially fails  If z_erofs_gbuf_growsize() partially
  fails on a global buffer due to memory allocation failure or fault injection (as reported
  by syzbot [1]), new pages need to be freed by comparing to the existing pages to avoid memory
  leaks.  However, the old gbuf->pages[] array may not be large enough, which can lead to null-ptr-deref
  or out-of-bound access.  Fix this by checking against gbuf->nrpages in advance.  [1] https://lore.kernel.org/r/000000000000f7b96e062018c6e3@google.com'
