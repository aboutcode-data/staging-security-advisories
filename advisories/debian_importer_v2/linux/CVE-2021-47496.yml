summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/tls: Fix
  flipped sign in tls_err_abort() calls  sk->sk_err appears to expect a positive value, a convention
  that ktls doesn''t always follow and that leads to memory corruption in other code. For instance,      [kworker]     tls_encrypt_done(...,
  err=<negative error from crypto request>)       tls_err_abort(.., err)         sk->sk_err
  = err;      [task]     splice_from_pipe_feed       ...         tls_sw_do_sendpage           if
  (sk->sk_err) {             ret = -sk->sk_err;  // ret is positive      splice_from_pipe_feed
  (continued)       ret = actor(...)  // ret is still positive and interpreted as bytes                         //
  written, resulting in underflow of buf->len and                         // sd->len, leading
  to huge buf->offset and bogus                         // addresses computed in later calls
  to actor()  Fix all tls_err_abort() callers to pass a negative error code consistently and
  centralize the error-prone sign flip there, throwing in a warning to catch future misuse and
  uninlining the function so it really does only warn once.'
