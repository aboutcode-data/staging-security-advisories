summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Enforce
  expected_attach_type for tailcall compatibility  Yinhao et al. recently reported:    Our fuzzer
  tool discovered an uninitialized pointer issue in the   bpf_prog_test_run_xdp() function within
  the Linux kernel''s BPF subsystem.   This leads to a NULL pointer dereference when a BPF program
  attempts to   deference the txq member of struct xdp_buff object.  The test initializes two
  programs of BPF_PROG_TYPE_XDP: progA acts as the entry point for bpf_prog_test_run_xdp() and
  its expected_attach_type can neither be of be BPF_XDP_DEVMAP nor BPF_XDP_CPUMAP. progA calls
  into a slot of a tailcall map it owns. progB''s expected_attach_type must be BPF_XDP_DEVMAP
  to pass xdp_is_valid_access() validation. The program returns struct xdp_md''s egress_ifindex,
  and the latter is only allowed to be accessed under mentioned expected_attach_type. progB
  is then inserted into the tailcall which progA calls.  The underlying issue goes beyond XDP
  though. Another example are programs of type BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SOCK_ADDR. sock_addr_is_valid_access()
  as well as sock_addr_func_proto() have different logic depending on the programs'' expected_attach_type.
  Similarly, a program attached to BPF_CGROUP_INET4_GETPEERNAME should not be allowed doing
  a tailcall into a program which calls bpf_bind() out of BPF which is only enabled for BPF_CGROUP_INET4_CONNECT.  In
  short, specifying expected_attach_type allows to open up additional functionality or restrictions
  beyond what the basic bpf_prog_type enables. The use of tailcalls must not violate these constraints.
  Fix it by enforcing expected_attach_type in __bpf_prog_map_compatible().  Note that we only
  enforce this for tailcall maps, but not for BPF devmaps or cpumaps: There, the programs are
  invoked through dev_map_bpf_prog_run*() and cpu_map_bpf_prog_run*() which set up a new environment
  / context and therefore these situations are not prone to this issue.'
