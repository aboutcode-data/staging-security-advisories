summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: mscc: ocelot:
  Fix crash when adding interface under a lag  Commit 15faa1f67ab4 ("lan966x: Fix crash when
  adding interface under a lag") fixed a similar issue in the lan966x driver caused by a NULL
  pointer dereference. The ocelot_set_aggr_pgids() function in the ocelot driver has similar
  logic and is susceptible to the same crash.  This issue specifically affects the ocelot_vsc7514.c
  frontend, which leaves unused ports as NULL pointers. The felix_vsc9959.c frontend is unaffected
  as it uses the DSA framework which registers all ports.  Fix this by checking if the port
  pointer is valid before accessing it.'
