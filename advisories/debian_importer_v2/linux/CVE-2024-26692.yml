summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  smb: Fix regression
  in writes when non-standard maximum write size negotiated  The conversion to netfs in the
  6.3 kernel caused a regression when maximum write size is set by the server to an unexpected
  value which is not a multiple of 4096 (similarly if the user overrides the maximum write size
  by setting mount parm "wsize", but sets it to a value that is not a multiple of 4096).  When
  negotiated write size is not a multiple of 4096 the netfs code can skip the end of the final
  page when doing large sequential writes, causing data corruption.  This section of code is
  being rewritten/removed due to a large netfs change, but until that point (ie for the 6.3
  kernel until now) we can not support non-standard maximum write sizes.  Add a warning if a
  user specifies a wsize on mount that is not a multiple of 4096 (and round down), also add
  a change where we round down the maximum write size if the server negotiates a value that
  is not a multiple of 4096 (we also have to check to make sure that we do not round it down
  to zero).'
