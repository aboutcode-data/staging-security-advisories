summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommu/io-pgtable-arm:
  fix size_t signedness bug in unmap path  __arm_lpae_unmap() returns size_t but was returning
  -ENOENT (negative error code) when encountering an unmapped PTE. Since size_t is unsigned,
  -ENOENT (typically -2) becomes a huge positive value (0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFE on 64-bit systems).  This
  corrupted value propagates through the call chain:   __arm_lpae_unmap() returns -ENOENT as
  size_t   -> arm_lpae_unmap_pages() returns it   -> __iommu_unmap() adds it to iova address   ->
  iommu_pgsize() triggers BUG_ON due to corrupted iova  This can cause IOVA address overflow
  in __iommu_unmap() loop and trigger BUG_ON in iommu_pgsize() from invalid address alignment.  Fix
  by returning 0 instead of -ENOENT. The WARN_ON already signals the error condition, and returning
  0 (meaning "nothing unmapped") is the correct semantic for size_t return type. This matches
  the behavior of other io-pgtable implementations (io-pgtable-arm-v7s, io-pgtable-dart) which
  return 0 on error conditions.'
