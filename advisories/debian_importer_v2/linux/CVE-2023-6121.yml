  - CVE-2023-6121
summary: An out-of-bounds read vulnerability was found in the NVMe-oF/TCP subsystem in the Linux
  kernel. This issue may allow a remote attacker to send a crafted TCP packet, triggering a
  heap-based buffer overflow that results in kmalloc data being printed and potentially leaked
  to the kernel ring buffer (dmesg).
