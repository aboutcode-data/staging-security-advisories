summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: ipv4: fix
  one memleak in __inet_del_ifa()  I got the below warning when do fuzzing test: unregister_netdevice:
  waiting for bond0 to become free. Usage count = 2  It can be repoduced via:  ip link add bond0
  type bond sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.bond0.promote_secondaries=1 ip addr add 4.117.174.103/0
  scope 0x40 dev bond0 ip addr add 192.168.100.111/255.255.255.254 scope 0 dev bond0 ip addr
  add 0.0.0.4/0 scope 0x40 secondary dev bond0 ip addr del 4.117.174.103/0 scope 0x40 dev bond0
  ip link delete bond0 type bond  In this reproduction test case, an incorrect ''last_prim''
  is found in __inet_del_ifa(), as a result, the secondary address(0.0.0.4/0 scope 0x40) is
  lost. The memory of the secondary address is leaked and the reference of in_device and net_device
  is leaked.  Fix this problem: Look for ''last_prim'' starting at location of the deleted IP
  and inserting the promoted IP into the location of ''last_prim''.'
