  - CVE-2025-68816
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/mlx5: fw_tracer,
  Validate format string parameters  Add validation for format string parameters in the firmware
  tracer to prevent potential security vulnerabilities and crashes from malformed format strings
  received from firmware.  The firmware tracer receives format strings from the device firmware
  and uses them to format trace messages. Without proper validation, bad firmware could provide
  format strings with invalid format specifiers (e.g., %s, %p, %n) that could lead to crashes,
  or other undefined behavior.  Add mlx5_tracer_validate_params() to validate that all format
  specifiers in trace strings are limited to safe integer/hex formats (%x, %d, %i, %u, %llx,
  %lx, etc.). Reject strings containing other format types that could be used to access arbitrary
  memory or cause crashes. Invalid format strings are added to the trace output for visibility
  with "BAD_FORMAT: " prefix.'
