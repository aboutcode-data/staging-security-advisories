summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  perf: sched:
  Fix perf crash with new is_user_task() helper  In order to do a user space stacktrace the
  current task needs to be a user task that has executed in user space. It use to be possible
  to test if a task is a user task or not by simply checking the task_struct mm field. If it
  was non NULL, it was a user task and if not it was a kernel task.  But things have changed
  over time, and some kernel tasks now have their own mm field.  An idea was made to instead
  test PF_KTHREAD and two functions were used to wrap this check in case it became more complex
  to test if a task was a user task or not[1]. But this was rejected and the C code simply checked
  the PF_KTHREAD directly.  It was later found that not all kernel threads set PF_KTHREAD. The
  io-uring helpers instead set PF_USER_WORKER and this needed to be added as well.  But checking
  the flags is still not enough. There''s a very small window when a task exits that it frees
  its mm field and it is set back to NULL. If perf were to trigger at this moment, the flags
  test would say its a user space task but when perf would read the mm field it would crash
  with at NULL pointer dereference.  Now there are flags that can be used to test if a task
  is exiting, but they are set in areas that perf may still want to profile the user space task
  (to see where it exited). The only real test is to check both the flags and the mm field.  Instead
  of making this modification in every location, create a new is_user_task() helper function
  that does all the tests needed to know if it is safe to read the user space memory or not.  [1]
