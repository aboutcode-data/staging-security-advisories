summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  exfat: add cluster
  chain loop check for dir  An infinite loop may occur if the following conditions occur due
  to file system corruption.  (1) Condition for exfat_count_dir_entries() to loop infinitely.     -
  The cluster chain includes a loop.     - There is no UNUSED entry in the cluster chain.  (2)
  Condition for exfat_create_upcase_table() to loop infinitely.     - The cluster chain of the
  root directory includes a loop.     - There are no UNUSED entry and up-case table entry in
  the cluster       chain of the root directory.  (3) Condition for exfat_load_bitmap() to loop
  infinitely.     - The cluster chain of the root directory includes a loop.     - There are
  no UNUSED entry and bitmap entry in the cluster chain       of the root directory.  (4) Condition
  for exfat_find_dir_entry() to loop infinitely.     - The cluster chain includes a loop.     -
  The unused directory entries were exhausted by some operation.  (5) Condition for exfat_check_dir_empty()
  to loop infinitely.     - The cluster chain includes a loop.     - The unused directory entries
  were exhausted by some operation.     - All files and sub-directories under the directory
  are deleted.  This commit adds checks to break the above infinite loop.'
