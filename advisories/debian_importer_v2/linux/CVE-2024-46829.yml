summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rtmutex: Drop\
  \ rt_mutex::wait_lock before scheduling  rt_mutex_handle_deadlock() is called with rt_mutex::wait_lock\
  \ held.  In the good case it returns with the lock held and in the deadlock case it emits\
  \ a warning and goes into an endless scheduling loop with the lock held, which triggers the\
  \ 'scheduling in atomic' warning.  Unlock rt_mutex::wait_lock in the dead lock case before\
  \ issuing the warning and dropping into the schedule for ever loop.  [ tglx: Moved unlock\
  \ before the WARN(), removed the pointless comment,   \tmassaged changelog, added Fixes tag\
  \ ]"
