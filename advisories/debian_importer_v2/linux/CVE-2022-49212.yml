summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mtd: rawnand:
  atmel: fix refcount issue in atmel_nand_controller_init  The reference counting issue happens
  in several error handling paths on a refcounted object "nc->dmac". In these paths, the function
  simply returns the error code, forgetting to balance the reference count of "nc->dmac", increased
  earlier by dma_request_channel(), which may cause refcount leaks.  Fix it by decrementing
  the refcount of specific object in those error paths.'
