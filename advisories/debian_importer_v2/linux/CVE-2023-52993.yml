summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/i8259: Mark
  legacy PIC interrupts with IRQ_LEVEL  Baoquan reported that after triggering a crash the subsequent
  crash-kernel fails to boot about half of the time. It triggers a NULL pointer dereference
  in the periodic tick code.  This happens because the legacy timer interrupt (IRQ0) is resent
  in software which happens in soft interrupt (tasklet) context. In this context get_irq_regs()
  returns NULL which leads to the NULL pointer dereference.  The reason for the resend is a
  spurious APIC interrupt on the IRQ0 vector which is captured and leads to a resend when the
  legacy timer interrupt is enabled. This is wrong because the legacy PIC interrupts are level
  triggered and therefore should never be resent in software, but nothing ever sets the IRQ_LEVEL
  flag on those interrupts, so the core code does not know about their trigger type.  Ensure
  that IRQ_LEVEL is set when the legacy PCI interrupts are set up.'
