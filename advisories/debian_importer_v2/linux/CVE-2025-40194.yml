  - CVE-2025-40194
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cpufreq: intel_pstate:
  Fix object lifecycle issue in update_qos_request()  The cpufreq_cpu_put() call in update_qos_request()
  takes place too early because the latter subsequently calls freq_qos_update_request() that
  indirectly accesses the policy object in question through the QoS request object passed to
  it.  Fortunately, update_qos_request() is called under intel_pstate_driver_lock, so this issue
  does not matter for changing the intel_pstate operation mode, but it theoretically can cause
  a crash to occur on CPU device hot removal (which currently can only happen in virt, but it
  is formally supported nevertheless).  Address this issue by modifying update_qos_request()
  to drop the reference to the policy later.'
