  - CVE-2022-49186
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: visconti:
  prevent array overflow in visconti_clk_register_gates()  This code was using -1 to represent
  that there was no reset function. Unfortunately, the -1 was stored in u8 so the if (clks[i].rs_id
  >= 0) condition was always true.  This lead to an out of bounds access in visconti_clk_register_gates().'
