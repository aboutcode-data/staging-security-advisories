summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  start_kernel:
  Add __no_stack_protector function attribute  Back during the discussion of commit a9a3ed1eff36
  ("x86: Fix early boot crash on gcc-10, third try") we discussed the need for a function attribute
  to control the omission of stack protectors on a per-function basis; at the time Clang had
  support for no_stack_protector but GCC did not. This was fixed in gcc-11. Now that the function
  attribute is available, let''s start using it.  Callers of boot_init_stack_canary need to
  use this function attribute unless they''re compiled with -fno-stack-protector, otherwise
  the canary stored in the stack slot of the caller will differ upon the call to boot_init_stack_canary.
  This will lead to a call to __stack_chk_fail() then panic.'
