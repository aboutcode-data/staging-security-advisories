  - CVE-2025-71115
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  um: init cpu_tasks[]
  earlier  This is currently done in uml_finishsetup(), but e.g. with KCOV enabled we''ll crash
  because some init code can call into e.g. memparse(), which has coverage annotations, and
  then the checks in check_kcov_mode() crash because current is NULL.  Simply initialize the
  cpu_tasks[] array statically, which fixes the crash. For the later SMP work, it seems to have
  not really caused any problems yet, but initialize all of the entries anyway.'
