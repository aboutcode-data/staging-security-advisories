summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/mm: Fix flush_tlb_range()
  when used for zapping normal PMDs  On the following path, flush_tlb_range() can be used for
  zapping normal PMD entries (PMD entries that point to page tables) together with the PTE entries
  in the pointed-to page table:      collapse_pte_mapped_thp       pmdp_collapse_flush         flush_tlb_range  The
  arm64 version of flush_tlb_range() has a comment describing that it can be used for page table
  removal, and does not use any last-level invalidation optimizations. Fix the X86 version by
  making it behave the same way.  Currently, X86 only uses this information for the following
  two purposes, which I think means the issue doesn''t have much impact:   - In native_flush_tlb_multi()
  for checking if lazy TLB CPUs need to be    IPI''d to avoid issues with speculative page table
  walks.  - In Hyper-V TLB paravirtualization, again for lazy TLB stuff.  The patch "x86/mm:
  only invalidate final translations with INVLPGB" which is currently under review (see <https://lore.kernel.org/all/20241230175550.4046587-13-riel@surriel.com/>)
  would probably be making the impact of this a lot worse.'
