summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: rsi: Fix
  memory corruption due to not set vif driver data size  The struct ieee80211_vif contains trailing
  space for vif driver data, when struct ieee80211_vif is allocated, the total memory size that
  is allocated is sizeof(struct ieee80211_vif) + size of vif driver data. The size of vif driver
  data is set by each WiFi driver as needed.  The RSI911x driver does not set vif driver data
  size, no trailing space for vif driver data is therefore allocated past struct ieee80211_vif
  . The RSI911x driver does however use the vif driver data to store its vif driver data structure
  "struct vif_priv". An access to vif->drv_priv leads to access out of struct ieee80211_vif
  bounds and corruption of some memory.  In case of the failure observed locally, rsi_mac80211_add_interface()
  would write struct vif_priv *vif_info = (struct vif_priv *)vif->drv_priv; vif_info->vap_id
  = vap_idx. This write corrupts struct fq_tin member struct list_head new_flows . The flow
  = list_first_entry(head, struct fq_flow, flowchain); in fq_tin_reset() then reports non-NULL
  bogus address, which when accessed causes a crash.  The trigger is very simple, boot the machine
  with init=/bin/sh , mount devtmpfs, sysfs, procfs, and then do "ip link set wlan0 up", "sleep
  1", "ip link set wlan0 down" and the crash occurs.  Fix this by setting the correct size of
  vif driver data, which is the size of "struct vif_priv", so that memory is allocated and the
  driver can store its driver data in it, instead of corrupting memory around it.'
