summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  NFS: Fix LTP
  test failures when timestamps are delegated  The utimes01 and utime06 tests fail when delegated
  timestamps are enabled, specifically in subtests that modify the atime and mtime fields using
  the ''nobody'' user ID.  The problem can be reproduced as follow:  # echo "/media *(rw,no_root_squash,sync)"
  >> /etc/exports # export -ra # mount -o rw,nfsvers=4.2 127.0.0.1:/media /tmpdir # cd /opt/ltp
  # ./runltp -d /tmpdir -s utimes01 # ./runltp -d /tmpdir -s utime06  This issue occurs because
  nfs_setattr does not verify the inode''s UID against the caller''s fsuid when delegated timestamps
  are permitted for the inode.  This patch adds the UID check and if it does not match then
  the request is sent to the server for permission checking.'
