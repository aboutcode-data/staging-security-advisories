summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ipvlan: Make
  the addrs_lock be per port  Make the addrs_lock be per port, not per ipvlan dev.  Initial
  code seems to be written in the assumption, that any address change must occur under RTNL.
  But it is not so for the case of IPv6. So  1) Introduce per-port addrs_lock.  2) It was needed
  to fix places where it was forgotten to take lock (ipvlan_open/ipvlan_close)  This appears
  to be a very minor problem though. Since it''s highly unlikely that ipvlan_add_addr() will
  be called on 2 CPU simultaneously. But nevertheless, this could cause:  1) False-negative
  of ipvlan_addr_busy(): one interface iterated through all port->ipvlans + ipvlan->addrs under
  some ipvlan spinlock, and another added IP under its own lock. Though this is only possible
  for IPv6, since looks like only ipvlan_addr6_event() can be called without rtnl_lock.  2)
  Race since ipvlan_ht_addr_add(port) is called under different ipvlan->addrs_lock locks  This
  should not affect performance, since add/remove IP is a rare situation and spinlock is not
  taken on fast paths.'
