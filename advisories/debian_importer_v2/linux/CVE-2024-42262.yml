summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/v3d: Fix
  potential memory leak in the performance extension  If fetching of userspace memory fails
  during the main loop, all drm sync objs looked up until that point will be leaked because
  of the missing drm_syncobj_put.  Fix it by exporting and using a common cleanup helper.  (cherry
  picked from commit 484de39fa5f5b7bd0c5f2e2c5265167250ef7501)'
