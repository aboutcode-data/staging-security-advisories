  - CVE-2023-53298
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfc: fix memory
  leak of se_io context in nfc_genl_se_io  The callback context for sending/receiving APDUs
  to/from the selected secure element is allocated inside nfc_genl_se_io and supposed to be
  eventually freed in se_io_cb callback function. However, there are several error paths where
  the bwi_timer is not charged to call se_io_cb later, and the cb_context is leaked.  The patch
  proposes to free the cb_context explicitly on those error paths.  At the moment we can''t
  simply check ''dev->ops->se_io()'' return value as it may be negative in both cases: when
  the timer was charged and was not.'
