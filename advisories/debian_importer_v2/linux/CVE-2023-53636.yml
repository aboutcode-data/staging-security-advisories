summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: microchip:
  fix potential UAF in auxdev release callback  Similar to commit 1c11289b34ab ("peci: cpu:
  Fix use-after-free in adev_release()"), the auxiliary device is not torn down in the correct
  order. If auxiliary_device_add() fails, the release callback will be called twice, resulting
  in a UAF. Due to timing, the auxdev code in this driver "took inspiration" from the aforementioned
  commit, and thus its bugs too!  Moving auxiliary_device_uninit() to the unregister callback
  instead avoids the issue.'
