summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: hda: fix
  a possible null-pointer dereference due to data race in snd_hdac_regmap_sync()  The variable
  codec->regmap is often protected by the lock codec->regmap_lock when is accessed. However,
  it is accessed without holding the lock when is accessed in snd_hdac_regmap_sync():    if
  (codec->regmap)  In my opinion, this may be a harmful race, because if codec->regmap is set
  to NULL right after the condition is checked, a null-pointer dereference can occur in the
  called function regcache_sync():    map->lock(map->lock_arg); --> Line 360 in drivers/base/regmap/regcache.c  To
  fix this possible null-pointer dereference caused by data race, the mutex_lock coverage is
  extended to protect the if statement as well as the function call to regcache_sync().  [ Note:
  the lack of the regmap_lock itself is harmless for the current   codec driver implementations,
  as snd_hdac_regmap_sync() is only for   PM runtime resume that is prohibited during the codec
  probe.   But the change makes the whole code more consistent, so it''s merged   as is -- tiwai
