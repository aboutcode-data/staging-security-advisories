summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: Fix\
  \ possible deadlock in rfcomm_sk_state_change  syzbot reports a possible deadlock in rfcomm_sk_state_change\
  \ [1]. While rfcomm_sock_connect acquires the sk lock and waits for the rfcomm lock, rfcomm_sock_release\
  \ could have the rfcomm lock and hit a deadlock for acquiring the sk lock. Here's a simplified\
  \ flow:  rfcomm_sock_connect:   lock_sock(sk)   rfcomm_dlc_open:     rfcomm_lock()  rfcomm_sock_release:\
  \   rfcomm_sock_shutdown:     rfcomm_lock()     __rfcomm_dlc_close:         rfcomm_k_state_change:\
  \ \t  lock_sock(sk)  This patch drops the sk lock before calling rfcomm_dlc_open to avoid\
  \ the possible deadlock and holds sk's reference count to prevent use-after-free after rfcomm_dlc_open\
  \ completes."
