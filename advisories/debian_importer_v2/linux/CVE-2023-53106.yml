summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfc: st-nci:
  Fix use after free bug in ndlc_remove due to race condition  This bug influences both st_nci_i2c_remove
  and st_nci_spi_remove. Take st_nci_i2c_remove as an example.  In st_nci_i2c_probe, it called
  ndlc_probe and bound &ndlc->sm_work with llt_ndlc_sm_work.  When it calls ndlc_recv or timeout
  handler, it will finally call schedule_work to start the work.  When we call st_nci_i2c_remove
  to remove the driver, there may be a sequence as follows:  Fix it by finishing the work before
  cleanup in ndlc_remove  CPU0                  CPU1                      |llt_ndlc_sm_work
