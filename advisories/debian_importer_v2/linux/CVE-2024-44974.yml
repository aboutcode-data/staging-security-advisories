summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mptcp: pm: avoid
  possible UaF when selecting endp  select_local_address() and select_signal_address() both
  select an endpoint entry from the list inside an RCU protected section, but return a reference
  to it, to be read later on. If the entry is dereferenced after the RCU unlock, reading info
  could cause a Use-after-Free.  A simple solution is to copy the required info while inside
  the RCU protected section to avoid any risk of UaF later. The address ID might need to be
  modified later to handle the ID0 case later, so a copy seems OK to deal with.'
