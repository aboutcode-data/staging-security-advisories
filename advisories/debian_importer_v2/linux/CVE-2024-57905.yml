summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iio: adc: ti-ads1119:
  fix information leak in triggered buffer  The ''scan'' local struct is used to push data to
  user space from a triggered buffer, but it has a hole between the sample (unsigned int) and
  the timestamp. This hole is never initialized.  Initialize the struct to zero before using
  it to avoid pushing uninitialized information to userspace.'
