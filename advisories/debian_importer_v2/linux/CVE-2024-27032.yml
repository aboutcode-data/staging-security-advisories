summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  f2fs: fix to
  avoid potential panic during recovery  During recovery, if FAULT_BLOCK is on, it is possible
  that f2fs_reserve_new_block() will return -ENOSPC during recovery, then it may trigger panic.  Also,
  if fault injection rate is 1 and only FAULT_BLOCK fault type is on, it may encounter deadloop
  in loop of block reservation.  Let''s change as below to fix these issues: - remove bug_on()
  to avoid panic. - limit the loop count of block reservation to avoid potential deadloop.'
