  - CVE-2022-48991
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/khugepaged:
  invoke MMU notifiers in shmem/file collapse paths  Any codepath that zaps page table entries
  must invoke MMU notifiers to ensure that secondary MMUs (like KVM) don''t keep accessing pages
  which aren''t mapped anymore.  Secondary MMUs don''t hold their own references to pages that
  are mirrored over, so failing to notify them can lead to page use-after-free.  I''m marking
  this as addressing an issue introduced in commit f3f0e1d2150b ("khugepaged: add support of
  collapse for tmpfs/shmem pages"), but most of the security impact of this only came in commit
  27e1f8273113 ("khugepaged: enable collapse pmd for pte-mapped THP"), which actually omitted
  flushes for the removal of present PTEs, not just for the removal of empty page tables.'
