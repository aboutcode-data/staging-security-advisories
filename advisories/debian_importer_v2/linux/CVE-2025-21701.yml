summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: avoid race
  between device unregistration and ethnl ops  The following trace can be seen if a device is
  being unregistered while its number of channels are being modified.    DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(lock->magic
  != lock)   WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 3754 at kernel/locking/mutex.c:564 __mutex_lock+0xc8a/0x1120   CPU:
  3 UID: 0 PID: 3754 Comm: ethtool Not tainted 6.13.0-rc6+ #771   RIP: 0010:__mutex_lock+0xc8a/0x1120   Call
  Trace:    <TASK>    ethtool_check_max_channel+0x1ea/0x880    ethnl_set_channels+0x3c3/0xb10    ethnl_default_set_doit+0x306/0x650    genl_family_rcv_msg_doit+0x1e3/0x2c0    genl_rcv_msg+0x432/0x6f0    netlink_rcv_skb+0x13d/0x3b0    genl_rcv+0x28/0x40    netlink_unicast+0x42e/0x720    netlink_sendmsg+0x765/0xc20    __sys_sendto+0x3ac/0x420    __x64_sys_sendto+0xe0/0x1c0    do_syscall_64+0x95/0x180    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e  This
  is because unregister_netdevice_many_notify might run before the rtnl lock section of ethnl
  operations, eg. set_channels in the above example. In this example the rss lock would be destroyed
  by the device unregistration path before being used again, but in general running ethnl operations
  while dismantle has started is not a good idea.  Fix this by denying any operation on devices
  being unregistered. A check was already there in ethnl_ops_begin, but not wide enough.  Note
  that the same issue cannot be seen on the ioctl version (__dev_ethtool) because the device
  reference is retrieved from within the rtnl lock section there. Once dismantle started, the
  net device is unlisted and no reference will be found.'
