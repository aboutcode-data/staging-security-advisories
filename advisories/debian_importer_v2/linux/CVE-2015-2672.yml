aliases:
  - CVE-2015-2672
summary: The xsave/xrstor implementation in arch/x86/include/asm/xsave.h in the Linux kernel
  before 3.19.2 creates certain .altinstr_replacement pointers and consequently does not provide
  any protection against instruction faulting, which allows local users to cause a denial of
  service (panic) by triggering a fault, as demonstrated by an unaligned memory operand or a
  non-canonical address memory operand.
