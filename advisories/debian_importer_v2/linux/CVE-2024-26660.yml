summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display:
  Implement bounds check for stream encoder creation in DCN301  ''stream_enc_regs'' array is
  an array of dcn10_stream_enc_registers structures. The array is initialized with four elements,
  corresponding to the four calls to stream_enc_regs() in the array initializer. This means
  that valid indices for this array are 0, 1, 2, and 3.  The error message ''stream_enc_regs''
  4 <= 5 below, is indicating that there is an attempt to access this array with an index of
  5, which is out of bounds. This could lead to undefined behavior  Here, eng_id is used as
  an index to access the stream_enc_regs array. If eng_id is 5, this would result in an out-of-bounds
  access on the stream_enc_regs array.  Thus fixing Buffer overflow error in dcn301_stream_encoder_create
  reported by Smatch: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/resource/dcn301/dcn301_resource.c:1011
  dcn301_stream_encoder_create() error: buffer overflow ''stream_enc_regs'' 4 <= 5'
