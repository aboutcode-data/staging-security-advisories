summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: timer:
  Don''t take register_mutex with copy_from/to_user()  The infamous mmap_lock taken in copy_from/to_user()
  can be often problematic when it''s called inside another mutex, as they might lead to deadlocks.  In
  the case of ALSA timer code, the bad pattern is with guard(mutex)(&register_mutex) that covers
  copy_from/to_user() -- which was mistakenly introduced at converting to guard(), and it had
  been carefully worked around in the past.  This patch fixes those pieces simply by moving
  copy_from/to_user() out of the register mutex lock again.'
