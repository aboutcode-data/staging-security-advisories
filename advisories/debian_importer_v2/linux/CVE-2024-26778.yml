  - CVE-2024-26778
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fbdev: savage:
  Error out if pixclock equals zero  The userspace program could pass any values to the driver
  through ioctl() interface. If the driver doesn''t check the value of pixclock, it may cause
  divide-by-zero error.  Although pixclock is checked in savagefb_decode_var(), but it is not
  checked properly in savagefb_probe(). Fix this by checking whether pixclock is zero in the
  function savagefb_check_var() before info->var.pixclock is used as the divisor.  This is similar
  to CVE-2022-3061 in i740fb which was fixed by commit 15cf0b8.'
