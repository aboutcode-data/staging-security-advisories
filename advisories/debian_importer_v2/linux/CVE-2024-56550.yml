  - CVE-2024-56550
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  s390/stacktrace:
  Use break instead of return statement  arch_stack_walk_user_common() contains a return statement
  instead of a break statement in case store_ip() fails while trying to store a callchain entry
  of a user space process. This may lead to a missing pagefault_enable() call.  If this happens
  any subsequent page fault of the process won''t be resolved by the page fault handler and
  this in turn will lead to the process being killed.  Use a break instead of a return statement
  to fix this.'
