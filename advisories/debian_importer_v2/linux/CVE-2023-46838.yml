  - CVE-2023-46838
summary: Transmit requests in Xen's virtual network protocol can consist of multiple parts.  While
  not really useful, except for the initial part any of them may be of zero length, i.e. carry
  no data at all.  Besides a certain initial portion of the to be transferred data, these parts
  are directly translated into what Linux calls SKB fragments.  Such converted request parts
  can, when for a particular SKB they are all of length zero, lead to a de-reference of NULL
  in core networking code.
