summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dmaengine: stm32:
  dmamux: fix device leak on route allocation  Make sure to drop the reference taken when looking
  up the DMA mux platform device during route allocation.  Note that holding a reference to
  a device does not prevent its driver data from going away so there is no point in keeping
  the reference.'
