summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/tilcdc: Fix
  removal actions in case of failed probe  The drm_kms_helper_poll_fini() and drm_atomic_helper_shutdown()
  helpers should only be called when the device has been successfully registered. Currently,
  these functions are called unconditionally in tilcdc_fini(), which causes warnings during
  probe deferral scenarios.  [    7.972317] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 23 at drivers/gpu/drm/drm_atomic_state_helper.c:175
  drm_atomic_helper_crtc_duplicate_state+0x60/0x68 ... [    8.005820]  drm_atomic_helper_crtc_duplicate_state
  from drm_atomic_get_crtc_state+0x68/0x108 [    8.005858]  drm_atomic_get_crtc_state from drm_atomic_helper_disable_all+0x90/0x1c8

  from tilcdc_fini+0x68/0xf8 [tilcdc] [    8.005957]  tilcdc_fini [tilcdc] from tilcdc_pdev_probe+0xb0/0x6d4
  [tilcdc]  Fix this by rewriting the failed probe cleanup path using the standard goto error
  handling pattern, which ensures that cleanup functions are only called on successfully initialized
  resources. Additionally, remove the now-unnecessary is_registered flag.'
