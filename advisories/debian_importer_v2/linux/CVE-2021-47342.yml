summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: fix possible
  UAF when remounting r/o a mmp-protected file system  After commit 618f003199c6 ("ext4: fix
  memory leak in ext4_fill_super"), after the file system is remounted read-only, there is a
  race where the kmmpd thread can exit, causing sbi->s_mmp_tsk to point at freed memory, which
  the call to ext4_stop_mmpd() can trip over.  Fix this by only allowing kmmpd() to exit when
  it is stopped via ext4_stop_mmpd().  Bug-Report-Link: <20210629143603.2166962-1-yebin10@huawei.com>'
