summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  exec: don''t
  WARN for racy path_noexec check  Both i_mode and noexec checks wrapped in WARN_ON stem from
  an artifact of the previous implementation. They used to legitimately check for the condition,
  but that got moved up in two commits: 633fb6ac3980 ("exec: move S_ISREG() check earlier")
  0fd338b2d2cd ("exec: move path_noexec() check earlier")  Instead of being removed said checks
  are WARN_ON''ed instead, which has some debug value.  However, the spurious path_noexec check
  is racy, resulting in unwarranted warnings should someone race with setting the noexec flag.  One
  can note there is more to perm-checking whether execve is allowed and none of the conditions
  are guaranteed to still hold after they were tested for.  Additionally this does not validate
  whether the code path did any perm checking to begin with -- it will pass if the inode happens
  to be regular.  Keep the redundant path_noexec() check even though it''s mindless nonsense
  checking for guarantee that isn''t given so drop the WARN.  Reword the commentary and do small
  tidy ups while here.  [brauner: keep redundant path_noexec() check]'
