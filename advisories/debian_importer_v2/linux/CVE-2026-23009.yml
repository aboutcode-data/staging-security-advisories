summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xhci: sideband:
  don''t dereference freed ring when removing sideband endpoint  xhci_sideband_remove_endpoint()
  incorrecly assumes that the endpoint is running and has a valid transfer ring.  Lianqin reported
  a crash during suspend/wake-up stress testing, and found the cause to be dereferencing a non-existing
  transfer ring ''ep->ring'' during xhci_sideband_remove_endpoint().  The endpoint and its ring
  may be in unknown state if this function is called after xHCI was reinitialized in resume
  (lost power), or if device is being re-enumerated, disconnected or endpoint already dropped.  Fix
  this by both removing unnecessary ring access, and by checking ep->ring exists before dereferencing
  it. Also make sure endpoint is running before attempting to stop it.  Remove the xhci_initialize_ring_info()
  call during sideband endpoint removal as is it only initializes ring structure enqueue, dequeue
  and cycle state values to their starting values without changing actual hardware enqueue,
  dequeue and cycle state. Leaving them out of sync is worse than leaving it as it is. The endpoint
  will get freed in after this in most usecases.  If the (audio) class driver want''s to reuse
  the endpoint after offload then it is up to the class driver to ensure endpoint is properly
  set up.'
