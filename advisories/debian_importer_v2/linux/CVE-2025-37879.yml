  - CVE-2025-37879
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  9p/net: fix improper
  handling of bogus negative read/write replies  In p9_client_write() and p9_client_read_once(),
  if the server incorrectly replies with success but a negative write/read count then we would
  consider written (negative) <= rsize (positive) because both variables were signed.  Make
  variables unsigned to avoid this problem.  The reproducer linked below now fails with the
  following error instead of a null pointer deref: 9pnet: bogus RWRITE count (4294967295 > 3)'
