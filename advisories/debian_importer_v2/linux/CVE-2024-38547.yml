summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: atomisp:
  ssh_css: Fix a null-pointer dereference in load_video_binaries  The allocation failure of
  mycs->yuv_scaler_binary in load_video_binaries() is followed with a dereference of mycs->yuv_scaler_binary
  after the following call chain:  sh_css_pipe_load_binaries()   |-> load_video_binaries(mycs->yuv_scaler_binary
  == NULL)   |   |-> sh_css_pipe_unload_binaries()         |-> unload_video_binaries()  In unload_video_binaries(),
  it calls to ia_css_binary_unload with argument &pipe->pipe_settings.video.yuv_scaler_binary[i],
  which refers to the same memory slot as mycs->yuv_scaler_binary. Thus, a null-pointer dereference
  is triggered.'
