summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  remoteproc: k3-r5:
  Fix error handling when power-up failed  By simply bailing out, the driver was violating its
  rule and internal assumptions that either both or no rproc should be initialized. E.g., this
  could cause the first core to be available but not the second one, leading to crashes on its
  shutdown later on while trying to dereference that second instance.'
