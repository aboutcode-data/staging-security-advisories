summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  NFS: fix an incorrect
  limit in filelayout_decode_layout()  The "sizeof(struct nfs_fh)" is two bytes too large and
  could lead to memory corruption.  It should be NFS_MAXFHSIZE because that''s the size of the
  ->data[] buffer.  I reversed the size of the arguments to put the variable on the left.'
