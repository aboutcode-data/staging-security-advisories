summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Drivers: vmbus:
  Check for channel allocation before looking up relids  relid2channel() assumes vmbus channel
  array to be allocated when called. However, in cases such as kdump/kexec, not all relids will
  be reset by the host. When the second kernel boots and if the guest receives a vmbus interrupt
  during vmbus driver initialization before vmbus_connect() is called, before it finishes, or
  if it fails, the vmbus interrupt service routine is called which in turn calls relid2channel()
  and can cause a null pointer dereference.  Print a warning and error out in relid2channel()
  for a channel id that''s invalid in the second kernel.'
