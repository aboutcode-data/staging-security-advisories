summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86, relocs:
  Ignore relocations in .notes section  When building with CONFIG_XEN_PV=y, .text symbols are
  emitted into the .notes section so that Xen can find the "startup_xen" entry point. This information
  is used prior to booting the kernel, so relocations are not useful. In fact, performing relocations
  against the .notes section means that the KASLR base is exposed since /sys/kernel/notes is
  world-readable.  To avoid leaking the KASLR base without breaking unprivileged tools that
  are expecting to read /sys/kernel/notes, skip performing relocations in the .notes section.
  The values readable in .notes are then identical to those found in System.map.'
