summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mei: vsc: Fix
  fortify-panic caused by invalid counted_by() use  gcc 15 honors the __counted_by(len) attribute
  on vsc_tp_packet.buf[] and the vsc-tp.c code is using this in a wrong way. len does not contain
  the available size in the buffer, it contains the actual packet length *without* the crc.
  So as soon as vsc_tp_xfer() tries to add the crc to buf[] the fortify-panic handler gets triggered:  [   80.842193]
  memcpy: detected buffer overflow: 4 byte write of buffer size 0 [   80.842243] WARNING: CPU:

  [mei_vsc] [   80.843270]  mei_reset+0x11d/0x420 [mei]  The easiest fix would be to just drop
  the counted-by but with the exception of the ack buffer in vsc_tp_xfer_helper() which only
  contains enough room for the packet-header, all other uses of vsc_tp_packet always use a buffer
  of VSC_TP_MAX_XFER_SIZE bytes for the packet.  Instead of just dropping the counted-by, split
  the vsc_tp_packet struct definition into a header and a full-packet definition and use a fixed
  size buf[] in the packet definition, this way fortify-source buffer overrun checking still
  works when enabled.'
