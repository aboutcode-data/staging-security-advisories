summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fs: sysfs: Fix
  reference leak in sysfs_break_active_protection()  The sysfs_break_active_protection() routine
  has an obvious reference leak in its error path.  If the call to kernfs_find_and_get() fails
  then kn will be NULL, so the companion sysfs_unbreak_active_protection() routine won''t get
  called (and would only cause an access violation by trying to dereference kn->parent if it
  was called).  As a result, the reference to kobj acquired at the start of the function will
  never be released.  Fix the leak by adding an explicit kobject_put() call when kn is NULL.'
