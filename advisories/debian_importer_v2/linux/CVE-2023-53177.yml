summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: hi846:
  fix usage of pm_runtime_get_if_in_use()  pm_runtime_get_if_in_use() does not only return nonzero
  values when the device is in use, it can return a negative errno too.  And especially during
  resuming from system suspend, when runtime pm is not yet up again, -EAGAIN is being returned,
  so the subsequent pm_runtime_put() call results in a refcount underflow.  Fix system-resume
  by handling -EAGAIN of pm_runtime_get_if_in_use().'
