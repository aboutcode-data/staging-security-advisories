  - CVE-2020-35519
summary: An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory access flaw was found in x25_bind in net/x25/af_x25.c
  in the Linux kernel version v5.12-rc5. A bounds check failure allows a local attacker with
  a user account on the system to gain access to out-of-bounds memory, leading to a system crash
  or a leak of internal kernel information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to
  confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.
