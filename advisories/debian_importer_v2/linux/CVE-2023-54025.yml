summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: rsi: Do
  not configure WoWlan in shutdown hook if not enabled  In case WoWlan was never configured
  during the operation of the system, the hw->wiphy->wowlan_config will be NULL. rsi_config_wowlan()
  checks whether wowlan_config is non-NULL and if it is not, then WARNs about it. The warning
  is valid, as during normal operation the rsi_config_wowlan() should only ever be called with
  non-NULL wowlan_config. In shutdown this rsi_config_wowlan() should only ever be called if
  WoWlan was configured before by the user.  Add checks for non-NULL wowlan_config into the
  shutdown hook. While at it, check whether the wiphy is also non-NULL before accessing wowlan_config
  . Drop the single-use wowlan_config variable, just inline it into function call.'
