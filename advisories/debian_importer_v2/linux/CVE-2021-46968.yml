summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  s390/zcrypt:
  fix zcard and zqueue hot-unplug memleak  Tests with kvm and a kmemdebug kernel showed, that
  on hot unplug the zcard and zqueue structs for the unplugged card or queue are not properly
  freed because of a mismatch with get/put for the embedded kref counter.  This fix now adjusts
  the handling of the kref counters. With init the kref counter starts with 1. This initial
  value needs to drop to zero with the unregister of the card or queue to trigger the release
  and free the object.'
