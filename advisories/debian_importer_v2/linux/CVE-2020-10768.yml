  - CVE-2020-10768
summary: A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel before 5.8-rc1 in the prctl() function, where
  it can be used to enable indirect branch speculation after it has been disabled. This call
  incorrectly reports it as being 'force disabled' when it is not and opens the system to Spectre
  v2 attacks. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.
