summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: host: xhci:
  Fix potential memory leak in xhci_alloc_stream_info()  xhci_alloc_stream_info() allocates
  stream context array for stream_info ->stream_ctx_array with xhci_alloc_stream_ctx(). When
  some error occurs, stream_info->stream_ctx_array is not released, which will lead to a memory
  leak.  We can fix it by releasing the stream_info->stream_ctx_array with xhci_free_stream_ctx()
  on the error path to avoid the potential memory leak.'
