summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: x86/mmu:
  Write-protect L2 SPTEs in TDP MMU when clearing dirty status  Check kvm_mmu_page_ad_need_write_protect()
  when deciding whether to write-protect or clear D-bits on TDP MMU SPTEs, so that the TDP MMU
  accounts for any role-specific reasons for disabling D-bit dirty logging.  Specifically, TDP
  MMU SPTEs must be write-protected when the TDP MMU is being used to run an L2 (i.e. L1 has
  disabled EPT) and PML is enabled. KVM always disables PML when running L2, even when L1 and
  L2 GPAs are in the some domain, so failing to write-protect TDP MMU SPTEs will cause writes
  made by L2 to not be reflected in the dirty log.  [sean: massage shortlog and changelog, tweak
