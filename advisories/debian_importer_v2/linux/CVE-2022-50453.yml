  - CVE-2022-50453
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gpiolib: cdev:
  fix NULL-pointer dereferences  There are several places where we can crash the kernel by requesting
  lines, unbinding the GPIO device, then calling any of the system calls relevant to the GPIO
  character device''s annonymous file descriptors: ioctl(), read(), poll().  While I observed
  it with the GPIO simulator, it will also happen for any of the GPIO devices that can be hot-unplugged
  - for instance any HID GPIO expander (e.g. CP2112).  This affects both v1 and v2 uAPI.  This
  fixes it partially by checking if gdev->chip is not NULL but it doesn''t entirely remedy the
  situation as we still have a race condition in which another thread can remove the device
  after the check.'
