summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  arm64: dts: qcom:
  qcs615: fix a crash issue caused by infinite loop for Coresight  An infinite loop has been
  created by the Coresight devices. When only a source device is enabled, the coresight_find_activated_sysfs_sink
  function is recursively invoked in an attempt to locate an active sink device, ultimately
  leading to a stack overflow and system crash. Therefore, disable the replicator1 to break
  the infinite loop and prevent a potential stack overflow.  replicator1_out   ->   funnel_swao_in6   ->   tmc_etf_swao_in   ->  tmc_etf_swao_out      |                                                                     |
