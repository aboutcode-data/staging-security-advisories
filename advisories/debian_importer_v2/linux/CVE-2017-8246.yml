aliases:
  - CVE-2017-8246
summary: In function msm_pcm_playback_close() in all Android releases from CAF using the Linux
  kernel, prtd is assigned substream->runtime->private_data. Later, prtd is freed. However,
  prtd is not sanitized and set to NULL, resulting in a dangling pointer. There are other functions
  that access the same memory (substream->runtime->private_data) with a NULL check, such as
  msm_pcm_volume_ctl_put(), which means this freed memory could be used.
