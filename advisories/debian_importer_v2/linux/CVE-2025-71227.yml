summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: mac80211:
  don''t WARN for connections on invalid channels  It''s not clear (to me) how exactly syzbot
  managed to hit this, but it seems conceivable that e.g. regulatory changed and has disabled
  a channel between scanning (channel is checked to be usable by cfg80211_get_ies_channel_number)
  and connecting on the channel later.  With one scenario that isn''t covered elsewhere described
  above, the warning isn''t good, replace it with a (more informative) error message.'
