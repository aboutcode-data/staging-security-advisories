summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xen-netfront:
  Add missing skb_mark_for_recycle  Notice that skb_mark_for_recycle() is introduced later than
  fixes tag in commit 6a5bcd84e886 ("page_pool: Allow drivers to hint on SKB recycling").  It
  is believed that fixes tag were missing a call to page_pool_release_page() between v5.9 to
  v5.14, after which is should have used skb_mark_for_recycle(). Since v6.6 the call page_pool_release_page()
  were removed (in commit 535b9c61bdef ("net: page_pool: hide page_pool_release_page()") and
  remaining callers converted (in commit 6bfef2ec0172 ("Merge branch ''net-page_pool-remove-page_pool_release_page''")).  This
  leak became visible in v6.8 via commit dba1b8a7ab68 ("mm/page_pool: catch page_pool memory
  leaks").'
