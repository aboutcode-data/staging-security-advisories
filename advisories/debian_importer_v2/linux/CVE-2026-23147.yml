summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: zlib:
  fix the folio leak on S390 hardware acceleration  [BUG] After commit aa60fe12b4f4 ("btrfs:
  zlib: refactor S390x HW acceleration buffer preparation"), we no longer release the folio
  of the page cache of folio returned by btrfs_compress_filemap_get_folio() for S390 hardware
  acceleration path.  [CAUSE] Before that commit, we call kumap_local() and folio_put() after
  handling each folio.  Although the timing is not ideal (it release previous folio at the beginning
  of the loop, and rely on some extra cleanup out of the loop), it at least handles the folio
  release correctly.  Meanwhile the refactored code is easier to read, it lacks the call to
  release the filemap folio.  [FIX] Add the missing folio_put() for copy_data_into_buffer().'
