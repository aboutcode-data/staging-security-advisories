summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  platform/x86/amd/pmc:
  Add support for Van Gogh SoC  The ROG Xbox Ally (non-X) SoC features a similar architecture
  to the Steam Deck. While the Steam Deck supports S3 (s2idle causes a crash), this support
  was dropped by the Xbox Ally which only S0ix suspend.  Since the handler is missing here,
  this causes the device to not suspend and the AMD GPU driver to crash while trying to resume
  afterwards due to a power hang.'
