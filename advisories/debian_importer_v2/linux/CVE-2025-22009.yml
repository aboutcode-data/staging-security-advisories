summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  regulator: dummy:
  force synchronous probing  Sometimes I get a NULL pointer dereference at boot time in kobject_get()
  with the following call stack:  anatop_regulator_probe()  devm_regulator_register()   regulator_register()    regulator_resolve_supply()     kobject_get()  By
  placing some extra BUG_ON() statements I could verify that this is raised because probing
  of the ''dummy'' regulator driver is not completed (''dummy_regulator_rdev'' is still NULL).  In
  the JTAG debugger I can see that dummy_regulator_probe() and anatop_regulator_probe() can
  be run by different kernel threads (kworker/u4:*).  I haven''t further investigated whether
  this can be changed or if there are other possibilities to force synchronization between these
  two probe routines.  On the other hand I don''t expect much boot time penalty by probing the
  ''dummy'' regulator synchronously.'
