summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  accel/qaic: Treat
  remaining == 0 as error in find_and_map_user_pages()  Currently, if find_and_map_user_pages()
  takes a DMA xfer request from the user with a length field set to 0, or in a rare case, the
  host receives QAIC_TRANS_DMA_XFER_CONT from the device where resources->xferred_dma_size is
  equal to the requested transaction size, the function will return 0 before allocating an sgt
  or setting the fields of the dma_xfer struct. In that case, encode_addr_size_pairs() will
  try to access the sgt which will lead to a general protection fault.  Return an EINVAL in
  case the user provides a zero-sized ALP, or the device requests continuation after all of
  the bytes have been transferred.'
