  - CVE-2023-53353
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  accel/habanalabs:
  postpone mem_mgr IDR destruction to hpriv_release()  The memory manager IDR is currently destroyed
  when user releases the file descriptor. However, at this point the user context might be still
  held, and memory buffers might be still in use. Later on, calls to release those buffers will
  fail due to not finding their handles in the IDR, leading to a memory leak. To avoid this
  leak, split the IDR destruction from the memory manager fini, and postpone it to hpriv_release()
  when there is no user context and no buffers are used.'
