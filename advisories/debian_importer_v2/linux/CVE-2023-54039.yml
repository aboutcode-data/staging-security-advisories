summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: j1939: j1939_tp_tx_dat_new():
  fix out-of-bounds memory access  In the j1939_tp_tx_dat_new() function, an out-of-bounds memory
  access could occur during the memcpy() operation if the size of skb->cb is larger than the
  size of struct j1939_sk_buff_cb. This is because the memcpy() operation uses the size of skb->cb,
  leading to a read beyond the struct j1939_sk_buff_cb.  Updated the memcpy() operation to use
  the size of struct j1939_sk_buff_cb instead of the size of skb->cb. This ensures that the
  memcpy() operation only reads the memory within the bounds of struct j1939_sk_buff_cb, preventing
  out-of-bounds memory access.  Additionally, add a BUILD_BUG_ON() to check that the size of
  skb->cb is greater than or equal to the size of struct j1939_sk_buff_cb. This ensures that
  the skb->cb buffer is large enough to hold the j1939_sk_buff_cb structure.  [mkl: rephrase
