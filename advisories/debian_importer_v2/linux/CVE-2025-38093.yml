summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  arm64: dts: qcom:
  x1e80100: Add GPU cooling  Unlike the CPU, the GPU does not throttle its speed automatically
  when it reaches high temperatures. With certain high GPU loads it is possible to reach the
  critical hardware shutdown temperature of 120°C, endangering the hardware and making it impossible
  to run certain applications.  Set up GPU cooling similar to the ACPI tables, by throttling
  the GPU speed when reaching 95°C and polling every 200ms.'
