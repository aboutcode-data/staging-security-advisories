summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  phonet/pep: refuse
  to enable an unbound pipe  This ioctl() implicitly assumed that the socket was already bound
  to a valid local socket name, i.e. Phonet object. If the socket was not bound, two separate
  problems would occur:  1) We''d send an pipe enablement request with an invalid source object.
  2) Later socket calls could BUG on the socket unexpectedly being    connected yet not bound
  to a valid object.'
