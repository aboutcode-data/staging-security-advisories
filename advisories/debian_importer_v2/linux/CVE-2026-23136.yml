summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  libceph: reset
  sparse-read state in osd_fault()  When a fault occurs, the connection is abandoned, reestablished,
  and any pending operations are retried. The OSD client tracks the progress of a sparse-read
  reply using a separate state machine, largely independent of the messenger''s state.  If a
  connection is lost mid-payload or the sparse-read state machine returns an error, the sparse-read
  state is not reset. The OSD client will then interpret the beginning of a new reply as the
  continuation of the old one. If this makes the sparse-read machinery enter a failure state,
  it may never recover, producing loops like:    libceph:  [0] got 0 extents   libceph: data
  len 142248331 != extent len 0   libceph: osd0 (1)...:6801 socket error on read   libceph:
  data len 142248331 != extent len 0   libceph: osd0 (1)...:6801 socket error on read  Therefore,
  reset the sparse-read state in osd_fault(), ensuring retries start from a clean state.'
