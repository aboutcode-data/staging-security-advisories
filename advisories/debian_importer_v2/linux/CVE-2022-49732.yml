summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sock: redo the
  psock vs ULP protection check  Commit 8a59f9d1e3d4 ("sock: Introduce sk->sk_prot->psock_update_sk_prot()")
  has moved the inet_csk_has_ulp(sk) check from sk_psock_init() to the new tcp_bpf_update_proto()
  function. I''m guessing that this was done to allow creating psocks for non-inet sockets.  Unfortunately
  the destruction path for psock includes the ULP unwind, so we need to fail the sk_psock_init()
  itself. Otherwise if ULP is already present we''ll notice that later, and call tcp_update_ulp()
  with the sk_proto of the ULP itself, which will most likely result in the ULP looping its
  callbacks.'
