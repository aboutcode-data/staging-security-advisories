summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  exfat: fix improper
  check of dentry.stream.valid_size  We found an infinite loop bug in the exFAT file system
  that can lead to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition. When a dentry in an exFAT filesystem
  is malformed, the following system calls — SYS_openat, SYS_ftruncate, and SYS_pwrite64 — can
  cause the kernel to hang.  Root cause analysis shows that the size validation code in exfat_find()
  does not check whether dentry.stream.valid_size is negative. As a result, the system calls
  mentioned above can succeed and eventually trigger the DoS issue.  This patch adds a check
  for negative dentry.stream.valid_size to prevent this vulnerability.'
