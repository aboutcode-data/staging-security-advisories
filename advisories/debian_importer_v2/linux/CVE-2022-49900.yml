summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i2c: piix4: Fix
  adapter not be removed in piix4_remove()  In piix4_probe(), the piix4 adapter will be registered
  in:     piix4_probe()      piix4_add_adapters_sb800() / piix4_add_adapter()        i2c_add_adapter()  Based
  on the probed device type, piix4_add_adapters_sb800() or single piix4_add_adapter() will be
  called. For the former case, piix4_adapter_count is set as the number of adapters, while for
  antoher case it is not set and kept default *zero*.  When piix4 is removed, piix4_remove()
  removes the adapters added in piix4_probe(), basing on the piix4_adapter_count value. Because
  the count is zero for the single adapter case, the adapter won''t be removed and makes the
  sources allocated for adapter leaked, such as the i2c client and device.  These sources can
  still be accessed by i2c or bus and cause problems. An easily reproduced case is that if a
  new adapter is registered, i2c will get the leaked adapter and try to call smbus_algorithm,
  which was already freed:  Triggered by: rmmod i2c_piix4 && modprobe max31730   BUG: unable
