summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: uas: fix
  urb unmapping issue when the uas device is remove during ongoing data transfer  When a UAS
  device is unplugged during data transfer, there is a probability of a system panic occurring.
  The root cause is an access to an invalid memory address during URB callback handling. Specifically,
  this happens when the dma_direct_unmap_sg() function is called within the usb_hcd_unmap_urb_for_dma()
  interface, but the sg->dma_address field is 0 and the sg data structure has already been freed.  The
  SCSI driver sends transfer commands by invoking uas_queuecommand_lck() in uas.c, using the
  uas_submit_urbs() function to submit requests to USB. Within the uas_submit_urbs() implementation,
  three URBs (sense_urb, data_urb, and cmd_urb) are sequentially submitted. Device removal may
  occur at any point during uas_submit_urbs execution, which may result in URB submission failure.
  However, some URBs might have been successfully submitted before the failure, and uas_submit_urbs
  will return the -ENODEV error code in this case. The current error handling directly calls
  scsi_done(). In the SCSI driver, this eventually triggers scsi_complete() to invoke scsi_end_request()
  for releasing the sgtable. The successfully submitted URBs, when being unlinked to giveback,
  call usb_hcd_unmap_urb_for_dma() in hcd.c, leading to exceptions during sg unmapping operations
  since the sg data structure has already been freed.  This patch modifies the error condition
  check in the uas_submit_urbs() function. When a UAS device is removed but one or more URBs
  have already been successfully submitted to USB, it avoids immediately invoking scsi_done()
  and save the cmnd to devinfo->cmnd array. If the successfully submitted URBs is completed
  before devinfo->resetting being set, then the scsi_done() function will be called within uas_try_complete()
  after all pending URB operations are finalized. Otherwise, the scsi_done() function will be
  called within uas_zap_pending(), which is executed after usb_kill_anchored_urbs().  The error
  handling only takes effect when uas_queuecommand_lck() calls uas_submit_urbs() and returns
  the error value -ENODEV . In this case, the device is disconnected, and the flow proceeds
  to uas_disconnect(), where uas_zap_pending() is invoked to call uas_try_complete().'
