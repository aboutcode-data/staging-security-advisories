summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: consider\
  \ that tail calls invalidate packet pointers  Tail-called programs could execute any of the\
  \ helpers that invalidate packet pointers. Hence, conservatively assume that each tail call\
  \ invalidates packet pointers.  Making the change in bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data() automatically\
  \ makes use of check_cfg() logic that computes 'changes_pkt_data' effect for global sub-programs,\
  \ such that the following program could be rejected:      int tail_call(struct __sk_buff *sk)\
  \     {     \tbpf_tail_call_static(sk, &jmp_table, 0);     \treturn 0;     }      SEC(\"tc\"\
  )     int not_safe(struct __sk_buff *sk)     {     \tint *p = (void *)(long)sk->data;    \
  \ \t... make p valid ...     \ttail_call(sk);     \t*p = 42; /* this is unsafe */     \t...\
  \     }  The tc_bpf2bpf.c:subprog_tc() needs change: mark it as a function that can invalidate\
  \ packet pointers. Otherwise, it can't be freplaced with tailcall_freplace.c:entry_freplace()\
  \ that does a tail call."
