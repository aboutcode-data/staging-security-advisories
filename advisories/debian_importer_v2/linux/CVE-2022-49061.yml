summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: ethernet:
  stmmac: fix altr_tse_pcs function when using a fixed-link  When using a fixed-link, the altr_tse_pcs
  driver crashes due to null-pointer dereference as no phy_device is provided to tse_pcs_fix_mac_speed
  function. Fix this by adding a check for phy_dev before calling the tse_pcs_fix_mac_speed()
  function.  Also clean up the tse_pcs_fix_mac_speed function a bit. There is no need to check
  for splitter_base and sgmii_adapter_base because the driver will fail if these 2 variables
  are not derived from the device tree.'
