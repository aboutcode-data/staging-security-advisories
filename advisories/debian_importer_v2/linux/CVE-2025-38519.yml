summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/damon: fix
  divide by zero in damon_get_intervals_score()  The current implementation allows having zero
  size regions with no special reasons, but damon_get_intervals_score() gets crashed by divide
  by zero when the region size is zero.    [   29.403950] Oops: divide error: 0000 [#1] SMP
  NOPTI  This patch fixes the bug, but does not disallow zero size regions to keep the backward
  compatibility since disallowing zero size regions might be a breaking change for some users.  In
  addition, the same crash can happen when intervals_goal.access_bp is zero so this should be
  fixed in stable trees as well.'
