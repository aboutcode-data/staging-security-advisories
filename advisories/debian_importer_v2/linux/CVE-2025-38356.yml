summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/xe/guc: Explicitly
  exit CT safe mode on unwind  During driver probe we might be briefly using CT safe mode, which
  is based on a delayed work, but usually we are able to stop this once we have IRQ fully operational.  However,
  if we abort the probe quite early then during unwind we might try to destroy the workqueue
  while there is still a pending delayed work that attempts to restart itself which triggers
  a WARN.  This was recently observed during unsuccessful VF initialization:   [ ] xe 0000:00:02.1:
  probe with driver xe failed with error -62  [ ] ------------[ cut here ]------------  [ ]
  workqueue: cannot queue safe_mode_worker_func [xe] on wq xe-g2h-wq  [ ] WARNING: CPU: 9 PID:
  0 at kernel/workqueue.c:2257 __queue_work+0x287/0x710  [ ] RIP: 0010:__queue_work+0x287/0x710  [
  ] Call Trace:  [ ]  delayed_work_timer_fn+0x19/0x30  [ ]  call_timer_fn+0xa1/0x2a0  Exit the
  CT safe mode on unwind to avoid that warning.  (cherry picked from commit 2ddbb73ec20b98e70a5200cb85deade22ccea2ec)'
