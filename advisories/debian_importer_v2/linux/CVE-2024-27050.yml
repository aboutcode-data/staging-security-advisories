summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  libbpf: Use OPTS_SET()
  macro in bpf_xdp_query()  When the feature_flags and xdp_zc_max_segs fields were added to
  the libbpf bpf_xdp_query_opts, the code writing them did not use the OPTS_SET() macro. This
  causes libbpf to write to those fields unconditionally, which means that programs compiled
  against an older version of libbpf (with a smaller size of the bpf_xdp_query_opts struct)
  will have its stack corrupted by libbpf writing out of bounds.  The patch adding the feature_flags
  field has an early bail out if the feature_flags field is not part of the opts struct (via
  the OPTS_HAS) macro, but the patch adding xdp_zc_max_segs does not. For consistency, this
  fix just changes the assignments to both fields to use the OPTS_SET() macro.'
