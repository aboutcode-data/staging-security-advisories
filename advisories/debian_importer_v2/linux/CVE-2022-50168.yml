summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf, x86: fix
  freeing of not-finalized bpf_prog_pack  syzbot reported a few issues with bpf_prog_pack [1],
  [2]. This only happens with multiple subprogs. In jit_subprogs(), we first call bpf_int_jit_compile()
  on each sub program. And then, we call it on each sub program again. jit_data is not freed
  in the first call of bpf_int_jit_compile(). Similarly we don''t call bpf_jit_binary_pack_finalize()
  in the first call of bpf_int_jit_compile().  If bpf_int_jit_compile() failed for one sub program,
  we will call bpf_jit_binary_pack_finalize() for this sub program. However, we don''t have
  a chance to call it for other sub programs. Then we will hit "goto out_free" in jit_subprogs(),
  and call bpf_jit_free on some subprograms that haven''t got bpf_jit_binary_pack_finalize()
  yet.  At this point, bpf_jit_binary_pack_free() is called and the whole 2MB page is freed
  erroneously.  Fix this with a custom bpf_jit_free() for x86_64, which calls bpf_jit_binary_pack_finalize()
  if necessary. Also, with custom bpf_jit_free(), bpf_prog_aux->use_bpf_prog_pack is not needed
  any more, remove it.  [1] https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=2f649ec6d2eea1495a8f [2]
