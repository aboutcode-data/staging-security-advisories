  - CVE-2023-53704
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: imx: clk-imx8mp:
  improve error handling in imx8mp_clocks_probe()  Replace of_iomap() and kzalloc() with devm_of_iomap()
  and devm_kzalloc() which can automatically release the related memory when the device or driver
  is removed or unloaded to avoid potential memory leak.  In this case, iounmap(anatop_base)
  in line 427,433 are removed as manual release is not required.  Besides, referring to clk-imx8mq.c,
  check the return code of of_clk_add_hw_provider, if it returns negtive, print error info and
  unregister hws, which makes the program more robust.'
