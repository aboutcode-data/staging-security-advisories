summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring/net:
  ensure vectored buffer node import is tied to notification  When support for vectored registered
  buffers was added, the import itself is using ''req'' rather than the notification io_kiocb,
  sr->notif. For non-vectored imports, sr->notif is correctly used. This is important as the
  lifetime of the two may be different. Use the correct io_kiocb for the vectored buffer import.'
