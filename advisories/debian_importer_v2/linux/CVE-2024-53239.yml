summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: 6fire:
  Release resources at card release  The current 6fire code tries to release the resources right
  after the call of usb6fire_chip_abort().  But at this moment, the card object might be still
  in use (as we''re calling snd_card_free_when_closed()).  For avoid potential UAFs, move the
  release of resources to the card''s private_free instead of the manual call of usb6fire_chip_destroy()
  at the USB disconnect callback.'
