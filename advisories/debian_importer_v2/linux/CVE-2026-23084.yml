summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  be2net: Fix NULL
  pointer dereference in be_cmd_get_mac_from_list  When the parameter pmac_id_valid argument
  of be_cmd_get_mac_from_list() is set to false, the driver may request the PMAC_ID from the
  firmware of the network card, and this function will store that PMAC_ID at the provided address
  pmac_id. This is the contract of this function.  However, there is a location within the driver
  where both pmac_id_valid == false and pmac_id == NULL are being passed. This could result
  in dereferencing a NULL pointer.  To resolve this issue, it is necessary to pass the address
  of a stub variable to the function.'
