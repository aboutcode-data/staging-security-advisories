  - CVE-2022-49582
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: dsa: fix
  NULL pointer dereference in dsa_port_reset_vlan_filtering  The "ds" iterator variable used
  in dsa_port_reset_vlan_filtering() -> dsa_switch_for_each_port() overwrites the "dp" received
  as argument, which is later used to call dsa_port_vlan_filtering() proper.  As a result, switches
  which do enter that code path (the ones with vlan_filtering_is_global=true) will dereference
  an invalid dp in dsa_port_reset_vlan_filtering() after leaving a VLAN-aware bridge.  Use a
  dedicated "other_dp" iterator variable to avoid this from happening.'
