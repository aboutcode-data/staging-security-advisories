summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: libwx: fix
  the using of Rx buffer DMA  The wx_rx_buffer structure contained two DMA address fields: ''dma''
  and ''page_dma''. However, only ''page_dma'' was actually initialized and used to program
  the Rx descriptor. But ''dma'' was uninitialized and used in some paths.  This could lead
  to undefined behavior, including DMA errors or use-after-free, if the uninitialized ''dma''
  was used. Althrough such error has not yet occurred, it is worth fixing in the code.'
