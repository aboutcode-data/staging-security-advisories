summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  arm64/pageattr:
  Propagate return value from __change_memory_common  The rodata=on security measure requires
  that any code path which does vmalloc -> set_memory_ro/set_memory_rox must protect the linear
  map alias too. Therefore, if such a call fails, we must abort set_memory_* and caller must
  take appropriate action; currently we are suppressing the error, and there is a real chance
  of such an error arising post commit a166563e7ec3 ("arm64: mm: support large block mapping
  when rodata=full"). Therefore, propagate any error to the caller.'
