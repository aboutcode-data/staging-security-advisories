summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  of: dynamic:
  Synchronize of_changeset_destroy() with the devlink removals  In the following sequence:   1)
  of_platform_depopulate()   2) of_overlay_remove()  During the step 1, devices are destroyed
  and devlinks are removed. During the step 2, OF nodes are destroyed but __of_changeset_entry_destroy()
  can raise warnings related to missing of_node_put():   ERROR: memory leak, expected refcount
  1 instead of 2 ...  Indeed, during the devlink removals performed at step 1, the removal itself
  releasing the device (and the attached of_node) is done by a job queued in a workqueue and
  so, it is done asynchronously with respect to function calls. When the warning is present,
  of_node_put() will be called but wrongly too late from the workqueue job.  In order to be
  sure that any ongoing devlink removals are done before the of_node destruction, synchronize
  the of_changeset_destroy() with the devlink removals.'
