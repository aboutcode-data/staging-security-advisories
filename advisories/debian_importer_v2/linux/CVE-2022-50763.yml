summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: marvell/octeontx
  - prevent integer overflows  The "code_length" value comes from the firmware file.  If your
  firmware is untrusted realistically there is probably very little you can do to protect yourself.  Still
  we try to limit the damage as much as possible. Also Smatch marks any data read from the filesystem
  as untrusted and prints warnings if it not capped correctly.  The "code_length * 2" can overflow.  The
  round_up(ucode_size, 16) + sizeof() expression can overflow too.  Prevent these overflows.'
