summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: rfkill:
  gpio: Fix crash due to dereferencering uninitialized pointer  Since commit 7d5e9737efda ("net:
  rfkill: gpio: get the name and type from device property") rfkill_find_type() gets called
  with the possibly uninitialized "const char *type_name;" local variable.  On x86 systems when
  rfkill-gpio binds to a "BCM4752" or "LNV4752" acpi_device, the rfkill->type is set based on
  the ACPI acpi_device_id:          rfkill->type = (unsigned)id->driver_data;  and there is
  no "type" property so device_property_read_string() will fail and leave type_name uninitialized,
  leading to a potential crash.  rfkill_find_type() does accept a NULL pointer, fix the potential
  crash by initializing type_name to NULL.  Note likely sofar this has not been caught because:  1.
  Not many x86 machines actually have a "BCM4752"/"LNV4752" acpi_device 2. The stack happened
  to contain NULL where type_name is stored'
