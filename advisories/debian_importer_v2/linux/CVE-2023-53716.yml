summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: fix skb
  leak in __skb_tstamp_tx()  Commit 50749f2dd685 ("tcp/udp: Fix memleaks of sk and zerocopy
  skbs with TX timestamp.") added a call to skb_orphan_frags_rx() to fix leaks with zerocopy
  skbs. But it ended up adding a leak of its own. When skb_orphan_frags_rx() fails, the function
  just returns, leaking the skb it just cloned. Free it before returning.  This bug was discovered
  and resolved using Coverity Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) by Synopsys, Inc.'
