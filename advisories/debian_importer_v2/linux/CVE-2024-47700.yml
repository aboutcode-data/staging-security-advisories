summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: check stripe
  size compatibility on remount as well  We disable stripe size in __ext4_fill_super if it is
  not a multiple of the cluster ratio however this check is missed when trying to remount. This
  can leave us with cases where stripe < cluster_ratio after remount:set making EXT4_B2C(sbi->s_stripe)
  become 0 that can cause some unforeseen bugs like divide by 0.  Fix that by adding the check
  in remount path as well.'
