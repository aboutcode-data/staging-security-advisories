summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display:
  Fix out-of-bound accesses  [WHAT & HOW] hpo_stream_to_link_encoder_mapping has size MAX_HPO_DP2_ENCODERS(=4),
  but location can have size up to 6. As a result, it is necessary to check location against
  MAX_HPO_DP2_ENCODERS.  Similiarly, disp_cfg_stream_location can be used as an array index
  which should be 0..5, so the ASSERT''s conditions should be less without equal.'
