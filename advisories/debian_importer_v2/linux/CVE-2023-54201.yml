summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/efa: Fix
  wrong resources deallocation order  When trying to destroy QP or CQ, we first decrease the
  refcount and potentially free memory regions allocated for the object and then request the
  device to destroy the object. If the device fails, the object isn''t fully destroyed so the
  user/IB core can try to destroy the object again which will lead to underflow when trying
  to decrease an already zeroed refcount.  Deallocate resources in reverse order of allocating
  them to safely free them.'
