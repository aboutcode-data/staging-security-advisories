summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ipmi:ssif: Fix
  a memory leak when scanning for an adapter  The adapter scan ssif_info_find() sets info->adapter_name
  if the adapter info came from SMBIOS, as it''s not set in that case.  However, this function
  can be called more than once, and it will leak the adapter name if it had already been set.  So
  check for NULL before setting it.'
