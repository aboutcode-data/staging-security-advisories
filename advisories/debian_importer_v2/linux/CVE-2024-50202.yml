summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: propagate
  directory read errors from nilfs_find_entry()  Syzbot reported that a task hang occurs in
  vcs_open() during a fuzzing test for nilfs2.  The root cause of this problem is that in nilfs_find_entry(),
  which searches for directory entries, ignores errors when loading a directory page/folio via
  nilfs_get_folio() fails.  If the filesystem images is corrupted, and the i_size of the directory
  inode is large, and the directory page/folio is successfully read but fails the sanity check,
  for example when it is zero-filled, nilfs_check_folio() may continue to spit out error messages
  in bursts.  Fix this issue by propagating the error to the callers when loading a page/folio
  fails in nilfs_find_entry().  The current interface of nilfs_find_entry() and its callers
  is outdated and cannot propagate error codes such as -EIO and -ENOMEM returned via nilfs_find_entry(),
  so fix it together.'
