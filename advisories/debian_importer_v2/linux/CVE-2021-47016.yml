summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  m68k: mvme147,mvme16x:
  Don''t wipe PCC timer config bits  Don''t clear the timer 1 configuration bits when clearing
  the interrupt flag and counter overflow. As Michael reported, "This results in no timer interrupts
  being delivered after the first. Initialization then hangs in calibrate_delay as the jiffies
  counter is not updated."  On mvme16x, enable the timer after requesting the irq, consistent
  with mvme147.'
