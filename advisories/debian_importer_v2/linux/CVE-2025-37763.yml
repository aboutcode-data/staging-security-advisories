summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/imagination:
  take paired job reference  For paired jobs, have the fragment job take a reference on the
  geometry job, so that the geometry job cannot be freed until the fragment job has finished
  with it.  The geometry job structure is accessed when the fragment job is being prepared by
  the GPU scheduler. Taking the reference prevents the geometry job being freed until the fragment
  job no longer requires it.  Fixes a use after free bug detected by KASAN:  [  124.256386]
  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in pvr_queue_prepare_job+0x108/0x868 [powervr] [  124.264893]
