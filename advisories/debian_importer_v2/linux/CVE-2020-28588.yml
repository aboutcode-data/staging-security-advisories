  - CVE-2020-28588
summary: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the /proc/pid/syscall functionality
  of Linux Kernel 5.1 Stable and 5.4.66. More specifically, this issue has been introduced in
  v5.1-rc4 (commit 631b7abacd02b88f4b0795c08b54ad4fc3e7c7c0) and is still present in v5.10-rc4,
  so it’s likely that all versions in between are affected. An attacker can read /proc/pid/syscall
  to trigger this vulnerability, which leads to the kernel leaking memory contents.
