summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ksmbd: Fix UAF
  in __close_file_table_ids  A use-after-free is possible if one thread destroys the file via
  __ksmbd_close_fd while another thread holds a reference to it. The existing checks on fp->refcount
  are not sufficient to prevent this.  The fix takes ft->lock around the section which removes
  the file from the file table. This prevents two threads acquiring the same file pointer via
  __close_file_table_ids, as well as the other functions which retrieve a file from the IDR
  and which already use this same lock.'
