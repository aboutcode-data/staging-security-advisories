summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  stmmac: intel:
  Add a missing clk_disable_unprepare() call in intel_eth_pci_remove()  Commit 09f012e64e4b
  ("stmmac: intel: Fix clock handling on error and remove paths") removed this clk_disable_unprepare()  This
  was partly revert by commit ac322f86b56c ("net: stmmac: Fix clock handling on remove path")
  which removed this clk_disable_unprepare() because: "    While unloading the dwmac-intel driver,
  clk_disable_unprepare() is    being called twice in stmmac_dvr_remove() and    intel_eth_pci_remove().
  This causes kernel panic on the second call. "  However later on, commit 5ec55823438e8 ("net:
  stmmac: add clocks management for gmac driver") has updated stmmac_dvr_remove() which do not
  call clk_disable_unprepare() anymore.  So this call should now be called from intel_eth_pci_remove().'
