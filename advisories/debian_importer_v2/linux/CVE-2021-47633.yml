summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ath5k: fix OOB
  in ath5k_eeprom_read_pcal_info_5111  The bug was found during fuzzing. Stacktrace locates
  it in ath5k_eeprom_convert_pcal_info_5111. When none of the curve is selected in the loop,
  idx can go up to AR5K_EEPROM_N_PD_CURVES. The line makes pd out of bound. pd = &chinfo[pier].pd_curves[idx];  There
  are many OOB writes using pd later in the code. So I added a sanity check for idx. Checks
  for other loops involving AR5K_EEPROM_N_PD_CURVES are not needed as the loop index is not
  used outside the loops.  The patch is NOT tested with real device.  The following is the fuzzing
