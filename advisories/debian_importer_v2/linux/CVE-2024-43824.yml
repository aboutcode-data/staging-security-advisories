summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PCI: endpoint:
  pci-epf-test: Make use of cached ''epc_features'' in pci_epf_test_core_init()  Instead of
  getting the epc_features from pci_epc_get_features() API, use the cached pci_epf_test::epc_features
  value to avoid the NULL check. Since the NULL check is already performed in pci_epf_test_bind(),
  having one more check in pci_epf_test_core_init() is redundant and it is not possible to hit
  the NULL pointer dereference.  Also with commit a01e7214bef9 ("PCI: endpoint: Remove "core_init_notifier"
  flag"), ''epc_features'' got dereferenced without the NULL check, leading to the following
  false positive Smatch warning:    drivers/pci/endpoint/functions/pci-epf-test.c:784 pci_epf_test_core_init()
  error: we previously assumed ''epc_features'' could be null (see line 747)  Thus, remove the
  redundant NULL check and also use the epc_features:: {msix_capable/msi_capable} flags directly
  to avoid local variables.  [kwilczynski: commit log]'
