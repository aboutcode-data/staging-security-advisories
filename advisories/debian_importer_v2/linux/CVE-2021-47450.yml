summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: arm64: Fix
  host stage-2 PGD refcount  The KVM page-table library refcounts the pages of concatenated
  stage-2 PGDs individually. However, when running KVM in protected mode, the host''s stage-2
  PGD is currently managed by EL2 as a single high-order compound page, which can cause the
  refcount of the tail pages to reach 0 when they shouldn''t, hence corrupting the page-table.  Fix
  this by introducing a new hyp_split_page() helper in the EL2 page allocator (matching the
  kernel''s split_page() function), and make use of it from host_s2_zalloc_pages_exact().'
