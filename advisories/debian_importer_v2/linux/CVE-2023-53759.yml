summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: hidraw:
  fix data race on device refcount  The hidraw_open() function increments the hidraw device
  reference counter. The counter has no dedicated synchronization mechanism, resulting in a
  potential data race when concurrently opening a device.  The race is a regression introduced
  by commit 8590222e4b02 ("HID: hidraw: Replace hidraw device table mutex with a rwsem"). While
  minors_rwsem is intended to protect the hidraw_table itself, by instead acquiring the lock
  for writing, the reference counter is also protected. This is symmetrical to hidraw_release().'
