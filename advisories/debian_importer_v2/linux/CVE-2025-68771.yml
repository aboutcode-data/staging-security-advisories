summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ocfs2: fix kernel
  BUG in ocfs2_find_victim_chain  syzbot reported a kernel BUG in ocfs2_find_victim_chain()
  because the `cl_next_free_rec` field of the allocation chain list (next free slot in the chain
  list) is 0, triggring the BUG_ON(!cl->cl_next_free_rec) condition in ocfs2_find_victim_chain()
  and panicking the kernel.  To fix this, an if condition is introduced in ocfs2_claim_suballoc_bits(),
  just before calling ocfs2_find_victim_chain(), the code block in it being executed when either
  of the following conditions is true:  1. `cl_next_free_rec` is equal to 0, indicating that
  there are no free chains in the allocation chain list 2. `cl_next_free_rec` is greater than
  `cl_count` (the total number of chains in the allocation chain list)  Either of them being
  true is indicative of the fact that there are no chains left for usage.  This is addressed
  using ocfs2_error(), which prints the error log for debugging purposes, rather than panicking
  the kernel.'
