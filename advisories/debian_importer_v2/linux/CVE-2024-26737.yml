summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Fix racing\
  \ between bpf_timer_cancel_and_free and bpf_timer_cancel  The following race is possible between\
  \ bpf_timer_cancel_and_free and bpf_timer_cancel. It will lead a UAF on the timer->timer.\
  \  bpf_timer_cancel(); \tspin_lock(); \tt = timer->time; \tspin_unlock();  \t\t\t\t\tbpf_timer_cancel_and_free();\
  \ \t\t\t\t\t\tspin_lock(); \t\t\t\t\t\tt = timer->timer; \t\t\t\t\t\ttimer->timer = NULL;\
  \ \t\t\t\t\t\tspin_unlock(); \t\t\t\t\t\thrtimer_cancel(&t->timer); \t\t\t\t\t\tkfree(t);\
  \  \t/* UAF on t */ \thrtimer_cancel(&t->timer);  In bpf_timer_cancel_and_free, this patch\
  \ frees the timer->timer after a rcu grace period. This requires a rcu_head addition to the\
  \ \"struct bpf_hrtimer\". Another kfree(t) happens in bpf_timer_init, this does not need a\
  \ kfree_rcu because it is still under the spin_lock and timer->timer has not been visible\
  \ by others yet.  In bpf_timer_cancel, rcu_read_lock() is added because this helper can be\
  \ used in a non rcu critical section context (e.g. from a sleepable bpf prog). Other timer->timer\
  \ usages in helpers.c have been audited, bpf_timer_cancel() is the only place where timer->timer\
  \ is used outside of the spin_lock.  Another solution considered is to mark a t->flag in bpf_timer_cancel\
  \ and clear it after hrtimer_cancel() is done.  In bpf_timer_cancel_and_free, it busy waits\
  \ for the flag to be cleared before kfree(t). This patch goes with a straight forward solution\
  \ and frees timer->timer after a rcu grace period."
