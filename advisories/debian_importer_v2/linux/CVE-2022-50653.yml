summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mmc: atmel-mci:
  fix return value check of mmc_add_host()  mmc_add_host() may return error, if we ignore its
  return value, it will lead two issues: 1. The memory that allocated in mmc_alloc_host() is
  leaked. 2. In the remove() path, mmc_remove_host() will be called to    delete device, but
  it''s not added yet, it will lead a kernel    crash because of null-ptr-deref in device_del().  So
  fix this by checking the return value and calling mmc_free_host() in the error path.'
