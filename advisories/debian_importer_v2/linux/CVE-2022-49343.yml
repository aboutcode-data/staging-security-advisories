summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: avoid cycles
  in directory h-tree  A maliciously corrupted filesystem can contain cycles in the h-tree stored
  inside a directory. That can easily lead to the kernel corrupting tree nodes that were already
  verified under its hands while doing a node split and consequently accessing unallocated memory.
  Fix the problem by verifying traversed block numbers are unique.'
