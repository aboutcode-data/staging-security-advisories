summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sched/core: Fix
  use-after-free bug in dup_user_cpus_ptr()  Since commit 07ec77a1d4e8 ("sched: Allow task CPU
  affinity to be restricted on asymmetric systems"), the setting and clearing of user_cpus_ptr
  are done under pi_lock for arm64 architecture. However, dup_user_cpus_ptr() accesses user_cpus_ptr
  without any lock protection. Since sched_setaffinity() can be invoked from another process,
  the process being modified may be undergoing fork() at the same time.  When racing with the
  clearing of user_cpus_ptr in __set_cpus_allowed_ptr_locked(), it can lead to user-after-free
  and possibly double-free in arm64 kernel.  Commit 8f9ea86fdf99 ("sched: Always preserve the
  user requested cpumask") fixes this problem as user_cpus_ptr, once set, will never be cleared
  in a task''s lifetime. However, this bug was re-introduced in commit 851a723e45d1 ("sched:
  Always clear user_cpus_ptr in do_set_cpus_allowed()") which allows the clearing of user_cpus_ptr
  in do_set_cpus_allowed(). This time, it will affect all arches.  Fix this bug by always clearing
  the user_cpus_ptr of the newly cloned/forked task before the copying process starts and check
  the user_cpus_ptr state of the source task under pi_lock.  Note to stable, this patch won''t
  be applicable to stable releases. Just copy the new dup_user_cpus_ptr() function over.'
