summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tpm2-sessions:
  Fix out of range indexing in name_size  ''name_size'' does not have any range checks, and
  it just directly indexes with TPM_ALG_ID, which could lead into memory corruption at worst.  Address
  the issue by only processing known values and returning -EINVAL for unrecognized values.  Make
  also ''tpm_buf_append_name'' and ''tpm_buf_fill_hmac_session'' fallible so that errors are
  detected before causing any spurious TPM traffic.  End also the authorization session on failure
  in both of the functions, as the session state would be then by definition corrupted.'
