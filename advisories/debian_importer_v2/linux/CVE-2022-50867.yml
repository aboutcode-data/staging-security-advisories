summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/msm/a6xx:
  Fix kvzalloc vs state_kcalloc usage  adreno_show_object() is a trap!  It will re-allocate
  the pointer it is passed on first call, when the data is ascii85 encoded, using kvmalloc/
  kvfree().  Which means the data *passed* to it must be kvmalloc''d, ie. we cannot use the
  state_kcalloc() helper.  This partially reverts commit ec8f1813bf8d ("drm/msm/a6xx: Replace
  kcalloc() with kvzalloc()"), but adds the missing kvfree() to fix the memory leak that was
  present previously.  And adds a warning comment.  Patchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/507014/'
