  cleanup_srcu_struct() GP checks  Currently, cleanup_srcu_struct() checks for a grace period
  in progress, but it does not check for a grace period that has not yet started but which might
  start at any time.  Such a situation could result in a use-after-free bug, so this commit
  adds a check for a grace period that is needed but not yet started to cleanup_srcu_struct().'
