summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: mediatek:
  mt8186: Fix use-after-free in driver remove path  When devm runs function in the "remove"
  path for a device it runs them in the reverse order. That means that if you have parts of
  your driver that aren''t using devm or are using "roll your own" devm w/ devm_add_action_or_reset()
  you need to keep that in mind.  The mt8186 audio driver didn''t quite get this right. Specifically,
  in mt8186_init_clock() it called mt8186_audsys_clk_register() and then went on to call a bunch
  of other devm function. The caller of mt8186_init_clock() used devm_add_action_or_reset()
  to call mt8186_deinit_clock() but, because of the intervening devm functions, the order was
  wrong.  Specifically at probe time, the order was: 1. mt8186_audsys_clk_register() 2. afe_priv->clk
  = devm_kcalloc(...) 3. afe_priv->clk[i] = devm_clk_get(...)  At remove time, the order (which
  should have been 3, 2, 1) was: 1. mt8186_audsys_clk_unregister() 3. Free all of afe_priv->clk[i]
  2. Free afe_priv->clk  The above seemed to be causing a use-after-free. Luckily, it''s easy
  to fix this by simply using devm more correctly. Let''s move the devm_add_action_or_reset()
  to the right place. In addition to fixing the use-after-free, code inspection shows that this
  fixes a leak (missing call to mt8186_audsys_clk_unregister()) that would have happened if
  any of the syscon_regmap_lookup_by_phandle() calls in mt8186_init_clock() had failed.'
