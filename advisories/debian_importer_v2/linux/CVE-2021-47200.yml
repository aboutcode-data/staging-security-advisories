summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/prime: Fix
  use after free in mmap with drm_gem_ttm_mmap  drm_gem_ttm_mmap() drops a reference to the
  gem object on success. If the gem object''s refcount == 1 on entry to drm_gem_prime_mmap(),
  that drop will free the gem object, and the subsequent drm_gem_object_get() will be a UAF.
  Fix by grabbing a reference before calling the mmap helper.  This issue was forseen when the
  reference dropping was adding in commit 9786b65bc61ac ("drm/ttm: fix mmap refcounting"):   "For
  that to work properly the drm_gem_object_get() call in   drm_gem_ttm_mmap() must be moved
  so it happens before calling   obj->funcs->mmap(), otherwise the gem refcount would go down   to
  zero."'
