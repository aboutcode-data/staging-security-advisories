summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rcu/nocb: Fix
  possible invalid rdp''s->nocb_cb_kthread pointer access  In the preparation stage of CPU online,
  if the corresponding the rdp''s->nocb_cb_kthread does not exist, will be created, there is
  a situation where the rdp''s rcuop kthreads creation fails, and then de-offload this CPU''s
  rdp, does not assign this CPU''s rdp->nocb_cb_kthread pointer, but this rdp''s->nocb_gp_rdp
  and rdp''s->rdp_gp->nocb_gp_kthread is still valid.  This will cause the subsequent re-offload
  operation of this offline CPU, which will pass the conditional check and the kthread_unpark()
  will access invalid rdp''s->nocb_cb_kthread pointer.  This commit therefore use rdp''s->nocb_gp_kthread
  instead of rdp_gp''s->nocb_gp_kthread for safety check.'
