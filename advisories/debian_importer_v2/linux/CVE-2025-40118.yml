summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: pm80xx:
  Fix array-index-out-of-of-bounds on rmmod  Since commit f7b705c238d1 ("scsi: pm80xx: Set phy_attached
  to zero when device is gone") UBSAN reports:    UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in drivers/scsi/pm8001/pm8001_sas.c:786:17   index
  28 is out of range for type ''pm8001_phy [16]''  on rmmod when using an expander.  For a direct
  attached device, attached_phy contains the local phy id. For a device behind an expander,
  attached_phy contains the remote phy id, not the local phy id.  I.e. while pm8001_ha will
  have pm8001_ha->chip->n_phy local phys, for a device behind an expander, attached_phy can
  be much larger than pm8001_ha->chip->n_phy (depending on the amount of phys of the expander).  E.g.
  on my system pm8001_ha has 8 phys with phy ids 0-7.  One of the ports has an expander connected.  The
  expander has 31 phys with phy ids 0-30.  The pm8001_ha->phy array only contains the phys of
  the HBA.  It does not contain the phys of the expander.  Thus, it is wrong to use attached_phy
  to index the pm8001_ha->phy array for a device behind an expander.  Thus, we can only clear
  phy_attached for devices that are directly attached.'
