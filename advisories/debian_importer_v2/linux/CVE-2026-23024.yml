summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  idpf: fix memory
  leak of flow steer list on rmmod  The flow steering list maintains entries that are added
  and removed as ethtool creates and deletes flow steering rules. Module removal with active
  entries causes memory leak as the list is not properly cleaned up.  Prevent this by iterating
  through the remaining entries in the list and freeing the associated memory during module
  removal. Add a spinlock (flow_steer_list_lock) to protect the list access from multiple threads.'
