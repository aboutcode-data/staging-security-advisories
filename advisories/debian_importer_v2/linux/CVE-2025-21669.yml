  - CVE-2025-21669
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vsock/virtio:
  discard packets if the transport changes  If the socket has been de-assigned or assigned to
  another transport, we must discard any packets received because they are not expected and
  would cause issues when we access vsk->transport.  A possible scenario is described by Hyunwoo
  Kim in the attached link, where after a first connect() interrupted by a signal, and a second
  connect() failed, we can find `vsk->transport` at NULL, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.'
