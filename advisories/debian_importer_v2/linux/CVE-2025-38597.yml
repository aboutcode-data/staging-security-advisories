  - CVE-2025-38597
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/rockchip:
  vop2: fail cleanly if missing a primary plane for a video-port  Each window of a vop2 is usable
  by a specific set of video ports, so while binding the vop2, we look through the list of available
  windows trying to find one designated as primary-plane and usable by that specific port.  The
  code later wants to use drm_crtc_init_with_planes with that found primary plane, but nothing
  has checked so far if a primary plane was actually found.  For whatever reason, the rk3576
  vp2 does not have a usable primary window (if vp0 is also in use) which brought the issue
  to light and ended in a null-pointer dereference further down.  As we expect a primary-plane
  to exist for a video-port, add a check at the end of the window-iteration and fail probing
  if none was found.'
