summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  serial: 8250:\
  \ omap: Don't skip resource freeing if pm_runtime_resume_and_get() failed  Returning an error\
  \ code from .remove() makes the driver core emit the little helpful error message:  \tremove\
  \ callback returned a non-zero value. This will be ignored.  and then remove the device anyhow.\
  \ So all resources that were not freed are leaked in this case. Skipping serial8250_unregister_port()\
  \ has the potential to keep enough of the UART around to trigger a use-after-free.  So replace\
  \ the error return (and with it the little helpful error message) by a more useful error message\
  \ and continue to cleanup."
