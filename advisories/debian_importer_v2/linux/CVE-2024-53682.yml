  AXP717: set ramp_delay  AXP717 datasheet says that regulator ramp delay is 15.625 us/step,
  which is 10mV in our case.  Add a AXP_DESC_RANGES_DELAY macro and update AXP_DESC_RANGES macro
  to expand to AXP_DESC_RANGES_DELAY with ramp_delay = 0  For DCDC4, steps is 100mv  Add a AXP_DESC_DELAY
  macro and update AXP_DESC macro to expand to AXP_DESC_DELAY with ramp_delay = 0  This patch
  fix crashes when using CPU DVFS.'
