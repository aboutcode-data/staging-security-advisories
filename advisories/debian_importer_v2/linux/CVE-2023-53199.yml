summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath9k:
  hif_usb: clean up skbs if ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream() fails  Syzkaller detected a memory leak
  of skbs in ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream(). While processing skbs in ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream(),
  the already allocated skbs in skb_pool are not freed if ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream() fails. If
  we have an incorrect pkt_len or pkt_tag, the input skb is considered invalid and dropped.
  All the associated packets already in skb_pool should be dropped and freed. Added a comment
  describing this issue.  The patch also makes remain_skb NULL after being processed so that
  it cannot be referenced after potential free. The initialization of hif_dev fields which are
  associated with remain_skb (rx_remain_len, rx_transfer_len and rx_pad_len) is moved after
  a new remain_skb is allocated.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with
  Syzkaller.'
