summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: message:
  mptlan: Fix use after free bug in mptlan_remove() due to race condition  mptlan_probe() calls
  mpt_register_lan_device() which initializes the &priv->post_buckets_task workqueue. A call
  to mpt_lan_wake_post_buckets_task() will subsequently start the work.  During driver unload
  in mptlan_remove() the following race may occur:  CPU0                  CPU1                      |mpt_lan_post_receive_buckets_work()
  mptlan_remove()     |   free_netdev()     |     kfree(dev);     |                     |                     |
  dev->mtu                     |   //use  Fix this by finishing the work prior to cleaning up
  in mptlan_remove().  [mkp: we really should remove mptlan instead of attempting to fix it]'
