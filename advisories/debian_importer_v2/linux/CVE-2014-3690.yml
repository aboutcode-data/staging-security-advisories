  - CVE-2014-3690
summary: arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.17.2 on Intel
  processors does not ensure that the value in the CR4 control register remains the same after
  a VM entry, which allows host OS users to kill arbitrary processes or cause a denial of service
  (system disruption) by leveraging /dev/kvm access, as demonstrated by PR_SET_TSC prctl calls
  within a modified copy of QEMU.
