summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/hugetlb: fix
  huge_pmd_unshare() vs GUP-fast race  huge_pmd_unshare() drops a reference on a page table
  that may have previously been shared across processes, potentially turning it into a normal
  page table used in another process in which unrelated VMAs can afterwards be installed.  If
  this happens in the middle of a concurrent gup_fast(), gup_fast() could end up walking the
  page tables of another process.  While I don''t see any way in which that immediately leads
  to kernel memory corruption, it is really weird and unexpected.  Fix it with an explicit broadcast
  IPI through tlb_remove_table_sync_one(), just like we do in khugepaged when removing page
  tables for a THP collapse.'
