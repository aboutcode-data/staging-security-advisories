  - CVE-2021-3491
summary: 'The io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel allowed the MAX_RW_COUNT limit to be bypassed
  in the PROVIDE_BUFFERS operation, which led to negative values being usedin mem_rw when reading
  /proc/<PID>/mem. This could be used to create a heap overflow leading to arbitrary code execution
  in the kernel. It was addressed via commit d1f82808877b ("io_uring: truncate lengths larger
  than MAX_RW_COUNT on provide buffers") (v5.13-rc1) and backported to the stable kernels in
  v5.12.4, v5.11.21, and v5.10.37. It was introduced in ddf0322db79c ("io_uring: add IORING_OP_PROVIDE_BUFFERS")
  (v5.7-rc1).'
