summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/pm: Update
  intermediate power state for SI  Update the current state as boot state during dpm initialization.
  During the subsequent initialization, set_power_state gets called to transition to the final
  power state. set_power_state refers to values from the current state and without current state
  populated, it could result in NULL pointer dereference.  For ex: on platforms where PCI speed
  change is supported through ACPI ATCS method, the link speed of current state needs to be
  queried before deciding on changing to final power state''s link speed. The logic to query
  ATCS-support was broken on certain platforms. The issue became visible when broken ATCS-support
  logic got fixed with commit f9b7f3703ff9 ("drm/amdgpu/acpi: make ATPX/ATCS structures global
  (v2)").  Bug: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/1698'
