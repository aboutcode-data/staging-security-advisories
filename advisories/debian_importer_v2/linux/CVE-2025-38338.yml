summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fs/nfs/read:
  fix double-unlock bug in nfs_return_empty_folio()  Sometimes, when a file was read while it
  was being truncated by another NFS client, the kernel could deadlock because folio_unlock()
  was called twice, and the second call would XOR back the `PG_locked` flag.  Most of the time
  (depending on the timing of the truncation), nobody notices the problem because folio_unlock()
  gets called three times, which flips `PG_locked` back off:   1. vfs_read, nfs_read_folio,
  ... nfs_read_add_folio,     nfs_return_empty_folio  2. vfs_read, nfs_read_folio, ... netfs_read_collection,     netfs_unlock_abandoned_read_pages  3.
  vfs_read, ... nfs_do_read_folio, nfs_read_add_folio,     nfs_return_empty_folio  The problem
  is that nfs_read_add_folio() is not supposed to unlock the folio if fscache is enabled, and
  a nfs_netfs_folio_unlock() check is missing in nfs_return_empty_folio().  Rarely this leads
  to a warning in netfs_read_collection():   ------------[ cut here ]------------  R=0000031c:
  folio 10 is not locked  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 29 at fs/netfs/read_collect.c:133 netfs_read_collection+0x7c0/0xf00  [...]  Workqueue:

  of the time, however, processes just get stuck forever in folio_wait_bit_common(), waiting
  for `PG_locked` to disappear, which never happens because nobody is really holding the folio
  lock.'
