summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  uacce: fix isolate
  sysfs check condition  uacce supports the device isolation feature. If the driver implements
  the isolate_err_threshold_read and isolate_err_threshold_write callback functions, uacce will
  create sysfs files now. Users can read and configure the isolation policy through sysfs. Currently,
  sysfs files are created as long as either isolate_err_threshold_read or isolate_err_threshold_write
  callback functions are present.  However, accessing a non-existent callback function may cause
  the system to crash. Therefore, intercept the creation of sysfs if neither read nor write
  exists; create sysfs if either is supported, but intercept unsupported operations at the call
  site.'
