summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  hwmon: (lm90)
  Prevent integer overflow/underflow in hysteresis calculations  Commit b50aa49638c7 ("hwmon:
  (lm90) Prevent integer underflows of temperature calculations") addressed a number of underflow
  situations when writing temperature limits. However, it missed one situation, seen when an
  attempt is made to set the hysteresis value to MAX_LONG and the critical temperature limit
  is negative.  Use clamp_val() when setting the hysteresis temperature to ensure that the provided
  value can never overflow or underflow.'
