summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tracing: Make
  sure trace_printk() can output as soon as it can be used  Currently trace_printk() can be
  used as soon as early_trace_init() is called from start_kernel(). But if a crash happens,
  and "ftrace_dump_on_oops" is set on the kernel command line, all you get will be:    [    0.456075]   <idle>-0         0dN.2.
  347519us : Unknown type 6   [    0.456075]   <idle>-0         0dN.2. 353141us : Unknown type
  6   [    0.456075]   <idle>-0         0dN.2. 358684us : Unknown type 6  This is because the
  trace_printk() event (type 6) hasn''t been registered yet. That gets done via an early_initcall(),
  which may be early, but not early enough.  Instead of registering the trace_printk() event
  (and other ftrace events, which are not trace events) via an early_initcall(), have them registered
  at the same time that trace_printk() can be used. This way, if there is a crash before early_initcall(),
  then the trace_printk()s will actually be useful.'
