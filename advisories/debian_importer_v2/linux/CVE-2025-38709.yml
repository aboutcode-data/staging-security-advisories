summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  loop: Avoid updating
  block size under exclusive owner  Syzbot came up with a reproducer where a loop device block
  size is changed underneath a mounted filesystem. This causes a mismatch between the block
  device block size and the block size stored in the superblock causing confusion in various
  places such as fs/buffer.c. The particular issue triggered by syzbot was a warning in __getblk_slow()
  due to requested buffer size not matching block device block size.  Fix the problem by getting
  exclusive hold of the loop device to change its block size. This fails if somebody (such as
  filesystem) has already an exclusive ownership of the block device and thus prevents modifying
  the loop device under some exclusive owner which doesn''t expect it.'
