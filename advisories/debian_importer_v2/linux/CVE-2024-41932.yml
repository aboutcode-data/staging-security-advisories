summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sched: fix warning
  in sched_setaffinity  Commit 8f9ea86fdf99b added some logic to sched_setaffinity that included
  a WARN when a per-task affinity assignment races with a cpuset update.  Specifically, we can
  have a race where a cpuset update results in the task affinity no longer being a subset of
  the cpuset. That''s fine; we have a fallback to instead use the cpuset mask. However, we have
  a WARN set up that will trigger if the cpuset mask has no overlap at all with the requested
  task affinity. This shouldn''t be a warning condition; its trivial to create this condition.  Reproduced
  the warning by the following setup:  - $PID inside a cpuset cgroup - another thread repeatedly
  switching the cpuset cpus from 1-2 to just 1 - another thread repeatedly setting the $PID
  affinity (via taskset) to 2'
