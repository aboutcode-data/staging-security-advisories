summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/mlx5: HWS,
  change error flow on matcher disconnect  Currently, when firmware failure occurs during matcher
  disconnect flow, the error flow of the function reconnects the matcher back and returns an
  error, which continues running the calling function and eventually frees the matcher that
  is being disconnected. This leads to a case where we have a freed matcher on the matchers
  list, which in turn leads to use-after-free and eventual crash.  This patch fixes that by
  not trying to reconnect the matcher back when some FW command fails during disconnect.  Note
  that we''re dealing here with FW error. We can''t overcome this problem. This might lead to
  bad steering state (e.g. wrong connection between matchers), and will also lead to resource
  leakage, as it is the case with any other error handling during resource destruction.  However,
  the goal here is to allow the driver to continue and not crash the machine with use-after-free
  error.'
