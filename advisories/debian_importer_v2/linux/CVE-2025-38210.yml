summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  configfs-tsm-report:
  Fix NULL dereference of tsm_ops  Unlike sysfs, the lifetime of configfs objects is controlled
  by userspace. There is no mechanism for the kernel to find and delete all created config-items.
  Instead, the configfs-tsm-report mechanism has an expectation that tsm_unregister() can happen
  at any time and cause established config-item access to start failing.  That expectation is
  not fully satisfied. While tsm_report_read(), tsm_report_{is,is_bin}_visible(), and tsm_report_make_item()
  safely fail if tsm_ops have been unregistered, tsm_report_privlevel_store() tsm_report_provider_show()
  fail to check for ops registration. Add the missing checks for tsm_ops having been removed.  Now,
  in supporting the ability for tsm_unregister() to always succeed, it leaves the problem of
  what to do with lingering config-items. The expectation is that the admin that arranges for
  the ->remove() (unbind) of the ${tsm_arch}-guest driver is also responsible for deletion of
  all open config-items. Until that deletion happens, ->probe() (reload / bind) of the ${tsm_arch}-guest
  driver fails.  This allows for emergency shutdown / revocation of attestation interfaces,
  and requires coordinated restart.'
