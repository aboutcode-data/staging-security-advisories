summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ice: always check
  VF VSI pointer values  The ice_get_vf_vsi function can return NULL in some cases, such as
  if handling messages during a reset where the VSI is being removed and recreated.  Several
  places throughout the driver do not bother to check whether this VSI pointer is valid. Static
  analysis tools maybe report issues because they detect paths where a potentially NULL pointer
  could be dereferenced.  Fix this by checking the return value of ice_get_vf_vsi everywhere.'
