summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  perf/aux: Fix
  AUX buffer serialization  Ole reported that event->mmap_mutex is strictly insufficient to
  serialize the AUX buffer, add a per RB mutex to fully serialize it.  Note that in the lock
  order comment the perf_event::mmap_mutex order was already wrong, that is, it nesting under
  mmap_lock is not new with this patch.'
