summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  posix-timers:\
  \ Ensure timer ID search-loop limit is valid  posix_timer_add() tries to allocate a posix\
  \ timer ID by starting from the cached ID which was stored by the last successful allocation.\
  \  This is done in a loop searching the ID space for a free slot one by one. The loop has\
  \ to terminate when the search wrapped around to the starting point.  But that's racy vs.\
  \ establishing the starting point. That is read out lockless, which leads to the following\
  \ problem:  CPU0\t  \t      \t     \t   CPU1 posix_timer_add()   start = sig->posix_timer_id;\
  \   lock(hash_lock);   ...\t\t\t\t   posix_timer_add()   if (++sig->posix_timer_id < 0)  \
  \     \t\t\t             start = sig->posix_timer_id;      sig->posix_timer_id = 0;  So CPU1\
  \ can observe a negative start value, i.e. -1, and the loop break never happens because the\
  \ condition can never be true:    if (sig->posix_timer_id == start)      break;  While this\
  \ is unlikely to ever turn into an endless loop as the ID space is huge (INT_MAX), the racy\
  \ read of the start value caught the attention of KCSAN and Dmitry unearthed that incorrectness.\
  \  Rewrite it so that all id operations are under the hash lock."
