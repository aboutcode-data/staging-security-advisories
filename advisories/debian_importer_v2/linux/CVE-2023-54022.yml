summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: usb-audio:
  Fix potential memory leaks at error path for UMP open  The allocation and initialization errors
  at alloc_midi_urbs() that is called at MIDI 2.0 / UMP device are supposed to be handled at
  the caller side by invoking free_midi_urbs().  However, free_midi_urbs() loops only for ep->num_urbs
  entries, and since ep->num_entries wasn''t updated yet at the allocation / init error in alloc_midi_urbs(),
  this entry won''t be released.  The intention of free_midi_urbs() is to release the whole
  elements, so change the loop size to NUM_URBS to scan over all elements for fixing the missed
  releases.  Also, the call of free_midi_urbs() is missing at snd_usb_midi_v2_open().  Although
  it''ll be released later at reopen/close or disconnection, it''s better to release immediately
  at the error path.'
