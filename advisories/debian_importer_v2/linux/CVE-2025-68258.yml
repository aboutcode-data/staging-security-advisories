summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  comedi: multiq3:
  sanitize config options in multiq3_attach()  Syzbot identified an issue [1] in multiq3_attach()
  that induces a task timeout due to open() or COMEDI_DEVCONFIG ioctl operations, specifically,
  in the case of multiq3 driver.  This problem arose when syzkaller managed to craft weird configuration
  options used to specify the number of channels in encoder subdevice. If a particularly great
  number is passed to s->n_chan in multiq3_attach() via it->options[2], then multiple calls
  to multiq3_encoder_reset() at the end of driver-specific attach() method will be running for
  minutes, thus blocking tasks and affected devices as well.  While this issue is most likely
  not too dangerous for real-life devices, it still makes sense to sanitize configuration inputs.
  Enable a sensible limit on the number of encoder chips (4 chips max, each with 2 channels)
  to stop this behaviour from manifesting.  [1] Syzbot crash: INFO: task syz.2.19:6067 blocked
  for more than 143 seconds. ... Call Trace:  <TASK>  context_switch kernel/sched/core.c:5254
