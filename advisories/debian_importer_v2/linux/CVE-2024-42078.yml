summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfsd: initialise
  nfsd_info.mutex early.  nfsd_info.mutex can be dereferenced by svc_pool_stats_start() immediately
  after the new netns is created.  Currently this can trigger an oops.  Move the initialisation
  earlier before it can possibly be dereferenced.'
