summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: fix race
  between quota enable and quota rescan ioctl  When enabling quotas, at btrfs_quota_enable(),
  after committing the transaction, we change fs_info->quota_root to point to the quota root
  we created and set BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLED at fs_info->flags. Then we try to start the qgroup
  rescan worker, first by initializing it with a call to qgroup_rescan_init() - however if that
  fails we end up freeing the quota root but we leave fs_info->quota_root still pointing to
  it, this can later result in a use-after-free somewhere else.  We have previously set the
  flags BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLED and BTRFS_QGROUP_STATUS_FLAG_ON, so we can only fail with -EINPROGRESS
  at btrfs_quota_enable(), which is possible if someone already called the quota rescan ioctl,
  and therefore started the rescan worker.  So fix this by ignoring an -EINPROGRESS and asserting
  we can''t get any other error.'
