  - CVE-2023-53796
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  f2fs: fix information
  leak in f2fs_move_inline_dirents()  When converting an inline directory to a regular one,
  f2fs is leaking uninitialized memory to disk because it doesn''t initialize the entire directory
  block.  Fix this by zero-initializing the block.  This bug was introduced by commit 4ec17d688d74
  ("f2fs: avoid unneeded initializing when converting inline dentry"), which didn''t consider
  the security implications of leaking uninitialized memory to disk.  This was found by running
  xfstest generic/435 on a KMSAN-enabled kernel.'
