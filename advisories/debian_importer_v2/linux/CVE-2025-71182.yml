summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: j1939: make
  j1939_session_activate() fail if device is no longer registered  syzbot is still reporting    unregister_netdevice:
  waiting for vcan0 to become free. Usage count = 2  even after commit 93a27b5891b8 ("can: j1939:
  add missing calls in NETDEV_UNREGISTER notification handler") was added. A debug printk()
  patch found that j1939_session_activate() can succeed even after j1939_cancel_active_session()
  from j1939_netdev_notify(NETDEV_UNREGISTER) has completed.  Since j1939_cancel_active_session()
  is processed with the session list lock held, checking ndev->reg_state in j1939_session_activate()
  with the session list lock held can reliably close the race window.'
