  - CVE-2024-42089
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: fsl-asoc-card:
  set priv->pdev before using it  priv->pdev pointer was set after being used in fsl_asoc_card_audmux_init().
  Move this assignment at the start of the probe function, so sub-functions can correctly use
  pdev through priv.  fsl_asoc_card_audmux_init() dereferences priv->pdev to get access to the
  dev struct, used with dev_err macros. As priv is zero-initialised, there would be a NULL pointer
  dereference. Note that if priv->dev is dereferenced before assignment but never used, for
  example if there is no error to be printed, the driver won''t crash probably due to compiler
  optimisations.'
