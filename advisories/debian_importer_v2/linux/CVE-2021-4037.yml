aliases:
  - CVE-2021-4037
summary: A vulnerability was found in the fs/inode.c:inode_init_owner() function logic of the
  LInux kernel that allows local users to create files for the XFS file-system with an unintended
  group ownership and with group execution and SGID permission bits set, in a scenario where
  a directory is SGID and belongs to a certain group and is writable by a user who is not a
  member of this group. This can lead to excessive permissions granted in case when they should
  not. This vulnerability is similar to the previous CVE-2018-13405 and adds the missed fix
  for the XFS.
