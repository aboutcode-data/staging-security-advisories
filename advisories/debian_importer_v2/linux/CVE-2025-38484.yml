summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iio: backend:
  fix out-of-bound write  The buffer is set to 80 character. If a caller write more characters,
  count is truncated to the max available space in "simple_write_to_buffer". But afterwards
  a string terminator is written to the buffer at offset count without boundary check. The zero
  termination is written OUT-OF-BOUND.  Add a check that the given buffer is smaller then the
  buffer to prevent.'
