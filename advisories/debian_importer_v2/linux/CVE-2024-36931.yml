  - CVE-2024-36931
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  s390/cio: Ensure
  the copied buf is NUL terminated  Currently, we allocate a lbuf-sized kernel buffer and copy
  lbuf from userspace to that buffer. Later, we use scanf on this buffer but we don''t ensure
  that the string is terminated inside the buffer, this can lead to OOB read when using scanf.
  Fix this issue by using memdup_user_nul instead.'
