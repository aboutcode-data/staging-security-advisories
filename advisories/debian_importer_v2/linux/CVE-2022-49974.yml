summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: nintendo:
  fix rumble worker null pointer deref  We can dereference a null pointer trying to queue work
  to a destroyed workqueue.  If the device is disconnected, nintendo_hid_remove is called, in
  which the rumble_queue is destroyed. Avoid using that queue to defer rumble work once the
  controller state is set to JOYCON_CTLR_STATE_REMOVED.  This eliminates the null pointer dereference.'
