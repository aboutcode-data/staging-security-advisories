summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dmaengine: zynqmp_dma:\
  \ In struct zynqmp_dma_chan fix desc_size data type  In zynqmp_dma_alloc/free_chan_resources\
  \ functions there is a potential overflow in the below expressions.  dma_alloc_coherent(chan->dev,\
  \ (2 * chan->desc_size * \t\t   ZYNQMP_DMA_NUM_DESCS), \t\t   &chan->desc_pool_p, GFP_KERNEL);\
  \  dma_free_coherent(chan->dev,(2 * ZYNQMP_DMA_DESC_SIZE(chan) *                  ZYNQMP_DMA_NUM_DESCS),\
  \                 chan->desc_pool_v, chan->desc_pool_p);  The arguments desc_size and ZYNQMP_DMA_NUM_DESCS\
  \ were 32 bit. Though this overflow condition is not observed but it is a potential problem\
  \ in the case of 32-bit multiplication. Hence fix it by changing the desc_size data type to\
  \ size_t.  In addition to coverity fix it also reuse ZYNQMP_DMA_DESC_SIZE macro in dma_alloc_coherent\
  \ API argument.  Addresses-Coverity: Event overflow_before_widen."
