summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  spi: Fix null
  dereference on suspend  A race condition exists where a synchronous (noqueue) transfer can
  be active during a system suspend. This can cause a null pointer dereference exception to
  occur when the system resumes.  Example order of events leading to the exception: 1. spi_sync()
  calls __spi_transfer_message_noqueue() which sets    ctlr->cur_msg 2. Spi transfer begins
  via spi_transfer_one_message() 3. System is suspended interrupting the transfer context 4.
  System is resumed 6. spi_controller_resume() calls spi_start_queue() which resets cur_msg    to
  NULL 7. Spi transfer context resumes and spi_finalize_current_message() is    called which
  dereferences cur_msg (which is now NULL)  Wait for synchronous transfers to complete before
  suspending by acquiring the bus mutex and setting/checking a suspend flag.'
