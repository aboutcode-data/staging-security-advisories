summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/msm/dpu:
  check for valid hw_pp in dpu_encoder_helper_phys_cleanup  The commit 8b45a26f2ba9 ("drm/msm/dpu:
  reserve cdm blocks for writeback in case of YUV output") introduced a smatch warning about
  another conditional block in dpu_encoder_helper_phys_cleanup() which had assumed hw_pp will
  always be valid which may not necessarily be true.  Lets fix the other conditional block by
  making sure hw_pp is valid before dereferencing it.  Patchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/574878/'
