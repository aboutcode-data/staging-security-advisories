summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/damon/core:
  initialize damo_filter->list from damos_new_filter()  damos_new_filter() is not initializing
  the list field of newly allocated filter object.  However, DAMON sysfs interface and DAMON_RECLAIM
  are not initializing it after calling damos_new_filter().  As a result, accessing uninitialized
  memory is possible.  Actually, adding multiple DAMOS filters via DAMON sysfs interface caused
  NULL pointer dereferencing.  Initialize the field just after the allocation from damos_new_filter().'
