summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: hns3: fix
  kernel crash when devlink reload during pf initialization  The devlink reload process will
  access the hardware resources, but the register operation is done before the hardware is initialized.
  So, processing the devlink reload during initialization may lead to kernel crash. This patch
  fixes this by taking devl_lock during initialization.'
