summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powerpc/pseries:
  Rework lppaca_shared_proc() to avoid DEBUG_PREEMPT  lppaca_shared_proc() takes a pointer to
  the lppaca which is typically accessed through get_lppaca().  With DEBUG_PREEMPT enabled,
  this leads to checking if preemption is enabled, for example:    BUG: using smp_processor_id()
  in preemptible [00000000] code: grep/10693   caller is lparcfg_data+0x408/0x19a0   CPU: 4
  PID: 10693 Comm: grep Not tainted 6.5.0-rc3 #2   Call Trace:     dump_stack_lvl+0x154/0x200
  (unreliable)     check_preemption_disabled+0x214/0x220     lparcfg_data+0x408/0x19a0     ...  This
  isn''t actually a problem however, as it does not matter which lppaca is accessed, the shared
  proc state will be the same. vcpudispatch_stats_procfs_init() already works around this by
  disabling preemption, but the lparcfg code does not, erroring any time /proc/powerpc/lparcfg
  is accessed with DEBUG_PREEMPT enabled.  Instead of disabling preemption on the caller side,
  rework lppaca_shared_proc() to not take a pointer and instead directly access the lppaca,
  bypassing any potential preemption checks.  [mpe: Rework to avoid needing a definition in
  paca.h and lppaca.h]'
