summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: seq: Fix
  function prototype mismatch in snd_seq_expand_var_event  With clang''s kernel control flow
  integrity (kCFI, CONFIG_CFI_CLANG), indirect call targets are validated against the expected
  function pointer prototype to make sure the call target is valid to help mitigate ROP attacks.
  If they are not identical, there is a failure at run time, which manifests as either a kernel
  panic or thread getting killed.  seq_copy_in_user() and seq_copy_in_kernel() did not have
  prototypes matching snd_seq_dump_func_t. Adjust this and remove the casts. There are not resulting
  binary output differences.  This was found as a result of Clang''s new -Wcast-function-type-strict
  flag, which is more sensitive than the simpler -Wcast-function-type, which only checks for
  type width mismatches.'
