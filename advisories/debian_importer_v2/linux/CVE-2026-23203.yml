summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: cpsw_new:
  Execute ndo_set_rx_mode callback in a work queue  Commit 1767bb2d47b7 ("ipv6: mcast: Don''t
  hold RTNL for IPV6_ADD_MEMBERSHIP and MCAST_JOIN_GROUP.") removed the RTNL lock for IPV6_ADD_MEMBERSHIP
  and MCAST_JOIN_GROUP operations. However, this change triggered the following call trace on
  my BeagleBone Black board:   WARNING: net/8021q/vlan_core.c:236 at vlan_for_each+0x120/0x124,

  from ret_fast_syscall+0x0/0x5  This trace occurs because vlan_for_each() is called within
  cpsw_ndo_set_rx_mode(), which expects the RTNL lock to be held. Since modifying vlan_for_each()
  to operate without the RTNL lock is not straightforward, and because ndo_set_rx_mode() is
  invoked both with and without the RTNL lock across different code paths, simply adding rtnl_lock()
  in cpsw_ndo_set_rx_mode() is not a viable solution.  To resolve this issue, we opt to execute
  the actual processing within a work queue, following the approach used by the icssg-prueth
  driver.'
