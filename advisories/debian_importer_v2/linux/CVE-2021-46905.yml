summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: hso: fix
  NULL-deref on disconnect regression  Commit 8a12f8836145 ("net: hso: fix null-ptr-deref during
  tty device unregistration") fixed the racy minor allocation reported by syzbot, but introduced
  an unconditional NULL-pointer dereference on every disconnect instead.  Specifically, the
  serial device table must no longer be accessed after the minor has been released by hso_serial_tty_unregister().'
