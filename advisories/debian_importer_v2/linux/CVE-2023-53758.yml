  - CVE-2023-53758
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  spi: atmel-quadspi:
  Free resources even if runtime resume failed in .remove()  An early error exit in atmel_qspi_remove()
  doesn''t prevent the device unbind. So this results in an spi controller with an unbound parent
  and unmapped register space (because devm_ioremap_resource() is undone). So using the remaining
  spi controller probably results in an oops.  Instead unregister the controller unconditionally
  and only skip hardware access and clk disable.  Also add a warning about resume failing and
  return zero unconditionally. The latter has the only effect to suppress a less helpful error
  message by the spi core.'
