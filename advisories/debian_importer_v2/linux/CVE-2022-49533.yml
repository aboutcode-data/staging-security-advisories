summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ath11k: Change
  max no of active probe SSID and BSSID to fw capability  The maximum number of SSIDs in a for
  active probe requests is currently reported as 16 (WLAN_SCAN_PARAMS_MAX_SSID) when registering
  the driver. The scan_req_params structure only has the capacity to hold 10 SSIDs. This leads
  to a buffer overflow which can be triggered from wpa_supplicant in userspace. When copying
  the SSIDs into the scan_req_params structure in the ath11k_mac_op_hw_scan route, it can overwrite
  the extraie pointer.  Firmware supports 16 ssid * 4 bssid, for each ssid 4 bssid combo probe
  request will be sent, so totally 64 probe requests supported. So set both max ssid and bssid
  to 16 and 4 respectively. Remove the redundant macros of ssid and bssid.  Tested-on: IPQ8074
  hw2.0 AHB WLAN.HK.2.7.0.1-01300-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1'
