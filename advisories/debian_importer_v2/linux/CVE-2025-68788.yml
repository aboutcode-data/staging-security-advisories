summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fsnotify: do
  not generate ACCESS/MODIFY events on child for special files  inotify/fanotify do not allow
  users with no read access to a file to subscribe to events (e.g. IN_ACCESS/IN_MODIFY), but
  they do allow the same user to subscribe for watching events on children when the user has
  access to the parent directory (e.g. /dev).  Users with no read access to a file but with
  read access to its parent directory can still stat the file and see if it was accessed/modified
  via atime/mtime change.  The same is not true for special files (e.g. /dev/null). Users will
  not generally observe atime/mtime changes when other users read/write to special files, only
  when someone sets atime/mtime via utimensat().  Align fsnotify events with this stat behavior
  and do not generate ACCESS/MODIFY events to parent watchers on read/write of special files.
  The events are still generated to parent watchers on utimensat(). This closes some side-channels
  that could be possibly used for information exfiltration [1].  [1] https://snee.la/pdf/pubs/file-notification-attacks.pdf'
