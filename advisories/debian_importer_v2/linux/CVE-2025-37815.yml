summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  misc: microchip:
  pci1xxxx: Fix Kernel panic during IRQ handler registration  Resolve kernel panic while accessing
  IRQ handler associated with the generated IRQ. This is done by acquiring the spinlock and
  storing the current interrupt state before handling the interrupt request using generic_handle_irq.  A
  previous fix patch was submitted where ''generic_handle_irq'' was replaced with ''handle_nested_irq''.
  However, this change also causes the kernel panic where after determining which GPIO triggered
  the interrupt and attempting to call handle_nested_irq with the mapped IRQ number, leads to
  a failure in locating the registered handler.'
