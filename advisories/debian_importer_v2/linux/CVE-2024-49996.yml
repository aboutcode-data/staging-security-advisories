summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cifs: Fix buffer
  overflow when parsing NFS reparse points  ReparseDataLength is sum of the InodeType size and
  DataBuffer size. So to get DataBuffer size it is needed to subtract InodeType''s size from
  ReparseDataLength.  Function cifs_strndup_from_utf16() is currentlly accessing buf->DataBuffer
  at position after the end of the buffer because it does not subtract InodeType size from the
  length. Fix this problem and correctly subtract variable len.  Member InodeType is present
  only when reparse buffer is large enough. Check for ReparseDataLength before accessing InodeType
  to prevent another invalid memory access.  Major and minor rdev values are present also only
  when reparse buffer is large enough. Check for reparse buffer size before calling reparse_mkdev().'
