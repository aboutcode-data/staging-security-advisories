summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: qgroup:
  fix race between quota disable and quota rescan ioctl  There''s a race between a task disabling
  quotas and another running the rescan ioctl that can result in a use-after-free of qgroup
  records from the fs_info->qgroup_tree rbtree.  This happens as follows:  1) Task A enters
  btrfs_ioctl_quota_rescan() -> btrfs_qgroup_rescan();  2) Task B enters btrfs_quota_disable()
  and calls    btrfs_qgroup_wait_for_completion(), which does nothing because at that    point
  fs_info->qgroup_rescan_running is false (it wasn''t set yet by    task A);  3) Task B calls
  btrfs_free_qgroup_config() which starts freeing qgroups    from fs_info->qgroup_tree without
  taking the lock fs_info->qgroup_lock;  4) Task A enters qgroup_rescan_zero_tracking() which
  starts iterating    the fs_info->qgroup_tree tree while holding fs_info->qgroup_lock,    but
  task B is freeing qgroup records from that tree without holding    the lock, resulting in
  a use-after-free.  Fix this by taking fs_info->qgroup_lock at btrfs_free_qgroup_config().
  Also at btrfs_qgroup_rescan() don''t start the rescan worker if quotas were already disabled.'
