summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  keys: Fix UAF
  in key_put()  Once a key''s reference count has been reduced to 0, the garbage collector thread
  may destroy it at any time and so key_put() is not allowed to touch the key after that point.  The
  most key_put() is normally allowed to do is to touch key_gc_work as that''s a static global
  variable.  However, in an effort to speed up the reclamation of quota, this is now done in
  key_put() once the key''s usage is reduced to 0 - but now the code is looking at the key after
  the deadline, which is forbidden.  Fix this by using a flag to indicate that a key can be
  gc''d now rather than looking at the key''s refcount in the garbage collector.'
