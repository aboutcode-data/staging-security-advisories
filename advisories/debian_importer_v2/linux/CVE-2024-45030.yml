summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  igb: cope with
  large MAX_SKB_FRAGS  Sabrina reports that the igb driver does not cope well with large MAX_SKB_FRAG
  values: setting MAX_SKB_FRAG to 45 causes payload corruption on TX.  An easy reproducer is
  to run ssh to connect to the machine.  With MAX_SKB_FRAGS=17 it works, with MAX_SKB_FRAGS=45
  it fails.  This has been reported originally in https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2265320  The
  root cause of the issue is that the driver does not take into account properly the (possibly
  large) shared info size when selecting the ring layout, and will try to fit two packets inside
  the same 4K page even when the 1st fraglist will trump over the 2nd head.  Address the issue
  by checking if 2K buffers are insufficient.'
