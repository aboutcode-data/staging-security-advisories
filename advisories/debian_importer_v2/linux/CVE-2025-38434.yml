summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Revert "riscv:
  Define TASK_SIZE_MAX for __access_ok()"  This reverts commit ad5643cf2f69 ("riscv: Define
  TASK_SIZE_MAX for __access_ok()").  This commit changes TASK_SIZE_MAX to be LONG_MAX to optimize
  access_ok(), because the previous TASK_SIZE_MAX (default to TASK_SIZE) requires some computation.  The
  reasoning was that all user addresses are less than LONG_MAX, and all kernel addresses are
  greater than LONG_MAX. Therefore access_ok() can filter kernel addresses.  Addresses between
  TASK_SIZE and LONG_MAX are not valid user addresses, but access_ok() let them pass. That was
  thought to be okay, because they are not valid addresses at hardware level.  Unfortunately,
  one case is missed: get_user_pages_fast() happily accepts addresses between TASK_SIZE and
  LONG_MAX. futex(), for instance, uses get_user_pages_fast(). This causes the problem reported
  by Robert [1].  Therefore, revert this commit. TASK_SIZE_MAX is changed to the default: TASK_SIZE.  This
  unfortunately reduces performance, because TASK_SIZE is more expensive to compute compared
  to LONG_MAX. But correctness first, we can think about optimization later, if required.'
