summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iio: adc: ina2xx:
  avoid NULL pointer dereference on OF device match  The affected lines were resulting in a
  NULL pointer dereference on our platform because the device tree contained the following list
  of compatible strings:      power-sensor@40 {         compatible = "ti,ina232", "ti,ina231";         ...     };  Since
  the driver doesn''t declare a compatible string "ti,ina232", the OF matching succeeds on "ti,ina231".
  But the I2C device ID info is populated via the first compatible string, cf. modalias population
  in of_i2c_get_board_info(). Since there is no "ina232" entry in the legacy I2C device ID table
  either, the struct i2c_device_id *id pointer in the probe function is NULL.  Fix this by using
  the already populated type variable instead, which points to the proper driver data. Since
  the name is also wanted, add a generic one to the ina2xx_config table.'
