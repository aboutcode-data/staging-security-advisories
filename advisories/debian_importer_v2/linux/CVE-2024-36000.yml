summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/hugetlb: fix\
  \ missing hugetlb_lock for resv uncharge  There is a recent report on UFFDIO_COPY over hugetlb:\
  \  https://lore.kernel.org/all/000000000000ee06de0616177560@google.com/  350:\tlockdep_assert_held(&hugetlb_lock);\
  \  Should be an issue in hugetlb but triggered in an userfault context, where it goes into\
  \ the unlikely path where two threads modifying the resv map together.  Mike has a fix in\
  \ that path for resv uncharge but it looks like the locking criteria was overlooked: hugetlb_cgroup_uncharge_folio_rsvd()\
  \ will update the cgroup pointer, so it requires to be called with the lock held."
