summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  filemap: Handle
  sibling entries in filemap_get_read_batch()  If a read races with an invalidation followed
  by another read, it is possible for a folio to be replaced with a higher-order folio.  If
  that happens, we''ll see a sibling entry for the new folio in the next iteration of the loop.  This
  manifests as a NULL pointer dereference while holding the RCU read lock.  Handle this by simply
  returning.  The next call will find the new folio and handle it correctly.  The other ways
  of handling this rare race are more complex and it''s just not worth it.'
