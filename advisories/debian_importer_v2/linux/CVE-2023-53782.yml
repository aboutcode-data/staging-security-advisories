summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dccp: Fix out
  of bounds access in DCCP error handler  There was a previous attempt to fix an out-of-bounds
  access in the DCCP error handlers, but that fix assumed that the error handlers only want
  to access the first 8 bytes of the DCCP header. Actually, they also look at the DCCP sequence
  number, which is stored beyond 8 bytes, so an explicit pskb_may_pull() is required.'
