summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: ethernet:
  ti: am65-cpsw: fix memleak in certain XDP cases  If the XDP program doesn''t result in XDP_PASS
  then we leak the memory allocated by am65_cpsw_build_skb().  It is pointless to allocate SKB
  memory before running the XDP program as we would be wasting CPU cycles for cases other than
  XDP_PASS. Move the SKB allocation after evaluating the XDP program result.  This fixes the
  memleak. A performance boost is seen for XDP_DROP test.  XDP_DROP test: Before: 460256 rx/s                  0
  err/s After:  784130 rx/s                  0 err/s'
