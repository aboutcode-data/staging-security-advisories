summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf, arm64: Fix
  fp initialization for exception boundary  In the ARM64 BPF JIT when prog->aux->exception_boundary
  is set for a BPF program, find_used_callee_regs() is not called because for a program acting
  as exception boundary, all callee saved registers are saved. find_used_callee_regs() sets
  `ctx->fp_used = true;` when it sees FP being used in any of the instructions.  For programs
  acting as exception boundary, ctx->fp_used remains false even if frame pointer is used by
  the program and therefore, FP is not set-up for such programs in the prologue. This can cause
  the kernel to crash due to a pagefault.  Fix it by setting ctx->fp_used = true for exception
  boundary programs as fp is always saved in such programs.'
