summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring: wait
  interruptibly for request completions on exit  WHen the ring exits, cleanup is done and the
  final cancelation and waiting on completions is done by io_ring_exit_work. That function is
  invoked by kworker, which doesn''t take any signals. Because of that, it doesn''t really matter
  if we wait for completions in TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE or TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE state. However, it
  does matter to the hung task detection checker!  Normally we expect cancelations and completions
  to happen rather quickly. Some test cases, however, will exit the ring and park the owning
  task stopped (eg via SIGSTOP). If the owning task needs to run task_work to complete requests,
  then io_ring_exit_work won''t make any progress until the task is runnable again. Hence io_ring_exit_work
  can trigger the hung task detection, which is particularly problematic if panic-on-hung-task
  is enabled.  As the ring exit doesn''t take signals to begin with, have it wait interruptibly
  rather than uninterruptibly. io_uring has a separate stuck-exit warning that triggers independently
  anyway, so we''re not really missing anything by making this switch.'
