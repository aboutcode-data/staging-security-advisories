  - CVE-2017-12190
summary: The bio_map_user_iov and bio_unmap_user functions in block/bio.c in the Linux kernel
  before 4.13.8 do unbalanced refcounting when a SCSI I/O vector has small consecutive buffers
  belonging to the same page. The bio_add_pc_page function merges them into one, but the page
  reference is never dropped. This causes a memory leak and possible system lockup (exploitable
  against the host OS by a guest OS user, if a SCSI disk is passed through to a virtual machine)
  due to an out-of-memory condition.
