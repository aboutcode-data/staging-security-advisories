  - CVE-2021-47132
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mptcp: fix sk_forward_memory
  corruption on retransmission  MPTCP sk_forward_memory handling is a bit special, as such field
  is protected by the msk socket spin_lock, instead of the plain socket lock.  Currently we
  have a code path updating such field without handling the relevant lock:  __mptcp_retrans()
  -> __mptcp_clean_una_wakeup()  Several helpers in __mptcp_clean_una_wakeup() will update sk_forward_alloc,
  possibly causing such field corruption, as reported by Matthieu.  Address the issue providing
  and using a new variant of blamed function which explicitly acquires the msk spin lock.'
