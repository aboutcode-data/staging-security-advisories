  - CVE-2024-47732
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: iaa -
  Fix potential use after free bug  The free_device_compression_mode(iaa_device, device_mode)
  function frees "device_mode" but it iss passed to iaa_compression_modes[i]->free() a few lines
  later resulting in a use after free.  The good news is that, so far as I can tell, nothing
  implements the ->free() function and the use after free happens in dead code.  But, with this
  fix, when something does implement it, we''ll be ready.  :)'
