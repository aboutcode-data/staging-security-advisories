summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/rockchip:
  dw_hdmi: cleanup drm encoder during unbind  This fixes a use-after-free crash during rmmod.  The
  DRM encoder is embedded inside the larger rockchip_hdmi, which is allocated with the component.
  The component memory gets freed before the main drm device is destroyed. Fix it by running
  encoder cleanup before tearing down its container.  [moved encoder cleanup above clk_disable,
  similar to bind-error-path]'
