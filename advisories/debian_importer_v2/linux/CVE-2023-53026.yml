summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/core: Fix
  ib block iterator counter overflow  When registering a new DMA MR after selecting the best
  aligned page size for it, we iterate over the given sglist to split each entry to smaller,
  aligned to the selected page size, DMA blocks.  In given circumstances where the sg entry
  and page size fit certain sizes and the sg entry is not aligned to the selected page size,
  the total size of the aligned pages we need to cover the sg entry is >= 4GB. Under this circumstances,
  while iterating page aligned blocks, the counter responsible for counting how much we advanced
  from the start of the sg entry is overflowed because its type is u32 and we pass 4GB in size.
  This can lead to an infinite loop inside the iterator function because the overflow prevents
  the counter to be larger than the size of the sg entry.  Fix the presented problem by changing
  the advancement condition to eliminate overflow.  Backtrace: [  192.374329] efa_reg_user_mr_dmabuf
