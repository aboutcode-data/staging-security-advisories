  - CVE-2025-21746
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Input: synaptics
  - fix crash when enabling pass-through port  When enabling a pass-through port an interrupt
  might come before psmouse driver binds to the pass-through port. However synaptics sub-driver
  tries to access psmouse instance presumably associated with the pass-through port to figure
  out if only 1 byte of response or entire protocol packet needs to be forwarded to the pass-through
  port and may crash if psmouse instance has not been attached to the port yet.  Fix the crash
  by introducing open() and close() methods for the port and check if the port is open before
  trying to access psmouse instance. Because psmouse calls serio_open() only after attaching
  psmouse instance to serio port instance this prevents the potential crash.'
