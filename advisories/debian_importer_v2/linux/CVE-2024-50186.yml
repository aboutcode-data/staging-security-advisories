summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: explicitly
  clear the sk pointer, when pf->create fails  We have recently noticed the exact same KASAN
  splat as in commit 6cd4a78d962b ("net: do not leave a dangling sk pointer, when socket creation
  fails"). The problem is that commit did not fully address the problem, as some pf->create
  implementations do not use sk_common_release in their error paths.  For example, we can use
  the same reproducer as in the above commit, but changing ping to arping. arping uses AF_PACKET
  socket and if packet_create fails, it will just sk_free the allocated sk object.  While we
  could chase all the pf->create implementations and make sure they NULL the freed sk object
  on error from the socket, we can''t guarantee future protocols will not make the same mistake.  So
  it is easier to just explicitly NULL the sk pointer upon return from pf->create in __sock_create.
  We do know that pf->create always releases the allocated sk object on error, so if the pointer
  is not NULL, it is definitely dangling.'
