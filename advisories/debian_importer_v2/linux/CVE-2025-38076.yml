summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  alloc_tag: allocate
  percpu counters for module tags dynamically  When a module gets unloaded it checks whether
  any of its tags are still in use and if so, we keep the memory containing module''s allocation
  tags alive until all tags are unused.  However percpu counters referenced by the tags are
  freed by free_module().  This will lead to UAF if the memory allocated by a module is accessed
  after module was unloaded.  To fix this we allocate percpu counters for module allocation
  tags dynamically and we keep it alive for tags which are still in use after module unloading.  This
  also removes the requirement of a larger PERCPU_MODULE_RESERVE when memory allocation profiling
  is enabled because percpu memory for counters does not need to be reserved anymore.'
