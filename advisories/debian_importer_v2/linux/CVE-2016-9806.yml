summary: Race condition in the netlink_dump function in net/netlink/af_netlink.c in the Linux
  kernel before 4.6.3 allows local users to cause a denial of service (double free) or possibly
  have unspecified other impact via a crafted application that makes sendmsg system calls, leading
  to a free operation associated with a new dump that started earlier than anticipated.
