  - CVE-2021-47111
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xen-netback:
  take a reference to the RX task thread  Do this in order to prevent the task from being freed
  if the thread returns (which can be triggered by the frontend) before the call to kthread_stop
  done as part of the backend tear down. Not taking the reference will lead to a use-after-free
  in that scenario. Such reference was taken before but dropped as part of the rework done in
  2ac061ce97f4.  Reintroduce the reference taking and add a comment this time explaining why
  it''s needed.  This is XSA-374 / CVE-2021-28691.'
