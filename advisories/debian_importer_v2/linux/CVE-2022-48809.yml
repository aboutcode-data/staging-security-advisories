summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: fix a memleak
  when uncloning an skb dst and its metadata  When uncloning an skb dst and its associated metadata,
  a new dst+metadata is allocated and later replaces the old one in the skb. This is helpful
  to have a non-shared dst+metadata attached to a specific skb.  The issue is the uncloned dst+metadata
  is initialized with a refcount of 1, which is increased to 2 before attaching it to the skb.
  When tun_dst_unclone returns, the dst+metadata is only referenced from a single place (the
  skb) while its refcount is 2. Its refcount will never drop to 0 (when the skb is consumed),
  leading to a memory leak.  Fix this by removing the call to dst_hold in tun_dst_unclone, as
  the dst+metadata refcount is already 1.'
