summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: Destroy
  I/O bus devices on unregister failure _after_ sync''ing SRCU  If allocating a new instance
  of an I/O bus fails when unregistering a device, wait to destroy the device until after all
  readers are guaranteed to see the new null bus.  Destroying devices before the bus is nullified
  could lead to use-after-free since readers expect the devices on their reference of the bus
  to remain valid.'
