summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: prevent
  leak of lsm program after failed attach  In [0], we added the ability to bpf_prog_attach LSM
  programs to cgroups, but in our validation to make sure the prog is meant to be attached to
  BPF_LSM_CGROUP, we return too early if the check fails. This results in lack of decrementing
  prog''s refcnt (through bpf_prog_put) leaving the LSM program alive past the point of the
  expected lifecycle. This fix allows for the decrement to take place.  [0] https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220628174314.1216643-4-sdf@google.com/'
