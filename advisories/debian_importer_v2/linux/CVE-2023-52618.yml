summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  block/rnbd-srv:
  Check for unlikely string overflow  Since "dev_search_path" can technically be as large as
  PATH_MAX, there was a risk of truncation when copying it and a second string into "full_path"
  since it was also PATH_MAX sized. The W=1 builds were reporting this warning:  drivers/block/rnbd/rnbd-srv.c:
  In function ''process_msg_open.isra'': drivers/block/rnbd/rnbd-srv.c:616:51: warning: ''%s''
  directive output may be truncated writing up to 254 bytes into a region of size between 0
  and 4095 [-Wformat-truncation=]   616 |                 snprintf(full_path, PATH_MAX, "%s/%s",       |                                                   ^~

  fix this, unconditionally check for truncation (as was already done for the case where "%SESSNAME%"
  was present).'
