summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PCI: endpoint:
  Avoid creating sub-groups asynchronously  The asynchronous creation of sub-groups by a delayed
  work could lead to a NULL pointer dereference when the driver directory is removed before
  the work completes.  The crash can be easily reproduced with the following commands:    #
  cd /sys/kernel/config/pci_ep/functions/pci_epf_test   # for i in {1..20}; do mkdir test &&
  rmdir test; done    BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000088   ...   Call
  Trace:    configfs_register_group+0x3d/0x190    pci_epf_cfs_work+0x41/0x110    process_one_work+0x18f/0x350    worker_thread+0x25a/0x3a0  Fix
  this issue by using configfs_add_default_group() API which does not have the deadlock problem
  as configfs_register_group() and does not require the delayed work handler.  [mani: slightly
  reworded the description and added stable list]'
