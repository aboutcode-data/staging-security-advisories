  - CVE-2025-38429
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bus: mhi: ep:
  Update read pointer only after buffer is written  Inside mhi_ep_ring_add_element, the read
  pointer (rd_offset) is updated before the buffer is written, potentially causing race conditions
  where the host sees an updated read pointer before the buffer is actually written. Updating
  rd_offset prematurely can lead to the host accessing an uninitialized or incomplete element,
  resulting in data corruption.  Invoke the buffer write before updating rd_offset to ensure
  the element is fully written before signaling its availability.'
