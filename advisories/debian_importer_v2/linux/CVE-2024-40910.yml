summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ax25: Fix refcount
  imbalance on inbound connections  When releasing a socket in ax25_release(), we call netdev_put()
  to decrease the refcount on the associated ax.25 device. However, the execution path for accepting
  an incoming connection never calls netdev_hold(). This imbalance leads to refcount errors,
  and ultimately to kernel crashes.  A typical call trace for the above situation will start
  with one of the following errors:      refcount_t: decrement hit 0; leaking memory.     refcount_t:
  underflow; use-after-free.  And will then have a trace like:      Call Trace:     <TASK>     ?

  reboot (or any attempt to remove the interface), the kernel gets stuck in an infinite loop:      unregister_netdevice:
  waiting for ax0 to become free. Usage count = 0  This patch corrects these issues by ensuring
  that we call netdev_hold() and ax25_dev_hold() for new connections in ax25_accept(). This
  makes the logic leading to ax25_accept() match the logic for ax25_bind(): in both cases we
  increment the refcount, which is ultimately decremented in ax25_release().'
