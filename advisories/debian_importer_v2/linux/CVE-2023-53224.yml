summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: Fix function
  prototype mismatch for ext4_feat_ktype  With clang''s kernel control flow integrity (kCFI,
  CONFIG_CFI_CLANG), indirect call targets are validated against the expected function pointer
  prototype to make sure the call target is valid to help mitigate ROP attacks. If they are
  not identical, there is a failure at run time, which manifests as either a kernel panic or
  thread getting killed.  ext4_feat_ktype was setting the "release" handler to "kfree", which
  doesn''t have a matching function prototype. Add a simple wrapper with the correct prototype.  This
  was found as a result of Clang''s new -Wcast-function-type-strict flag, which is more sensitive
  than the simpler -Wcast-function-type, which only checks for type width mismatches.  Note
  that this code is only reached when ext4 is a loadable module and it is being unloaded:   CFI
  failure at kobject_put+0xbb/0x1b0 (target: kfree+0x0/0x180; expected type: 0x7c4aa698)  ...  RIP:
  0010:kobject_put+0xbb/0x1b0  ...  Call Trace:   <TASK>   ext4_exit_sysfs+0x14/0x60 [ext4]   cleanup_module+0x67/0xedb
