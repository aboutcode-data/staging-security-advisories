summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: mvpp2: Prevent
  parser TCAM memory corruption  Protect the parser TCAM/SRAM memory, and the cached (shadow)
  SRAM information, from concurrent modifications.  Both the TCAM and SRAM tables are indirectly
  accessed by configuring an index register that selects the row to read or write to. This means
  that operations must be atomic in order to, e.g., avoid spreading writes across multiple rows.
  Since the shadow SRAM array is used to find free rows in the hardware table, it must also
  be protected in order to avoid TOCTOU errors where multiple cores allocate the same row.  This
  issue was detected in a situation where `mvpp2_set_rx_mode()` ran concurrently on two CPUs.
  In this particular case the MVPP2_PE_MAC_UC_PROMISCUOUS entry was corrupted, causing the classifier
  unit to drop all incoming unicast - indicated by the `rx_classifier_drops` counter.'
