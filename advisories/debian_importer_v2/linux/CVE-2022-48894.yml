  - CVE-2022-48894
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommu/arm-smmu-v3:
  Don''t unregister on shutdown  Similar to SMMUv2, this driver calls iommu_device_unregister()
  from the shutdown path, which removes the IOMMU groups with no coordination whatsoever with
  their users - shutdown methods are optional in device drivers. This can lead to NULL pointer
  dereferences in those drivers'' DMA API calls, or worse.  Instead of calling the full arm_smmu_device_remove()
  from arm_smmu_device_shutdown(), let''s pick only the relevant function call - arm_smmu_device_disable()
  - more or less the reverse of arm_smmu_device_reset() - and call just that from the shutdown
  path.'
