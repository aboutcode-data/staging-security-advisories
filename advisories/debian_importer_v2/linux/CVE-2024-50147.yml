summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/mlx5: Fix
  command bitmask initialization  Command bitmask have a dedicated bit for MANAGE_PAGES command,
  this bit isn''t Initialize during command bitmask Initialization, only during MANAGE_PAGES.  In
  addition, mlx5_cmd_trigger_completions() is trying to trigger completion for MANAGE_PAGES
  command as well.  Hence, in case health error occurred before any MANAGE_PAGES command have
  been invoke (for example, during mlx5_enable_hca()), mlx5_cmd_trigger_completions() will try
  to trigger completion for MANAGE_PAGES command, which will result in null-ptr-deref error.[1]  Fix
  it by Initialize command bitmask correctly.  While at it, re-write the code for better understanding.  [1]
