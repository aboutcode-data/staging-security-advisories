summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: mpi3mr:
  Use number of bits to manage bitmap sizes  To allocate bitmaps, the mpi3mr driver calculates
  sizes of bitmaps using byte as unit. However, bitmap helper functions assume that bitmaps
  are allocated using unsigned long as unit. This gap causes memory access beyond the bitmap
  sizes and results in "BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds".  The BUG was observed at firmware download
  to eHBA-9600. Call trace indicated that the out-of-bounds access happened in find_first_zero_bit()
  called from mpi3mr_send_event_ack() for miroc->evtack_cmds_bitmap.  To fix the BUG, do not
  use bytes to manage bitmap sizes. Instead, use number of bits, and call bitmap helper functions
  which take number of bits as arguments. For memory allocation, call bitmap_zalloc() instead
  of kzalloc() and krealloc(). For memory free, call bitmap_free() instead of kfree(). For zero
  clear, call bitmap_clear() instead of memset().  Remove three fields for bitmap byte sizes
  in struct scmd_priv which are no longer required. Replace the field dev_handle_bitmap_sz with
  dev_handle_bitmap_bits to keep number of bits of removepend_bitmap across resize.'
