summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: bridge:
  fix vlan tunnel dst null pointer dereference  This patch fixes a tunnel_dst null pointer dereference
  due to lockless access in the tunnel egress path. When deleting a vlan tunnel the tunnel_dst
  pointer is set to NULL without waiting a grace period (i.e. while it''s still usable) and
  packets egressing are dereferencing it without checking. Use READ/WRITE_ONCE to annotate the
  lockless use of tunnel_id, use RCU for accessing tunnel_dst and make sure it is read only
  once and checked in the egress path. The dst is already properly RCU protected so we don''t
  need to do anything fancy than to make sure tunnel_id and tunnel_dst are read only once and
  checked in the egress path.'
