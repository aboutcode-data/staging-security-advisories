summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sh: dma: Fix
  DMA channel offset calculation  Various SoCs of the SH3, SH4 and SH4A family, which use this
  driver, feature a differing number of DMA channels, which can be distributed between up to
  two DMAC modules. The existing implementation fails to correctly accommodate for all those
  variations, resulting in wrong channel offset calculations and leading to kernel panics.  Rewrite
  dma_base_addr() in order to properly calculate channel offsets in a DMAC module. Fix dmaor_read_reg()
  and dmaor_write_reg(), so that the correct DMAC module base is selected for the DMAOR register.'
