summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: lpfc: Fix
  use-after-free KFENCE violation during sysfs firmware write  During the sysfs firmware write
  process, a use-after-free read warning is logged from the lpfc_wr_object() routine:    BUG:
  KFENCE: use-after-free read in lpfc_wr_object+0x235/0x310 [lpfc]   Use-after-free read at
  0x0000000000cf164d (in kfence-#111):   lpfc_wr_object+0x235/0x310 [lpfc]   lpfc_write_firmware.cold+0x206/0x30d

  driver accessed wr_object pointer data, which was initialized into mailbox payload memory,
  after the mailbox object was released back to the mailbox pool.  Fix by moving the mailbox
  free calls to the end of the routine ensuring that we don''t reference internal mailbox memory
  after release.'
