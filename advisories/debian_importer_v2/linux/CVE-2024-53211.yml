summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/l2tp: fix\
  \ warning in l2tp_exit_net found by syzbot  In l2tp's net exit handler, we check that an IDR\
  \ is empty before destroying it:  \tWARN_ON_ONCE(!idr_is_empty(&pn->l2tp_tunnel_idr)); \t\
  idr_destroy(&pn->l2tp_tunnel_idr);  By forcing memory allocation failures in idr_alloc_32,\
  \ syzbot is able to provoke a condition where idr_is_empty returns false despite there being\
  \ no items in the IDR. This turns out to be because the radix tree of the IDR contains only\
  \ internal radix-tree nodes and it is this that causes idr_is_empty to return false. The internal\
  \ nodes are cleaned by idr_destroy.  Use idr_for_each to check that the IDR is empty instead\
  \ of idr_is_empty to avoid the problem."
