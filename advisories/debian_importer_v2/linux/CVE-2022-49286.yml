  - CVE-2022-49286
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tpm: use try_get_ops()
  in tpm-space.c  As part of the series conversion to remove nested TPM operations:  https://lore.kernel.org/all/20190205224723.19671-1-jarkko.sakkinen@linux.intel.com/  exposure
  of the chip->tpm_mutex was removed from much of the upper level code.  In this conversion,
  tpm2_del_space() was missed.  This didn''t matter much because it''s usually called closely
  after a converted operation, so there''s only a very tiny race window where the chip can be
  removed before the space flushing is done which causes a NULL deref on the mutex.  However,
  there are reports of this window being hit in practice, so fix this by converting tpm2_del_space()
  to use tpm_try_get_ops(), which performs all the teardown checks before acquring the mutex.'
