summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nvme: host: fix
  double-free of struct nvme_id_ns in ns_update_nuse()  When nvme_identify_ns() fails, it frees
  the pointer to the struct nvme_id_ns before it returns. However, ns_update_nuse() calls kfree()
  for the pointer even when nvme_identify_ns() fails. This results in KASAN double-free, which
  was observed with blktests nvme/045 with proposed patches [1] on the kernel v6.8-rc7. Fix
  the double-free by skipping kfree() when nvme_identify_ns() fails.'
