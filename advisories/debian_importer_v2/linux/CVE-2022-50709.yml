summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath9k:
  avoid uninit memory read in ath9k_htc_rx_msg()  syzbot is reporting uninit value at ath9k_htc_rx_msg()
  [1], for ioctl(USB_RAW_IOCTL_EP_WRITE) can call ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream() with pkt_len = 0
  but ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream() uses __dev_alloc_skb(pkt_len + 32, GFP_ATOMIC) based on an assumption
  that pkt_len is valid. As a result, ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream() allocates skb with uninitialized
  memory and ath9k_htc_rx_msg() is reading from uninitialized memory.  Since bytes accessed
  by ath9k_htc_rx_msg() is not known until ath9k_htc_rx_msg() is called, it would be difficult
  to check minimal valid pkt_len at "if (pkt_len > 2 * MAX_RX_BUF_SIZE) {" line in ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream().  We
  have two choices. One is to workaround by adding __GFP_ZERO so that ath9k_htc_rx_msg() sees
  0 if pkt_len is invalid. The other is to let ath9k_htc_rx_msg() validate pkt_len before accessing.
  This patch chose the latter.  Note that I''m not sure threshold condition is correct, for
  I can''t find details on possible packet length used by this protocol.'
