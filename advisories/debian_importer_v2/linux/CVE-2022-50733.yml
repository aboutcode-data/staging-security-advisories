summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: idmouse:
  fix an uninit-value in idmouse_open  In idmouse_create_image, if any ftip_command fails, it
  will go to the reset label. However, this leads to the data in bulk_in_buffer[HEADER..IMGSIZE]
  uninitialized. And the check for valid image incurs an uninitialized dereference.  Fix this
  by moving the check before reset label since this check only be valid if the data after bulk_in_buffer[HEADER]
  has concrete data.  Note that this is found by KMSAN, so only kernel compilation is tested.'
