summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: chipidea:
  udc: disconnect/reconnect from host when do suspend/resume  Shawn and John reported a hang
  issue during system suspend as below:   - USB gadget is enabled as Ethernet  - There is data
  transfer over USB Ethernet (scp a big file between host                                              and
  device)  - Device is going in/out suspend (echo mem > /sys/power/state)  The root cause is
  the USB device controller is suspended but the USB bus is still active which caused the USB
  host continues to transfer data with device and the device continues to queue USB requests
  (in this case, a delayed TCP ACK packet trigger the issue) after controller is suspended,
  however the USB controller clock is already gated off. Then if udc driver access registers
  after that point, the system will hang.  The correct way to avoid such issue is to disconnect
  device from host when the USB bus is not at suspend state. Then the host will receive disconnect
  event and stop data transfer in time. To continue make USB gadget device work after system
  resume, this will reconnect device automatically.  To make usb wakeup work if USB bus is already
  at suspend state, this will keep connection for it only when USB device controller has enabled
  wakeup capability.'
