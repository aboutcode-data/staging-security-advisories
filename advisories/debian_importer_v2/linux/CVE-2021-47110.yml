summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/kvm: Disable
  kvmclock on all CPUs on shutdown  Currenly, we disable kvmclock from machine_shutdown() hook
  and this only happens for boot CPU. We need to disable it for all CPUs to guard against memory
  corruption e.g. on restore from hibernate.  Note, writing ''0'' to kvmclock MSR doesn''t clear
  memory location, it just prevents hypervisor from updating the location so for the short while
  after write and while CPU is still alive, the clock remains usable and correct so we don''t
  need to switch to some other clocksource.'
