  - CVE-2024-27069
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ovl: relax WARN_ON
  in ovl_verify_area()  syzbot hit an assertion in copy up data loop which looks like it is
  the result of a lower file whose size is being changed underneath overlayfs.  This type of
  use case is documented to cause undefined behavior, so returning EIO error for the copy up
  makes sense, but it should not be causing a WARN_ON assertion.'
