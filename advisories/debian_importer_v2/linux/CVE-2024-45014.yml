summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  s390/boot: Avoid
  possible physmem_info segment corruption  When physical memory for the kernel image is allocated
  it does not consider extra memory required for offsetting the image start to match it with
  the lower 20 bits of KASLR virtual base address. That might lead to kernel access beyond its
  memory range.'
