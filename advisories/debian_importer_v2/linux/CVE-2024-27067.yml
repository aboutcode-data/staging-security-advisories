summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xen/evtchn: avoid
  WARN() when unbinding an event channel  When unbinding a user event channel, the related handler
  might be called a last time in case the kernel was built with CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ. This might
  cause a WARN() in the handler.  Avoid that by adding an "unbinding" flag to struct user_event
  which will short circuit the handler.'
