summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfs: Fix oops
  in nfs_netfs_init_request() when copying to cache  When netfslib wants to copy some data that
  has just been read on behalf of nfs, it creates a new write request and calls nfs_netfs_init_request()
  to initialise it, but with a NULL file pointer.  This causes nfs_file_open_context() to oops
  - however, we don''t actually need the nfs context as we''re only going to write to the cache.  Fix
  this by just returning if we aren''t given a file pointer and emit a warning if the request
  was for something other than copy-to-cache.  Further, fix nfs_netfs_free_request() so that
  it doesn''t try to free the context if the pointer is NULL.'
