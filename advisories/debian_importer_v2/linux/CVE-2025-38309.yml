summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/xe/vm: move
  xe_svm_init() earlier  In xe_vm_close_and_put() we need to be able to call xe_svm_fini(),
  however during vm creation we can call this on the error path, before having actually initialised
  the svm state, leading to various splats followed by a fatal NPD.  (cherry picked from commit
  4f296d77cf49fcb5f90b4674123ad7f3a0676165)'
