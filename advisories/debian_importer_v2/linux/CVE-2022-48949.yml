summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  igb: Initialize
  mailbox message for VF reset  When a MAC address is not assigned to the VF, that portion of
  the message sent to the VF is not set. The memory, however, is allocated from the stack meaning
  that information may be leaked to the VM. Initialize the message buffer to 0 so that no information
  is passed to the VM in this case.'
