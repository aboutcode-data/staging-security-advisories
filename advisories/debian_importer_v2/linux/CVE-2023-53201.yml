summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/bnxt_re:
  wraparound mbox producer index  Driver is not handling the wraparound of the mbox producer
  index correctly. Currently the wraparound happens once u32 max is reached.  Bit 31 of the
  producer index register is special and should be set only once for the first command. Because
  the producer index overflow setting bit31 after a long time, FW goes to initialization sequence
  and this causes FW hang.  Fix is to wraparound the mbox producer index once it reaches u16
  max.'
