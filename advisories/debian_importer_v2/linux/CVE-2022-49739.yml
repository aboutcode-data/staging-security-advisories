summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gfs2: Always
  check inode size of inline inodes  Check if the inode size of stuffed (inline) inodes is within
  the allowed range when reading inodes from disk (gfs2_dinode_in()).  This prevents us from
  on-disk corruption.  The two checks in stuffed_readpage() and gfs2_unstuffer_page() that just
  truncate inline data to the maximum allowed size don''t actually make sense, and they can
  be removed now as well.'
