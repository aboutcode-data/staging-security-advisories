summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Fix verifier
  assumptions about socket->sk  The verifier assumes that ''sk'' field in ''struct socket''
  is valid and non-NULL when ''socket'' pointer itself is trusted and non-NULL. That may not
  be the case when socket was just created and passed to LSM socket_accept hook. Fix this verifier
  assumption and adjust tests.'
