summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  SUNRPC: Fix a
  slow server-side memory leak with RPC-over-TCP  Jan Schunk reports that his small NFS servers
  suffer from memory exhaustion after just a few days. A bisect shows that commit e18e157bb5c8
  ("SUNRPC: Send RPC message on TCP with a single sock_sendmsg() call") is the first bad commit.  That
  commit assumed that sock_sendmsg() releases all the pages in the underlying bio_vec array,
  but the reality is that it doesn''t. svc_xprt_release() releases the rqst''s response pages,
  but the record marker page fragment isn''t one of those, so it is never released.  This is
  a narrow fix that can be applied to stable kernels. A more extensive fix is in the works.'
