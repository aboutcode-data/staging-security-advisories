summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  arm64/sme: Set
  new vector length before reallocating  As part of fixing the allocation of the buffer for
  SVE state when changing SME vector length we introduced an immediate reallocation of the SVE
  state, this is also done when changing the SVE vector length for consistency. Unfortunately
  this reallocation is done prior to writing the new vector length to the task struct, meaning
  the allocation is done with the old vector length and can lead to memory corruption due to
  an undersized buffer being used.  Move the update of the vector length before the allocation
  to ensure that the new vector length is taken into account.  For some reason this isn''t triggering
  any problems when running tests on the arm64 fixes branch (even after repeated tries) but
  is triggering issues very often after merge into mainline.'
