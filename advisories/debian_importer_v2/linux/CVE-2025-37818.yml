summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  LoongArch: Return
  NULL from huge_pte_offset() for invalid PMD  LoongArch''s huge_pte_offset() currently returns
  a pointer to a PMD slot even if the underlying entry points to invalid_pte_table (indicating
  no mapping). Callers like smaps_hugetlb_range() fetch this invalid entry value (the address
  of invalid_pte_table) via this pointer.  The generic is_swap_pte() check then incorrectly
  identifies this address as a swap entry on LoongArch, because it satisfies the "!pte_present()
  && !pte_none()" conditions. This misinterpretation, combined with a coincidental match by
  is_migration_entry() on the address bits, leads to kernel crashes in pfn_swap_entry_to_page().  Fix
  this at the architecture level by modifying huge_pte_offset() to check the PMD entry''s content
  using pmd_none() before returning. If the entry is invalid (i.e., it points to invalid_pte_table),
  return NULL instead of the pointer to the slot.'
