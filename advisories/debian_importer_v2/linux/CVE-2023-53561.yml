summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: wwan: iosm:
  fix NULL pointer dereference when removing device  In suspend and resume cycle, the removal
  and rescan of device ends up in NULL pointer dereference.  During driver initialization, if
  the ipc_imem_wwan_channel_init() fails to get the valid device capabilities it returns an
  error and further no resource (wwan struct) will be allocated. Now in this situation if driver
  removal procedure is initiated it would result in NULL pointer exception since unallocated
  wwan struct is dereferenced inside ipc_wwan_deinit().  ipc_imem_run_state_worker() to handle
  the called functions return value and to release the resource in failure case. It also reports
  the link down event in failure cases. The user space application can handle this event to
  do a device reset for restoring the device communication.'
