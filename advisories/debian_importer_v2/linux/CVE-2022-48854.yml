summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: arc_emac:
  Fix use after free in arc_mdio_probe()  If bus->state is equal to MDIOBUS_ALLOCATED, mdiobus_free(bus)
  will free the "bus". But bus->name is still used in the next line, which will lead to a use
  after free.  We can fix it by putting the name in a local variable and make the bus->name
  point to the rodata section "name",then use the name in the error message without referring
  to bus to avoid the uaf.'
