summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: mac80211:
  Set n_channels after allocating struct cfg80211_scan_request  Make sure that n_channels is
  set after allocating the struct cfg80211_registered_device::int_scan_req member. Seen with
  syzkaller:  UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in net/mac80211/scan.c:1208:5 index 0 is out
  of range for type ''struct ieee80211_channel *[] __counted_by(n_channels)'' (aka ''struct
  ieee80211_channel *[]'')  This was missed in the initial conversions because I failed to locate
  the allocation likely due to the "sizeof(void *)" not matching the "channels" array type.'
