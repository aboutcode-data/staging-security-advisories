  - CVE-2021-26931
summary: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 2.6.39 through 5.10.16, as used in Xen.
  Block, net, and SCSI backends consider certain errors a plain bug, deliberately causing a
  kernel crash. For errors potentially being at least under the influence of guests (such as
  out of memory conditions), it isn't correct to assume a plain bug. Memory allocations potentially
  causing such crashes occur only when Linux is running in PV mode, though. This affects drivers/block/xen-blkback/blkback.c
  and drivers/xen/xen-scsiback.c.
