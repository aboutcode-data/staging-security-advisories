summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/alternatives:\
  \ Disable KASAN in apply_alternatives()  Fei has reported that KASAN triggers during apply_alternatives()\
  \ on a 5-level paging machine:  \tBUG: KASAN: out-of-bounds in rcu_is_watching() \tRead of\
  \ size 4 at addr ff110003ee6419a0 by task swapper/0/0 \t... \t__asan_load4() \trcu_is_watching()\
  \ \ttrace_hardirqs_on() \ttext_poke_early() \tapply_alternatives() \t...  On machines with\
  \ 5-level paging, cpu_feature_enabled(X86_FEATURE_LA57) gets patched. It includes KASAN code,\
  \ where KASAN_SHADOW_START depends on __VIRTUAL_MASK_SHIFT, which is defined with cpu_feature_enabled().\
  \  KASAN gets confused when apply_alternatives() patches the KASAN_SHADOW_START users. A test\
  \ patch that makes KASAN_SHADOW_START static, by replacing __VIRTUAL_MASK_SHIFT with 56, works\
  \ around the issue.  Fix it for real by disabling KASAN while the kernel is patching alternatives.\
  \  [ mingo: updated the changelog ]"
