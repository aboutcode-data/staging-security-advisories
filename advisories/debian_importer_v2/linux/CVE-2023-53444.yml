summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/ttm: fix
  bulk_move corruption when adding a entry  When the resource is the first in the bulk_move
  range, adding it again (thus moving it to the tail) will corrupt the list since the first
  pointer is not moved. This eventually lead to null pointer deref in ttm_lru_bulk_move_del()'
