summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Drivers: hv:
  vmbus: Track decrypted status in vmbus_gpadl  In CoCo VMs it is possible for the untrusted
  host to cause set_memory_encrypted() or set_memory_decrypted() to fail such that an error
  is returned and the resulting memory is shared. Callers need to take care to handle these
  errors to avoid returning decrypted (shared) memory to the page allocator, which could lead
  to functional or security issues.  In order to make sure callers of vmbus_establish_gpadl()
  and vmbus_teardown_gpadl() don''t return decrypted/shared pages to allocators, add a field
  in struct vmbus_gpadl to keep track of the decryption status of the buffers. This will allow
  the callers to know if they should free or leak the pages.'
