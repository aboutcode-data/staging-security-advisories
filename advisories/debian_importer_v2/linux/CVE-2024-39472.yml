summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xfs: fix log
  recovery buffer allocation for the legacy h_size fixup  Commit a70f9fe52daa ("xfs: detect
  and handle invalid iclog size set by mkfs") added a fixup for incorrect h_size values used
  for the initial umount record in old xfsprogs versions.  Later commit 0c771b99d6c9 ("xfs:
  clean up calculation of LR header blocks") cleaned up the log reover buffer calculation, but
  stoped using the fixed up h_size value to size the log recovery buffer, which can lead to
  an out of bounds access when the incorrect h_size does not come from the old mkfs tool, but
  a fuzzer.  Fix this by open coding xlog_logrec_hblks and taking the fixed h_size into account
  for this calculation.'
