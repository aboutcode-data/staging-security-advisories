summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  keys: Fix overwrite
  of key expiration on instantiation  The expiry time of a key is unconditionally overwritten
  during instantiation, defaulting to turn it permanent. This causes a problem for DNS resolution
  as the expiration set by user-space is overwritten to TIME64_MAX, disabling further DNS updates.
  Fix this by restoring the condition that key_set_expiry is only called when the pre-parser
  sets a specific expiry.'
