summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  s390/lcs: Fix
  return type of lcs_start_xmit()  With clang''s kernel control flow integrity (kCFI, CONFIG_CFI_CLANG),
  indirect call targets are validated against the expected function pointer prototype to make
  sure the call target is valid to help mitigate ROP attacks. If they are not identical, there
  is a failure at run time, which manifests as either a kernel panic or thread getting killed.
  A proposed warning in clang aims to catch these at compile time, which reveals:    drivers/s390/net/lcs.c:2090:21:
  error: incompatible function pointer types initializing ''netdev_tx_t (*)(struct sk_buff *,
  struct net_device *)'' (aka ''enum netdev_tx (*)(struct sk_buff *, struct net_device *)'')
  with an expression of type ''int (struct sk_buff *, struct net_device *)'' [-Werror,-Wincompatible-function-pointer-types-strict]           .ndo_start_xmit         =
  lcs_start_xmit,                                     ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~   drivers/s390/net/lcs.c:2097:21:
  error: incompatible function pointer types initializing ''netdev_tx_t (*)(struct sk_buff *,

  ''struct net_device_ops'' expects a return type of ''netdev_tx_t'', not ''int''. Adjust the
  return type of lcs_start_xmit() to match the prototype''s to resolve the warning and potential
  CFI failure, should s390 select ARCH_SUPPORTS_CFI_CLANG in the future.'
