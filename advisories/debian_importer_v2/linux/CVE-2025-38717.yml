summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: kcm: Fix
  race condition in kcm_unattach()  syzbot found a race condition when kcm_unattach(psock) and
  kcm_release(kcm) are executed at the same time.  kcm_unattach() is missing a check of the
  flag kcm->tx_stopped before calling queue_work().  If the kcm has a reserved psock, kcm_unattach()
  might get executed between cancel_work_sync() and unreserve_psock() in kcm_release(), requeuing
  kcm->tx_work right before kcm gets freed in kcm_done().  Remove kcm->tx_stopped and replace
  it by the less error-prone disable_work_sync().'
