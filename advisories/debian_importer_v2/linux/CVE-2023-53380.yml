summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  md/raid10: fix
  null-ptr-deref of mreplace in raid10_sync_request  There are two check of ''mreplace'' in
  raid10_sync_request(). In the first check, ''need_replace'' will be set and ''mreplace'' will
  be used later if no-Faulty ''mreplace'' exists, In the second check, ''mreplace'' will be
  set to NULL if it is Faulty, but ''need_replace'' will not be changed accordingly. null-ptr-deref
  occurs if Faulty is set between two check.  Fix it by merging two checks into one. And replace
  ''need_replace'' with ''mreplace'' because their values are always the same.'
