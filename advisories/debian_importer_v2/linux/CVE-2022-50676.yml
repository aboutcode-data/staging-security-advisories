summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: rds: don''t
  hold sock lock when cancelling work from rds_tcp_reset_callbacks()  syzbot is reporting lockdep
  warning at rds_tcp_reset_callbacks() [1], for commit ac3615e7f3cffe2a ("RDS: TCP: Reduce code
  duplication in rds_tcp_reset_callbacks()") added cancel_delayed_work_sync() into a section
  protected by lock_sock() without realizing that rds_send_xmit() might call lock_sock().  We
  don''t need to protect cancel_delayed_work_sync() using lock_sock(), for even if rds_{send,recv}_worker()
  re-queued this work while __flush_work()  from cancel_delayed_work_sync() was waiting for
  this work to complete, retried rds_{send,recv}_worker() is no-op due to the absence of RDS_CONN_UP
  bit.'
