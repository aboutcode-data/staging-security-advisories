summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86: stop playing\
  \ stack games in profile_pc()  The 'profile_pc()' function is used for timer-based profiling,\
  \ which isn't really all that relevant any more to begin with, but it also ends up making\
  \ assumptions based on the stack layout that aren't necessarily valid.  Basically, the code\
  \ tries to account the time spent in spinlocks to the caller rather than the spinlock, and\
  \ while I support that as a concept, it's not worth the code complexity or the KASAN warnings\
  \ when no serious profiling is done using timers anyway these days.  And the code really does\
  \ depend on stack layout that is only true in the simplest of cases.  We've lost the comment\
  \ at some point (I think when the 32-bit and 64-bit code was unified), but it used to say:\
  \  \tAssume the lock function has either no stack frame or a copy \tof eflags from PUSHF.\
  \  which explains why it just blindly loads a word or two straight off the stack pointer and\
  \ then takes a minimal look at the values to just check if they might be eflags or the return\
  \ pc:  \tEflags always has bits 22 and up cleared unlike kernel addresses  but that basic\
  \ stack layout assumption assumes that there isn't any lock debugging etc going on that would\
  \ complicate the code and cause a stack frame.  It causes KASAN unhappiness reported for years\
  \ by syzkaller [1] and others [2].  With no real practical reason for this any more, just\
  \ remove the code.  Just for historical interest, here's some background commits relating\
  \ to this code from 2006:    0cb91a229364 (\"i386: Account spinlocks to the caller during\
  \ profiling for !FP kernels\")   31679f38d886 (\"Simplify profile_pc on x86-64\")  and a code\
  \ unification from 2009:    ef4512882dbe (\"x86: time_32/64.c unify profile_pc\")  but the\
  \ basics of this thing actually goes back to before the git tree."
