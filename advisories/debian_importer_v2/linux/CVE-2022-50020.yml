summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: avoid resizing
  to a partial cluster size  This patch avoids an attempt to resize the filesystem to an unaligned
  cluster boundary.  An online resize to a size that is not integral to cluster size results
  in the last iteration attempting to grow the fs by a negative amount, which trips a BUG_ON
  and leaves the fs with a corrupted in-memory superblock.'
