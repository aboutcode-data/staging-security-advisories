summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nvme: fix reconnection
  fail due to reserved tag allocation  We found a issue on production environment while using
  NVMe over RDMA, admin_q reconnect failed forever while remote target and network is ok. After
  dig into it, we found it may caused by a ABBA deadlock due to tag allocation. In my case,
  the tag was hold by a keep alive request waiting inside admin_q, as we quiesced admin_q while
  reset ctrl, so the request maked as idle and will not process before reset success. As fabric_q
  shares tagset with admin_q, while reconnect remote target, we need a tag for connect command,
  but the only one reserved tag was held by keep alive command which waiting inside admin_q.
  As a result, we failed to reconnect admin_q forever. In order to fix this issue, I think we
  should keep two reserved tags for admin queue.'
