summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drivers: base:
  Free devm resources when unregistering a device  In the current code, devres_release_all()
  only gets called if the device has a bus and has been probed.  This leads to issues when using
  bus-less or driver-less devices where the device might never get freed if a managed resource
  holds a reference to the device. This is happening in the DRM framework for example.  We should
  thus call devres_release_all() in the device_del() function to make sure that the device-managed
  actions are properly executed when the device is unregistered, even if it has neither a bus
  nor a driver.  This is effectively the same change than commit 2f8d16a996da ("devres: release
  resources on device_del()") that got reverted by commit a525a3ddeaca ("driver core: free devres
  in device_release") over memory leaks concerns.  This patch effectively combines the two commits
  mentioned above to release the resources both on device_del() and device_release() and get
  the best of both worlds.'
