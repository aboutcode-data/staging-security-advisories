summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  linkwatch: use
  __dev_put() in callers to prevent UAF  After linkwatch_do_dev() calls __dev_put() to release
  the linkwatch reference, the device refcount may drop to 1. At this point, netdev_run_todo()
  can proceed (since linkwatch_sync_dev() sees an empty list and returns without blocking),
  wait for the refcount to become 1 via netdev_wait_allrefs_any(), and then free the device
  via kobject_put().  This creates a use-after-free when __linkwatch_run_queue() tries to call
  netdev_unlock_ops() on the already-freed device.  Note that adding netdev_lock_ops()/netdev_unlock_ops()
  pair in netdev_run_todo() before kobject_put() would not work, because netdev_lock_ops() is
  conditional - it only locks when netdev_need_ops_lock() returns true. If the device doesn''t
  require ops_lock, linkwatch won''t hold any lock, and netdev_run_todo() acquiring the lock
  won''t provide synchronization.  Fix this by moving __dev_put() from linkwatch_do_dev() to
  its callers. The device reference logically pairs with de-listing the device, so it''s reasonable
  for the caller that did the de-listing to release it. This allows placing __dev_put() after
  all device accesses are complete, preventing UAF.  The bug can be reproduced by adding mdelay(2000)
  after linkwatch_do_dev() in __linkwatch_run_queue(), then running:    ip tuntap add mode tun
  name tun_test   ip link set tun_test up   ip link set tun_test carrier off   ip link set tun_test
  carrier on   sleep 0.5   ip tuntap del mode tun name tun_test  KASAN report:   ==================================================================  BUG:
