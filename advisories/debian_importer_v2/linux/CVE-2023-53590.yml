summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sctp: add a refcnt
  in sctp_stream_priorities to avoid a nested loop  With this refcnt added in sctp_stream_priorities,
  we don''t need to traverse all streams to check if the prio is used by other streams when
  freeing one stream''s prio in sctp_sched_prio_free_sid(). This can avoid a nested loop (up
  to 65535 * 65535), which may cause a stuck as Ying reported:      watchdog: BUG: soft lockup
  - CPU#23 stuck for 26s! [ksoftirqd/23:136]     Call Trace:      <TASK>      sctp_sched_prio_free_sid+0xab/0x100
  [sctp]      sctp_stream_free_ext+0x64/0xa0 [sctp]      sctp_stream_free+0x31/0x50 [sctp]      sctp_association_free+0xa5/0x200
  [sctp]  Note that it doesn''t need to use refcount_t type for this counter, as its accessing
  is always protected under the sock lock.  v1->v2:  - add a check in sctp_sched_prio_set to
  avoid the possible prio_head    refcnt overflow.'
