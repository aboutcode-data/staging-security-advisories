summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: core: Put
  LLD module refcnt after SCSI device is released  SCSI host release is triggered when SCSI
  device is freed. We have to make sure that the low-level device driver module won''t be unloaded
  before SCSI host instance is released because shost->hostt is required in the release handler.  Make
  sure to put LLD module refcnt after SCSI device is released.  Fixes a kernel panic of ''BUG:
  unable to handle page fault for address'' reported by Changhui and Yi.'
