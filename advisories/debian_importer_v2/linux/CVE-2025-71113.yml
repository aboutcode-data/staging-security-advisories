summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: af_alg
  - zero initialize memory allocated via sock_kmalloc  Several crypto user API contexts and
  requests allocated with sock_kmalloc() were left uninitialized, relying on callers to set
  fields explicitly. This resulted in the use of uninitialized data in certain error paths or
  when new fields are added in the future.  The ACVP patches also contain two user-space interface
  files: algif_kpp.c and algif_akcipher.c. These too rely on proper initialization of their
  context structures.  A particular issue has been observed with the newly added ''inflight''
  variable introduced in af_alg_ctx by commit:    67b164a871af ("crypto: af_alg - Disallow multiple
  in-flight AIO requests")  Because the context is not memset to zero after allocation, the
  inflight variable has contained garbage values. As a result, af_alg_alloc_areq() has incorrectly
  returned -EBUSY randomly when the garbage value was interpreted as true:    https://github.com/gregkh/linux/blame/master/crypto/af_alg.c#L1209  The
  check directly tests ctx->inflight without explicitly comparing against true/false. Since
  inflight is only ever set to true or false later, an uninitialized value has triggered -EBUSY
  failures. Zero-initializing memory allocated with sock_kmalloc() ensures inflight and other
  fields start in a known state, removing random issues caused by uninitialized data.'
