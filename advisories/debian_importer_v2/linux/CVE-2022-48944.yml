summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sched: Fix yet
  more sched_fork() races  Where commit 4ef0c5c6b5ba ("kernel/sched: Fix sched_fork() access
  an invalid sched_task_group") fixed a fork race vs cgroup, it opened up a race vs syscalls
  by not placing the task on the runqueue before it gets exposed through the pidhash.  Commit
  13765de8148f ("sched/fair: Fix fault in reweight_entity") is trying to fix a single instance
  of this, instead fix the whole class of issues, effectively reverting this commit.'
