summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm: turn folio_test_hugetlb
  into a PageType  The current folio_test_hugetlb() can be fooled by a concurrent folio split
  into returning true for a folio which has never belonged to hugetlbfs.  This can''t happen
  if the caller holds a refcount on it, but we have a few places (memory-failure, compaction,
  procfs) which do not and should not take a speculative reference.  Since hugetlb pages do
  not use individual page mapcounts (they are always fully mapped and use the entire_mapcount
  field to record the number of mappings), the PageType field is available now that page_mapcount()
  ignores the value in this field.  In compaction and with CONFIG_DEBUG_VM enabled, the current
  implementation can result in an oops, as reported by Luis. This happens since 9c5ccf2db04b
  ("mm: remove HUGETLB_PAGE_DTOR") effectively added some VM_BUG_ON() checks in the PageHuge()
  testing path.  [willy@infradead.org: update vmcoreinfo]'
