summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: gs_usb:
  gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): check actual_length before accessing header  The driver expects
  to receive a struct gs_host_frame in gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback().  Use struct_group to
  describe the header of the struct gs_host_frame and check that we have at least received the
  header before accessing any members of it.  To resubmit the URB, do not dereference the pointer
  chain "dev->parent->hf_size_rx" but use "parent->hf_size_rx" instead. Since "urb->context"
  contains "parent", it is always defined, while "dev" is not defined if the URB it too short.'
