  - CVE-2013-0913
summary: Integer overflow in drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem_execbuffer.c in the i915 driver in
  the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) subsystem in the Linux kernel through 3.8.3, as used in
  Google Chrome OS before 25.0.1364.173 and other products, allows local users to cause a denial
  of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
  application that triggers many relocation copies, and potentially leads to a race condition.
