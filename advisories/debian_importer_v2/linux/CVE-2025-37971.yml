summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  staging: bcm2835-camera:
  Initialise dev in v4l2_dev  Commit 42a2f6664e18 ("staging: vc04_services: Move global g_state
  to vchiq_state") changed mmal_init to pass dev->v4l2_dev.dev to vchiq_mmal_init, however nothing
  iniitialised dev->v4l2_dev, so we got a NULL pointer dereference.  Set dev->v4l2_dev.dev during
  bcm2835_mmal_probe. The device pointer could be passed into v4l2_device_register to set it,
  however that also has other effects that would need additional changes.'
