summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i3c: Add NULL
  pointer check in i3c_master_queue_ibi()  The I3C master driver may receive an IBI from a target
  device that has not been probed yet. In such cases, the master calls `i3c_master_queue_ibi()`
  to queue an IBI work task, leading to "Unable to handle kernel read from unreadable memory"
  and resulting in a kernel panic.  Typical IBI handling flow: 1. The I3C master scans target
  devices and probes their respective drivers. 2. The target device driver calls `i3c_device_request_ibi()`
  to enable IBI    and assigns `dev->ibi = ibi`. 3. The I3C master receives an IBI from the
  target device and calls    `i3c_master_queue_ibi()` to queue the target device driver’s IBI    handler
  task.  However, since target device events are asynchronous to the I3C probe sequence, step
  3 may occur before step 2, causing `dev->ibi` to be `NULL`, leading to a kernel panic.  Add
  a NULL pointer check in `i3c_master_queue_ibi()` to prevent accessing an uninitialized `dev->ibi`,
  ensuring stability.'
