summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  spi: microchip-core-qspi:
  stop checking viability of op->max_freq in supports_op callback  In commit 13529647743d9 ("spi:
  microchip-core-qspi: Support per spi-mem operation frequency switches") the logic for checking
  the viability of op->max_freq in mchp_coreqspi_setup_clock() was copied into mchp_coreqspi_supports_op().
  Unfortunately, op->max_freq is not valid when this function is called during probe but is
  instead zero. Accordingly, baud_rate_val is calculated to be INT_MAX due to division by zero,
  causing probe of the attached memory device to fail.  Seemingly spi-microchip-core-qspi was
  the only driver that had such a modification made to its supports_op callback when the per_op_freq
  capability was added, so just remove it to restore prior functionality.'
