summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: kvaser_usb:
  kvaser_usb_read_bulk_callback(): fix URB memory leak  Fix similar memory leak as in commit
  7352e1d5932a ("can: gs_usb: gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): fix URB memory leak").  In kvaser_usb_set_{,data_}bittiming()
  -> kvaser_usb_setup_rx_urbs(), the URBs for USB-in transfers are allocated, added to the dev->rx_submitted
  anchor and submitted. In the complete callback kvaser_usb_read_bulk_callback(), the URBs are
  processed and resubmitted. In kvaser_usb_remove_interfaces() the URBs are freed by calling
  usb_kill_anchored_urbs(&dev->rx_submitted).  However, this does not take into account that
  the USB framework unanchors the URB before the complete function is called. This means that
  once an in-URB has been completed, it is no longer anchored and is ultimately not released
  in usb_kill_anchored_urbs().  Fix the memory leak by anchoring the URB in the kvaser_usb_read_bulk_callback()
  to the dev->rx_submitted anchor.'
