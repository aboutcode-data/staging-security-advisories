  - CVE-2019-19070
summary: 'A memory leak in the spi_gpio_probe() function in drivers/spi/spi-gpio.c in the Linux
  kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by
  triggering devm_add_action_or_reset() failures, aka CID-d3b0ffa1d75d. NOTE: third parties
  dispute the relevance of this because the system must have already been out of memory before
  the probe began'
