summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  slab: Avoid race
  on slab->obj_exts in alloc_slab_obj_exts  If two competing threads enter alloc_slab_obj_exts()
  and one of them fails to allocate the object extension vector, it might override the valid
  slab->obj_exts allocated by the other thread with OBJEXTS_ALLOC_FAIL. This will cause the
  thread that lost this race and expects a valid pointer to dereference a NULL pointer later
  on.  Update slab->obj_exts atomically using cmpxchg() to avoid slab->obj_exts overrides by
  racing threads.  Thanks for Vlastimil and Suren''s help with debugging.'
