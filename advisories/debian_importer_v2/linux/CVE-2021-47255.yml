summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  kvm: LAPIC: Restore
  guard to prevent illegal APIC register access  Per the SDM, "any access that touches bytes
  4 through 15 of an APIC register may cause undefined behavior and must not be executed." Worse,
  such an access in kvm_lapic_reg_read can result in a leak of kernel stack contents. Prior
  to commit 01402cf81051 ("kvm: LAPIC: write down valid APIC registers"), such an access was
  explicitly disallowed. Restore the guard that was removed in that commit.'
