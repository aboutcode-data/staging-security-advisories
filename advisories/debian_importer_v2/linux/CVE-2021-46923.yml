summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fs/mount_setattr:
  always cleanup mount_kattr  Make sure that finish_mount_kattr() is called after mount_kattr
  was succesfully built in both the success and failure case to prevent leaking any references
  we took when we built it.  We returned early if path lookup failed thereby risking to leak
  an additional reference we took when building mount_kattr when an idmapped mount was requested.'
