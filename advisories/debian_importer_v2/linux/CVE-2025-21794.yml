summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: hid-thrustmaster:
  fix stack-out-of-bounds read in usb_check_int_endpoints()  Syzbot[1] has detected a stack-out-of-bounds
  read of the ep_addr array from hid-thrustmaster driver. This array is passed to usb_check_int_endpoints
  function from usb.c core driver, which executes a for loop that iterates over the elements
  of the passed array. Not finding a null element at the end of the array, it tries to read
  the next, non-existent element, crashing the kernel.  To fix this, a 0 element was added at
  the end of the array to break the for loop.  [1] https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=9c9179ac46169c56c1ad'
