summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm: vmalloc:
  ensure vmap_block is initialised before adding to queue  Commit 8c61291fd850 ("mm: fix incorrect
  vbq reference in purge_fragmented_block") extended the ''vmap_block'' structure to contain
  a ''cpu'' field which is set at allocation time to the id of the initialising CPU.  When a
  new ''vmap_block'' is being instantiated by new_vmap_block(), the partially initialised structure
  is added to the local ''vmap_block_queue'' xarray before the ''cpu'' field has been initialised.  If
  another CPU is concurrently walking the xarray (e.g.  via vm_unmap_aliases()), then it may
  perform an out-of-bounds access to the remote queue thanks to an uninitialised index.  This
  has been observed as UBSAN errors in Android:   | Internal error: UBSAN: array index out of
  bounds: 00000000f2005512 [#1] PREEMPT SMP  |  | Call trace:  |  purge_fragmented_block+0x204/0x21c  |  _vm_unmap_aliases+0x170/0x378  |  vm_unmap_aliases+0x1c/0x28  |  change_memory_common+0x1dc/0x26c  |  set_memory_ro+0x18/0x24  |  module_enable_ro+0x98/0x238  |  do_init_module+0x1b0/0x310  Move
  the initialisation of ''vb->cpu'' in new_vmap_block() ahead of the addition to the xarray.'
