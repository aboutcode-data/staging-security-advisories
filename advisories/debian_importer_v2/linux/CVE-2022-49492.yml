summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nvme-pci: fix
  a NULL pointer dereference in nvme_alloc_admin_tags  In nvme_alloc_admin_tags, the admin_q
  can be set to an error (typically -ENOMEM) if the blk_mq_init_queue call fails to set up the
  queue, which is checked immediately after the call. However, when we return the error message
  up the stack, to nvme_reset_work the error takes us to nvme_remove_dead_ctrl()   nvme_dev_disable()    nvme_suspend_queue(&dev->queues[0]).  Here,
  we only check that the admin_q is non-NULL, rather than not an error or NULL, and begin quiescing
  a queue that never existed, leading to bad / NULL pointer dereference.'
