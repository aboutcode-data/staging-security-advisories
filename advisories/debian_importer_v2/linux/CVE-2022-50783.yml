summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mptcp: use proper
  req destructor for IPv6  Before, only the destructor from TCP request sock in IPv4 was called
  even if the subflow was IPv6.  It is important to use the right destructor to avoid memory
  leaks with some advanced IPv6 features, e.g. when the request socks contain specific IPv6
  options.'
