summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/smc: fix\
  \ NULL sndbuf_desc in smc_cdc_tx_handler()  When performing a stress test on SMC-R by rmmod\
  \ mlx5_ib driver during the wrk/nginx test, we found that there is a probability of triggering\
  \ a panic while terminating all link groups.  This issue dues to the race between smc_smcr_terminate_all()\
  \ and smc_buf_create().  \t\t\tsmc_smcr_terminate_all  smc_buf_create /* init */ conn->sndbuf_desc\
  \ = NULL; ...  \t\t\t__smc_lgr_terminate \t\t\t\tsmc_conn_kill \t\t\t\t\tsmc_close_abort \t\
  \t\t\t\t\tsmc_cdc_get_slot_and_msg_send  \t\t\t__softirqentry_text_start \t\t\t\tsmc_wr_tx_process_cqe\
  \ \t\t\t\t\tsmc_cdc_tx_handler \t\t\t\t\t\tREAD(conn->sndbuf_desc->len); \t\t\t\t\t\t/* panic\
  \ dues to NULL sndbuf_desc */  conn->sndbuf_desc = xxx;  This patch tries to fix the issue\
  \ by always to check the sndbuf_desc before send any cdc msg, to make sure that no null pointer\
  \ is seen during cqe processing."
