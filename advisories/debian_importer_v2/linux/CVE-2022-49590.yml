summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  igmp: Fix data-races
  around sysctl_igmp_llm_reports.  While reading sysctl_igmp_llm_reports, it can be changed
  concurrently. Thus, we need to add READ_ONCE() to its readers.  This test can be packed into
  a helper, so such changes will be in the follow-up series after net is merged into net-next.    if
  (ipv4_is_local_multicast(pmc->multiaddr) &&       !READ_ONCE(net->ipv4.sysctl_igmp_llm_reports))'
