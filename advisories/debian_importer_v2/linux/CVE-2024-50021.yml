summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ice: Fix improper
  handling of refcount in ice_dpll_init_rclk_pins()  This patch addresses a reference count
  handling issue in the ice_dpll_init_rclk_pins() function. The function calls ice_dpll_get_pins(),
  which increments the reference count of the relevant resources. However, if the condition
  WARN_ON((!vsi || !vsi->netdev)) is met, the function currently returns an error without properly
  releasing the resources acquired by ice_dpll_get_pins(), leading to a reference count leak.  To
  resolve this, the check has been moved to the top of the function. This ensures that the function
  verifies the state before any resources are acquired, avoiding the need for additional resource
  management in the error path.  This bug was identified by an experimental static analysis
  tool developed by our team. The tool specializes in analyzing reference count operations and
  detecting potential issues where resources are not properly managed. In this case, the tool
  flagged the missing release operation as a potential problem, which led to the development
  of this patch.'
