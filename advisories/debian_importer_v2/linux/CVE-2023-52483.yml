summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mctp: perform
  route lookups under a RCU read-side lock  Our current route lookups (mctp_route_lookup and
  mctp_route_lookup_null) traverse the net''s route list without the RCU read lock held. This
  means the route lookup is subject to preemption, resulting in an potential grace period expiry,
  and so an eventual kfree() while we still have the route pointer.  Add the proper read-side
  critical section locks around the route lookups, preventing premption and a possible parallel
  kfree.  The remaining net->mctp.routes accesses are already under a rcu_read_lock, or protected
  by the RTNL for updates.  Based on an analysis from Sili Luo <rootlab@huawei.com>, where introducing
  a delay in the route lookup could cause a UAF on simultaneous sendmsg() and route deletion.'
