summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  s390/dasd: fix
  error recovery leading to data corruption on ESE devices  Extent Space Efficient (ESE) or
  thin provisioned volumes need to be formatted on demand during usual IO processing.  The dasd_ese_needs_format
  function checks for error codes that signal the non existence of a proper track format.  The
  check for incorrect length is to imprecise since other error cases leading to transport of
  insufficient data also have this flag set. This might lead to data corruption in certain error
  cases for example during a storage server warmstart.  Fix by removing the check for incorrect
  length and replacing by explicitly checking for invalid track format in transport mode.  Also
  remove the check for file protected since this is not a valid ESE handling case.'
