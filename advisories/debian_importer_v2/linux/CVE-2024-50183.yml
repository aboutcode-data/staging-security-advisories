summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: lpfc: Ensure
  DA_ID handling completion before deleting an NPIV instance  Deleting an NPIV instance requires
  all fabric ndlps to be released before an NPIV''s resources can be torn down.  Failure to
  release fabric ndlps beforehand opens kref imbalance race conditions.  Fix by forcing the
  DA_ID to complete synchronously with usage of wait_queue.'
