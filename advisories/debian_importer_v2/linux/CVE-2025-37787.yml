summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: dsa: mv88e6xxx:\
  \ avoid unregistering devlink regions which were never registered  Russell King reports that\
  \ a system with mv88e6xxx dereferences a NULL pointer when unbinding this driver: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/Z_lRkMlTJ1KQ0kVX@shell.armlinux.org.uk/\
  \  The crash seems to be in devlink_region_destroy(), which is not NULL tolerant but is given\
  \ a NULL devlink global region pointer.  At least on some chips, some devlink regions are\
  \ conditionally registered since the blamed commit, see mv88e6xxx_setup_devlink_regions_global():\
  \  \t\tif (cond && !cond(chip)) \t\t\tcontinue;  These are MV88E6XXX_REGION_STU and MV88E6XXX_REGION_PVT.\
  \ If the chip does not have an STU or PVT, it should crash like this.  To fix the issue, avoid\
  \ unregistering those regions which are NULL, i.e. were skipped at mv88e6xxx_setup_devlink_regions_global()\
  \ time."
