summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nvme-pci: fix
  mempool alloc size  Convert the max size to bytes to match the units of the divisor that calculates
  the worst-case number of PRP entries.  The result is used to determine how many PRP Lists
  are required. The code was previously rounding this to 1 list, but we can require 2 in the
  worst case. In that scenario, the driver would corrupt memory beyond the size provided by
  the mempool.  While unlikely to occur (you''d need a 4MB in exactly 127 phys segments on a
  queue that doesn''t support SGLs), this memory corruption has been observed by kfence.'
