summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: account
  for current allocated stack depth in widen_imprecise_scalars()  The usage pattern for widen_imprecise_scalars()
  looks as follows:      prev_st = find_prev_entry(env, ...);     queued_st = push_stack(...);     widen_imprecise_scalars(env,
  prev_st, queued_st);  Where prev_st is an ancestor of the queued_st in the explored states
  tree. This ancestor is not guaranteed to have same allocated stack depth as queued_st. E.g.
  in the following case:      def main():       for i in 1..2:         foo(i)        // same
  callsite, differnt param      def foo(i):       if i == 1:         use 128 bytes of stack       iterator
  based loop  Here, for a second ''foo'' call prev_st->allocated_stack is 128, while queued_st->allocated_stack
  is much smaller. widen_imprecise_scalars() needs to take this into account and avoid accessing
  bpf_verifier_state->frame[*]->stack out of bounds.'
