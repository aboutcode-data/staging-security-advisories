summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: ipset:
  fix performance regression in swap operation  The patch "netfilter: ipset: fix race condition
  between swap/destroy and kernel side add/del/test", commit 28628fa9 fixes a race condition.
  But the synchronize_rcu() added to the swap function unnecessarily slows it down: it can safely
  be moved to destroy and use call_rcu() instead.  Eric Dumazet pointed out that simply calling
  the destroy functions as rcu callback does not work: sets with timeout use garbage collectors
  which need cancelling at destroy which can wait. Therefore the destroy functions are split
  into two: cancelling garbage collectors safely at executing the command received by netlink
  and moving the remaining part only into the rcu callback.'
