summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: iris:
  Add sanity check for stop streaming  Add sanity check in iris_vb2_stop_streaming. If inst->state
  is already IRIS_INST_ERROR, we should skip the stream_off operation because it would still
  send packets to the firmware.  In iris_kill_session, inst->state is set to IRIS_INST_ERROR
  and session_close is executed, which will kfree(inst_hfi_gen2->packet). If stop_streaming
  is called afterward, it will cause a crash.  [bod: remove qcom from patch title]'
