summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/msm/dpu:
  Disallow unallocated resources to be returned  In the event that the topology requests resources
  that have not been created by the system (because they are typically not represented in dpu_mdss_cfg
  ^1), the resource(s) in global_state (in this case DSC blocks, until their allocation/assignment
  is being sanity-checked in "drm/msm/dpu: Reject topologies for which no DSC blocks are available")
  remain NULL but will still be returned out of dpu_rm_get_assigned_resources, where the caller
  expects to get an array containing num_blks valid pointers (but instead gets these NULLs).  To
  prevent this from happening, where null-pointer dereferences typically result in a hard-to-debug
  platform lockup, num_blks shouldn''t increase past NULL blocks and will print an error and
  break instead. After all, max_blks represents the static size of the maximum number of blocks
  whereas the actual amount varies per platform.  ^1: which can happen after a git rebase ended
  up moving additions to _dpu_cfg to a different struct which has the same patch context.  Patchwork:
