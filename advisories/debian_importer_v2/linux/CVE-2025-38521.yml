summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/imagination:
  Fix kernel crash when hard resetting the GPU  The GPU hard reset sequence calls pm_runtime_force_suspend()
  and pm_runtime_force_resume(), which according to their documentation should only be used
  during system-wide PM transitions to sleep states.  The main issue though is that depending
  on some internal runtime PM state as seen by pm_runtime_force_suspend() (whether the usage
  count is <= 1), pm_runtime_force_resume() might not resume the device unless needed. If that
  happens, the runtime PM resume callback pvr_power_device_resume() is not called, the GPU clocks
  are not re-enabled, and the kernel crashes on the next attempt to access GPU registers as
  part of the power-on sequence.  Replace calls to pm_runtime_force_suspend() and pm_runtime_force_resume()
  with direct calls to the driver''s runtime PM callbacks, pvr_power_device_suspend() and pvr_power_device_resume(),
  to ensure clocks are re-enabled and avoid the kernel crash.'
