  - CVE-2025-39802
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  lib/crypto: arm/poly1305:
  Fix register corruption in no-SIMD contexts  Restore the SIMD usability check that was removed
  by commit 773426f4771b ("crypto: arm/poly1305 - Add block-only interface").  This safety check
  is cheap and is well worth eliminating a footgun. While the Poly1305 functions should not
  be called when SIMD registers are unusable, if they are anyway, they should just do the right
  thing instead of corrupting random tasks'' registers and/or computing incorrect MACs.  Fixing
  this is also needed for poly1305_kunit to pass.  Just use may_use_simd() instead of the original
  crypto_simd_usable(), since poly1305_kunit won''t rely on crypto_simd_disabled_for_test.'
