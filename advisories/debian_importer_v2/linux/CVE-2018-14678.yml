  - CVE-2018-14678
summary: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.11, as used in Xen through
  4.11.x. The xen_failsafe_callback entry point in arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S does not properly
  maintain RBX, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (uninitialized memory
  usage and system crash). Within Xen, 64-bit x86 PV Linux guest OS users can trigger a guest
  OS crash or possibly gain privileges.
