  - CVE-2025-39965
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xfrm: xfrm_alloc_spi
  shouldn''t use 0 as SPI  x->id.spi == 0 means "no SPI assigned", but since commit 94f39804d891
  ("xfrm: Duplicate SPI Handling"), we now create states and add them to the byspi list with
  this value.  __xfrm_state_delete doesn''t remove those states from the byspi list, since they
  shouldn''t be there, and this shows up as a UAF the next time we go through the byspi list.'
