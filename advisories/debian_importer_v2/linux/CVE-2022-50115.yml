summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: SOF: ipc3-topology:
  Prevent double freeing of ipc_control_data via load_bytes  We have sanity checks for byte
  controls and if any of the fail the locally allocated scontrol->ipc_control_data is freed
  up, but not set to NULL.  On a rollback path of the error the higher level code will also
  try to free the scontrol->ipc_control_data which will eventually going to lead to memory corruption
  as double freeing memory is not a good thing.'
