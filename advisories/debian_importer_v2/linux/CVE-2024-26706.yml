summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  parisc: Fix random
  data corruption from exception handler  The current exception handler implementation, which
  assists when accessing user space memory, may exhibit random data corruption if the compiler
  decides to use a different register than the specified register %r29 (defined in ASM_EXCEPTIONTABLE_REG)
  for the error code. If the compiler choose another register, the fault handler will nevertheless
  store -EFAULT into %r29 and thus trash whatever this register is used for. Looking at the
  assembly I found that this happens sometimes in emulate_ldd().  To solve the issue, the easiest
  solution would be if it somehow is possible to tell the fault handler which register is used
  to hold the error code. Using %0 or %1 in the inline assembly is not posssible as it will
  show up as e.g. %r29 (with the "%r" prefix), which the GNU assembler can not convert to an
  integer.  This patch takes another, better and more flexible approach: We extend the __ex_table
  (which is out of the execution path) by one 32-word. In this word we tell the compiler to
  insert the assembler instruction "or %r0,%r0,%reg", where %reg references the register which
  the compiler choosed for the error return code. In case of an access failure, the fault handler
  finds the __ex_table entry and can examine the opcode. The used register is encoded in the
  lowest 5 bits, and the fault handler can then store -EFAULT into this register.  Since we
  extend the __ex_table to 3 words we can''t use the BUILDTIME_TABLE_SORT config option any
  longer.'
