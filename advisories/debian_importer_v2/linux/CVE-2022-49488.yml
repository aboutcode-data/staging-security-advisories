summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/msm/mdp5:
  Return error code in mdp5_mixer_release when deadlock is detected  There is a possibility
  for mdp5_get_global_state to return -EDEADLK when acquiring the modeset lock, but currently
  global_state in mdp5_mixer_release doesn''t check for if an error is returned.  To avoid a
  NULL dereference error, let''s have mdp5_mixer_release check if an error is returned and propagate
  that error.  Patchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/485181/'
