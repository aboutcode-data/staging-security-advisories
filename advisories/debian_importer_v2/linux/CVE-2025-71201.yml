summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfs: Fix early
  read unlock of page with EOF in middle  The read result collection for buffered reads seems
  to run ahead of the completion of subrequests under some circumstances, as can be seen in
  the following log snippet:      9p_client_res: client 18446612686390831168 response P9_TREAD
  tag  0 err 0     ...     netfs_sreq: R=00001b55[1] DOWN TERM  f=192 s=0 5fb2/5fb2 s=5 e=0     ...     netfs_collect_folio:

  0/4e s=0 e=0     netfs_sreq: R=00001b55[2] ZERO TERM  f=102 s=5fb2 4e/4e s=5 e=0  The ''cto=5fb2''
  indicates the collected file pos we''ve collected results to so far - but we still have 0x4e
  more bytes to go - so we shouldn''t have collected folio ix=00005 yet.  The ''ZERO'' subreq
  that clears the tail happens after we unlock the folio, allowing the application to see the
  uncleared tail through mmap.  The problem is that netfs_read_unlock_folios() will unlock a
  folio in which the amount of read results collected hits EOF position - but the ZERO subreq
  lies beyond that and so happens after.  Fix this by changing the end check to always be the
  end of the folio and never the end of the file.  In the future, I should look at clearing
  to the end of the folio here rather than adding a ZERO subreq to do this.  On the other hand,
  the ZERO subreq can run in parallel with an async READ subreq.  Further, the ZERO subreq may
  still be necessary to, say, handle extents in a ceph file that don''t have any backing store
  and are thus implicitly all zeros.  This can be reproduced by creating a file, the size of
  which doesn''t align to a page boundary, e.g. 24998 (0x5fb2) bytes and then doing something
  like:      xfs_io -c "mmap -r 0 0x6000" -c "madvise -d 0 0x6000" \            -c "mread -v
  0 0x6000" /xfstest.test/x  The last 0x4e bytes should all be 00, but if the tail hasn''t been
  cleared yet, you may see rubbish there.  This can be reproduced with kafs by modifying the
  kernel to disable the call to netfs_read_subreq_progress() and to stop afs_issue_read() from
  doing the async call for NETFS_READAHEAD. Reproduction can be made easier by inserting an
  mdelay(100) in netfs_issue_read() for the ZERO-subreq case.  AFS and CIFS are normally unlikely
  to show this as they dispatch READ ops asynchronously, which allows the ZERO-subreq to finish
  first.  9P''s READ op is completely synchronous, so the ZERO-subreq will always happen after.  It
  isn''t seen all the time, though, because the collection may be done in a worker thread.'
