  - CVE-2024-46762
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xen: privcmd:
  Fix possible access to a freed kirqfd instance  Nothing prevents simultaneous ioctl calls
  to privcmd_irqfd_assign() and privcmd_irqfd_deassign(). If that happens, it is possible that
  a kirqfd created and added to the irqfds_list by privcmd_irqfd_assign() may get removed by
  another thread executing privcmd_irqfd_deassign(), while the former is still using it after
  dropping the locks.  This can lead to a situation where an already freed kirqfd instance may
  be accessed and cause kernel oops.  Use SRCU locking to prevent the same, as is done for the
  KVM implementation for irqfds.'
