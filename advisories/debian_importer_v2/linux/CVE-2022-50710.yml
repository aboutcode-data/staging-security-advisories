summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ice: set tx_tstamps
  when creating new Tx rings via ethtool  When the user changes the number of queues via ethtool,
  the driver allocates new rings. This allocation did not initialize tx_tstamps. This results
  in the tx_tstamps field being zero (due to kcalloc allocation), and would result in a NULL
  pointer dereference when attempting a transmit timestamp on the new ring.'
