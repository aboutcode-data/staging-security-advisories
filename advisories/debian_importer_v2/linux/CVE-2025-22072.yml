summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  spufs: fix gang\
  \ directory lifetimes  prior to \"[POWERPC] spufs: Fix gang destroy leaks\" we used to have\
  \ a problem with gang lifetimes - creation of a gang returns opened gang directory, which\
  \ normally gets removed when that gets closed, but if somebody has created a context belonging\
  \ to that gang and kept it alive until the gang got closed, removal failed and we ended up\
  \ with a leak.  Unfortunately, it had been fixed the wrong way.  Dentry of gang directory\
  \ was no longer pinned, and rmdir on close was gone. One problem was that failure of open\
  \ kept calling simple_rmdir() as cleanup, which meant an unbalanced dput().  Another bug was\
  \ in the success case - gang creation incremented link count on root directory, but that was\
  \ no longer undone when gang got destroyed.  Fix consists of \t* reverting the commit in question\
  \ \t* adding a counter to gang, protected by ->i_rwsem of gang directory inode. \t* having\
  \ it set to 1 at creation time, dropped in both spufs_dir_close() and spufs_gang_close() and\
  \ bumped in spufs_create_context(), provided that it's not 0. \t* using simple_recursive_removal()\
  \ to take the gang directory out when counter reaches zero."
