  - CVE-2017-1000365
summary: The Linux Kernel imposes a size restriction on the arguments and environmental strings
  passed through RLIMIT_STACK/RLIM_INFINITY (1/4 of the size), but does not take the argument
  and environment pointers into account, which allows attackers to bypass this limitation. This
  affects Linux Kernel versions 4.11.5 and earlier. It appears that this feature was introduced
  in the Linux Kernel version 2.6.23.
