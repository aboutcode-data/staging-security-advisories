summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  workqueue: Put
  the pwq after detaching the rescuer from the pool  The commit 68f83057b913("workqueue: Reap
  workers via kthread_stop() and remove detach_completion") adds code to reap the normal workers
  but mistakenly does not handle the rescuer and also removes the code waiting for the rescuer
  in put_unbound_pool(), which caused a use-after-free bug reported by Cheung Wall.  To avoid
  the use-after-free bug, the pool’s reference must be held until the detachment is complete.
  Therefore, move the code that puts the pwq after detaching the rescuer from the pool.'
