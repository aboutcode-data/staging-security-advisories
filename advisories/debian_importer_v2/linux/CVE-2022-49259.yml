summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  block: don''t
  delete queue kobject before its children  kobjects aren''t supposed to be deleted before their
  child kobjects are deleted.  Apparently this is usually benign; however, a WARN will be triggered
  if one of the child kobjects has a named attribute group:      sysfs group ''modes'' not found
  for kobject ''crypto''     WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1 at fs/sysfs/group.c:278 sysfs_remove_group+0x72/0x80     ...     Call
