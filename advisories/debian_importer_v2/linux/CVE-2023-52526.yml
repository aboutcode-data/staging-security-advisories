summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  erofs: fix memory
  leak of LZMA global compressed deduplication  When stressing microLZMA EROFS images with the
  new global compressed deduplication feature enabled (`-Ededupe`), I found some short-lived
  temporary pages weren''t properly released, which could slowly cause unexpected OOMs hours
  later.  Let''s fix it now (LZ4 and DEFLATE don''t have this issue.)'
