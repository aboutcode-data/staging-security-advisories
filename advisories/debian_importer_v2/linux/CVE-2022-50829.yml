summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath9k:
  hif_usb: Fix use-after-free in ath9k_hif_usb_reg_in_cb()  It is possible that skb is freed
  in ath9k_htc_rx_msg(), then usb_submit_urb() fails and we try to free skb again. It causes
  use-after-free bug. Moreover, if alloc_skb() fails, urb->context becomes NULL but rx_buf is
  not freed and there can be a memory leak.  The patch removes unnecessary nskb and makes skb
  processing more clear: it is supposed that ath9k_htc_rx_msg() either frees old skb or passes
  its managing to another callback function.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org)
  with Syzkaller.'
