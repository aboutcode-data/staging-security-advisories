summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  s390/vfio-ap:
  fix memory leak in vfio_ap device driver  The device release callback function invoked to
  release the matrix device uses the dev_get_drvdata(device *dev) function to retrieve the pointer
  to the vfio_matrix_dev object in order to free its storage. The problem is, this object is
  not stored as drvdata with the device; since the kfree function will accept a NULL pointer,
  the memory for the vfio_matrix_dev object is never freed.  Since the device being released
  is contained within the vfio_matrix_dev object, the container_of macro will be used to retrieve
  its pointer.'
