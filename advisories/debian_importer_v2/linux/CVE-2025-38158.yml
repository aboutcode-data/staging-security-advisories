summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  hisi_acc_vfio_pci:
  fix XQE dma address error  The dma addresses of EQE and AEQE are wrong after migration and
  results in guest kernel-mode encryption services  failure. Comparing the definition of hardware
  registers, we found that there was an error when the data read from the register was combined
  into an address. Therefore, the address combination sequence needs to be corrected.  Even
  after fixing the above problem, we still have an issue where the Guest from an old kernel
  can get migrated to new kernel and may result in wrong data.  In order to ensure that the
  address is correct after migration, if an old magic number is detected, the dma address needs
  to be updated.'
