summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  smb: client:
  Avoid race in open_cached_dir with lease breaks  A pre-existing valid cfid returned from find_or_create_cached_dir
  might race with a lease break, meaning open_cached_dir doesn''t consider it valid, and thinks
  it''s newly-constructed. This leaks a dentry reference if the allocation occurs before the
  queued lease break work runs.  Avoid the race by extending holding the cfid_list_lock across
  find_or_create_cached_dir and when the result is checked.'
