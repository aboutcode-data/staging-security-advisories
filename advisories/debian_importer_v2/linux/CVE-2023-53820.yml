summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  loop: loop_set_status_from_info()
  check before assignment  In loop_set_status_from_info(), lo->lo_offset and lo->lo_sizelimit
  should be checked before reassignment, because if an overflow error occurs, the original correct
  value will be changed to the wrong value, and it will not be changed back.  More, the original
  patch did not solve the problem, the value was set and ioctl returned an error, but the subsequent
  io used the value in the loop driver, which still caused an alarm:  loop_handle_cmd  do_req_filebacked   loff_t
  pos = ((loff_t) blk_rq_pos(rq) << 9) + lo->lo_offset;   lo_rw_aio    cmd->iocb.ki_pos = pos'
