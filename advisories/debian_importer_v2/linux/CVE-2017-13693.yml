  - CVE-2017-13693
summary: The acpi_ds_create_operands() function in drivers/acpi/acpica/dsutils.c in the Linux
  kernel through 4.12.9 does not flush the operand cache and causes a kernel stack dump, which
  allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory and bypass the KASLR
  protection mechanism (in the kernel through 4.9) via a crafted ACPI table.
