summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: sched: fix
  memory leak in tcindex_partial_destroy_work  Syzbot reported memory leak in tcindex_set_parms().
  The problem was in non-freed perfect hash in tcindex_partial_destroy_work().  In tcindex_set_parms()
  new tcindex_data is allocated and some fields from old one are copied to new one, but not
  the perfect hash. Since tcindex_partial_destroy_work() is the destroy function for old tcindex_data,
  we need to free perfect hash to avoid memory leak.'
