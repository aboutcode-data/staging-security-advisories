summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: hda: Do
  not unset preset when cleaning up codec  Several functions that take part in codec''s initialization
  and removal are re-used by ASoC codec drivers implementations. Drivers mimic the behavior
  of hda_codec_driver_probe/remove() found in sound/pci/hda/hda_bind.c with their component->probe/remove()
  instead.  One of the reasons for that is the expectation of snd_hda_codec_device_new() to
  receive a valid pointer to an instance of struct snd_card. This expectation can be met only
  once sound card components probing commences.  As ASoC sound card may be unbound without codec
  device being actually removed from the system, unsetting ->preset in snd_hda_codec_cleanup_for_unbind()
  interferes with module unload -> load scenario causing null-ptr-deref. Preset is assigned
  only once, during device/driver matching whereas ASoC codec driver''s module reloading may
  occur several times throughout the lifetime of an audio stack.'
