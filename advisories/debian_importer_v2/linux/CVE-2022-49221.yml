summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/msm/dp: populate
  connector of struct dp_panel  DP CTS test case 4.2.2.6 has valid edid with bad checksum on
  purpose and expect DP source return correct checksum. During drm edid read, correct edid checksum
  is calculated and stored at connector::real_edid_checksum.  The problem is struct dp_panel::connector
  never be assigned, instead the connector is stored in struct msm_dp::connector. When we run
  compliance testing test case 4.2.2.6 dp_panel_handle_sink_request() won''t have a valid edid
  set in struct dp_panel::edid so we''ll try to use the connectors real_edid_checksum and hit
  a NULL pointer dereference error because the connector pointer is never assigned.  Changes
  in V2: -- populate panel connector at msm_dp_modeset_init() instead of at dp_panel_read_sink_caps()  Changes
  in V3: -- remove unhelpful kernel crash trace commit text -- remove renaming dp_display parameter
  to dp  Changes in V4: -- add more details to commit text  Changes in v10: --  group into one
  series  Changes in v11: -- drop drm/msm/dp: dp_link_parse_sink_count() return immediately
