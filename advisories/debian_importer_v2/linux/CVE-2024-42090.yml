summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  pinctrl: fix
  deadlock in create_pinctrl() when handling -EPROBE_DEFER  In create_pinctrl(), pinctrl_maps_mutex
  is acquired before calling add_setting(). If add_setting() returns -EPROBE_DEFER, create_pinctrl()
  calls pinctrl_free(). However, pinctrl_free() attempts to acquire pinctrl_maps_mutex, which
  is already held by create_pinctrl(), leading to a potential deadlock.  This patch resolves
  the issue by releasing pinctrl_maps_mutex before calling pinctrl_free(), preventing the deadlock.  This
  bug was discovered and resolved using Coverity Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) by
  Synopsys, Inc.'
