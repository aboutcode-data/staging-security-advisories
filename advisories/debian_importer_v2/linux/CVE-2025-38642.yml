summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: mac80211:
  fix WARN_ON for monitor mode on some devices  On devices without WANT_MONITOR_VIF (and probably
  without channel context support) we get a WARN_ON for changing the per-link setting of a monitor
  interface.  Since we already skip AP_VLAN interfaces and MONITOR with WANT_MONITOR_VIF and/or
  NO_VIRTUAL_MONITOR should update the settings, catch this in the link change code instead
  of the warning.'
