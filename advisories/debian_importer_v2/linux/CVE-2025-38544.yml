summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rxrpc: Fix bug
  due to prealloc collision  When userspace is using AF_RXRPC to provide a server, it has to
  preallocate incoming calls and assign to them call IDs that will be used to thread related
  recvmsg() and sendmsg() together.  The preallocated call IDs will automatically be attached
  to calls as they come in until the pool is empty.  To the kernel, the call IDs are just arbitrary
  numbers, but userspace can use the call ID to hold a pointer to prepared structs.  In any
  case, the user isn''t permitted to create two calls with the same call ID (call IDs become
  available again when the call ends) and EBADSLT should result from sendmsg() if an attempt
  is made to preallocate a call with an in-use call ID.  However, the cleanup in the error handling
  will trigger both assertions in rxrpc_cleanup_call() because the call isn''t marked complete
  and isn''t marked as having been released.  Fix this by setting the call state in rxrpc_service_prealloc_one()
  and then marking it as being released before calling the cleanup function.'
