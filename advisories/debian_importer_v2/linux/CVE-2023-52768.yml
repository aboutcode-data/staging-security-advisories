summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: wilc1000:
  use vmm_table as array in wilc struct  Enabling KASAN and running some iperf tests raises
  some memory issues with vmm_table:  BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in wilc_wlan_handle_txq+0x6ac/0xdb4
  Write of size 4 at addr c3a61540 by task wlan0-tx/95  KASAN detects that we are writing data
  beyond range allocated to vmm_table. There is indeed a mismatch between the size passed to
  allocator in wilc_wlan_init, and the range of possible indexes used later: allocation size
  is missing a multiplication by sizeof(u32)'
