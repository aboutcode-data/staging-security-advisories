  - CVE-2024-40948
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/page_table_check:
  fix crash on ZONE_DEVICE  Not all pages may apply to pgtable check.  One example is ZONE_DEVICE
  pages: they map PFNs directly, and they don''t allocate page_ext at all even if there''s struct
  page around.  One may reference devm_memremap_pages().  When both ZONE_DEVICE and page-table-check
  enabled, then try to map some dax memories, one can trigger kernel bug constantly now when
  the kernel was trying to inject some pfn maps on the dax device:   kernel BUG at mm/page_table_check.c:55!  While
  it''s pretty legal to use set_pxx_at() for ZONE_DEVICE pages for page fault resolutions, skip
  all the checks if page_ext doesn''t even exist in pgtable checker, which applies to ZONE_DEVICE
  but maybe more.'
