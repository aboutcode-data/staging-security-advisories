summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/msm/dp: Drop
  aux devices together with DP controller  Using devres to depopulate the aux bus made sure
  that upon a probe deferral the EDP panel device would be destroyed and recreated upon next
  attempt.  But the struct device which the devres is tied to is the DPUs (drm_dev->dev), which
  may be happen after the DP controller is torn down.  Indications of this can be seen in the
  commonly seen EDID-hexdump full of zeros in the log, or the occasional/rare KASAN fault where
  the panel''s attempt to read the EDID information causes a use after free on DP resources.  It''s
  tempting to move the devres to the DP controller''s struct device, but the resources used
  by the device(s) on the aux bus are explicitly torn down in the error path. The KASAN-reported
  use-after-free also remains, as the DP aux "module" explicitly frees its devres-allocated
  memory in this code path.  As such, explicitly depopulate the aux bus in the error path, and
  in the component unbind path, to avoid these issues.  Patchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/542163/'
