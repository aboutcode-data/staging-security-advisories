summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rds: sysctl:
  rds_tcp_{rcv,snd}buf: avoid using current->nsproxy  As mentioned in a previous commit of this
  series, using the ''net'' structure via ''current'' is not recommended for different reasons:  -
  Inconsistency: getting info from the reader''s/writer''s netns vs only   from the opener''s
  netns.  - current->nsproxy can be NULL in some cases, resulting in an ''Oops''   (null-ptr-deref),
  e.g. when the current task is exiting, as spotted by   syzbot [1] using acct(2).  The per-netns
  structure can be obtained from the table->data using container_of(), then the ''net'' one
  can be retrieved from the listen socket (if available).'
