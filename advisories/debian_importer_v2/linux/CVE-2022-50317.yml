summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/bridge: megachips:
  Fix a null pointer dereference bug  When removing the module we will get the following warning:  [   31.911505]
  i2c-core: driver [stdp2690-ge-b850v3-fw] unregistered [   31.912484] general protection fault,
  probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc0000000001: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN PTI [   31.913338]
  KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000008-0x000000000000000f] [   31.915280] RIP:
  0010:drm_bridge_remove+0x97/0x130 [   31.921825] Call Trace: [   31.922533]  stdp4028_ge_b850v3_fw_remove+0x34/0x60
  [megachips_stdpxxxx_ge_b850v3_fw] [   31.923139]  i2c_device_remove+0x181/0x1f0  The two bridges
  (stdp2690, stdp4028) do not probe at the same time, so the driver does not call ge_b850v3_resgiter()
  when probing, causing the driver to try to remove the object that has not been initialized.  Fix
  this by checking whether both the bridges are probed.'
