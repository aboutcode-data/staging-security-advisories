summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  pinctrl: mediatek:
  eint: Fix invalid pointer dereference for v1 platforms  Commit 3ef9f710efcb ("pinctrl: mediatek:
  Add EINT support for multiple addresses") introduced an access to the ''soc'' field of struct
  mtk_pinctrl in mtk_eint_do_init() and for that an include of pinctrl-mtk-common-v2.h.  However,
  pinctrl drivers relying on the v1 common driver include pinctrl-mtk-common.h instead, which
  provides another definition of struct mtk_pinctrl that does not contain an ''soc'' field.  Since
  mtk_eint_do_init() can be called both by v1 and v2 drivers, it will now try to dereference
  an invalid pointer when called on v1 platforms. This has been observed on Genio 350 EVK (MT8365),
  which crashes very early in boot (the kernel trace can only be seen with earlycon).  In order
  to fix this, since ''struct mtk_pinctrl'' was only needed to get a ''struct mtk_eint_pin'',
  make ''struct mtk_eint_pin'' a parameter of mtk_eint_do_init() so that callers need to supply
  it, removing mtk_eint_do_init()''s dependency on any particular ''struct mtk_pinctrl''.'
