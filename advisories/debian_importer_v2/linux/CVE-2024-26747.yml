summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: roles: fix
  NULL pointer issue when put module''s reference  In current design, usb role class driver
  will get usb_role_switch parent''s module reference after the user get usb_role_switch device
  and put the reference after the user put the usb_role_switch device. However, the parent device
  of usb_role_switch may be removed before the user put the usb_role_switch. If so, then, NULL
  pointer issue will be met when the user put the parent module''s reference.  This will save
  the module pointer in structure of usb_role_switch. Then, we don''t need to find module by
  iterating long relations.'
