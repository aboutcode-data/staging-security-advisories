summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: add bounds
  checking in get_max_inline_xattr_value_size()  Normally the extended attributes in the inode
  body would have been checked when the inode is first opened, but if someone is writing to
  the block device while the file system is mounted, it''s possible for the inode table to get
  corrupted.  Add bounds checking to avoid reading beyond the end of allocated memory if this
  happens.'
