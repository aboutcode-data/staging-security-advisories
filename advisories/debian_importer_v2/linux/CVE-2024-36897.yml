summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display:
  Atom Integrated System Info v2_2 for DCN35  New request from KMD/VBIOS in order to support
  new UMA carveout model. This fixes a null dereference from accessing Ctx->dc_bios->integrated_info

  but was missing a case for the new BIOS version 2.3.'
