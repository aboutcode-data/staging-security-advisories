summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rxrpc: Fix call
  timer start racing with call destruction  The rxrpc_call struct has a timer used to handle
  various timed events relating to a call.  This timer can get started from the packet input
  routines that are run in softirq mode with just the RCU read lock held. Unfortunately, because
  only the RCU read lock is held - and neither ref or other lock is taken - the call can start
  getting destroyed at the same time a packet comes in addressed to that call.  This causes
  the timer - which was already stopped - to get restarted.  Later, the timer dispatch code
  may then oops if the timer got deallocated first.  Fix this by trying to take a ref on the
  rxrpc_call struct and, if successful, passing that ref along to the timer.  If the timer was
  already running, the ref is discarded.  The timer completion routine can then pass the ref
  along to the call''s work item when it queues it.  If the timer or work item where already
  queued/running, the extra ref is discarded.'
