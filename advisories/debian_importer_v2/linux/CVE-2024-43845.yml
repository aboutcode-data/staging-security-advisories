summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  udf: Fix bogus
  checksum computation in udf_rename()  Syzbot reports uninitialized memory access in udf_rename()
  when updating checksum of ''..'' directory entry of a moved directory. This is indeed true
  as we pass on-stack diriter.fi to the udf_update_tag() and because that has only struct fileIdentDesc
  included in it and not the impUse or name fields, the checksumming function is going to checksum
  random stack contents beyond the end of the structure. This is actually harmless because the
  following udf_fiiter_write_fi() will recompute the checksum from on-disk buffers where everything
  is properly included. So all that is needed is just removing the bogus calculation.'
