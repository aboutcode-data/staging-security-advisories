summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powercap: arm_scmi:
  Remove recursion while parsing zones  Powercap zones can be defined as arranged in a hierarchy
  of trees and when registering a zone with powercap_register_zone(), the kernel powercap subsystem
  expects this to happen starting from the root zones down to the leaves; on the other side,
  de-registration by powercap_deregister_zone() must begin from the leaf zones.  Available SCMI
  powercap zones are retrieved dynamically from the platform at probe time and, while any defined
  hierarchy between the zones is described properly in the zones descriptor, the platform returns
  the availables zones with no particular well-defined order: as a consequence, the trees possibly
  composing the hierarchy of zones have to be somehow walked properly to register the retrieved
  zones from the root.  Currently the ARM SCMI Powercap driver walks the zones using a recursive
  algorithm; this approach, even though correct and tested can lead to kernel stack overflow
  when processing a returned hierarchy of zones composed by particularly high trees.  Avoid
  possible kernel stack overflow by substituting the recursive approach with an iterative one
  supported by a dynamically allocated stack-like data structure.'
