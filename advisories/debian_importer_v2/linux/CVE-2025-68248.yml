summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vmw_balloon:
  indicate success when effectively deflating during migration  When migrating a balloon page,
  we first deflate the old page to then inflate the new page.  However, if inflating the new
  page succeeded, we effectively deflated the old page, reducing the balloon size.  In that
  case, the migration actually worked: similar to migrating+ immediately deflating the new page.  The
  old page will be freed back to the buddy.  Right now, the core will leave the page be marked
  as isolated (as we returned an error).  When later trying to putback that page, we will run
  into the WARN_ON_ONCE() in balloon_page_putback().  That handling was changed in commit 3544c4faccb8
  ("mm/balloon_compaction: stop using __ClearPageMovable()"); before that change, we would have
  tolerated that way of handling it.  To fix it, let''s just return 0 in that case, making the
  core effectively just clear the "isolated" flag + freeing it back to the buddy as if the migration
  succeeded.  Note that the new page will also get freed when the core puts the last reference.  Note
  that this also makes it all be more consistent: we will no longer unisolate the page in the
  balloon driver while keeping it marked as being isolated in migration core.  This was found
  by code inspection.'
