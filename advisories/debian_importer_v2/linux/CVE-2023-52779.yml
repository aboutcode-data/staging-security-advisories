summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fs: Pass AT_GETATTR_NOSEC
  flag to getattr interface function  When vfs_getattr_nosec() calls a filesystem''s getattr
  interface function then the ''nosec'' should propagate into this function so that vfs_getattr_nosec()
  can again be called from the filesystem''s gettattr rather than vfs_getattr(). The latter
  would add unnecessary security checks that the initial vfs_getattr_nosec() call wanted to
  avoid. Therefore, introduce the getattr flag GETATTR_NOSEC and allow to pass with the new
  getattr_flags parameter to the getattr interface function. In overlayfs and ecryptfs use this
  flag to determine which one of the two functions to call.  In a recent code change introduced
  to IMA vfs_getattr_nosec() ended up calling vfs_getattr() in overlayfs, which in turn called
  security_inode_getattr() on an exiting process that did not have current->fs set anymore,
  which then caused a kernel NULL pointer dereference. With this change the call to security_inode_getattr()
  can be avoided, thus avoiding the NULL pointer dereference.'
