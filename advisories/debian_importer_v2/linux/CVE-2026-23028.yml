summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  LoongArch: KVM:
  Fix kvm_device leak in kvm_ipi_destroy()  In kvm_ioctl_create_device(), kvm_device has allocated
  memory, kvm_device->destroy() seems to be supposed to free its kvm_device struct, but kvm_ipi_destroy()
  is not currently doing this, that would lead to a memory leak.  So, fix it.'
