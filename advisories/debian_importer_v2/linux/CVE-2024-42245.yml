summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Revert "sched/fair:
  Make sure to try to detach at least one movable task"  This reverts commit b0defa7ae03ecf91b8bfd10ede430cff12fcbd06.  b0defa7ae03ec
  changed the load balancing logic to ignore env.max_loop if all tasks examined to that point
  were pinned. The goal of the patch was to make it more likely to be able to detach a task
  buried in a long list of pinned tasks. However, this has the unfortunate side effect of creating
  an O(n) iteration in detach_tasks(), as we now must fully iterate every task on a cpu if all
  or most are pinned. Since this load balance code is done with rq lock held, and often in softirq
  context, it is very easy to trigger hard lockups. We observed such hard lockups with a user
  who affined O(10k) threads to a single cpu.  When I discussed this with Vincent he initially
  suggested that we keep the limit on the number of tasks to detach, but increase the number
  of tasks we can search. However, after some back and forth on the mailing list, he recommended
  we instead revert the original patch, as it seems likely no one was actually getting hit by
  the original issue.'
