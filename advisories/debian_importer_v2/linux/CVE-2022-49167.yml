summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: do not
  double complete bio on errors during compressed reads  I hit some weird panics while fixing
  up the error handling from btrfs_lookup_bio_sums().  Turns out the compression path will complete
  the bio we use if we set up any of the compression bios and then return an error, and then
  btrfs_submit_data_bio() will also call bio_endio() on the bio.  Fix this by making btrfs_submit_compressed_read()
  responsible for calling bio_endio() on the bio if there are any errors.  Currently it was
  only doing it if we created the compression bios, otherwise it was depending on btrfs_submit_data_bio()
  to do the right thing.  This creates the above problem, so fix up btrfs_submit_compressed_read()
  to always call bio_endio() in case of an error, and then simply return from btrfs_submit_data_bio()
  if we had to call btrfs_submit_compressed_read().'
