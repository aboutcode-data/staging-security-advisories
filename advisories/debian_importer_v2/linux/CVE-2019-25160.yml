  - CVE-2019-25160
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netlabel: fix
  out-of-bounds memory accesses  There are two array out-of-bounds memory accesses, one in cipso_v4_map_lvl_valid(),
  the other in netlbl_bitmap_walk().  Both errors are embarassingly simple, and the fixes are
  straightforward.  As a FYI for anyone backporting this patch to kernels prior to v4.8, you''ll
  want to apply the netlbl_bitmap_walk() patch to cipso_v4_bitmap_walk() as netlbl_bitmap_walk()
  doesn''t exist before Linux v4.8.'
