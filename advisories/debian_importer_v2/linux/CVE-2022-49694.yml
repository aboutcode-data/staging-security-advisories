summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  block: disable
  the elevator int del_gendisk  The elevator is only used for file system requests, which are
  stopped in del_gendisk.  Move disabling the elevator and freeing the scheduler tags to the
  end of del_gendisk instead of doing that work in disk_release and blk_cleanup_queue to avoid
  a use after free on q->tag_set from disk_release as the tag_set might not be alive at that
  point.  Move the blk_qos_exit call as well, as it just depends on the elevator exit and would
  be the only reason to keep the not exactly cheap queue freeze in disk_release.'
