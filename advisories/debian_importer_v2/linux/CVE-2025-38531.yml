summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iio: common:
  st_sensors: Fix use of uninitialize device structs  Throughout the various probe functions
  &indio_dev->dev is used before it is initialized. This caused a kernel panic in st_sensors_power_enable()
  when the call to devm_regulator_bulk_get_enable() fails and then calls dev_err_probe() with
  the uninitialized device.  This seems to only cause a panic with dev_err_probe(), dev_err(),
  dev_warn() and dev_info() don''t seem to cause a panic, but are fixed as well.  The issue
  is reported and traced here: [1]'
