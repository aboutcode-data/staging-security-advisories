summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sctp: check send
  stream number after wait_for_sndbuf  This patch fixes a corner case where the asoc out stream
  count may change after wait_for_sndbuf.  When the main thread in the client starts a connection,
  if its out stream count is set to N while the in stream count in the server is set to N -
  2, another thread in the client keeps sending the msgs with stream number N - 1, and waits
  for sndbuf before processing INIT_ACK.  However, after processing INIT_ACK, the out stream
  count in the client is shrunk to N - 2, the same to the in stream count in the server. The
  crash occurs when the thread waiting for sndbuf is awake and sends the msg in a non-existing
  stream(N - 1), the call trace is as below:    KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000038-0x000000000000003f]   Call
