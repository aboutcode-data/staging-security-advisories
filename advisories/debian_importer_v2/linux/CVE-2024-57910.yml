summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iio: light: vcnl4035:
  fix information leak in triggered buffer  The ''buffer'' local array is used to push data
  to userspace from a triggered buffer, but it does not set an initial value for the single
  data element, which is an u16 aligned to 8 bytes. That leaves at least 4 bytes uninitialized
  even after writing an integer value with regmap_read().  Initialize the array to zero before
  using it to avoid pushing uninitialized information to userspace.'
