summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  comedi: Fix use
  of uninitialized memory in do_insn_ioctl() and do_insnlist_ioctl()  syzbot reports a KMSAN
  kernel-infoleak in `do_insn_ioctl()`.  A kernel buffer is allocated to hold `insn->n` samples
  (each of which is an `unsigned int`).  For some instruction types, `insn->n` samples are copied
  back to user-space, unless an error code is being returned.  The problem is that not all the
  instruction handlers that need to return data to userspace fill in the whole `insn->n` samples,
  so that there is an information leak.  There is a similar syzbot report for `do_insnlist_ioctl()`,
  although it does not have a reproducer for it at the time of writing.  One culprit is `insn_rw_emulate_bits()`
  which is used as the handler for `INSN_READ` or `INSN_WRITE` instructions for subdevices that
  do not have a specific handler for that instruction, but do have an `INSN_BITS` handler.  For
  `INSN_READ` it only fills in at most 1 sample, so if `insn->n` is greater than 1, the remaining
  `insn->n - 1` samples copied to userspace will be uninitialized kernel data.  Another culprit
  is `vm80xx_ai_insn_read()` in the "vm80xx" driver.  It never returns an error, even if it
  fails to fill the buffer.  Fix it in `do_insn_ioctl()` and `do_insnlist_ioctl()` by making
  sure that uninitialized parts of the allocated buffer are zeroed before handling each instruction.  Thanks
  to Arnaud Lecomte for their fix to `do_insn_ioctl()`.  That fix replaced the call to `kmalloc_array()`
  with `kcalloc()`, but it is not always necessary to clear the whole buffer.'
