summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  soc: qcom: pmic_glink:
  Fix race during initialization  As pointed out by Stephen Boyd it is possible that during
  initialization of the pmic_glink child drivers, the protection-domain notifiers fires, and
  the associated work is scheduled, before the client registration returns and as a result the
  local "client" pointer has been initialized.  The outcome of this is a NULL pointer dereference
  as the "client" pointer is blindly dereferenced.  Timeline provided by Stephen:  CPU0                               CPU1  ----                               ----  ucsi->client
  = NULL;  devm_pmic_glink_register_client()   client->pdr_notify(client->priv, pg->client_state)    pmic_glink_ucsi_pdr_notify()     schedule_work(&ucsi->register_work)     <schedule
  away>                                     pmic_glink_ucsi_register()                                      ucsi_register()                                       pmic_glink_ucsi_read_version()                                        pmic_glink_ucsi_read()                                         pmic_glink_ucsi_read()                                          pmic_glink_send(ucsi->client)                                          <client
  is NULL BAD>  ucsi->client = client // Too late!  This code is identical across the altmode,
  battery manager and usci child drivers.  Resolve this by splitting the allocation of the "client"
  object and the registration thereof into two operations.  This only happens if the protection
  domain registry is populated at the time of registration, which by the introduction of commit
  ''1ebcde047c54 ("soc: qcom: add pd-mapper implementation")'' became much more likely.'
