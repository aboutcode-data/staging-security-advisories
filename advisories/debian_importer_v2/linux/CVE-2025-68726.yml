summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: aead
  - Fix reqsize handling  Commit afddce13ce81d ("crypto: api - Add reqsize to crypto_alg") introduced
  cra_reqsize field in crypto_alg struct to replace type specific reqsize fields. It looks like
  this was introduced specifically for ahash and acomp from the commit description as subsequent
  commits add necessary changes in these alg frameworks.  However, this is being recommended
  for use in all crypto algs instead of setting reqsize using crypto_*_set_reqsize(). Using
  cra_reqsize in aead algorithms, hence, causes memory corruptions and crashes as the underlying
  functions in the algorithm framework have not been updated to set the reqsize properly from
  cra_reqsize. [1]  Add proper set_reqsize calls in the aead init function to properly initialize
  reqsize for these algorithms in the framework.  [1]: https://gist.github.com/Pratham-T/24247446f1faf4b7843e4014d5089f6b'
