summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xen/events: Return
  -EEXIST for bound VIRQs  Change find_virq() to return -EEXIST when a VIRQ is bound to a different
  CPU than the one passed in.  With that, remove the BUG_ON() from bind_virq_to_irq() to propogate
  the error upwards.  Some VIRQs are per-cpu, but others are per-domain or global.  Those must
  be bound to CPU0 and can then migrate elsewhere.  The lookup for per-domain and global will
  probably fail when migrated off CPU 0, especially when the current CPU is tracked.  This now
  returns -EEXIST instead of BUG_ON().  A second call to bind a per-domain or global VIRQ is
  not expected, but make it non-fatal to avoid trying to look up the irq, since we don''t know
  which per_cpu(virq_to_irq) it will be in.'
