summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: qla2xxx:
  Clear cmds after chip reset  Commit aefed3e5548f ("scsi: qla2xxx: target: Fix offline port
  handling and host reset handling") caused two problems:  1. Commands sent to FW, after chip
  reset got stuck and never freed as FW    is not going to respond to them anymore.  2. BUG_ON(cmd->sg_mapped)
  in qlt_free_cmd().  Commit 26f9ce53817a    ("scsi: qla2xxx: Fix missed DMA unmap for aborted
  commands")    attempted to fix this, but introduced another bug under different    circumstances
  when two different CPUs were racing to call    qlt_unmap_sg() at the same time: BUG_ON(!valid_dma_direction(dir))
  in    dma_unmap_sg_attrs().  So revert "scsi: qla2xxx: Fix missed DMA unmap for aborted commands"
  and partially revert "scsi: qla2xxx: target: Fix offline port handling and host reset handling"
  at __qla2x00_abort_all_cmds.'
