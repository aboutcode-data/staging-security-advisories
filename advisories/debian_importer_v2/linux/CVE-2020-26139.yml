  - CVE-2020-26139
summary: An issue was discovered in the kernel in NetBSD 7.1. An Access Point (AP) forwards
  EAPOL frames to other clients even though the sender has not yet successfully authenticated
  to the AP. This might be abused in projected Wi-Fi networks to launch denial-of-service attacks
  against connected clients and makes it easier to exploit other vulnerabilities in connected
  clients.
