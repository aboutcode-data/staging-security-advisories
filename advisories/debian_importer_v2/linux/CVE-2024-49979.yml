  - CVE-2024-49979
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: gso: fix
  tcp fraglist segmentation after pull from frag_list  Detect tcp gso fraglist skbs with corrupted
  geometry (see below) and pass these to skb_segment instead of skb_segment_list, as the first
  can segment them correctly.  Valid SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST skbs - consist of two or more segments
  - the head_skb holds the protocol headers plus first gso_size - one or more frag_list skbs
  hold exactly one segment - all but the last must be gso_size  Optional datapath hooks such
  as NAT and BPF (bpf_skb_pull_data) can modify these skbs, breaking these invariants.  In extreme
  cases they pull all data into skb linear. For TCP, this causes a NULL ptr deref in __tcpv4_gso_segment_list_csum
  at tcp_hdr(seg->next).  Detect invalid geometry due to pull, by checking head_skb size. Don''t
  just drop, as this may blackhole a destination. Convert to be able to pass to regular skb_segment.  Approach
  and description based on a patch by Willem de Bruijn.'
