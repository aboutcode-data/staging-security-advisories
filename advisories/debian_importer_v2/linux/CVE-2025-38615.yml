summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fs/ntfs3: cancle
  set bad inode after removing name fails  The reproducer uses a file0 on a ntfs3 file system
  with a corrupted i_link. When renaming, the file0''s inode is marked as a bad inode because
  the file name cannot be deleted.  The underlying bug is that make_bad_inode() is called on
  a live inode. In some cases it''s "icache lookup finds a normal inode, d_splice_alias() is
  called to attach it to dentry, while another thread decides to call make_bad_inode() on it
  - that would evict it from icache, but we''d already found it there earlier". In some it''s
  outright "we have an inode attached to dentry - that''s how we got it in the first place;
  let''s call make_bad_inode() on it just for shits and giggles".'
