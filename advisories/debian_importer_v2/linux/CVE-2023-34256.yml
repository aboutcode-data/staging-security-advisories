  - CVE-2023-34256
summary: 'An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.3.3. There is an out-of-bounds
  read in crc16 in lib/crc16.c when called from fs/ext4/super.c because ext4_group_desc_csum
  does not properly check an offset. NOTE: this is disputed by third parties because the kernel
  is not intended to defend against attackers with the stated "When modifying the block device
  while it is mounted by the filesystem" access.'
