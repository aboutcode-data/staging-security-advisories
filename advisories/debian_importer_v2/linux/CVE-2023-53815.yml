  - CVE-2023-53815
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  posix-timers:
  Prevent RT livelock in itimer_delete()  itimer_delete() has a retry loop when the timer is
  concurrently expired. On non-RT kernels this just spin-waits until the timer callback has
  completed, except for posix CPU timers which have HAVE_POSIX_CPU_TIMERS_TASK_WORK enabled.  In
  that case and on RT kernels the existing task could live lock when preempting the task which
  does the timer delivery.  Replace spin_unlock() with an invocation of timer_wait_running()
  to handle it the same way as the other retry loops in the posix timer code.'
