summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ax25: properly
  unshare skbs in ax25_kiss_rcv()  Bernard Pidoux reported a regression apparently caused by
  commit c353e8983e0d ("net: introduce per netns packet chains").  skb->dev becomes NULL and
  we crash in __netif_receive_skb_core().  Before above commit, different kind of bugs or corruptions
  could happen without a major crash.  But the root cause is that ax25_kiss_rcv() can queue/mangle
  input skb without checking if this skb is shared or not.  Many thanks to Bernard Pidoux for
  his help, diagnosis and tests.  We had a similar issue years ago fixed with commit 7aaed57c5c28
  ("phonet: properly unshare skbs in phonet_rcv()").'
