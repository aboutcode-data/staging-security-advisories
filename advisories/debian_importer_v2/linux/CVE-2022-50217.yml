summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fuse: write inode
  in fuse_release()  A race between write(2) and close(2) allows pages to be dirtied after fuse_flush
  -> write_inode_now().  If these pages are not flushed from fuse_release(), then there might
  not be a writable open file later.  So any remaining dirty pages must be written back before
  the file is released.  This is a partial revert of the blamed commit.'
