summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dm: limit swapping
  tables for devices with zone write plugs  dm_revalidate_zones() only allowed new or previously
  unzoned devices to call blk_revalidate_disk_zones(). If the device was already zoned, disk->nr_zones
  would always equal md->nr_zones, so dm_revalidate_zones() returned without doing any work.
  This would make the zoned settings for the device not match the new table. If the device had
  zone write plug resources, it could run into errors like bdev_zone_is_seq() reading invalid
  memory because disk->conv_zones_bitmap was the wrong size.  If the device doesn''t have any
  zone write plug resources, calling blk_revalidate_disk_zones() will always correctly update
  device.  If blk_revalidate_disk_zones() fails, it can still overwrite or clear the current
  disk->nr_zones value. In this case, DM must restore the previous value of disk->nr_zones,
  so that the zoned settings will continue to match the previous value that it fell back to.  If
  the device already has zone write plug resources, blk_revalidate_disk_zones() will not correctly
  update them, if it is called for arbitrary zoned device changes.  Since there is not much
  need for this ability, the easiest solution is to disallow any table reloads that change the
  zoned settings, for devices that already have zone plug resources.  Specifically, if a device
  already has zone plug resources allocated, it can only switch to another zoned table that
  also emulates zone append.  Also, it cannot change the device size or the zone size. A device
  can switch to an error target.'
