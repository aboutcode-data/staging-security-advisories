summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: MGMT:
  fix crash in set_mesh_sync and set_mesh_complete  There is a BUG: KASAN: stack-out-of-bounds
  in set_mesh_sync due to memcpy from badly declared on-stack flexible array.  Another crash
  is in set_mesh_complete() due to double list_del via mgmt_pending_valid + mgmt_pending_remove.  Use
  DEFINE_FLEX to declare the flexible array right, and don''t memcpy outside bounds.  As mgmt_pending_valid
  removes the cmd from list, use mgmt_pending_free, and also report status on error.'
