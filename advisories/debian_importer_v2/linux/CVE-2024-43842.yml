summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: rtw89:
  Fix array index mistake in rtw89_sta_info_get_iter()  In rtw89_sta_info_get_iter() ''status->he_gi''
  is compared to array size. But then ''rate->he_gi'' is used as array index instead of ''status->he_gi''.
  This can lead to go beyond array boundaries in case of ''rate->he_gi'' is not equal to ''status->he_gi''
  and is bigger than array size. Looks like "copy-paste" mistake.  Fix this mistake by replacing
  ''rate->he_gi'' with ''status->he_gi''.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org)
  with SVACE.'
