summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  genetlink: fix
  genl_bind() invoking bind() after -EPERM  Per family bind/unbind callbacks were introduced
  to allow families to track multicast group consumer presence, e.g. to start or stop producing
  events depending on listeners.  However, in genl_bind() the bind() callback was invoked even
  if capability checks failed and ret was set to -EPERM. This means that callbacks could run
  on behalf of unauthorized callers while the syscall still returned failure to user space.  Fix
  this by only invoking bind() after "if (ret) break;" check i.e. after permission checks have
  succeeded.'
