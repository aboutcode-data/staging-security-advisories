  - CVE-2025-68186
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ring-buffer:
  Do not warn in ring_buffer_map_get_reader() when reader catches up  The function ring_buffer_map_get_reader()
  is a bit more strict than the other get reader functions, and except for certain situations
  the rb_get_reader_page() should not return NULL. If it does, it triggers a warning.  This
  warning was triggering but after looking at why, it was because another acceptable situation
  was happening and it wasn''t checked for.  If the reader catches up to the writer and there''s
  still data to be read on the reader page, then the rb_get_reader_page() will return NULL as
  there''s no new page to get.  In this situation, the reader page should not be updated and
  no warning should trigger.'
