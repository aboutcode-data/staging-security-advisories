summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  spi: tegra210-quad:
  Protect curr_xfer check in IRQ handler  Now that all other accesses to curr_xfer are done
  under the lock, protect the curr_xfer NULL check in tegra_qspi_isr_thread() with the spinlock.
  Without this protection, the following race can occur:    CPU0 (ISR thread)              CPU1
  (timeout path)   ----------------               -------------------   if (!tqspi->curr_xfer)     //
  sees non-NULL                                  spin_lock()                                  tqspi->curr_xfer
  = NULL                                  spin_unlock()   handle_*_xfer()     spin_lock()     t
  = tqspi->curr_xfer  // NULL!     ... t->len ...        // NULL dereference!  With this patch,
  all curr_xfer accesses are now properly synchronized.  Although all accesses to curr_xfer
  are done under the lock, in tegra_qspi_isr_thread() it checks for NULL, releases the lock
  and reacquires it later in handle_cpu_based_xfer()/handle_dma_based_xfer(). There is a potential
  for an update in between, which could cause a NULL pointer dereference.  To handle this, add
  a NULL check inside the handlers after acquiring the lock. This ensures that if the timeout
  path has already cleared curr_xfer, the handler will safely return without dereferencing the
  NULL pointer.'
