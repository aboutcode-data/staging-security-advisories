summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rxrpc: Fix a
  race between socket set up and I/O thread creation  In rxrpc_open_socket(), it sets up the
  socket and then sets up the I/O thread that will handle it.  This is a problem, however, as
  there''s a gap between the two phases in which a packet may come into rxrpc_encap_rcv() from
  the UDP packet but we oops when trying to wake the not-yet created I/O thread.  As a quick
  fix, just make rxrpc_encap_rcv() discard the packet if there''s no I/O thread yet.  A better,
  but more intrusive fix would perhaps be to rearrange things such that the socket creation
  is done by the I/O thread.'
