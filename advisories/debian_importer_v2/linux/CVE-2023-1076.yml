  - CVE-2023-1076
summary: A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel. The tun/tap sockets have their socket UID hardcoded
  to 0 due to a type confusion in their initialization function. While it will be often correct,
  as tuntap devices require CAP_NET_ADMIN, it may not always be the case, e.g., a non-root user
  only having that capability. This would make tun/tap sockets being incorrectly treated in
  filtering/routing decisions, possibly bypassing network filters.
