summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netpoll: Fix\
  \ race condition in netpoll_owner_active  KCSAN detected a race condition in netpoll:  \t\
  BUG: KCSAN: data-race in net_rx_action / netpoll_send_skb \twrite (marked) to 0xffff8881164168b0\
  \ of 4 bytes by interrupt on cpu 10: \tnet_rx_action (./include/linux/netpoll.h:90 net/core/dev.c:6712\
  \ net/core/dev.c:6822) <snip> \tread to 0xffff8881164168b0 of 4 bytes by task 1 on cpu 2:\
  \ \tnetpoll_send_skb (net/core/netpoll.c:319 net/core/netpoll.c:345 net/core/netpoll.c:393)\
  \ \tnetpoll_send_udp (net/core/netpoll.c:?) <snip> \tvalue changed: 0x0000000a -> 0xffffffff\
  \  This happens because netpoll_owner_active() needs to check if the current CPU is the owner\
  \ of the lock, touching napi->poll_owner non atomically. The ->poll_owner field contains the\
  \ current CPU holding the lock.  Use an atomic read to check if the poll owner is the current\
  \ CPU."
