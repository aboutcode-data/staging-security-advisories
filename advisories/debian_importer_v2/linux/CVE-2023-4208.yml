summary: 'A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel''s net/sched: cls_u32 component
  can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.  When u32_change() is called on an
  existing filter, the whole tcf_result struct is always copied into the new instance of the
  filter. This causes a problem when updating a filter bound to a class, as tcf_unbind_filter()
  is always called on the old instance in the success path, decreasing filter_cnt of the still
  referenced class and allowing it to be deleted, leading to a use-after-free.  We recommend
  upgrading past commit 3044b16e7c6fe5d24b1cdbcf1bd0a9d92d1ebd81.'
