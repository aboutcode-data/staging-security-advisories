  - CVE-2018-18955
summary: In the Linux kernel 4.15.x through 4.19.x before 4.19.2, map_write() in kernel/user_namespace.c
  allows privilege escalation because it mishandles nested user namespaces with more than 5
  UID or GID ranges. A user who has CAP_SYS_ADMIN in an affected user namespace can bypass access
  controls on resources outside the namespace, as demonstrated by reading /etc/shadow. This
  occurs because an ID transformation takes place properly for the namespaced-to-kernel direction
  but not for the kernel-to-namespaced direction.
