  - CVE-2023-5345
summary: A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's fs/smb/client component can be
  exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.  In case of an error in smb3_fs_context_parse_param,
  ctx->password was freed but the field was not set to NULL which could lead to double free.  We
  recommend upgrading past commit e6e43b8aa7cd3c3af686caf0c2e11819a886d705.
