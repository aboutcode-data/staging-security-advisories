summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: gadget:
  u_serial: Add null pointer check in gserial_suspend  Consider a case where gserial_disconnect
  has already cleared gser->ioport. And if gserial_suspend gets called afterwards, it will lead
  to accessing of gser->ioport and thus causing null pointer dereference.  Avoid this by adding
  a null pointer check. Added a static spinlock to prevent gser->ioport from becoming null after
  the newly added null pointer check.'
