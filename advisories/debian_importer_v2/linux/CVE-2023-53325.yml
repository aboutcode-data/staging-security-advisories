  - CVE-2023-53325
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/mediatek:
  dp: Change logging to dev for mtk_dp_aux_transfer()  Change logging from drm_{err,info}()
  to dev_{err,info}() in functions mtk_dp_aux_transfer() and mtk_dp_aux_do_transfer(): this
  will be essential to avoid getting NULL pointer kernel panics if any kind of error happens
  during AUX transfers happening before the bridge is attached.  This may potentially start
  happening in a later commit implementing aux-bus support, as AUX transfers will be triggered
  from the panel driver (for EDID) before the mtk-dp bridge gets attached, and it''s done in
  preparation for the same.'
