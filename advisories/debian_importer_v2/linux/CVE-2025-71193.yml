summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  phy: qcom-qusb2:
  Fix NULL pointer dereference on early suspend  Enabling runtime PM before attaching the QPHY
  instance as driver data can lead to a NULL pointer dereference in runtime PM callbacks that
  expect valid driver data. There is a small window where the suspend callback may run after
  PM runtime enabling and before runtime forbid. This causes a sporadic crash during boot:  ```
  Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000000000a1 [...]
  CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 11 Comm: kworker/0:1 Not tainted 6.16.7+ #116 PREEMPT Workqueue: pm pm_runtime_work
  pstate: 20000005 (nzCv daif -PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--) pc : qusb2_phy_runtime_suspend+0x14/0x1e0
  [phy_qcom_qusb2] lr : pm_generic_runtime_suspend+0x2c/0x44 [...] ```  Attach the QPHY instance
  as driver data before enabling runtime PM to prevent NULL pointer dereference in runtime PM
  callbacks.  Reorder pm_runtime_enable() and pm_runtime_forbid() to prevent a short window
  where an unnecessary runtime suspend can occur.  Use the devres-managed version to ensure
  PM runtime is symmetrically disabled during driver removal for proper cleanup.'
