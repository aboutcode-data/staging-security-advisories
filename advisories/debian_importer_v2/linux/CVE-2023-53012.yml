  - CVE-2023-53012
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  thermal: core:
  call put_device() only after device_register() fails  put_device() shouldn''t be called before
  a prior call to device_register(). __thermal_cooling_device_register() doesn''t follow that
  properly and needs fixing. Also thermal_cooling_device_destroy_sysfs() is getting called unnecessarily
  on few error paths.  Fix all this by placing the calls at the right place.  Based on initial
  work done by Caleb Connolly.'
