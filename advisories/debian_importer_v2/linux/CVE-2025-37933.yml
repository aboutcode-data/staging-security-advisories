summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  octeon_ep: Fix
  host hang issue during device reboot  When the host loses heartbeat messages from the device,
  the driver calls the device-specific ndo_stop function, which frees the resources. If the
  driver is unloaded in this scenario, it calls ndo_stop again, attempting to free resources
  that have already been freed, leading to a host hang issue. To resolve this, dev_close should
  be called instead of the device-specific stop function.dev_close internally calls ndo_stop
  to stop the network interface and performs additional cleanup tasks. During the driver unload
  process, if the device is already down, ndo_stop is not called.'
