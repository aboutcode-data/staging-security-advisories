summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  binfmt_elf_fdpic:
  fix AUXV size calculation when ELF_HWCAP2 is defined  create_elf_fdpic_tables() does not correctly
  account the space for the AUX vector when an architecture has ELF_HWCAP2 defined. Prior to
  the commit 10e29251be0e ("binfmt_elf_fdpic: fix /proc/<pid>/auxv") it resulted in the last
  entry of the AUX vector being set to zero, but with that change it results in a kernel BUG.  Fix
  that by adding one to the number of AUXV entries (nitems) when ELF_HWCAP2 is defined.'
