summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/i915: Fix
  NULL ptr deref by checking new_crtc_state  intel_atomic_get_new_crtc_state can return NULL,
  unless crtc state wasn''t obtained previously with intel_atomic_get_crtc_state, so we must
  check it for NULLness here, just as in many other places, where we can''t guarantee that intel_atomic_get_crtc_state
  was called. We are currently getting NULL ptr deref because of that, so this fix was confirmed
  to help.  (cherry picked from commit 1d5b09f8daf859247a1ea65b0d732a24d88980d8)'
