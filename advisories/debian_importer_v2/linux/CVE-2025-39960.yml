summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gpiolib: acpi:
  initialize acpi_gpio_info struct  Since commit 7c010d463372 ("gpiolib: acpi: Make sure we
  fill struct acpi_gpio_info"), uninitialized acpi_gpio_info struct are passed to __acpi_find_gpio()
  and later in the call stack info->quirks is used in acpi_populate_gpio_lookup. This breaks
  the i2c_hid_cpi driver:  [   58.122916] i2c_hid_acpi i2c-UNIW0001:00: HID over i2c has not
  been provided an Int IRQ [   58.123097] i2c_hid_acpi i2c-UNIW0001:00: probe with driver i2c_hid_acpi
  failed with error -22  Fix this by initializing the acpi_gpio_info pass to __acpi_find_gpio()'
