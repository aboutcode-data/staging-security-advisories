summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/irdma: Fix
  memory leak of PBLE objects  On rmmod of irdma, the PBLE object memory is not being freed.
  PBLE object memory are not statically pre-allocated at function initialization time unlike
  other HMC objects. PBLEs objects and the Segment Descriptors (SD) for it can be dynamically
  allocated during scale up and SD''s remain allocated till function deinitialization.  Fix
  this leak by adding IRDMA_HMC_IW_PBLE to the iw_hmc_obj_types[] table and skip pbles in irdma_create_hmc_obj
  but not in irdma_del_hmc_objects().'
