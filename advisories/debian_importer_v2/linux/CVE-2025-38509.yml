summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: mac80211:
  reject VHT opmode for unsupported channel widths  VHT operating mode notifications are not
  defined for channel widths below 20 MHz. In particular, 5 MHz and 10 MHz are not valid under
  the VHT specification and must be rejected.  Without this check, malformed notifications using
  these widths may reach ieee80211_chan_width_to_rx_bw(), leading to a WARN_ON due to invalid
  input. This issue was reported by syzbot.  Reject these unsupported widths early in sta_link_apply_parameters()
  when opmode_notif is used. The accepted set includes 20, 40, 80, 160, and 80+80 MHz, which
  are valid for VHT. While 320 MHz is not defined for VHT, it is allowed to avoid rejecting
  HE or EHT clients that may still send a VHT opmode notification.'
