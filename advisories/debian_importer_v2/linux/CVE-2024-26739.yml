summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/sched: act_mirred:
  don''t override retval if we already lost the skb  If we''re redirecting the skb, and haven''t
  called tcf_mirred_forward(), yet, we need to tell the core to drop the skb by setting the
  retcode to SHOT. If we have called tcf_mirred_forward(), however, the skb is out of our hands
  and returning SHOT will lead to UaF.  Move the retval override to the error path which actually
  need it.'
