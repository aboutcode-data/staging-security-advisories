summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  idpf: cleanup
  remaining SKBs in PTP flows  When the driver requests Tx timestamp value, one of the first
  steps is to clone SKB using skb_get. It increases the reference counter for that SKB to prevent
  unexpected freeing by another component. However, there may be a case where the index is requested,
  SKB is assigned and never consumed by PTP flows - for example due to reset during running
  PTP apps.  Add a check in release timestamping function to verify if the SKB assigned to Tx
  timestamp latch was freed, and release remaining SKBs.'
