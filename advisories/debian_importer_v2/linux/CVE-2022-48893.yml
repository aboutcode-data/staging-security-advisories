summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/i915/gt:
  Cleanup partial engine discovery failures  If we abort driver initialisation in the middle
  of gt/engine discovery, some engines will be fully setup and some not. Those incompletely
  setup engines only have ''engine->release == NULL'' and so will leak any of the common objects
  allocated.  v2:  - Drop the destroy_pinned_context() helper for now.  It''s not really    worth
  it with just a single callsite at the moment.  (Janusz)'
