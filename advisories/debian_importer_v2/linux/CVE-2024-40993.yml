summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: ipset:
  Fix suspicious rcu_dereference_protected()  When destroying all sets, we are either in pernet
  exit phase or are executing a "destroy all sets command" from userspace. The latter was taken
  into account in ip_set_dereference() (nfnetlink mutex is held), but the former was not. The
  patch adds the required check to rcu_dereference_protected() in ip_set_dereference().'
