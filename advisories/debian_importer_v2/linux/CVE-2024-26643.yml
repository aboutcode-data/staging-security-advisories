summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: nf_tables:
  mark set as dead when unbinding anonymous set with timeout  While the rhashtable set gc runs
  asynchronously, a race allows it to collect elements from anonymous sets with timeouts while
  it is being released from the commit path.  Mingi Cho originally reported this issue in a
  different path in 6.1.x with a pipapo set with low timeouts which is not possible upstream
  since 7395dfacfff6 ("netfilter: nf_tables: use timestamp to check for set element timeout").  Fix
  this by setting on the dead flag for anonymous sets to skip async gc in this case.  According
  to 08e4c8c5919f ("netfilter: nf_tables: mark newset as dead on transaction abort"), Florian
  plans to accelerate abort path by releasing objects via workqueue, therefore, this sets on
  the dead flag for abort path too.'
