summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cachefiles: add
  consistency check for copen/cread  This prevents malicious processes from completing random
  copen/cread requests and crashing the system. Added checks are listed below:    * Generic,
  copen can only complete open requests, and cread can only     complete read requests.   *
  For copen, ondemand_id must not be 0, because this indicates that the     request has not
  been read by the daemon.   * For cread, the object corresponding to fd and req should be the
  same.'
