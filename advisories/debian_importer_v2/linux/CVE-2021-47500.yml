summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iio: mma8452:
  Fix trigger reference couting  The mma8452 driver directly assigns a trigger to the struct
  iio_dev. The IIO core when done using this trigger will call `iio_trigger_put()` to drop the
  reference count by 1.  Without the matching `iio_trigger_get()` in the driver the reference
  count can reach 0 too early, the trigger gets freed while still in use and a use-after-free
  occurs.  Fix this by getting a reference to the trigger before assigning it to the IIO device.'
