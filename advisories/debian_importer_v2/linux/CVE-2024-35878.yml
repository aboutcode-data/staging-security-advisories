summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  of: module: prevent
  NULL pointer dereference in vsnprintf()  In of_modalias(), we can get passed the str and len
  parameters which would cause a kernel oops in vsnprintf() since it only allows passing a NULL
  ptr when the length is also 0. Also, we need to filter out the negative values of the len
  parameter as these will result in a really huge buffer since snprintf() takes size_t parameter
  while ours is ssize_t...  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with the Svace
  static analysis tool.'
