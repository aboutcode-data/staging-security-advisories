summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PCI: Fix active
  state requirement in PME polling  The commit noted in fixes added a bogus requirement that
  runtime PM managed devices need to be in the RPM_ACTIVE state for PME polling.  In fact, only
  devices in low power states should be polled.  However there''s still a requirement that the
  device config space must be accessible, which has implications for both the current state
  of the polled device and the parent bridge, when present.  It''s not sufficient to assume
  the bridge remains in D0 and cases have been observed where the bridge passes the D0 test,
  but the PM state indicates RPM_SUSPENDING and config space of the polled device becomes inaccessible
  during pci_pme_wakeup().  Therefore, since the bridge is already effectively required to be
  in the RPM_ACTIVE state, formalize this in the code and elevate the PM usage count to maintain
  the state while polling the subordinate device.  This resolves a regression reported in the
  bugzilla below where a Thunderbolt/USB4 hierarchy fails to scan for an attached NVMe endpoint
  downstream of a bridge in a D3hot power state.'
