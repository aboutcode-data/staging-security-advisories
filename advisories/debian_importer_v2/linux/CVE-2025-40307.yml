summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  exfat: validate
  cluster allocation bits of the allocation bitmap  syzbot created an exfat image with cluster
  bits not set for the allocation bitmap. exfat-fs reads and uses the allocation bitmap without
  checking this. The problem is that if the start cluster of the allocation bitmap is 6, cluster
  6 can be allocated when creating a directory with mkdir. exfat zeros out this cluster in exfat_mkdir,
  which can delete existing entries. This can reallocate the allocated entries. In addition,
  the allocation bitmap is also zeroed out, so cluster 6 can be reallocated. This patch adds
  exfat_test_bitmap_range to validate that clusters used for the allocation bitmap are correctly
  marked as in-use.'
