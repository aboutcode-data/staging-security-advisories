aliases:
  - CVE-2021-34866
summary: This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations
  of Linux Kernel 5.14-rc3. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged
  code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists
  within the handling of eBPF programs. The issue results from the lack of proper validation
  of user-supplied eBPF programs, which can result in a type confusion condition. An attacker
  can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context
  of the kernel. Was ZDI-CAN-14689.
