summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: mac80211:
  fix use-after-free in chanctx code  In ieee80211_vif_use_reserved_context(), when we have
  an old context and the new context''s replace_state is set to IEEE80211_CHANCTX_REPLACE_NONE,
  we free the old context in ieee80211_vif_use_reserved_reassign(). Therefore, we cannot check
  the old_ctx anymore, so we should set it to NULL after this point.  However, since the new_ctx
  replace state is clearly not IEEE80211_CHANCTX_REPLACES_OTHER, we''re not going to do anything
  else in this function and can just return to avoid accessing the freed old_ctx.'
