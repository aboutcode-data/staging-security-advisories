summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: wd33c93:
  Don''t use stale scsi_pointer value  A regression was introduced with commit dbb2da557a6a
  ("scsi: wd33c93: Move the SCSI pointer to private command data") which results in an oops
  in wd33c93_intr(). That commit added the scsi_pointer variable and initialized it from hostdata->connected.
  However, during selection, hostdata->connected is not yet valid. Fix this by getting the current
  scsi_pointer from hostdata->selecting.'
