summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  virtio: break\
  \ and reset virtio devices on device_shutdown()  Hongyu reported a hang on kexec in a VM.\
  \ QEMU reported invalid memory accesses during the hang.  \tInvalid read at addr 0x102877002,\
  \ size 2, region '(null)', reason: rejected \tInvalid write at addr 0x102877A44, size 2, region\
  \ '(null)', reason: rejected \t...  It was traced down to virtio-console. Kexec works fine\
  \ if virtio-console is not in use.  The issue is that virtio-console continues to write to\
  \ the MMIO even after underlying virtio-pci device is reset.  Additionally, Eric noticed that\
  \ IOMMUs are reset before devices, if devices are not reset on shutdown they continue to poke\
  \ at guest memory and get errors from the IOMMU. Some devices get wedged then.  The problem\
  \ can be solved by breaking all virtio devices on virtio bus shutdown, then resetting them."
