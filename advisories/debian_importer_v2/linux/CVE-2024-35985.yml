summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sched/eevdf:
  Prevent vlag from going out of bounds in reweight_eevdf()  It was possible to have pick_eevdf()
  return NULL, which then causes a NULL-deref. This turned out to be due to entity_eligible()
  returning falsely negative because of a s64 multiplcation overflow.  Specifically, reweight_eevdf()
  computes the vlag without considering the limit placed upon vlag as update_entity_lag() does,
  and then the scaling multiplication (remember that weight is 20bit fixed point) can overflow.
  This then leads to the new vruntime being weird which then causes the above entity_eligible()
  to go side-ways and claim nothing is eligible.  Thus limit the range of vlag accordingly.  All
  this was quite rare, but fatal when it does happen.'
