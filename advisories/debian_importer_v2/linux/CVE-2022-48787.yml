summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iwlwifi: fix
  use-after-free  If no firmware was present at all (or, presumably, all of the firmware files
  failed to parse), we end up unbinding by calling device_release_driver(), which calls remove(),
  which then in iwlwifi calls iwl_drv_stop(), freeing the ''drv'' struct. However the new code
  I added will still erroneously access it after it was freed.  Set ''failure=false'' in this
  case to avoid the access, all data was already freed anyway.'
