summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommu/vt-d: Remove
  WO permissions on second-level paging entries  When the first level page table is used for
  IOVA translation, it only supports Read-Only and Read-Write permissions. The Write-Only permission
  is not supported as the PRESENT bit (implying Read permission) should always set. When using
  second level, we still give separate permissions that allows WriteOnly which seems inconsistent
  and awkward. We want to have consistent behavior. After moving to 1st level, we don''t want
  things to work sometimes, and break if we use 2nd level for the same mappings. Hence remove
  this configuration.'
