  - CVE-2023-52530
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: mac80211:
  fix potential key use-after-free  When ieee80211_key_link() is called by ieee80211_gtk_rekey_add()
  but returns 0 due to KRACK protection (identical key reinstall), ieee80211_gtk_rekey_add()
  will still return a pointer into the key, in a potential use-after-free. This normally doesn''t
  happen since it''s only called by iwlwifi in case of WoWLAN rekey offload which has its own
  KRACK protection, but still better to fix, do that by returning an error code and converting
  that to success on the cfg80211 boundary only, leaving the error for bad callers of ieee80211_gtk_rekey_add().'
