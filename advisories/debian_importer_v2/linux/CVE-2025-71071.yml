  - CVE-2025-71071
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommu/mediatek:
  fix use-after-free on probe deferral  The driver is dropping the references taken to the larb
  devices during probe after successful lookup as well as on errors. This can potentially lead
  to a use-after-free in case a larb device has not yet been bound to its driver so that the
  iommu driver probe defers.  Fix this by keeping the references as expected while the iommu
  driver is bound.'
