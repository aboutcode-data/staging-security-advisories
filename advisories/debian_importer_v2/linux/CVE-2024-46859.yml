  - CVE-2024-46859
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  platform/x86:
  panasonic-laptop: Fix SINF array out of bounds accesses  The panasonic laptop code in various
  places uses the SINF array with index values of 0 - SINF_CUR_BRIGHT(0x0d) without checking
  that the SINF array is big enough.  Not all panasonic laptops have this many SINF array entries,
  for example the Toughbook CF-18 model only has 10 SINF array entries. So it only supports
  the AC+DC brightness entries and mute.  Check that the SINF array has a minimum size which
  covers all AC+DC brightness entries and refuse to load if the SINF array is smaller.  For
  higher SINF indexes hide the sysfs attributes when the SINF array does not contain an entry
  for that attribute, avoiding show()/store() accessing the array out of bounds and add bounds
  checking to the probe() and resume() code accessing these.'
