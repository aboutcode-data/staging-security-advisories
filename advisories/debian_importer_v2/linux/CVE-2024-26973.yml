summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fat: fix uninitialized
  field in nostale filehandles  When fat_encode_fh_nostale() encodes file handle without a parent
  it stores only first 10 bytes of the file handle. However the length of the file handle must
  be a multiple of 4 so the file handle is actually 12 bytes long and the last two bytes remain
  uninitialized. This is not great at we potentially leak uninitialized information with the
  handle to userspace. Properly initialize the full handle length.'
