summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Revert "drm/msm:
  Add missing check and destroy for alloc_ordered_workqueue"  This reverts commit 643b7d0869cc7f1f7a5ac7ca6bd25d88f54e31d0.  A
  recent patch that tried to fix up the msm_drm_init() paths with respect to the workqueue but
  only ended up making things worse:  First, the newly added calls to msm_drm_uninit() on early
  errors would trigger NULL-pointer dereferences, for example, as the kms pointer would not
  have been initialised. (Note that these paths were also modified by a second broken error
  handling patch which in effect cancelled out this part when merged.)  Second, the newly added
  allocation sanity check would still leak the previously allocated drm device.  Instead of
  trying to salvage what was badly broken (and clearly not tested), let''s revert the bad commit
  so that clean and backportable fixes can be added in its place.  Patchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/525107/'
