summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  audit: fix out-of-bounds
  read in audit_compare_dname_path()  When a watch on dir=/ is combined with an fsnotify event
  for a single-character name directly under / (e.g., creating /a), an out-of-bounds read can
  occur in audit_compare_dname_path().  The helper parent_len() returns 1 for "/". In audit_compare_dname_path(),
  when parentlen equals the full path length (1), the code sets p = path + 1 and pathlen = 1
  - 1 = 0. The subsequent loop then dereferences p[pathlen - 1] (i.e., p[-1]), causing an out-of-bounds
  read.  Fix this by adding a pathlen > 0 check to the while loop condition to prevent the out-of-bounds
  access.  [PM: subject tweak, sign-off email fixes]'
