summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/xe/migrate:
  prevent potential UAF  If we hit the error path, the previous fence (if there is one) has
  already been put() prior to this, so doing a fence_wait could lead to UAF. Tweak the flow
  to do to the put() until after we do the wait.  (cherry picked from commit 9b7ca35ed28fe5fad86e9d9c24ebd1271e4c9c3e)'
