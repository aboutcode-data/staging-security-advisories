summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath12k:
  change DMA direction while mapping reinjected packets  For fragmented packets, ath12k reassembles
  each fragment as a normal packet and then reinjects it into HW ring. In this case, the DMA
  direction should be DMA_TO_DEVICE, not DMA_FROM_DEVICE. Otherwise, an invalid payload may
  be reinjected into the HW and subsequently delivered to the host.  Given that arbitrary memory
  can be allocated to the skb buffer, knowledge about the data contained in the reinjected buffer
  is lacking. Consequently, there’s a risk of private information being leaked.  Tested-on:
  QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.1.1-00209-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1'
