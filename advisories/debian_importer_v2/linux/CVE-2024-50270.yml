summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/damon/core:
  avoid overflow in damon_feed_loop_next_input()  damon_feed_loop_next_input() is inefficient
  and fragile to overflows.  Specifically, ''score_goal_diff_bp'' calculation can overflow when
  ''score'' is high.  The calculation is actually unnecessary at all because ''goal'' is a constant
  of value 10,000.  Calculation of ''compensation'' is again fragile to overflow.  Final calculation
  of return value for under-achiving case is again fragile to overflow when the current score
  is under-achieving the target.  Add two corner cases handling at the beginning of the function
  to make the body easier to read, and rewrite the body of the function to avoid overflows and
  the unnecessary bp value calcuation.'
