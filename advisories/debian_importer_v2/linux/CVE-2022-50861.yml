summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  NFSD: Finish
  converting the NFSv2 GETACL result encoder  The xdr_stream conversion inadvertently left some
  code that set the page_len of the send buffer. The XDR stream encoders should handle this
  automatically now.  This oversight adds garbage past the end of the Reply message. Clients
  typically ignore the garbage, but NFSD does not need to send it, as it leaks stale memory
  contents onto the wire.'
