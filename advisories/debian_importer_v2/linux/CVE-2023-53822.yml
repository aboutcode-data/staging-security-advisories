summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath11k:
  Ignore frags from uninitialized peer in dp.  When max virtual ap interfaces are configured
  in all the bands with ACS and hostapd restart is done every 60s, a crash is observed at random
  times. In this certain scenario, a fragmented packet is received for self peer, for which
  rx_tid and rx_frags are not initialized in datapath. While handling this fragment, crash is
  observed as the rx_frag list is uninitialised and when we walk in ath11k_dp_rx_h_sort_frags,
  skb null leads to exception.  To address this, before processing received fragments we check
  dp_setup_done flag is set to ensure that peer has completed its dp peer setup for fragment
  queue, else ignore processing the fragments.  Call trace:   ath11k_dp_process_rx_err+0x550/0x1084
