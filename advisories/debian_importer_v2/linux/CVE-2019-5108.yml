  - CVE-2019-5108
summary: An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the Linux kernel prior to
  mainline 5.3. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by triggering AP to send IAPP location
  updates for stations before the required authentication process has completed. This could
  lead to different denial-of-service scenarios, either by causing CAM table attacks, or by
  leading to traffic flapping if faking already existing clients in other nearby APs of the
  same wireless infrastructure. An attacker can forge Authentication and Association Request
  packets to trigger this vulnerability.
