summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: fix inode
  list leak during backref walking at resolve_indirect_refs()  During backref walking, at resolve_indirect_refs(),
  if we get an error we jump to the ''out'' label and call ulist_free() on the ''parents'' ulist,
  which frees all the elements in the ulist - however that does not free any inode lists that
  may be attached to elements, through the ''aux'' field of a ulist node, so we end up leaking
  lists if we have any attached to the unodes.  Fix this by calling free_leaf_list() instead
  of ulist_free() when we exit from resolve_indirect_refs(). The static function free_leaf_list()
  is moved up for this to be possible and it''s slightly simplified by removing unnecessary
  code.'
