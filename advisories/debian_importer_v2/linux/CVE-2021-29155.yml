  - CVE-2021-29155
summary: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.x. kernel/bpf/verifier.c performs
  undesirable out-of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic, leading to side-channel attacks
  that defeat Spectre mitigations and obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. Specifically,
  for sequences of pointer arithmetic operations, the pointer modification performed by the
  first operation is not correctly accounted for when restricting subsequent operations.
