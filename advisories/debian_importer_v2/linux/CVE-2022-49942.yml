summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: mac80211:
  Don''t finalize CSA in IBSS mode if state is disconnected  When we are not connected to a
  channel, sending channel "switch" announcement doesn''t make any sense.  The BSS list is empty
  in that case. This causes the for loop in cfg80211_get_bss() to be bypassed, so the function
  returns NULL (check line 1424 of net/wireless/scan.c), causing the WARN_ON() in ieee80211_ibss_csa_beacon()
  to get triggered (check line 500 of net/mac80211/ibss.c), which was consequently reported
  on the syzkaller dashboard.  Thus, check if we have an existing connection before generating
  the CSA beacon in ieee80211_ibss_finish_csa().'
