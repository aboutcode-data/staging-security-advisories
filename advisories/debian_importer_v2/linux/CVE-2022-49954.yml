  - CVE-2022-49954
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Input: iforce
  - wake up after clearing IFORCE_XMIT_RUNNING flag  syzbot is reporting hung task at __input_unregister_device()
  [1], for iforce_close() waiting at wait_event_interruptible() with dev->mutex held is blocking
  input_disconnect_device() from __input_unregister_device().  It seems that the cause is simply
  that commit c2b27ef672992a20 ("Input: iforce - wait for command completion when closing the
  device") forgot to call wake_up() after clear_bit().  Fix this problem by introducing a helper
  that calls clear_bit() followed by wake_up_all().'
