summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tty: n_gsm: add
  sanity check for gsm->receive in gsm_receive_buf()  A null pointer dereference can happen
  when attempting to access the "gsm->receive()" function in gsmld_receive_buf(). Currently,
  the code assumes that gsm->recieve is only called after MUX activation. Since the gsmld_receive_buf()
  function can be accessed without the need to initialize the MUX, the gsm->receive() function
  will not be set and a NULL pointer dereference will occur.  Fix this by avoiding the call
  to "gsm->receive()" in case the function is not initialized by adding a sanity check.  Call
