summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommu/vt-d: Disallow
  dirty tracking if incoherent page walk  Dirty page tracking relies on the IOMMU atomically
  updating the dirty bit in the paging-structure entry. For this operation to succeed, the paging-
  structure memory must be coherent between the IOMMU and the CPU. In another word, if the iommu
  page walk is incoherent, dirty page tracking doesn''t work.  The Intel VT-d specification,
  Section 3.10 "Snoop Behavior" states:  "Remapping hardware encountering the need to atomically
  update A/EA/D bits  in a paging-structure entry that is not snooped will result in a non-  recoverable
  fault."  To prevent an IOMMU from being incorrectly configured for dirty page tracking when
  it is operating in an incoherent mode, mark SSADS as supported only when both ecap_slads and
  ecap_smpwc are supported.'
