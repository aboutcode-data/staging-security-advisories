summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  firmware: qcom:
  scm: Fix missing read barrier in qcom_scm_get_tzmem_pool()  Commit 2e4955167ec5 ("firmware:
  qcom: scm: Fix __scm and waitq completion variable initialization") introduced a write barrier
  in probe function to store global ''__scm'' variable.  We all known barriers are paired (see
  memory-barriers.txt: "Note that write barriers should normally be paired with read or address-dependency
  barriers"), therefore accessing it from concurrent contexts requires read barrier.  Previous
  commit added such barrier in qcom_scm_is_available(), so let''s use that directly.  Lack of
  this read barrier can result in fetching stale ''__scm'' variable value, NULL, and dereferencing
  it.  Note that barrier in qcom_scm_is_available() satisfies here the control dependency.'
