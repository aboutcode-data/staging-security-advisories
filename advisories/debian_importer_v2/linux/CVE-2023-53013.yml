  - CVE-2023-53013
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ptdma: pt_core_execute_cmd()
  should use spinlock  The interrupt handler (pt_core_irq_handler()) of the ptdma driver can
  be called from interrupt context. The code flow in this function can lead down to pt_core_execute_cmd()
  which will attempt to grab a mutex, which is not appropriate in interrupt context and ultimately
  leads to a kernel panic. The fix here changes this mutex to a spinlock, which has been verified
  to resolve the issue.'
