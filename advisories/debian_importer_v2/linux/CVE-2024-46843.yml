  - CVE-2024-46843
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: ufs: core:
  Remove SCSI host only if added  If host tries to remove ufshcd driver from a UFS device it
  would cause a kernel panic if ufshcd_async_scan fails during ufshcd_probe_hba before adding
  a SCSI host with scsi_add_host and MCQ is enabled since SCSI host has been defered after MCQ
  configuration introduced by commit 0cab4023ec7b ("scsi: ufs: core: Defer adding host to SCSI
  if MCQ is supported").  To guarantee that SCSI host is removed only if it has been added,
  set the scsi_host_added flag to true after adding a SCSI host and check whether it is set
  or not before removing it.'
