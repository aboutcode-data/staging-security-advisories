summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  thermal: core:
  Reference count the zone in thermal_zone_get_by_id()  There are places in the thermal netlink
  code where nothing prevents the thermal zone object from going away while being accessed after
  it has been returned by thermal_zone_get_by_id().  To address this, make thermal_zone_get_by_id()
  get a reference on the thermal zone device object to be returned with the help of get_device(),
  under thermal_list_lock, and adjust all of its callers to this change with the help of the
  cleanup.h infrastructure.'
