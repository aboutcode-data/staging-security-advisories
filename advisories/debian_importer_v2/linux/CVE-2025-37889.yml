summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: ops: Consistently
  treat platform_max as control value  This reverts commit 9bdd10d57a88 ("ASoC: ops: Shift tested
  values in snd_soc_put_volsw() by +min"), and makes some additional related updates.  There
  are two ways the platform_max could be interpreted; the maximum register value, or the maximum
  value the control can be set to. The patch moved from treating the value as a control value
  to a register one. When the patch was applied it was technically correct as snd_soc_limit_volume()
  also used the register interpretation. However, even then most of the other usages treated
  platform_max as a control value, and snd_soc_limit_volume() has since been updated to also
  do so in commit fb9ad24485087 ("ASoC: ops: add correct range check for limiting volume").
  That patch however, missed updating snd_soc_put_volsw() back to the control interpretation,
  and fixing snd_soc_info_volsw_range(). The control interpretation makes more sense as limiting
  is typically done from the machine driver, so it is appropriate to use the customer facing
  representation rather than the internal codec representation. Update all the code to consistently
  use this interpretation of platform_max.  Finally, also add some comments to the soc_mixer_control
  struct to hopefully avoid further patches switching between the two approaches.'
