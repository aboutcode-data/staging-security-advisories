summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/mlx5e: Fix
  CT entry update leaks of modify header context  The cited commit allocates a new modify header
  to replace the old one when updating CT entry. But if failed to allocate a new one, eg. exceed
  the max number firmware can support, modify header will be an error pointer that will trigger
  a panic when deallocating it. And the old modify header point is copied to old attr. When
  the old attr is freed, the old modify header is lost.  Fix it by restoring the old attr to
  attr when failed to allocate a new modify header context. So when the CT entry is freed, the
  right modify header context will be freed. And the panic of accessing error pointer is also
  fixed.'
