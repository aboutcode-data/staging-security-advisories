summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm, fbcon, vga_switcheroo:
  Avoid race condition in fbcon setup  Protect vga_switcheroo_client_fb_set() with console lock.
  Avoids OOB access in fbcon_remap_all(). Without holding the console lock the call races with
  switching outputs.  VGA switcheroo calls fbcon_remap_all() when switching clients. The fbcon
  function uses struct fb_info.node, which is set by register_framebuffer(). As the fb-helper
  code currently sets up VGA switcheroo before registering the framebuffer, the value of node
  is -1 and therefore not a legal value. For example, fbcon uses the value within set_con2fb_map()
  [1] as an index into an array.  Moving vga_switcheroo_client_fb_set() after register_framebuffer()
  can result in VGA switching that does not switch fbcon correctly.  Therefore move vga_switcheroo_client_fb_set()
  under fbcon_fb_registered(), which already holds the console lock. Fbdev calls fbcon_fb_registered()
  from within register_framebuffer(). Serializes the helper with VGA switcheroo''s call to fbcon_remap_all().  Although
  vga_switcheroo_client_fb_set() takes an instance of struct fb_info as parameter, it really
  only needs the contained fbcon state. Moving the call to fbcon initialization is therefore
  cleaner than before. Only amdgpu, i915, nouveau and radeon support vga_switcheroo. For all
  other drivers, this change does nothing.'
