  - CVE-2020-26147
summary: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 5.8.9. The WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 implementations
  reassemble fragments even though some of them were sent in plaintext. This vulnerability can
  be abused to inject packets and/or exfiltrate selected fragments when another device sends
  fragmented frames and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP data-confidentiality protocol is used.
