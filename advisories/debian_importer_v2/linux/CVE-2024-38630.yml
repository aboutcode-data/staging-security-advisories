summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  watchdog: cpu5wdt.c:
  Fix use-after-free bug caused by cpu5wdt_trigger  When the cpu5wdt module is removing, the
  origin code uses del_timer() to de-activate the timer. If the timer handler is running, del_timer()
  could not stop it and will return directly. If the port region is released by release_region()
  and then the timer handler cpu5wdt_trigger() calls outb() to write into the region that is
  released, the use-after-free bug will happen.  Change del_timer() to timer_shutdown_sync()
  in order that the timer handler could be finished before the port region is released.'
