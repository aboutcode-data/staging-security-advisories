  - CVE-2023-52624
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display:
  Wake DMCUB before executing GPINT commands  [Why] DMCUB can be in idle when we attempt to
  interface with the HW through the GPINT mailbox resulting in a system hang.  [How] Add dc_wake_and_execute_gpint()
  to wrap the wake, execute, sleep sequence.  If the GPINT executes successfully then DMCUB
  will be put back into sleep after the optional response is returned.  It functions similar
  to the inbox command interface.'
