  - CVE-2022-50575
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xen/privcmd:
  Fix a possible warning in privcmd_ioctl_mmap_resource()  As ''kdata.num'' is user-controlled
  data, if user tries to allocate memory larger than(>=) MAX_ORDER, then kcalloc() will fail,
  it creates a stack trace and messes up dmesg with a warning.  Call trace: -> privcmd_ioctl
  --> privcmd_ioctl_mmap_resource  Add __GFP_NOWARN in order to avoid too large allocation warning.
  This is detected by static analysis using smatch.'
