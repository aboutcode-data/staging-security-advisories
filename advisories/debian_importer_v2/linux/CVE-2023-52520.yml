summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  platform/x86:
  think-lmi: Fix reference leak  If a duplicate attribute is found using kset_find_obj(), a
  reference to that attribute is returned which needs to be disposed accordingly using kobject_put().
  Move the setting name validation into a separate function to allow for this change without
  having to duplicate the cleanup code for this setting. As a side note, a very similar bug
  was fixed in commit 7295a996fdab ("platform/x86: dell-sysman: Fix reference leak"), so it
  seems that the bug was copied from that driver.  Compile-tested only.'
