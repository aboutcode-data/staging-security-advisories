summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: stk1160:
  fix bounds checking in stk1160_copy_video()  The subtract in this condition is reversed.  The
  ->length is the length of the buffer.  The ->bytesused is how many bytes we have copied thus
  far.  When the condition is reversed that means the result of the subtraction is always negative
  but since it''s unsigned then the result is a very high positive value.  That means the overflow
  check is never true.  Additionally, the ->bytesused doesn''t actually work for this purpose
  because we''re not writing to "buf->mem + buf->bytesused".  Instead, the math to calculate
  the destination where we are writing is a bit involved.  You calculate the number of full
  lines already written, multiply by two, skip a line if necessary so that we start on an odd
  numbered line, and add the offset into the line.  To fix this buffer overflow, just take the
  actual destination where we are writing, if the offset is already out of bounds print an error
  and return.  Otherwise, write up to buf->length bytes.'
