  - CVE-2025-71202
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommu/sva: invalidate
  stale IOTLB entries for kernel address space  Introduce a new IOMMU interface to flush IOTLB
  paging cache entries for the CPU kernel address space.  This interface is invoked from the
  x86 architecture code that manages combined user and kernel page tables, specifically before
  any kernel page table page is freed and reused.  This addresses the main issue with vfree()
  which is a common occurrence and can be triggered by unprivileged users.  While this resolves
  the primary problem, it doesn''t address some extremely rare case related to memory unplug
  of memory that was present as reserved memory at boot, which cannot be triggered by unprivileged
  users.  The discussion can be found at the link below.  Enable SVA on x86 architecture since
  the IOMMU can now receive notification to flush the paging cache before freeing the CPU kernel
  page table pages.'
