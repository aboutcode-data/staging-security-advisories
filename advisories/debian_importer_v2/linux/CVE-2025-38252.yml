summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cxl/ras: Fix
  CPER handler device confusion  By inspection, cxl_cper_handle_prot_err() is making a series
  of fragile assumptions that can lead to crashes:  1/ It assumes that endpoints identified
  in the record are a CXL-type-3    device, nothing guarantees that.  2/ It assumes that the
  device is bound to the cxl_pci driver, nothing    guarantees that.  3/ Minor, it holds the
  device lock over the switch-port tracing for no    reason as the trace is 100% generated from
  data in the record.  Correct those by checking that the PCIe endpoint parents a cxl_memdev
  before assuming the format of the driver data, and move the lock to where it is required.
  Consequently this also makes the implementation ready for CXL accelerators that are not bound
  to cxl_pci.'
