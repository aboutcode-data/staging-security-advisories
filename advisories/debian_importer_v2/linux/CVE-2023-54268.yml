  - CVE-2023-54268
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  debugobjects:
  Don''t wake up kswapd from fill_pool()  syzbot is reporting a lockdep warning in fill_pool()
  because the allocation from debugobjects is using GFP_ATOMIC, which is (__GFP_HIGH | __GFP_KSWAPD_RECLAIM)
  and therefore tries to wake up kswapd, which acquires kswapd_wait::lock.  Since fill_pool()
  might be called with arbitrary locks held, fill_pool() should not assume that acquiring kswapd_wait::lock
  is safe.  Use __GFP_HIGH instead and remove __GFP_NORETRY as it is pointless for !__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM
  allocation.'
