summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xfs: fix UAF
  in xchk_btree_check_block_owner  We cannot dereference bs->cur when trying to determine if
  bs->cur aliases bs->sc->sa.{bno,rmap}_cur after the latter has been freed. Fix this by sampling
  before type before any freeing could happen. The correct temporal ordering was broken when
  we removed xfs_btnum_t.'
