summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: bcm: rpi:
  Assign ->num before accessing ->hws  Commit f316cdff8d67 ("clk: Annotate struct clk_hw_onecell_data
  with __counted_by") annotated the hws member of ''struct clk_hw_onecell_data'' with __counted_by,
  which informs the bounds sanitizer about the number of elements in hws, so that it can warn
  when hws is accessed out of bounds. As noted in that change, the __counted_by member must
  be initialized with the number of elements before the first array access happens, otherwise
  there will be a warning from each access prior to the initialization because the number of
  elements is zero. This occurs in raspberrypi_discover_clocks() due to ->num being assigned
  after ->hws has been accessed:    UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in drivers/clk/bcm/clk-raspberrypi.c:374:4   index
  3 is out of range for type ''struct clk_hw *[] __counted_by(num)'' (aka ''struct clk_hw *[]'')  Move
  the ->num initialization to before the first access of ->hws, which clears up the warning.'
