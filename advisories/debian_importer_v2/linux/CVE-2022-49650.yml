summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dmaengine: qcom:
  bam_dma: fix runtime PM underflow  Commit dbad41e7bb5f ("dmaengine: qcom: bam_dma: check if
  the runtime pm enabled") caused unbalanced pm_runtime_get/put() calls when the bam is controlled
  remotely. This commit reverts it and just enables pm_runtime in all cases, the clk_* functions
  already just nop when the clock is NULL.  Also clean up a bit by removing unnecessary bamclk
  null checks.'
