summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  LoongArch: BPF:
  Fix off-by-one error in build_prologue()  Vincent reported that running BPF progs with tailcalls
  on LoongArch causes kernel hard lockup. Debugging the issues shows that the JITed image missing
  a jirl instruction at the end of the epilogue.  There are two passes in JIT compiling, the
  first pass set the flags and the second pass generates JIT code based on those flags. With
  BPF progs mixing bpf2bpf and tailcalls, build_prologue() generates N insns in the first pass
  and then generates N+1 insns in the second pass. This makes epilogue_offset off by one and
  we will jump to some unexpected insn and cause lockup. Fix this by inserting a nop insn.'
