summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: fix memory
  leak of qgroup_list in btrfs_add_qgroup_relation  When btrfs_add_qgroup_relation() is called
  with invalid qgroup levels (src >= dst), the function returns -EINVAL directly without freeing
  the preallocated qgroup_list structure passed by the caller. This causes a memory leak because
  the caller unconditionally sets the pointer to NULL after the call, preventing any cleanup.  The
  issue occurs because the level validation check happens before the mutex is acquired and before
  any error handling path that would free the prealloc pointer. On this early return, the cleanup
  code at the ''out'' label (which includes kfree(prealloc)) is never reached.  In btrfs_ioctl_qgroup_assign(),
  the code pattern is:      prealloc = kzalloc(sizeof(*prealloc), GFP_KERNEL);     ret = btrfs_add_qgroup_relation(trans,
  sa->src, sa->dst, prealloc);     prealloc = NULL;  // Always set to NULL regardless of return
  value     ...     kfree(prealloc);  // This becomes kfree(NULL), does nothing  When the level
  check fails, ''prealloc'' is never freed by either the callee or the caller, resulting in
  a 64-byte memory leak per failed operation. This can be triggered repeatedly by an unprivileged
  user with access to a writable btrfs mount, potentially exhausting kernel memory.  Fix this
  by freeing prealloc before the early return, ensuring prealloc is always freed on all error
  paths.'
