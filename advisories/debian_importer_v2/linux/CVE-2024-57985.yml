summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  firmware: qcom:
  scm: Cleanup global ''__scm'' on probe failures  If SCM driver fails the probe, it should
  not leave global ''__scm'' variable assigned, because external users of this driver will assume
  the probe finished successfully.  For example TZMEM parts (''__scm->mempool'') are initialized
  later in the probe, but users of it (__scm_smc_call()) rely on the ''__scm'' variable.  This
  fixes theoretical NULL pointer exception, triggered via introducing probe deferral in SCM
  driver with call trace:    qcom_tzmem_alloc+0x70/0x1ac (P)   qcom_tzmem_alloc+0x64/0x1ac (L)   qcom_scm_assign_mem+0x78/0x194   qcom_rmtfs_mem_probe+0x2d4/0x38c   platform_probe+0x68/0xc8'
