summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  riscv: Prevent
  a bad reference count on CPU nodes  When populating cache leaves we previously fetched the
  CPU device node at the very beginning. But when ACPI is enabled we go through a specific branch
  which returns early and does not call ''of_node_put'' for the node that was acquired.  Since
  we are not using a CPU device node for the ACPI code anyways, we can simply move the initialization
  of it just passed the ACPI block, and we are guaranteed to have an ''of_node_put'' call for
  the acquired node. This prevents a bad reference count of the CPU device node.  Moreover,
  the previous function did not check for errors when acquiring the device node, so a return
  -ENOENT has been added for that case.'
