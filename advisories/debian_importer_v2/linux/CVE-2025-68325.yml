summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/sched: sch_cake:
  Fix incorrect qlen reduction in cake_drop  In cake_drop(), qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() is
  used to update the qlen and backlog of the qdisc hierarchy. Its caller, cake_enqueue(), assumes
  that the parent qdisc will enqueue the current packet. However, this assumption breaks when
  cake_enqueue() returns NET_XMIT_CN: the parent qdisc stops enqueuing current packet, leaving
  the tree qlen/backlog accounting inconsistent. This mismatch can lead to a NULL dereference
  (e.g., when the parent Qdisc is qfq_qdisc).  This patch computes the qlen/backlog delta in
  a more robust way by observing the difference before and after the series of cake_drop() calls,
  and then compensates the qdisc tree accounting if cake_enqueue() returns NET_XMIT_CN.  To
  ensure correct compensation when ACK thinning is enabled, a new variable is introduced to
  keep qlen unchanged.'
