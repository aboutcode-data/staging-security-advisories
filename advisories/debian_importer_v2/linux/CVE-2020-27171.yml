  - CVE-2020-27171
summary: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. kernel/bpf/verifier.c has
  an off-by-one error (with a resultant integer underflow) affecting out-of-bounds speculation
  on pointer arithmetic, leading to side-channel attacks that defeat Spectre mitigations and
  obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, aka CID-10d2bb2e6b1d.
