  - CVE-2024-27418
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: mctp: take
  ownership of skb in mctp_local_output  Currently, mctp_local_output only takes ownership of
  skb on success, and we may leak an skb if mctp_local_output fails in specific states; the
  skb ownership isn''t transferred until the actual output routing occurs.  Instead, make mctp_local_output
  free the skb on all error paths up to the route action, so it always consumes the passed skb.'
