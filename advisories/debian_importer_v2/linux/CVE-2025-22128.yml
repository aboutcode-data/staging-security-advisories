summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath12k:\
  \ Clear affinity hint before calling ath12k_pci_free_irq() in error path  If a shared IRQ\
  \ is used by the driver due to platform limitation, then the IRQ affinity hint is set right\
  \ after the allocation of IRQ vectors in ath12k_pci_msi_alloc(). This does no harm unless\
  \ one of the functions requesting the IRQ fails and attempt to free the IRQ.  This may end\
  \ up with a warning from the IRQ core that is expecting the affinity hint to be cleared before\
  \ freeing the IRQ:  kernel/irq/manage.c:  \t/* make sure affinity_hint is cleaned up */ \t\
  if (WARN_ON_ONCE(desc->affinity_hint)) \t\tdesc->affinity_hint = NULL;  So to fix this issue,\
  \ clear the IRQ affinity hint before calling ath12k_pci_free_irq() in the error path. The\
  \ affinity will be cleared once again further down the error path due to code organization,\
  \ but that does no harm."
