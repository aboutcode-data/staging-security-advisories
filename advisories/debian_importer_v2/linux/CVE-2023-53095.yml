summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/ttm: Fix
  a NULL pointer dereference  The LRU mechanism may look up a resource in the process of being
  removed from an object. The locking rules here are a bit unclear but it looks currently like
  res->bo assignment is protected by the LRU lock, whereas bo->resource is protected by the
  object lock, while *clearing* of bo->resource is also protected by the LRU lock. This means
  that if we check that bo->resource points to the LRU resource under the LRU lock we should
  be safe. So perform that check before deciding to swap out a bo. That avoids dereferencing
  a NULL bo->resource in ttm_bo_swapout().'
