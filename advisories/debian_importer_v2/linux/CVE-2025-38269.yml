  - CVE-2025-38269
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: exit after
  state insertion failure at btrfs_convert_extent_bit()  If insert_state() state failed it returns
  an error pointer and we call extent_io_tree_panic() which will trigger a BUG() call. However
  if CONFIG_BUG is disabled, which is an uncommon and exotic scenario, then we fallthrough and
  call cache_state() which will dereference the error pointer, resulting in an invalid memory
  access.  So jump to the ''out'' label after calling extent_io_tree_panic(), it also makes
  the code more clear besides dealing with the exotic scenario where CONFIG_BUG is disabled.'
