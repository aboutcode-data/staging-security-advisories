summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  landlock: Don''t
  lose track of restrictions on cred_transfer  When a process'' cred struct is replaced, this
  _almost_ always invokes the cred_prepare LSM hook; but in one special case (when KEYCTL_SESSION_TO_PARENT
  updates the parent''s credentials), the cred_transfer LSM hook is used instead.  Landlock
  only implements the cred_prepare hook, not cred_transfer, so KEYCTL_SESSION_TO_PARENT causes
  all information on Landlock restrictions to be lost.  This basically means that a process
  with the ability to use the fork() and keyctl() syscalls can get rid of all Landlock restrictions
  on itself.  Fix it by adding a cred_transfer hook that does the same thing as the existing
  cred_prepare hook. (Implemented by having hook_cred_prepare() call hook_cred_transfer() so
  that the two functions are less likely to accidentally diverge in the future.)'
