summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  locking/csd_lock:
  Change csdlock_debug from early_param to __setup  The csdlock_debug kernel-boot parameter
  is parsed by the early_param() function csdlock_debug().  If set, csdlock_debug() invokes
  static_branch_enable() to enable csd_lock_wait feature, which triggers a panic on arm64 for
  kernels built with CONFIG_SPARSEMEM=y and CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP=n.  With CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP=n,
  __nr_to_section is called in static_key_enable() and returns NULL, resulting in a NULL dereference
  because mem_section is initialized only later in sparse_init().  This is also a problem for
  powerpc because early_param() functions are invoked earlier than jump_label_init(), also resulting
  in static_key_enable() failures.  These failures cause the warning "static key ''xxx'' used
  before call to jump_label_init()".  Thus, early_param is too early for csd_lock_wait to run
  static_branch_enable(), so changes it to __setup to fix these.'
