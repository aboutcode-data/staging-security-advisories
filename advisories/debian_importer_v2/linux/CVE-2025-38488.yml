  - CVE-2025-38488
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  smb: client:
  fix use-after-free in crypt_message when using async crypto  The CVE-2024-50047 fix removed
  asynchronous crypto handling from crypt_message(), assuming all crypto operations are synchronous.
  However, when hardware crypto accelerators are used, this can cause use-after-free crashes:    crypt_message()     //
  Allocate the creq buffer containing the req     creq = smb2_get_aead_req(..., &req);      //
  Async encryption returns -EINPROGRESS immediately     rc = enc ? crypto_aead_encrypt(req)
  : crypto_aead_decrypt(req);      // Free creq while async operation is still in progress     kvfree_sensitive(creq,
  ...);  Hardware crypto modules often implement async AEAD operations for performance. When
  crypto_aead_encrypt/decrypt() returns -EINPROGRESS, the operation completes asynchronously.
  Without crypto_wait_req(), the function immediately frees the request buffer, leading to crashes
  when the driver later accesses the freed memory.  This results in a use-after-free condition
  when the hardware crypto driver later accesses the freed request structure, leading to kernel
  crashes with NULL pointer dereferences.  The issue occurs because crypto_alloc_aead() with
  mask=0 doesn''t guarantee synchronous operation. Even without CRYPTO_ALG_ASYNC in the mask,
  async implementations can be selected.  Fix by restoring the async crypto handling: - DECLARE_CRYPTO_WAIT(wait)
  for completion tracking - aead_request_set_callback() for async completion notification -
  crypto_wait_req() to wait for operation completion  This ensures the request buffer isn''t
  freed until the crypto operation completes, whether synchronous or asynchronous, while preserving
  the CVE-2024-50047 fix.'
