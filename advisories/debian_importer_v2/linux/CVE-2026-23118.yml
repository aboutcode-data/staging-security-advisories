summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rxrpc: Fix data-race
  warning and potential load/store tearing  Fix the following:          BUG: KCSAN: data-race
  in rxrpc_peer_keepalive_worker / rxrpc_send_data_packet  which is reporting an issue with
  the reads and writes to ->last_tx_at in:          conn->peer->last_tx_at = ktime_get_seconds();  and:          keepalive_at
  = peer->last_tx_at + RXRPC_KEEPALIVE_TIME;  The lockless accesses to these to values aren''t
  actually a problem as the read only needs an approximate time of last transmission for the
  purposes of deciding whether or not the transmission of a keepalive packet is warranted yet.  Also,
  as ->last_tx_at is a 64-bit value, tearing can occur on a 32-bit arch.  Fix both of these
  by switching to an unsigned int for ->last_tx_at and only storing the LSW of the time64_t.  It
  can then be reconstructed at need provided no more than 68 years has elapsed since the last
  transmission.'
