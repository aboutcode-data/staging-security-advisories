  - CVE-2015-2877
summary: 'Kernel Samepage Merging (KSM) in the Linux kernel 2.6.32 through 4.x does not prevent
  use of a write-timing side channel, which allows guest OS users to defeat the ASLR protection
  mechanism on other guest OS instances via a Cross-VM ASL INtrospection (CAIN) attack.  NOTE:
  the vendor states "Basically if you care about this attack vector, disable deduplication."
  Share-until-written approaches for memory conservation among mutually untrusting tenants are
  inherently detectable for information disclosure, and can be classified as potentially misunderstood
  behaviors rather than vulnerabilities'
