summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cxl/pmem: Fix
  nvdimm registration races  A loop of the form:      while true; do modprobe cxl_pci; modprobe
  -r cxl_pci; done  ...fails with the following crash signature:      BUG: kernel NULL pointer
  dereference, address: 0000000000000040     [..]     RIP: 0010:cxl_internal_send_cmd+0x5/0xb0

  device registration runs after the CXL has already torn down the context that cxl_pmem_ctl()
  needs. Unlike the ACPI NFIT case that benefits from launching multiple nvdimm device registrations
  in parallel from those listed in the table, CXL is already marked PROBE_PREFER_ASYNCHRONOUS.
  So provide for a synchronous registration path to preclude this scenario.'
