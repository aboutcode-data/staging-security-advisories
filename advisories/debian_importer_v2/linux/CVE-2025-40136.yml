  - CVE-2025-40136
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: hisilicon/qm
  - request reserved interrupt for virtual function  The device interrupt vector 3 is an error
  interrupt for physical function and a reserved interrupt for virtual function. However, the
  driver has not registered the reserved interrupt for virtual function. When allocating interrupts,
  the number of interrupts is allocated based on powers of two, which includes this interrupt.
  When the system enables GICv4 and the virtual function passthrough to the virtual machine,
  releasing the interrupt in the driver triggers a warning.  The WARNING report is: WARNING:
  CPU: 62 PID: 14889 at arch/arm64/kvm/vgic/vgic-its.c:852 its_free_ite+0x94/0xb4  Therefore,
  register a reserved interrupt for VF and set the IRQF_NO_AUTOEN flag to avoid that warning.'
