summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  s390/cpum_sf:
  Fix and protect memory allocation of SDBs with mutex  Reservation of the PMU hardware is done
  at first event creation and is protected by a pair of mutex_lock() and mutex_unlock(). After
  reservation of the PMU hardware the memory required for the PMUs the event is to be installed
  on is allocated by allocate_buffers() and alloc_sampling_buffer(). This done outside of the
  mutex protection. Without mutex protection two or more concurrent invocations of perf_event_init()
  may run in parallel. This can lead to allocation of Sample Data Blocks (SDBs) multiple times
  for the same PMU. Prevent this and protect memory allocation of SDBs by mutex.'
