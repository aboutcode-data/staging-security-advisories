summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vhost-vdpa: fix
  vm_flags for virtqueue doorbell mapping  The virtqueue doorbell is usually implemented via
  registeres but we don''t provide the necessary vma->flags like VM_PFNMAP. This may cause several
  issues e.g when userspace tries to map the doorbell via vhost IOTLB, kernel may panic due
  to the page is not backed by page structure. This patch fixes this by setting the necessary
  vm_flags. With this patch, try to map doorbell via IOTLB will fail with bad address.'
