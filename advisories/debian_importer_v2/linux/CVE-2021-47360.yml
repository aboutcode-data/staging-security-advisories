summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  binder: make
  sure fd closes complete  During BC_FREE_BUFFER processing, the BINDER_TYPE_FDA object cleanup
  may close 1 or more fds. The close operations are completed using the task work mechanism
  -- which means the thread needs to return to userspace or the file object may never be dereferenced
  -- which can lead to hung processes.  Force the binder thread back to userspace if an fd is
  closed during BC_FREE_BUFFER handling.'
