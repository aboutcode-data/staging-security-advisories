  - CVE-2023-53472
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  pwm: lpc32xx:
  Remove handling of PWM channels  Because LPC32xx PWM controllers have only a single output
  which is registered as the only PWM device/channel per controller, it is known in advance
  that pwm->hwpwm value is always 0. On basis of this fact simplify the code by removing operations
  with pwm->hwpwm, there is no controls which require channel number as input.  Even though
  I wasn''t aware at the time when I forward ported that patch, this fixes a null pointer dereference
  as lpc32xx->chip.pwms is NULL before devm_pwmchip_add() is called.'
