summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  idpf: fix adapter
  NULL pointer dereference on reboot  With SRIOV enabled, idpf ends up calling into idpf_remove()
  twice. First via idpf_shutdown() and then again when idpf_remove() calls into sriov_disable(),
  because the VF devices use the idpf driver, hence the same remove routine. When that happens,
  it is possible for the adapter to be NULL from the first call to idpf_remove(), leading to
  a NULL pointer dereference.  echo 1 > /sys/class/net/<netif>/device/sriov_numvfs reboot  BUG:
  kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000020 ... RIP: 0010:idpf_remove+0x22/0x1f0

  device_shutdown+0x156/0x200 ...  Replace the direct idpf_remove() call in idpf_shutdown()
  with idpf_vc_core_deinit() and idpf_deinit_dflt_mbx(), which perform the bulk of the cleanup,
  such as stopping the init task, freeing IRQs, destroying the vports and freeing the mailbox.
  This avoids the calls to sriov_disable() in addition to a small netdev cleanup, and destroying
  workqueues, which don''t seem to be required on shutdown.'
