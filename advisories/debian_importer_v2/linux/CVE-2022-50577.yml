summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ima: Fix memory
  leak in __ima_inode_hash()  Commit f3cc6b25dcc5 ("ima: always measure and audit files in policy")
  lets measurement or audit happen even if the file digest cannot be calculated.  As a result,
  iint->ima_hash could have been allocated despite ima_collect_measurement() returning an error.  Since
  ima_hash belongs to a temporary inode metadata structure, declared at the beginning of __ima_inode_hash(),
  just add a kfree() call if ima_collect_measurement() returns an error different from -ENOMEM
  (in that case, ima_hash should not have been allocated).'
