summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  libceph: fix
  invalid accesses to ceph_connection_v1_info  There is a place where generic code in messenger.c
  is reading and another place where it is writing to con->v1 union member without checking
  that the union member is active (i.e. msgr1 is in use).  On 64-bit systems, con->v1.auth_retry
  overlaps with con->v2.out_iter, so such a read is almost guaranteed to return a bogus value
  instead of 0 when msgr2 is in use.  This ends up being fairly benign because the side effect
  is just the invalidation of the authorizer and successive fetching of new tickets.  con->v1.connect_seq
  overlaps with con->v2.conn_bufs and the fact that it''s being written to can cause more serious
  consequences, but luckily it''s not something that happens often.'
