  - CVE-2023-52932
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/swapfile:
  add cond_resched() in get_swap_pages()  The softlockup still occurs in get_swap_pages() under
  memory pressure.  64 CPU cores, 64GB memory, and 28 zram devices, the disksize of each zram
  device is 50MB with same priority as si.  Use the stress-ng tool to increase memory pressure,
  causing the system to oom frequently.  The plist_for_each_entry_safe() loops in get_swap_pages()
  could reach tens of thousands of times to find available space (extreme case: cond_resched()
  is not called in scan_swap_map_slots()).  Let''s add cond_resched() into get_swap_pages()
  when failed to find available space to avoid softlockup.'
