  - CVE-2025-22046
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  uprobes/x86:
  Harden uretprobe syscall trampoline check  Jann reported a possible issue when trampoline_check_ip
  returns address near the bottom of the address space that is allowed to call into the syscall
  if uretprobes are not set up:     https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/202502081235.5A6F352985@keescook/T/#m9d416df341b8fbc11737dacbcd29f0054413cbbf  Though
  the mmap minimum address restrictions will typically prevent creating mappings there, let''s
  make sure uretprobe syscall checks for that.'
