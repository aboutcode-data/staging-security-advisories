summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: usb-audio:
  Kill timer properly at removal  The USB-audio MIDI code initializes the timer, but in a rare
  case, the driver might be freed without the disconnect call.  This leaves the timer in an
  active state while the assigned object is released via snd_usbmidi_free(), which ends up with
  a kernel warning when the debug configuration is enabled, as spotted by fuzzer.  For avoiding
  the problem, put timer_shutdown_sync() at snd_usbmidi_free(), so that the timer can be killed
  properly. While we''re at it, replace the existing timer_delete_sync() at the disconnect callback
  with timer_shutdown_sync(), too.'
