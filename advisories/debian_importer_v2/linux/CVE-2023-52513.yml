summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/siw: Fix
  connection failure handling  In case immediate MPA request processing fails, the newly created
  endpoint unlinks the listening endpoint and is ready to be dropped. This special case was
  not handled correctly by the code handling the later TCP socket close, causing a NULL dereference
  crash in siw_cm_work_handler() when dereferencing a NULL listener. We now also cancel the
  useless MPA timeout, if immediate MPA request processing fails.  This patch furthermore simplifies
  MPA processing in general: Scheduling a useless TCP socket read in sk_data_ready() upcall
  is now surpressed, if the socket is already moved out of TCP_ESTABLISHED state.'
