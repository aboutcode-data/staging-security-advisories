summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: don''t
  check PageError in __extent_writepage  __extent_writepage currenly sets PageError whenever
  any error happens, and the also checks for PageError to decide if to call error handling.
  This leads to very unclear responsibility for cleaning up on errors. In the VM and generic
  writeback helpers the basic idea is that once I/O is fired off all error handling responsibility
  is delegated to the end I/O handler.  But if that end I/O handler sets the PageError bit,
  and the submitter checks it, the bit could in some cases leak into the submission context
  for fast enough I/O.  Fix this by simply not checking PageError and just using the local ret
  variable to check for submission errors.  This also fundamentally solves the long problem
  documented in a comment in __extent_writepage by never leaking the error bit into the submission
  context.'
