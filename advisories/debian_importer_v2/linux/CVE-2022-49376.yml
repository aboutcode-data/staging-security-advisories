summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: sd: Fix
  potential NULL pointer dereference  If sd_probe() sees an early error before sdkp->device
  is initialized, sd_zbc_release_disk() is called. This causes a NULL pointer dereference when
  sd_is_zoned() is called inside that function. Avoid this by removing the call to sd_zbc_release_disk()
  in sd_probe() error path.  This change is safe and does not result in zone information memory
  leakage because the zone information for a zoned disk is allocated only when sd_revalidate_disk()
  is called, at which point sdkp->disk_dev is fully set, resulting in sd_disk_release() being
  called when needed to cleanup a disk zone information using sd_zbc_release_disk().'
