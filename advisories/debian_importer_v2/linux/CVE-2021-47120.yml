summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: magicmouse:
  fix NULL-deref on disconnect  Commit 9d7b18668956 ("HID: magicmouse: add support for Apple
  Magic Trackpad 2") added a sanity check for an Apple trackpad but returned success instead
  of -ENODEV when the check failed. This means that the remove callback will dereference the
  never-initialised driver data pointer when the driver is later unbound (e.g. on USB disconnect).'
