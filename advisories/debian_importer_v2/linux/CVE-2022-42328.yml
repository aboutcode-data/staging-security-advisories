summary: Guests can trigger deadlock in Linux netback driver T[his CNA information record relates
  to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
  The patch for XSA-392 introduced another issue which might result in a deadlock when trying
  to free the SKB of a packet dropped due to the XSA-392 handling (CVE-2022-42328). Additionally
