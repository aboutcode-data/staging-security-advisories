summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/MCE/AMD:
  Fix memory leak when threshold_create_bank() fails  In mce_threshold_create_device(), if threshold_create_bank()
  fails, the previously allocated threshold banks array @bp will be leaked because the call
  to mce_threshold_remove_device() will not free it.  This happens because mce_threshold_remove_device()
  fetches the pointer through the threshold_banks per-CPU variable but bp is written there only
  after the bank creation is successful, and not before, when threshold_create_bank() fails.  Add
  a helper which unwinds all the bank creation work previously done and pass into it the previously
  allocated threshold banks array for freeing.    [ bp: Massage. ]'
