summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  perf: Ensure
  swevent hrtimer is properly destroyed  With the change to hrtimer_try_to_cancel() in perf_swevent_cancel_hrtimer()
  it appears possible for the hrtimer to still be active by the time the event gets freed.  Make
  sure the event does a full hrtimer_cancel() on the free path by installing a perf_event::destroy
  handler.'
