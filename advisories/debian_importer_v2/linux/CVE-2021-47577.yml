  - CVE-2021-47577
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io-wq: check
  for wq exit after adding new worker task_work  We check IO_WQ_BIT_EXIT before attempting to
  create a new worker, and wq exit cancels pending work if we have any. But it''s possible to
  have a race between the two, where creation checks exit finding it not set, but we''re in
  the process of exiting. The exit side will cancel pending creation task_work, but there''s
  a gap where we add task_work after we''ve canceled existing creations at exit time.  Fix this
  by checking the EXIT bit post adding the creation task_work. If it''s set, run the same cancelation
  that exit does.'
