  - CVE-2025-21704
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: cdc-acm:
  Check control transfer buffer size before access  If the first fragment is shorter than struct
  usb_cdc_notification, we can''t calculate an expected_size. Log an error and discard the notification
  instead of reading lengths from memory outside the received data, which can lead to memory
  corruption when the expected_size decreases between fragments, causing `expected_size - acm->nb_index`
  to wrap.  This issue has been present since the beginning of git history; however, it only
  leads to memory corruption since commit ea2583529cd1 ("cdc-acm: reassemble fragmented notifications").  A
  mitigating factor is that acm_ctrl_irq() can only execute after userspace has opened /dev/ttyACM*;
  but if ModemManager is running, ModemManager will do that automatically depending on the USB
  device''s vendor/product IDs and its other interfaces.'
