summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: ti: icss-iep:
  Fix possible NULL pointer dereference for perout request  The ICSS IEP driver tracks perout
  and pps enable state with flags. Currently when disabling pps and perout signals during icss_iep_exit(),
  results in NULL pointer dereference for perout.  To fix the null pointer dereference issue,
  the icss_iep_perout_enable_hw function can be modified to directly clear the IEP CMP registers
  when disabling PPS or PEROUT, without referencing the ptp_perout_request structure, as its
  contents are irrelevant in this case.'
