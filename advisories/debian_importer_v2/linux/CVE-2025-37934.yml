summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: simple-card-utils:
  Fix pointer check in graph_util_parse_link_direction  Actually check if the passed pointers
  are valid, before writing to them. This also fixes a USBAN warning: UBSAN: invalid-load in
  ../sound/soc/fsl/imx-card.c:687:25 load of value 255 is not a valid value for type ''_Bool''  This
  is because playback_only is uninitialized and is not written to, as the playback-only property
  is absent.'
