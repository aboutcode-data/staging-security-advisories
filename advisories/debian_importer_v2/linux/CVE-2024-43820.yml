summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dm-raid: Fix
  WARN_ON_ONCE check for sync_thread in raid_resume  rm-raid devices will occasionally trigger
  the following warning when being resumed after a table load because DM_RECOVERY_RUNNING is
  set:  WARNING: CPU: 7 PID: 5660 at drivers/md/dm-raid.c:4105 raid_resume+0xee/0x100 [dm_raid]  The
  failing check is: WARN_ON_ONCE(test_bit(MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING, &mddev->recovery));  This check
  is designed to make sure that the sync thread isn''t registered, but md_check_recovery can
  set MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING without the sync_thread ever getting registered. Instead of checking
  if MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING is set, check if sync_thread is non-NULL.'
