summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  soc: qcom: geni-se:
  fix array underflow in geni_se_clk_tbl_get()  This loop is supposed to break if the frequency
  returned from clk_round_rate() is the same as on the previous iteration.  However, that check
  doesn''t make sense on the first iteration through the loop. It leads to reading before the
  start of these->clk_perf_tbl[] array.'
