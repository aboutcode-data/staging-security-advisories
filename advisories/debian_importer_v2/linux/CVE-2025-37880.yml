  - CVE-2025-37880
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  um: work around
  sched_yield not yielding in time-travel mode  sched_yield by a userspace may not actually
  cause scheduling in time-travel mode as no time has passed. In the case seen it appears to
  be a badly implemented userspace spinlock in ASAN. Unfortunately, with time-travel it causes
  an extreme slowdown or even deadlock depending on the kernel configuration (CONFIG_UML_MAX_USERSPACE_ITERATIONS).  Work
  around it by accounting time to the process whenever it executes a sched_yield syscall.'
