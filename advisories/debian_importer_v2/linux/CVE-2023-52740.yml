summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powerpc/64s/interrupt:
  Fix interrupt exit race with security mitigation switch  The RFI and STF security mitigation
  options can flip the interrupt_exit_not_reentrant static branch condition concurrently with
  the interrupt exit code which tests that branch.  Interrupt exit tests this condition to set
  MSR[EE|RI] for exit, then again in the case a soft-masked interrupt is found pending, to recover
  the MSR so the interrupt can be replayed before attempting to exit again. If the condition
  changes between these two tests, the MSR and irq soft-mask state will become corrupted, leading
  to warnings and possible crashes. For example, if the branch is initially true then false,
  MSR[EE] will be 0 but PACA_IRQ_HARD_DIS clear and EE may not get enabled, leading to warnings
  in irq_64.c.'
