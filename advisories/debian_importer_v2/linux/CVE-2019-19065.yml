  - CVE-2019-19065
summary: 'A memory leak in the sdma_init() function in drivers/infiniband/hw/hfi1/sdma.c in
  the Linux kernel before 5.3.9 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption)
  by triggering rhashtable_init() failures, aka CID-34b3be18a04e. NOTE: This has been disputed
  as not a vulnerability because "rhashtable_init() can only fail if it is passed invalid values
  in the second parameter''s struct, but when invoked from sdma_init() that is a pointer to
  a static const struct, so an attacker could only trigger failure if they could corrupt kernel
  memory (in which case a small memory leak is not a significant problem).'
