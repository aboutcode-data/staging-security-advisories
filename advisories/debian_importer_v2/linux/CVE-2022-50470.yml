summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xhci: Remove
  device endpoints from bandwidth list when freeing the device  Endpoints are normally deleted
  from the bandwidth list when they are dropped, before the virt device is freed.  If xHC host
  is dying or being removed then the endpoints aren''t dropped cleanly due to functions returning
  early to avoid interacting with a non-accessible host controller.  So check and delete endpoints
  that are still on the bandwidth list when freeing the virt device.  Solves a list_del corruption
  kernel crash when unbinding xhci-pci, caused by xhci_mem_cleanup() when it later tried to
  delete already freed endpoints from the bandwidth list.  This only affects hosts that use
  software bandwidth checking, which currenty is only the xHC in intel Panther Point PCH (Ivy
  Bridge)'
