  - CVE-2023-52494
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bus: mhi: host:
  Add alignment check for event ring read pointer  Though we do check the event ring read pointer
  by "is_valid_ring_ptr" to make sure it is in the buffer range, but there is another risk the
  pointer may be not aligned.  Since we are expecting event ring elements are 128 bits(struct
  mhi_ring_element) aligned, an unaligned read pointer could lead to multiple issues like DoS
  or ring buffer memory corruption.  So add a alignment check for event ring read pointer.'
