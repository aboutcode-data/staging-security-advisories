summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  platform/x86:
  toshiba_haps: Fix memory leaks in add/remove routines  toshiba_haps_add() leaks the haps object
  allocated by it if it returns an error after allocating that object successfully.  toshiba_haps_remove()
  does not free the object pointed to by toshiba_haps before clearing that pointer, so it becomes
  unreachable allocated memory.  Address these memory leaks by using devm_kzalloc() for allocating
  the memory in question.'
