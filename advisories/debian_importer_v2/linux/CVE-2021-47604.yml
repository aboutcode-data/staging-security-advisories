  - CVE-2021-47604
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vduse: check
  that offset is within bounds in get_config()  This condition checks "len" but it does not
  check "offset" and that could result in an out of bounds read if "offset > dev->config_size".
  The problem is that since both variables are unsigned the "dev->config_size - offset" subtraction
  would result in a very high unsigned value.  I think these checks might not be necessary because
  "len" and "offset" are supposed to already have been validated using the vhost_vdpa_config_validate()
  function.  But I do not know the code perfectly, and I like to be safe.'
