  - CVE-2019-16230
summary: 'drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/radeon_display.c in the Linux kernel 5.2.14 does not check
  the alloc_workqueue return value, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. NOTE: A third-party
  software maintainer states that the work queue allocation is happening during device initialization,
  which for a graphics card occurs during boot. It is not attacker controllable and OOM at that
  time is highly unlikely'
