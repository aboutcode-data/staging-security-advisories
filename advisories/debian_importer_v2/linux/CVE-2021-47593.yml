summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mptcp: clear
  ''kern'' flag from fallback sockets  The mptcp ULP extension relies on sk->sk_sock_kern being
  set correctly: It prevents setsockopt(fd, IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_ULP, "mptcp", 6); from working
  for plain tcp sockets (any userspace-exposed socket).  But in case of fallback, accept() can
  return a plain tcp sk. In such case, sk is still tagged as ''kernel'' and setsockopt will
  work.  This will crash the kernel, The subflow extension has a NULL ctx->conn mptcp socket:  BUG:
  KASAN: null-ptr-deref in subflow_data_ready+0x181/0x2b0 Call Trace:  tcp_data_ready+0xf8/0x370  [..]'
