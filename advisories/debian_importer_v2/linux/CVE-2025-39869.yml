summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dmaengine: ti:
  edma: Fix memory allocation size for queue_priority_map  Fix a critical memory allocation
  bug in edma_setup_from_hw() where queue_priority_map was allocated with insufficient memory.
  The code declared queue_priority_map as s8 (*)[2] (pointer to array of 2 s8), but allocated
  memory using sizeof(s8) instead of the correct size.  This caused out-of-bounds memory writes
  when accessing:   queue_priority_map[i][0] = i;   queue_priority_map[i][1] = i;  The bug manifested
  as kernel crashes with "Oops - undefined instruction" on ARM platforms (BeagleBoard-X15) during
  EDMA driver probe, as the memory corruption triggered kernel hardening features on Clang.  Change
  the allocation to use sizeof(*queue_priority_map) which automatically gets the correct size
  for the 2D array structure.'
