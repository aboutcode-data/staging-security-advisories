summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: usb: lan78xx:
  Fix double free issue with interrupt buffer allocation  In lan78xx_probe(), the buffer `buf`
  was being freed twice: once implicitly through `usb_free_urb(dev->urb_intr)` with the `URB_FREE_BUFFER`
  flag and again explicitly by `kfree(buf)`. This caused a double free issue.  To resolve this,
  reordered `kmalloc()` and `usb_alloc_urb()` calls to simplify the initialization sequence
  and removed the redundant `kfree(buf)`.  Now, `buf` is allocated after `usb_alloc_urb()`,
  ensuring it is correctly managed by  `usb_fill_int_urb()` and freed by `usb_free_urb()` as
  intended.'
