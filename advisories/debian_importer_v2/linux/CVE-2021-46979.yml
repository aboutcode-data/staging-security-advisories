  - CVE-2021-46979
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iio: core: fix
  ioctl handlers removal  Currently ioctl handlers are removed twice. For the first time during
  iio_device_unregister() then later on inside iio_device_unregister_eventset() and iio_buffers_free_sysfs_and_mask().
  Double free leads to kernel panic.  Fix this by not touching ioctl handlers list directly
  but rather letting code responsible for registration call the matching cleanup routine itself.'
