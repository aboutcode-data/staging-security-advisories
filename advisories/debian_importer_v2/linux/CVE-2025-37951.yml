summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/v3d: Add
  job to pending list if the reset was skipped  When a CL/CSD job times out, we check if the
  GPU has made any progress since the last timeout. If so, instead of resetting the hardware,
  we skip the reset and let the timer get rearmed. This gives long-running jobs a chance to
  complete.  However, when `timedout_job()` is called, the job in question is removed from the
  pending list, which means it won''t be automatically freed through `free_job()`. Consequently,
  when we skip the reset and keep the job running, the job won''t be freed when it finally completes.  This
  situation leads to a memory leak, as exposed in [1] and [2].  Similarly to commit 704d3d60fec4
  ("drm/etnaviv: don''t block scheduler when GPU is still active"), this patch ensures the job
  is put back on the pending list when extending the timeout.'
