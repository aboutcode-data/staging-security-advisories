summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: SVM: Make
  sure GHCB is mapped before updating  Access to the GHCB is mainly in the VMGEXIT path and
  it is known that the GHCB will be mapped. But there are two paths where it is possible the
  GHCB might not be mapped.  The sev_vcpu_deliver_sipi_vector() routine will update the GHCB
  to inform the caller of the AP Reset Hold NAE event that a SIPI has been delivered. However,
  if a SIPI is performed without a corresponding AP Reset Hold, then the GHCB might not be mapped
  (depending on the previous VMEXIT), which will result in a NULL pointer dereference.  The
  svm_complete_emulated_msr() routine will update the GHCB to inform the caller of a RDMSR/WRMSR
  operation about any errors. While it is likely that the GHCB will be mapped in this situation,
  add a safe guard in this path to be certain a NULL pointer dereference is not encountered.'
