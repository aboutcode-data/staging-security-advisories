  - CVE-2025-68185
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfs4_setup_readdir():
  insufficient locking for ->d_parent->d_inode dereferencing  Theoretically it''s an oopsable
  race, but I don''t believe one can manage to hit it on real hardware; might become doable
  on a KVM, but it still won''t be easy to attack.  Anyway, it''s easy to deal with - since
  xdr_encode_hyper() is just a call of put_unaligned_be64(), we can put that under ->d_lock
  and be done with that.'
