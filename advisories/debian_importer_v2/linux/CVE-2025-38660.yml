summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  [ceph] parse_longname():
  strrchr() expects NUL-terminated string  ... and parse_longname() is not guaranteed that.  That''s
  the reason why it uses kmemdup_nul() to build the argument for kstrtou64(); the problem is,
  kstrtou64() is not the only thing that need it.  Just get a NUL-terminated copy of the entire
  thing and be done with that...'
