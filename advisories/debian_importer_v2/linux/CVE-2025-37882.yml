summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: xhci: Fix
  isochronous Ring Underrun/Overrun event handling  The TRB pointer of these events points at
  enqueue at the time of error occurrence on xHCI 1.1+ HCs or it''s NULL on older ones. By the
  time we are handling the event, a new TD may be queued at this ring position.  I can trigger
  this race by rising interrupt moderation to increase IRQ handling delay. Similar delay may
  occur naturally due to system load.  If this ever happens after a Missed Service Error, missed
  TDs will be skipped and the new TD processed as if it matched the event. It could be given
  back prematurely, risking data loss or buffer UAF by the xHC.  Don''t complete TDs on xrun
  events and don''t warn if queued TDs don''t match the event''s TRB pointer, which can be NULL
  or a link/no-op TRB. Don''t warn if there are no queued TDs at all.  Now that it''s safe,
  also handle xrun events if the skip flag is clear. This ensures completion of any TD stuck
  in ''error mid TD'' state right before the xrun event, which could happen if a driver submits
  a finite number of URBs to a buggy HC and then an error occurs on the last TD.'
