summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: Get runtime
  PM before walking tree for clk_summary  Similar to the previous commit, we should make sure
  that all devices are runtime resumed before printing the clk_summary through debugfs. Failure
  to do so would result in a deadlock if the thread is resuming a device to print clk state
  and that device is also runtime resuming in another thread, e.g the screen is turning on and
  the display driver is starting up. We remove the calls to clk_pm_runtime_{get,put}() in this
  path because they''re superfluous now that we know the devices are runtime resumed. This also
  squashes a bug where the return value of clk_pm_runtime_get() wasn''t checked, leading to
  an RPM count underflow on error paths.'
