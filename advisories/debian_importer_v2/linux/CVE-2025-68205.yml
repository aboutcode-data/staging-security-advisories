summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: hda/hdmi:
  Fix breakage at probing nvhdmi-mcp driver  After restructuring and splitting the HDMI codec
  driver code, each HDMI codec driver contains the own build_controls and build_pcms ops. A
  copy-n-paste error put the wrong entries for nvhdmi-mcp driver; both build_controls and build_pcms
  are swapped.  Unfortunately both callbacks have the very same form, and the compiler didn''t
  complain it, either.  This resulted in a NULL dereference because the PCM instance hasn''t
  been initialized at calling the build_controls callback.  Fix it by passing the proper entries.'
