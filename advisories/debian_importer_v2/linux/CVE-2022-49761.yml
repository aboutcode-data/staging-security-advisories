summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: always
  report error in run_one_delayed_ref()  Currently we have a btrfs_debug() for run_one_delayed_ref()
  failure, but if end users hit such problem, there will be no chance that btrfs_debug() is
  enabled.  This can lead to very little useful info for debugging.  This patch will:  - Add
  extra info for error reporting   Including:   * logical bytenr   * num_bytes   * type   *
  action   * ref_mod  - Replace the btrfs_debug() with btrfs_err()  - Move the error reporting
  into run_one_delayed_ref()   This is to avoid use-after-free, the @node can be freed in the
  caller.  This error should only be triggered at most once.  As if run_one_delayed_ref() failed,
  we trigger the error message, then causing the call chain to error out:  btrfs_run_delayed_refs()
  `- btrfs_run_delayed_refs()    `- btrfs_run_delayed_refs_for_head()       `- run_one_delayed_ref()  And
  we will abort the current transaction in btrfs_run_delayed_refs(). If we have to run delayed
  refs for the abort transaction, run_one_delayed_ref() will just cleanup the refs and do nothing,
  thus no new error messages would be output.'
