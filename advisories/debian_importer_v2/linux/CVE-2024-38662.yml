summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Allow delete
  from sockmap/sockhash only if update is allowed  We have seen an influx of syzkaller reports
  where a BPF program attached to a tracepoint triggers a locking rule violation by performing
  a map_delete on a sockmap/sockhash.  We don''t intend to support this artificial use scenario.
  Extend the existing verifier allowed-program-type check for updating sockmap/sockhash to also
  cover deleting from a map.  From now on only BPF programs which were previously allowed to
  update sockmap/sockhash can delete from these map types.'
