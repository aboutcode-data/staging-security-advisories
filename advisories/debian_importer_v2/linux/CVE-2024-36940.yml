  - CVE-2024-36940
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  pinctrl: core:
  delete incorrect free in pinctrl_enable()  The "pctldev" struct is allocated in devm_pinctrl_register_and_init().
  It''s a devm_ managed pointer that is freed by devm_pinctrl_dev_release(), so freeing it in
  pinctrl_enable() will lead to a double free.  The devm_pinctrl_dev_release() function frees
  the pindescs and destroys the mutex as well.'
