summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: ch9200:
  fix uninitialised access during mii_nway_restart  In mii_nway_restart() the code attempts
  to call mii->mdio_read which is ch9200_mdio_read(). ch9200_mdio_read() utilises a local buffer
  called "buff", which is initialised with control_read(). However "buff" is conditionally initialised
  inside control_read():          if (err == size) {                 memcpy(data, buf, size);         }  If
  the condition of "err == size" is not met, then "buff" remains uninitialised. Once this happens
  the uninitialised "buff" is accessed and returned during ch9200_mdio_read():          return
  (buff[0] | buff[1] << 8);  The problem stems from the fact that ch9200_mdio_read() ignores
  the return value of control_read(), leading to uinit-access of "buff".  To fix this we should
  check the return value of control_read() and return early on error.'
