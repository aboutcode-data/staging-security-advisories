summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  loop: Check for\
  \ overflow while configuring loop  The userspace can configure a loop using an ioctl call,\
  \ wherein a configuration of type loop_config is passed (see lo_ioctl()'s case on line 1550\
  \ of drivers/block/loop.c). This proceeds to call loop_configure() which in turn calls loop_set_status_from_info()\
  \ (see line 1050 of loop.c), passing &config->info which is of type loop_info64*. This function\
  \ then sets the appropriate values, like the offset.  loop_device has lo_offset of type loff_t\
  \ (see line 52 of loop.c), which is typdef-chained to long long, whereas loop_info64 has lo_offset\
  \ of type __u64 (see line 56 of include/uapi/linux/loop.h).  The function directly copies\
  \ offset from info to the device as follows (See line 980 of loop.c): \tlo->lo_offset = info->lo_offset;\
  \  This results in an overflow, which triggers a warning in iomap_iter() due to a call to\
  \ iomap_iter_done() which has: \tWARN_ON_ONCE(iter->iomap.offset > iter->pos);  Thus, check\
  \ for negative value during loop_set_status_from_info().  Bug report: https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?id=c620fe14aac810396d3c3edc9ad73848bf69a29e"
