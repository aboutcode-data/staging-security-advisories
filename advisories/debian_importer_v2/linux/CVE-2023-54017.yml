summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powerpc/pseries:
  fix possible memory leak in ibmebus_bus_init()  If device_register() returns error in ibmebus_bus_init(),
  name of kobject which is allocated in dev_set_name() called in device_add() is leaked.  As
  comment of device_add() says, it should call put_device() to drop the reference count that
  was set in device_initialize() when it fails, so the name can be freed in kobject_cleanup().'
