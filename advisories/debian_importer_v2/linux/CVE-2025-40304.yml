summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fbdev: Add bounds
  checking in bit_putcs to fix vmalloc-out-of-bounds  Add bounds checking to prevent writes
  past framebuffer boundaries when rendering text near screen edges. Return early if the Y position
  is off-screen and clip image height to screen boundary. Break from the rendering loop if the
  X position is off-screen. When clipping image width to fit the screen, update the character
  count to match the clipped width to prevent buffer size mismatches.  Without the character
  count update, bit_putcs_aligned and bit_putcs_unaligned receive mismatched parameters where
  the buffer is allocated for the clipped width but cnt reflects the original larger count,
  causing out-of-bounds writes.'
