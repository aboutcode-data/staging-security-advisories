summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cachestat: do
  not flush stats in recency check  syzbot detects that cachestat() is flushing stats, which
  can sleep, in its RCU read section (see [1]).  This is done in the workingset_test_recent()
  step (which checks if the folio''s eviction is recent).  Move the stat flushing step to before
  the RCU read section of cachestat, and skip stat flushing during the recency check.  [1]:
