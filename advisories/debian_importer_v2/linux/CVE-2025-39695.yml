summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/rxe: Flush
  delayed SKBs while releasing RXE resources  When skb packets are sent out, these skb packets
  still depends on the rxe resources, for example, QP, sk, when these packets are destroyed.  If
  these rxe resources are released when the skb packets are destroyed, the call traces will
  appear.  To avoid skb packets hang too long time in some network devices, a timestamp is added
  when these skb packets are created. If these skb packets hang too long time in network devices,
  these network devices can free these skb packets to release rxe resources.'
