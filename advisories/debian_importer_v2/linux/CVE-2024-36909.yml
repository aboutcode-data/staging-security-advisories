summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Drivers: hv:
  vmbus: Don''t free ring buffers that couldn''t be re-encrypted  In CoCo VMs it is possible
  for the untrusted host to cause set_memory_encrypted() or set_memory_decrypted() to fail such
  that an error is returned and the resulting memory is shared. Callers need to take care to
  handle these errors to avoid returning decrypted (shared) memory to the page allocator, which
  could lead to functional or security issues.  The VMBus ring buffer code could free decrypted/shared
  pages if set_memory_decrypted() fails. Check the decrypted field in the struct vmbus_gpadl
  for the ring buffers to decide whether to free the memory.'
