summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: airoha:
  fix potential use-after-free in airoha_npu_get()  np->name was being used after calling of_node_put(np),
  which releases the node and can lead to a use-after-free bug. Previously, of_node_put(np)
  was called unconditionally after of_find_device_by_node(np), which could result in a use-after-free
  if pdev is NULL.  This patch moves of_node_put(np) after the error check to ensure the node
  is only released after both the error and success cases are handled appropriately, preventing
  potential resource issues.'
