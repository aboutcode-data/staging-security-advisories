summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommu/vt-d: Fix
  potential memory leak in intel_setup_irq_remapping()  After commit e3beca48a45b ("irqdomain/treewide:
  Keep firmware node unconditionally allocated"). For tear down scenario, fn is only freed after
  fail to allocate ir_domain, though it also should be freed in case dmar_enable_qi returns
  error.  Besides free fn, irq_domain and ir_msi_domain need to be removed as well if intel_setup_irq_remapping
  fails to enable queued invalidation.  Improve the rewinding path by add out_free_ir_domain
  and out_free_fwnode lables per Baolu''s suggestion.'
