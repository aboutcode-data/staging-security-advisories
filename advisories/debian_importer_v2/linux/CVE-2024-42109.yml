summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: nf_tables:
  unconditionally flush pending work before notifier  syzbot reports:  KASAN: slab-uaf in nft_ctx_update
  include/net/netfilter/nf_tables.h:1831 KASAN: slab-uaf in nft_commit_release net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c:9530
  KASAN: slab-uaf int nf_tables_trans_destroy_work+0x152b/0x1750 net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c:9597
  Read of size 2 at addr ffff88802b0051c4 by task kworker/1:1/45 [..] Workqueue: events nf_tables_trans_destroy_work
  Call Trace:  nft_ctx_update include/net/netfilter/nf_tables.h:1831 [inline]  nft_commit_release
  net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c:9530 [inline]  nf_tables_trans_destroy_work+0x152b/0x1750 net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c:9597  Problem
  is that the notifier does a conditional flush, but its possible that the table-to-be-removed
  is still referenced by transactions being processed by the worker, so we need to flush unconditionally.  We
  could make the flush_work depend on whether we found a table to delete in nf-next to avoid
  the flush for most cases.  AFAICS this problem is only exposed in nf-next, with commit e169285f8c56
  ("netfilter: nf_tables: do not store nft_ctx in transaction objects"), with this commit applied
  there is an unconditional fetch of table->family which is whats triggering the above splat.'
