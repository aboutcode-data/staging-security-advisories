summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  spi: tegra210-quad:
  Protect curr_xfer in tegra_qspi_combined_seq_xfer  The curr_xfer field is read by the IRQ
  handler without holding the lock to check if a transfer is in progress. When clearing curr_xfer
  in the combined sequence transfer loop, protect it with the spinlock to prevent a race with
  the interrupt handler.  Protect the curr_xfer clearing at the exit path of tegra_qspi_combined_seq_xfer()
  with the spinlock to prevent a race with the interrupt handler that reads this field.  Without
  this protection, the IRQ handler could read a partially updated curr_xfer value, leading to
  NULL pointer dereference or use-after-free.'
