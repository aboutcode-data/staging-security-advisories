summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tools/power turbostat:
  Fix offset overflow issue in index converting  The idx_to_offset() function returns type int
  (32-bit signed), but MSR_PKG_ENERGY_STAT is u32 and would be interpreted as a negative number.
  The end result is that it hits the if (offset < 0) check in update_msr_sum() which prevents
  the timer callback from updating the stat in the background when long durations are used.
  The similar issue exists in offset_to_idx() and update_msr_sum(). Fix this issue by converting
  the ''int'' to ''off_t'' accordingly.'
