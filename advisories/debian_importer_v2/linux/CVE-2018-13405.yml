  - CVE-2018-13405
summary: The inode_init_owner function in fs/inode.c in the Linux kernel through 3.16 allows
  local users to create files with an unintended group ownership, in a scenario where a directory
  is SGID to a certain group and is writable by a user who is not a member of that group. Here,
  the non-member can trigger creation of a plain file whose group ownership is that group. The
  intended behavior was that the non-member can trigger creation of a directory (but not a plain
  file) whose group ownership is that group. The non-member can escalate privileges by making
  the plain file executable and SGID.
