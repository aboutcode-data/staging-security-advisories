  - CVE-2022-50489
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/mipi-dsi:
  Detach devices when removing the host  Whenever the MIPI-DSI host is unregistered, the code
  of mipi_dsi_host_unregister() loops over every device currently found on that bus and will
  unregister it.  However, it doesn''t detach it from the bus first, which leads to all kind
  of resource leaks if the host wants to perform some clean up whenever a device is detached.'
