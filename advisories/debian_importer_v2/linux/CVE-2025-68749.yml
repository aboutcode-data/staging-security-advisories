summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  accel/ivpu: Fix
  race condition when unbinding BOs  Fix ''Memory manager not clean during takedown'' warning
  that occurs when ivpu_gem_bo_free() removes the BO from the BOs list before it gets unmapped.
  Then file_priv_unbind() triggers a warning in drm_mm_takedown() during context teardown.  Protect
  the unmapping sequence with bo_list_lock to ensure the BO is always fully unmapped when removed
  from the list. This ensures the BO is either fully unmapped at context teardown time or present
  on the list and unmapped by file_priv_unbind().'
