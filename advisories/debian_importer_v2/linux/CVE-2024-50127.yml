  - CVE-2024-50127
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: sched: fix
  use-after-free in taprio_change()  In ''taprio_change()'', ''admin'' pointer may become dangling
  due to sched switch / removal caused by ''advance_sched()'', and critical section protected
  by ''q->current_entry_lock'' is too small to prevent from such a scenario (which causes use-after-free
  detected by KASAN). Fix this by prefer ''rcu_replace_pointer()'' over ''rcu_assign_pointer()''
  to update ''admin'' immediately before an attempt to schedule freeing.'
