summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dm rq: don''t
  queue request to blk-mq during DM suspend  DM uses blk-mq''s quiesce/unquiesce to stop/start
  device mapper queue.  But blk-mq''s unquiesce may come from outside events, such as elevator
  switch, updating nr_requests or others, and request may come during suspend, so simply ask
  for blk-mq to requeue it.  Fixes one kernel panic issue when running updating nr_requests
  and dm-mpath suspend/resume stress test.'
