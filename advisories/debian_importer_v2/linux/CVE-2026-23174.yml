summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nvme-pci: handle
  changing device dma map requirements  The initial state of dma_needs_unmap may be false, but
  change to true while mapping the data iterator. Enabling swiotlb is one such case that can
  change the result. The nvme driver needs to save the mapped dma vectors to be unmapped later,
  so allocate as needed during iteration rather than assume it was always allocated at the beginning.
  This fixes a NULL dereference from accessing an uninitialized dma_vecs when the device dma
  unmapping requirements change mid-iteration.'
