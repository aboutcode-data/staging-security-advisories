summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/huge_memory:
  drop beyond-EOF folios with the right number of refs  When an after-split folio is large and
  needs to be dropped due to EOF, folio_put_refs(folio, folio_nr_pages(folio)) should be used
  to drop all page cache refs.  Otherwise, the folio will not be freed, causing memory leak.  This
  leak would happen on a filesystem with blocksize > page_size and a truncate is performed,
  where the blocksize makes folios split to >0 order ones, causing truncated folios not being
  freed.'
