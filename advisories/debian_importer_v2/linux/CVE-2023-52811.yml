summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: ibmvfc:
  Remove BUG_ON in the case of an empty event pool  In practice the driver should never send
  more commands than are allocated to a queue''s event pool. In the unlikely event that this
  happens, the code asserts a BUG_ON, and in the case that the kernel is not configured to crash
  on panic returns a junk event pointer from the empty event list causing things to spiral from
  there. This BUG_ON is a historical artifact of the ibmvfc driver first being upstreamed, and
  it is well known now that the use of BUG_ON is bad practice except in the most unrecoverable
  scenario. There is nothing about this scenario that prevents the driver from recovering and
  carrying on.  Remove the BUG_ON in question from ibmvfc_get_event() and return a NULL pointer
  in the case of an empty event pool. Update all call sites to ibmvfc_get_event() to check for
  a NULL pointer and perfrom the appropriate failure or recovery action.'
