summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: netconsole:
  fix wrong warning  A warning is triggered when there is insufficient space in the buffer for
  userdata. However, this is not an issue since userdata will be sent in the next iteration.  Current
  warning message:      ------------[ cut here ]------------      WARNING: CPU: 13 PID: 3013042
  at drivers/net/netconsole.c:1122 write_ext_msg+0x3b6/0x3d0       ? write_ext_msg+0x3b6/0x3d0       console_flush_all+0x1e9/0x330  The
  code incorrectly issues a warning when this_chunk is zero, which is a valid scenario. The
  warning should only be triggered when this_chunk is negative.'
