summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/mlx5e: Skip
  restore TC rules for vport rep without loaded flag  During driver unload, unregister_netdev
  is called after unloading vport rep. So, the mlx5e_rep_priv is already freed while trying
  to get rpriv->netdev, or walk rpriv->tc_ht, which results in use-after-free. So add the checking
  to make sure access the data of vport rep which is still loaded.'
