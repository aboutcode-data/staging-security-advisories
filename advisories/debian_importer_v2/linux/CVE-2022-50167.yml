summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: fix potential
  32-bit overflow when accessing ARRAY map element  If BPF array map is bigger than 4GB, element
  pointer calculation can overflow because both index and elem_size are u32. Fix this everywhere
  by forcing 64-bit multiplication. Extract this formula into separate small helper and use
  it consistently in various places.  Speculative-preventing formula utilizing index_mask trick
  is left as is, but explicit u64 casts are added in both places.'
