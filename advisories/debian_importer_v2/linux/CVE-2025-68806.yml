summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ksmbd: fix buffer
  validation by including null terminator size in EA length  The smb2_set_ea function, which
  handles Extended Attributes (EA), was performing buffer validation checks that incorrectly
  omitted the size of the null terminating character (+1 byte) for EA Name. This patch fixes
  the issue by explicitly adding ''+ 1'' to EaNameLength where the null terminator is expected
  to be present in the buffer, ensuring the validation accurately reflects the total required
  buffer size.'
