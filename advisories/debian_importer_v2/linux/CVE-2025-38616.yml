summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tls: handle data
  disappearing from under the TLS ULP  TLS expects that it owns the receive queue of the TCP
  socket. This cannot be guaranteed in case the reader of the TCP socket entered before the
  TLS ULP was installed, or uses some non-standard read API (eg. zerocopy ones). Replace the
  WARN_ON() and a buggy early exit (which leaves anchor pointing to a freed skb) with real error
  handling. Wipe the parsing state and tell the reader to retry.  We already reload the anchor
  every time we (re)acquire the socket lock, so the only condition we need to avoid is an out
  of bounds read (not having enough bytes in the socket for previously parsed record len).  If
  some data was read from under TLS but there''s enough in the queue we''ll reload and decrypt
  what is most likely not a valid TLS record. Leading to some undefined behavior from TLS perspective
  (corrupting a stream? missing an alert? missing an attack?) but no kernel crash should take
  place.'
