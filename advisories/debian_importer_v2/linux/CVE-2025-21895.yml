summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  perf/core: Order
  the PMU list to fix warning about unordered pmu_ctx_list  Syskaller triggers a warning due
  to prev_epc->pmu != next_epc->pmu in perf_event_swap_task_ctx_data(). vmcore shows that two
  lists have the same perf_event_pmu_context, but not in the same order.  The problem is that
  the order of pmu_ctx_list for the parent is impacted by the time when an event/PMU is added.
  While the order for a child is impacted by the event order in the pinned_groups and flexible_groups.
  So the order of pmu_ctx_list in the parent and child may be different.  To fix this problem,
  insert the perf_event_pmu_context to its proper place after iteration of the pmu_ctx_list.  The
  follow testcase can trigger above warning:   # perf record -e cycles --call-graph lbr -- taskset
  -c 3 ./a.out &  # perf stat -e cpu-clock,cs -p xxx // xxx is the pid of a.out   test.c   void
  main() {         int count = 0;         pid_t pid;          printf("%d running\n", getpid());         sleep(30);         printf("running\n");          pid
  = fork();         if (pid == -1) {                 printf("fork error\n");                 return;         }         if
  (pid == 0) {                 while (1) {                         count++;                 }         }
  else {                 while (1) {                         count++;                 }         }  }  The
  testcase first opens an LBR event, so it will allocate task_ctx_data, and then open tracepoint
  and software events, so the parent context will have 3 different perf_event_pmu_contexts.
  On inheritance, child ctx will insert the perf_event_pmu_context in another order and the
  warning will trigger.  [ mingo: Tidied up the changelog. ]'
