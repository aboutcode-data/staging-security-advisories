summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  perf/core: Handle
  buffer mapping fail correctly in perf_mmap()  After successful allocation of a buffer or a
  successful attachment to an existing buffer perf_mmap() tries to map the buffer read only
  into the page table. If that fails, the already set up page table entries are zapped, but
  the other perf specific side effects of that failure are not handled.  The calling code just
  cleans up the VMA and does not invoke perf_mmap_close().  This leaks reference counts, corrupts
  user->vm accounting and also results in an unbalanced invocation of event::event_mapped().  Cure
  this by moving the event::event_mapped() invocation before the map_range() call so that on
  map_range() failure perf_mmap_close() can be invoked without causing an unbalanced event::event_unmapped()
  call.  perf_mmap_close() undoes the reference counts and eventually frees buffers.'
