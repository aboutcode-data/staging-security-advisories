summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  s390/dasd: fix
  Oops in dasd_alias_get_start_dev due to missing pavgroup  Fix Oops in dasd_alias_get_start_dev()
  function caused by the pavgroup pointer being NULL.  The pavgroup pointer is checked on the
  entrance of the function but without the lcu->lock being held. Therefore there is a race window
  between dasd_alias_get_start_dev() and _lcu_update() which sets pavgroup to NULL with the
  lcu->lock held.  Fix by checking the pavgroup pointer with lcu->lock held.'
