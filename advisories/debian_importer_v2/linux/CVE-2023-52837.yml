summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nbd: fix uaf
  in nbd_open  Commit 4af5f2e03013 ("nbd: use blk_mq_alloc_disk and blk_cleanup_disk") cleans
  up disk by blk_cleanup_disk() and it won''t set disk->private_data as NULL as before. UAF
  may be triggered in nbd_open() if someone tries to open nbd device right after nbd_put() since
  nbd has been free in nbd_dev_remove().  Fix this by implementing ->free_disk and free private
  data in it.'
