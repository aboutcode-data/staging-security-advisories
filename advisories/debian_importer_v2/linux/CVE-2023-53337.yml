summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: do not
  write dirty data after degenerating to read-only  According to syzbot''s report, mark_buffer_dirty()
  called from nilfs_segctor_do_construct() outputs a warning with some patterns after nilfs2
  detects metadata corruption and degrades to read-only mode.  After such read-only degeneration,
  page cache data may be cleared through nilfs_clear_dirty_page() which may also clear the uptodate
  flag for their buffer heads.  However, even after the degeneration, log writes are still performed
  by unmount processing etc., which causes mark_buffer_dirty() to be called for buffer heads
  without the "uptodate" flag and causes the warning.  Since any writes should not be done to
  a read-only file system in the first place, this fixes the warning in mark_buffer_dirty()
  by letting nilfs_segctor_do_construct() abort early if in read-only mode.  This also changes
  the retry check of nilfs_segctor_write_out() to avoid unnecessary log write retries if it
  detects -EROFS that nilfs_segctor_do_construct() returned.'
