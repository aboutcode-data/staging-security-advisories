summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/vmwgfx: Fix
  prime with external buffers  Make sure that for external buffers mapping goes through the
  dma_buf interface instead of trying to access pages directly.  External buffers might not
  provide direct access to readable/writable pages so to make sure the bo''s created from external
  dma_bufs can be read dma_buf interface has to be used.  Fixes crashes in IGT''s kms_prime
  with vgem. Regular desktop usage won''t trigger this due to the fact that virtual machines
  will not have multiple GPUs but it enables better test coverage in IGT.'
