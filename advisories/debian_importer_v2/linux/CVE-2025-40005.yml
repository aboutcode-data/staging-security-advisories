summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  spi: cadence-quadspi:
  Implement refcount to handle unbind during busy  driver support indirect read and indirect
  write operation with assumption no force device removal(unbind) operation. However force device
  removal(removal) is still available to root superuser.  Unbinding driver during operation
  causes kernel crash. This changes ensure driver able to handle such operation for indirect
