summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  phy: tegra: xusb:
  Fix unbalanced regulator disable in UTMI PHY mode  When transitioning from USB_ROLE_DEVICE
  to USB_ROLE_NONE, the code assumed that the regulator should be disabled. However, if the
  regulator is marked as always-on, regulator_is_enabled() continues to return true, leading
  to an incorrect attempt to disable a regulator which is not enabled.  This can result in warnings
  such as:  [  250.155624] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 7326 at drivers/regulator/core.c:3004 _regulator_disable+0xe4/0x1a0
  [  250.155652] unbalanced disables for VIN_SYS_5V0  To fix this, we move the regulator control
  logic into tegra186_xusb_padctl_id_override() function since it''s directly related to the
  ID override state. The regulator is now only disabled when the role transitions from USB_ROLE_HOST
  to USB_ROLE_NONE, by checking the VBUS_ID register. This ensures that regulator enable/disable
  operations are properly balanced and only occur when actually transitioning to/from host mode.'
