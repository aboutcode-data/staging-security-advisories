summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/xe: Use local
  fence in error path of xe_migrate_clear  The intent of the error path in xe_migrate_clear
  is to wait on locally generated fence and then return. The code is waiting on m->fence which
  could be the local fence but this is only stable under the job mutex leading to a possible
  UAF. Fix code to wait on local fence.  (cherry picked from commit 762b7e95362170b3e13a8704f38d5e47eca4ba74)'
