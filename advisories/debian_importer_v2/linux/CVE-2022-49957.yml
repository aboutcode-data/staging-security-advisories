summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  kcm: fix strp_init()
  order and cleanup  strp_init() is called just a few lines above this csk->sk_user_data check,
  it also initializes strp->work etc., therefore, it is unnecessary to call strp_done() to cancel
  the freshly initialized work.  And if sk_user_data is already used by KCM, psock->strp should
  not be touched, particularly strp->work state, so we need to move strp_init() after the csk->sk_user_data
  check.  This also makes a lockdep warning reported by syzbot go away.'
