summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: brcmfmac:
  cfg80211: Pass the PMK in binary instead of hex  Apparently the hex passphrase mechanism does
  not work on newer chips/firmware (e.g. BCM4387). It seems there was a simple way of passing
  it in binary all along, so use that and avoid the hexification.  OpenBSD has been doing it
  like this from the beginning, so this should work on all chips.  Also clear the structure
  before setting the PMK. This was leaking uninitialized stack contents to the device.'
