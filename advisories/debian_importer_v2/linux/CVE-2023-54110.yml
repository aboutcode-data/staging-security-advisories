  - CVE-2023-54110
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: rndis_host:
  Secure rndis_query check against int overflow  Variables off and len typed as uint32 in rndis_query
  function are controlled by incoming RNDIS response message thus their value may be manipulated.
  Setting off to a unexpectetly large value will cause the sum with len and 8 to overflow and
  pass the implemented validation step. Consequently the response pointer will be referring
  to a location past the expected buffer boundaries allowing information leakage e.g. via RNDIS_OID_802_3_PERMANENT_ADDRESS
  OID.'
