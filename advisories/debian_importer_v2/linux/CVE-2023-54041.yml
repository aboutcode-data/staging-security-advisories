summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring: fix
  memory leak when removing provided buffers  When removing provided buffers, io_buffer structs
  are not being disposed of, leading to a memory leak. They can''t be freed individually, because
  they are allocated in page-sized groups. They need to be added to some free list instead,
  such as io_buffers_cache. All callers already hold the lock protecting it, apart from when
  destroying buffers, so had to extend the lock there.'
