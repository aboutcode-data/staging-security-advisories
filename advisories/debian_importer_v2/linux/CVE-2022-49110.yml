summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: conntrack:
  revisit gc autotuning  as of commit 4608fdfc07e1 ("netfilter: conntrack: collect all entries
  in one cycle") conntrack gc was changed to run every 2 minutes.  On systems where conntrack
  hash table is set to large value, most evictions happen from gc worker rather than the packet
  path due to hash table distribution.  This causes netlink event overflows when events are
  collected.  This change collects average expiry of scanned entries and reschedules to the
  average remaining value, within 1 to 60 second interval.  To avoid event overflows, reschedule
  after each bucket and add a limit for both run time and number of evictions per run.  If more
  entries have to be evicted, reschedule and restart 1 jiffy into the future.'
