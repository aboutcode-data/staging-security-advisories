summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: xdp: Disallow
  attaching device-bound programs in generic mode  Device-bound programs are used to support
  RX metadata kfuncs. These kfuncs are driver-specific and rely on the driver context to read
  the metadata. This means they can''t work in generic XDP mode. However, there is no check
  to disallow such programs from being attached in generic mode, in which case the metadata
  kfuncs will be called in an invalid context, leading to crashes.  Fix this by adding a check
  to disallow attaching device-bound programs in generic mode.'
