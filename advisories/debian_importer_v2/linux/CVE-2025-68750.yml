summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: potential
  integer overflow in usbg_make_tpg()  The variable tpgt in usbg_make_tpg() is defined as unsigned
  long and is assigned to tpgt->tport_tpgt, which is defined as u16. This may cause an integer
  overflow when tpgt is greater than USHRT_MAX (65535). I haven''t tried to trigger it myself,
  but it is possible to trigger it by calling usbg_make_tpg() with a large value for tpgt.  I
  modified the type of tpgt to match tpgt->tport_tpgt and adjusted the relevant code accordingly.  This
  patch is similar to commit 59c816c1f24d ("vhost/scsi: potential memory corruption").'
