summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  most: usb: fix
  double free on late probe failure  The MOST subsystem has a non-standard registration function
  which frees the interface on registration failures and on deregistration.  This unsurprisingly
  leads to bugs in the MOST drivers, and a couple of recent changes turned a reference underflow
  and use-after-free in the USB driver into several double free and a use-after-free on late
  probe failures.'
