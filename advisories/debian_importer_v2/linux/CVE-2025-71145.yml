summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: phy: isp1301:
  fix non-OF device reference imbalance  A recent change fixing a device reference leak in a
  UDC driver introduced a potential use-after-free in the non-OF case as the isp1301_get_client()
  helper only increases the reference count for the returned I2C device in the OF case.  Increment
  the reference count also for non-OF so that the caller can decrement it unconditionally.  Note
  that this is inherently racy just as using the returned I2C device is since nothing is preventing
  the PHY driver from being unbound while in use.'
