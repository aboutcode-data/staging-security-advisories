summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tty: Fix out-of-bound
  vmalloc access in imageblit  This issue happens when a userspace program does an ioctl FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO
  passing the fb_var_screeninfo struct containing only the fields xres, yres, and bits_per_pixel
  with values.  If this struct is the same as the previous ioctl, the vc_resize() detects it
  and doesn''t call the resize_screen(), leaving the fb_var_screeninfo incomplete. And this
  leads to the updatescrollmode() calculates a wrong value to fbcon_display->vrows, which makes
  the real_y() return a wrong value of y, and that value, eventually, causes the imageblit to
  access an out-of-bound address value.  To solve this issue I made the resize_screen() be called
  even if the screen does not need any resizing, so it will "fix and fill" the fb_var_screeninfo
  independently.'
