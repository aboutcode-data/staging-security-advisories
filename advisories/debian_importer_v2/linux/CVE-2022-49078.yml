summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  lz4: fix LZ4_decompress_safe_partial
  read out of bound  When partialDecoding, it is EOF if we''ve either filled the output buffer
  or can''t proceed with reading an offset for following match.  In some extreme corner cases
  when compressed data is suitably corrupted, UAF will occur.  As reported by KASAN [1], LZ4_decompress_safe_partial
  may lead to read out of bound problem during decoding.  lz4 upstream has fixed it [2] and
  this issue has been disscussed here [3] before.  current decompression routine was ported
  from lz4 v1.8.3, bumping lib/lz4 to v1.9.+ is certainly a huge work to be done later, so,
  we''d better fix it first.  [1] https://lore.kernel.org/all/000000000000830d1205cf7f0477@google.com/
