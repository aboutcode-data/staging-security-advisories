summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: cfg80211:
  clear wdev->cqm_config pointer on free  When we free wdev->cqm_config when unregistering,
  we also need to clear out the pointer since the same wdev/netdev may get re-registered in
  another network namespace, then destroyed later, running this code again, which results in
  a double-free.'
