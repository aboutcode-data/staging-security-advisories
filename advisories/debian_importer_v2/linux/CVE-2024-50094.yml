summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sfc: Don''t invoke
  xdp_do_flush() from netpoll.  Yury reported a crash in the sfc driver originated from netpoll_send_udp().
  The netconsole sends a message and then netpoll invokes the driver''s NAPI function with a
  budget of zero. It is dedicated to allow driver to free TX resources, that it may have used
  while sending the packet.  In the netpoll case the driver invokes xdp_do_flush() unconditionally,
  leading to crash because bpf_net_context was never assigned.  Invoke xdp_do_flush() only if
  budget is not zero.'
