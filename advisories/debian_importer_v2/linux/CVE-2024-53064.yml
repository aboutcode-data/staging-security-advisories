summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  idpf: fix idpf_vc_core_init
  error path  In an event where the platform running the device control plane is rebooted, reset
  is detected on the driver. It releases all the resources and waits for the reset to complete.
  Once the reset is done, it tries to build the resources back. At this time if the device control
  plane is not yet started, then the driver timeouts on the virtchnl message and retries to
  establish the mailbox again.  In the retry flow, mailbox is deinitialized but the mailbox
  workqueue is still alive and polling for the mailbox message. This results in accessing the
  released control queue leading to null-ptr-deref. Fix it by unrolling the work queue cancellation
  and mailbox deinitialization in the reverse order which they got initialized.'
