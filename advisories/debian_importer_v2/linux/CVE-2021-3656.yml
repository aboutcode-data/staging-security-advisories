  - CVE-2021-3656
summary: A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization. The
  flaw occurs when processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest
  to spawn/handle a nested guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the "virt_ext" field, this
  issue could allow a malicious L1 to disable both VMLOAD/VMSAVE intercepts and VLS (Virtual
  VMLOAD/VMSAVE) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest would be allowed to read/write
  physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak of sensitive data
  or potential guest-to-host escape.
