summary: Closing of an event channel in the Linux kernel can result in a deadlock. This happens
  when the close is being performed in parallel to an unrelated Xen console action and the handling
  of a Xen console interrupt in an unprivileged guest.  The closing of an event channel is e.g.
  triggered by removal of a paravirtual device on the other side. As this action will cause
  console messages to be issued on the other side quite often, the chance of triggering the
  deadlock is not neglectable.  Note that 32-bit Arm-guests are not affected, as the 32-bit
  Linux kernel on Arm doesn't use queued-RW-locks, which are required to trigger the issue (on
  Arm32 a waiting writer doesn't block further readers to get the lock).
