summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mcb: fix error
  handling in mcb_alloc_bus()  There are two bugs: 1) If ida_simple_get() fails then this code
  calls put_device(carrier)    but we haven''t yet called get_device(carrier) and probably that    leads
  to a use after free. 2) After device_initialize() then we need to use put_device() to    release
  the bus.  This will free the internal resources tied to the    device and call mcb_free_bus()
  which will free the rest.'
