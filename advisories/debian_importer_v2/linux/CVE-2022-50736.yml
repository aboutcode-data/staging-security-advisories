summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/siw: Fix
  immediate work request flush to completion queue  Correctly set send queue element opcode
  during immediate work request flushing in post sendqueue operation, if the QP is in ERROR
  state. An undefined ocode value results in out-of-bounds access to an array for mapping the
  opcode between siw internal and RDMA core representation in work completion generation. It
  resulted in a KASAN BUG report of type ''global-out-of-bounds'' during NFSoRDMA testing.  This
  patch further fixes a potential case of a malicious user which may write undefined values
  for completion queue elements status or opcode, if the CQ is memory mapped to user land. It
  avoids the same out-of-bounds access to arrays for status and opcode mapping as described
  above.'
