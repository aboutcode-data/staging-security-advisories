summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: betop: check
  shape of output reports  betopff_init() only checks the total sum of the report counts for
  each report field to be at least 4, but hid_betopff_play() expects 4 report fields. A device
  advertising an output report with one field and 4 report counts would pass the check but crash
  the kernel with a NULL pointer dereference in hid_betopff_play().'
