  - CVE-2025-38297
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PM: EM: Fix potential
  division-by-zero error in em_compute_costs()  When the device is of a non-CPU type, table[i].performance
  won''t be initialized in the previous em_init_performance(), resulting in division by zero
  when calculating costs in em_compute_costs().  Since the ''cost'' algorithm is only used for
  EAS energy efficiency calculations and is currently not utilized by other device drivers,
  we should add the _is_cpu_device(dev) check to prevent this division-by-zero issue.'
