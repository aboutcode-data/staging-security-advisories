summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Revert "NFSD:
  Remove the cap on number of operations per NFSv4 COMPOUND"  I''ve found that pynfs COMP6 now
  leaves the connection or lease in a strange state, which causes CLOSE9 to hang indefinitely.
  I''ve dug into it a little, but I haven''t been able to root-cause it yet. However, I bisected
  to commit 48aab1606fa8 ("NFSD: Remove the cap on number of operations per NFSv4 COMPOUND").  Tianshuo
  Han also reports a potential vulnerability when decoding an NFSv4 COMPOUND. An attacker can
  place an arbitrarily large op count in the COMPOUND header, which results in:  [   51.410584]
  nfsd: vmalloc error: size 1209533382144, exceeds total pages, mode:0xdc0(GFP_KERNEL|__GFP_ZERO),
  nodemask=(null),cpuset=/,mems_allowed=0  when NFSD attempts to allocate the COMPOUND op array.  Let''s
  restore the operation-per-COMPOUND limit, but increased to 200 for now.'
