summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommu: Fix potential
  memory leak in iopf_queue_remove_device()  The iopf_queue_remove_device() helper removes a
  device from the per-iommu iopf queue when PRI is disabled on the device. It responds to all
  outstanding iopf''s with an IOMMU_PAGE_RESP_INVALID code and detaches the device from the
  queue.  However, it fails to release the group structure that represents a group of iopf''s
  awaiting for a response after responding to the hardware. This can cause a memory leak if
  iopf_queue_remove_device() is called with pending iopf''s.  Fix it by calling iopf_free_group()
  after the iopf group is responded.'
