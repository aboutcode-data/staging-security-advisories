summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: usb-audio:
  Fix potential overflow of PCM transfer buffer  The PCM stream data in USB-audio driver is
  transferred over USB URB packet buffers, and each packet size is determined dynamically.  The
  packet sizes are limited by some factors such as wMaxPacketSize USB descriptor.  OTOH, in
  the current code, the actually used packet sizes are determined only by the rate and the PPS,
  which may be bigger than the size limit above.  This results in a buffer overflow, as reported
  by syzbot.  Basically when the limit is smaller than the calculated packet size, it implies
  that something is wrong, most likely a weird USB descriptor.  So the best option would be
  just to return an error at the parameter setup time before doing any further operations.  This
  patch introduces such a sanity check, and returns -EINVAL when the packet size is greater
  than maxpacksize.  The comparison with ep->packsize[1] alone should suffice since it''s always
  equal or greater than ep->packsize[0].'
