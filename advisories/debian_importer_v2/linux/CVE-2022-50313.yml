summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  erofs: fix order
  >= MAX_ORDER warning due to crafted negative i_size  As syzbot reported [1], the root cause
  is that i_size field is a signed type, and negative i_size is also less than EROFS_BLKSIZ.
  As a consequence, it''s handled as fast symlink unexpectedly.  Let''s fall back to the generic
  path to deal with such unusual i_size.  [1] https://lore.kernel.org/r/000000000000ac8efa05e7feaa1f@google.com'
