  - CVE-2024-56561
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PCI: endpoint:
  Fix PCI domain ID release in pci_epc_destroy()  pci_epc_destroy() invokes pci_bus_release_domain_nr()
  to release the PCI domain ID, but there are two issues:    - ''epc->dev'' is passed to pci_bus_release_domain_nr()
  which was already     freed by device_unregister(), leading to a use-after-free issue.    -
  Domain ID corresponds to the EPC device parent, so passing ''epc->dev''     is also wrong.  Fix
  these issues by passing ''epc->dev.parent'' to pci_bus_release_domain_nr() and also do it
  before device_unregister().  [mani: reworded subject and description]'
