summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  kdb: Fix buffer
  overflow during tab-complete  Currently, when the user attempts symbol completion with the
  Tab key, kdb will use strncpy() to insert the completed symbol into the command buffer. Unfortunately
  it passes the size of the source buffer rather than the destination to strncpy() with predictably
  horrible results. Most obviously if the command buffer is already full but cp, the cursor
  position, is in the middle of the buffer, then we will write past the end of the supplied
  buffer.  Fix this by replacing the dubious strncpy() calls with memmove()/memcpy() calls plus
  explicit boundary checks to make sure we have enough space before we start moving characters
  around.'
