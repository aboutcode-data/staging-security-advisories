summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: lpfc: Fix
  buffer free/clear order in deferred receive path  Fix a use-after-free window by correcting
  the buffer release sequence in the deferred receive path. The code freed the RQ buffer first
  and only then cleared the context pointer under the lock. Concurrent paths (e.g., ABTS and
  the repost path) also inspect and release the same pointer under the lock, so the old order
  could lead to double-free/UAF.  Note that the repost path already uses the correct pattern:
  detach the pointer under the lock, then free it after dropping the lock. The deferred path
  should do the same.'
