summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bus: fsl-mc-bus:
  fix KASAN use-after-free in fsl_mc_bus_remove()  In fsl_mc_bus_remove(), mc->root_mc_bus_dev->mc_io
  is passed to fsl_destroy_mc_io(). However, mc->root_mc_bus_dev is already freed in fsl_mc_device_remove().
  Then reference to mc->root_mc_bus_dev->mc_io triggers KASAN use-after-free. To avoid the use-after-free,
  keep the reference to mc->root_mc_bus_dev->mc_io in a local variable and pass to fsl_destroy_mc_io().  This
  patch needs rework to apply to kernels older than v5.15.'
