summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ice: Fix improper
  extts handling  Extts events are disabled and enabled by the application ts2phc. However,
  in case where the driver is removed when the application is running, a specific extts event
  remains enabled and can cause a kernel crash. As a side effect, when the driver is reloaded
  and application is started again, remaining extts event for the channel from a previous run
  will keep firing and the message "extts on unexpected channel" might be printed to the user.  To
  avoid that, extts events shall be disabled when PTP is released.'
