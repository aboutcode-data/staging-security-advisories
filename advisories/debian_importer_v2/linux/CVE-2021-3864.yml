  - CVE-2021-3864
summary: A flaw was found in the way the dumpable flag setting was handled when certain SUID
  binaries executed its descendants. The prerequisite is a SUID binary that sets real UID equal
  to effective UID, and real GID equal to effective GID. The descendant will then have a dumpable
  value set to 1. As a result, if the descendant process crashes and core_pattern is set to
  a relative value, its core dump is stored in the current directory with uid:gid permissions.
  An unprivileged local user with eligible root SUID binary could use this flaw to place core
  dumps into root-owned directories, potentially resulting in escalation of privileges.
