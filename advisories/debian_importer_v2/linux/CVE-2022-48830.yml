summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: isotp: fix
  potential CAN frame reception race in isotp_rcv()  When receiving a CAN frame the current
  code logic does not consider concurrently receiving processes which do not show up in real
  world usage.  Ziyang Xuan writes:  The following syz problem is one of the scenarios. so->rx.len
  is changed by isotp_rcv_ff() during isotp_rcv_cf(), so->rx.len equals 0 before alloc_skb()
  and equals 4096 after alloc_skb(). That will trigger skb_over_panic() in skb_put().  =======================================================

  sure the state changes and data structures stay consistent at CAN frame reception time by
  adding a spin_lock in isotp_rcv(). This fixes the issue reported by syzkaller but does not
  affect real world operation.'
