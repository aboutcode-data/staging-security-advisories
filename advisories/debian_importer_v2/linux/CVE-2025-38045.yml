summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: iwlwifi:
  fix debug actions order  The order of actions taken for debug was implemented incorrectly.
  Now we implemented the dump split and do the FW reset only in the middle of the dump (rather
  than the FW killing itself on error.) As a result, some of the actions taken when applying
  the config will now crash the device, so we need to fix the order.'
