summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  hung_task: fix
  warnings caused by unaligned lock pointers  The blocker tracking mechanism assumes that lock
  pointers are at least 4-byte aligned to use their lower bits for type encoding.  However,
  as reported by Eero Tamminen, some architectures like m68k only guarantee 2-byte alignment
  of 32-bit values. This breaks the assumption and causes two related WARN_ON_ONCE checks to
  trigger.  To fix this, the runtime checks are adjusted to silently ignore any lock that is
  not 4-byte aligned, effectively disabling the feature in such cases and avoiding the related
  warnings.  Thanks to Geert Uytterhoeven for bisecting!'
