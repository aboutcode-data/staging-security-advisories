  - CVE-2025-68814
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring: fix
  filename leak in __io_openat_prep()   __io_openat_prep() allocates a struct filename using
  getname(). However, for the condition of the file being installed in the fixed file table
  as well as having O_CLOEXEC flag set, the function returns early. At that point, the request
  doesn''t have REQ_F_NEED_CLEANUP flag set. Due to this, the memory for the newly allocated
  struct filename is not cleaned up, causing a memory leak.  Fix this by setting the REQ_F_NEED_CLEANUP
  for the request just after the successful getname() call, so that when the request is torn
  down, the filename will be cleaned up, along with other resources needing cleanup.'
