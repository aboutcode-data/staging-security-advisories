summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  NFSv4/pNFS: Fix
  a race to wake on NFS_LAYOUT_DRAIN  We found a few different systems hung up in writeback
  waiting on the same page lock, and one task waiting on the NFS_LAYOUT_DRAIN bit in pnfs_update_layout(),
  however the pnfs_layout_hdr''s plh_outstanding count was zero.  It seems most likely that
  this is another race between the waiter and waker similar to commit ed0172af5d6f ("SUNRPC:
  Fix a race to wake a sync task"). Fix it up by applying the advised barrier.'
