summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath12k:
  Avoid NULL pointer access during management transmit cleanup  Currently ''ar'' reference is
  not added in skb_cb. Though this is generally not used during transmit completion callbacks,
  on interface removal the remaining idr cleanup callback uses the ar pointer from skb_cb from
  management txmgmt_idr. Hence fill them during transmit call for proper usage to avoid NULL
  pointer dereference.  Tested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.0.1-00029-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1'
