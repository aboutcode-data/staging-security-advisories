  - CVE-2014-4699
summary: The Linux kernel before 3.15.4 on Intel processors does not properly restrict use of
  a non-canonical value for the saved RIP address in the case of a system call that does not
  use IRET, which allows local users to leverage a race condition and gain privileges, or cause
  a denial of service (double fault), via a crafted application that makes ptrace and fork system
  calls.
