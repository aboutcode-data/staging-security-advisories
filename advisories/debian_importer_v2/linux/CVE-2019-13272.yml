  - CVE-2019-13272
summary: 'In the Linux kernel before 5.1.17, ptrace_link in kernel/ptrace.c mishandles the recording
  of the credentials of a process that wants to create a ptrace relationship, which allows local
  users to obtain root access by leveraging certain scenarios with a parent-child process relationship,
  where a parent drops privileges and calls execve (potentially allowing control by an attacker).
  One contributing factor is an object lifetime issue (which can also cause a panic). Another
  contributing factor is incorrect marking of a ptrace relationship as privileged, which is
  exploitable through (for example) Polkit''s pkexec helper with PTRACE_TRACEME. NOTE: SELinux
  deny_ptrace might be a usable workaround in some environments.'
