summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: can327:
  can327_feed_frame_to_netdev(): fix potential skb leak when netdev is down  In can327_feed_frame_to_netdev(),
  it did not free the skb when netdev is down, and all callers of can327_feed_frame_to_netdev()
  did not free allocated skb too. That would trigger skb leak.  Fix it by adding kfree_skb()
  in can327_feed_frame_to_netdev() when netdev is down. Not tested, just compiled.'
