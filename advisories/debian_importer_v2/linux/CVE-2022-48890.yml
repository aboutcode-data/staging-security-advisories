summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: storvsc:
  Fix swiotlb bounce buffer leak in confidential VM  storvsc_queuecommand() maps the scatter/gather
  list using scsi_dma_map(), which in a confidential VM allocates swiotlb bounce buffers. If
  the I/O submission fails in storvsc_do_io(), the I/O is typically retried by higher level
  code, but the bounce buffer memory is never freed.  The mostly like cause of I/O submission
  failure is a full VMBus channel ring buffer, which is not uncommon under high I/O loads.  Eventually
  enough bounce buffer memory leaks that the confidential VM can''t do any I/O. The same problem
  can arise in a non-confidential VM with kernel boot parameter swiotlb=force.  Fix this by
  doing scsi_dma_unmap() in the case of an I/O submission error, which frees the bounce buffer
  memory.'
