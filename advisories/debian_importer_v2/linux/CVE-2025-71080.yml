summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ipv6: fix a BUG
  in rt6_get_pcpu_route() under PREEMPT_RT  On PREEMPT_RT kernels, after rt6_get_pcpu_route()
  returns NULL, the current task can be preempted. Another task running on the same CPU may
  then execute rt6_make_pcpu_route() and successfully install a pcpu_rt entry. When the first
  task resumes execution, its cmpxchg() in rt6_make_pcpu_route() will fail because rt6i_pcpu
  is no longer NULL, triggering the BUG_ON(prev). It''s easy to reproduce it by adding mdelay()
  after rt6_get_pcpu_route().  Using preempt_disable/enable is not appropriate here because
  ip6_rt_pcpu_alloc() may sleep.  Fix this by handling the cmpxchg() failure gracefully on PREEMPT_RT:
  free our allocation and return the existing pcpu_rt installed by another task. The BUG_ON
  is replaced by WARN_ON_ONCE for non-PREEMPT_RT kernels where such races should not occur.'
