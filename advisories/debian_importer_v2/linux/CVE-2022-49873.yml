summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Fix wrong
  reg type conversion in release_reference()  Some helper functions will allocate memory. To
  avoid memory leaks, the verifier requires the eBPF program to release these memories by calling
  the corresponding helper functions.  When a resource is released, all pointer registers corresponding
  to the resource should be invalidated. The verifier use release_references() to do this job,
  by apply  __mark_reg_unknown() to each relevant register.  It will give these registers the
  type of SCALAR_VALUE. A register that will contain a pointer value at runtime, but of type
  SCALAR_VALUE, which may allow the unprivileged user to get a kernel pointer by storing this
  register into a map.  Using __mark_reg_not_init() while NOT allow_ptr_leaks can mitigate this
  problem.'
