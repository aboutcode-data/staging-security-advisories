summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommufd/iova_bitmap:
  Fix shift-out-of-bounds in iova_bitmap_offset_to_index()  Resolve a UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds
  issue in iova_bitmap_offset_to_index() where shifting the constant "1" (of type int) by bitmap->mapped.pgshift
  (an unsigned long value) could result in undefined behavior.  The constant "1" defaults to
  a 32-bit "int", and when "pgshift" exceeds 31 (e.g., pgshift = 63) the shift operation overflows,
  as the result cannot be represented in a 32-bit type.  To resolve this, the constant is updated
  to "1UL", promoting it to an unsigned long type to match the operand''s type.'
