summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mptcp: fix NULL
  pointer dereference on fastopen early fallback  In case of early fallback to TCP, subflow_syn_recv_sock()
  deletes the subflow context before returning the newly allocated sock to the caller.  The
  fastopen path does not cope with the above unconditionally dereferencing the subflow context.'
