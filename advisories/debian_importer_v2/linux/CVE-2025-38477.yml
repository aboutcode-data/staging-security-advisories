summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/sched: sch_qfq:
  Fix race condition on qfq_aggregate  A race condition can occur when ''agg'' is modified in
  qfq_change_agg (called during qfq_enqueue) while other threads access it concurrently. For
  example, qfq_dump_class may trigger a NULL dereference, and qfq_delete_class may cause a use-after-free.  This
  patch addresses the issue by:  1. Moved qfq_destroy_class into the critical section.  2. Added
  sch_tree_lock protection to qfq_dump_class and qfq_dump_class_stats.'
