  - CVE-2023-53845
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix infinite
  loop in nilfs_mdt_get_block()  If the disk image that nilfs2 mounts is corrupted and a virtual
  block address obtained by block lookup for a metadata file is invalid, nilfs_bmap_lookup_at_level()
  may return the same internal return code as -ENOENT, meaning the block does not exist in the
  metadata file.  This duplication of return codes confuses nilfs_mdt_get_block(), causing it
  to read and create a metadata block indefinitely.  In particular, if this happens to the inode
  metadata file, ifile, semaphore i_rwsem can be left held, causing task hangs in lock_mount.  Fix
  this issue by making nilfs_bmap_lookup_at_level() treat virtual block address translation
  failures with -ENOENT as metadata corruption instead of returning the error code.'
