summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dm raid: fix
  address sanitizer warning in raid_status  There is this warning when using a kernel with the
  address sanitizer and running this testsuite: https://gitlab.com/cki-project/kernel-tests/-/tree/main/storage/swraid/scsi_raid  ==================================================================
  BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in raid_status+0x1747/0x2820 [dm_raid] Read of size 4 at addr

  warning is caused by reading conf->max_nr_stripes in raid_status. The code in raid_status
  reads mddev->private, casts it to struct r5conf and reads the entry max_nr_stripes.  However,
  if we have different raid type than 4/5/6, mddev->private doesn''t point to struct r5conf;
  it may point to struct r0conf, struct r1conf, struct r10conf or struct mpconf. If we cast
  a pointer to one of these structs to struct r5conf, we will be reading invalid memory and
  KASAN warns about it.  Fix this bug by reading struct r5conf only if raid type is 4, 5 or
  6.'
