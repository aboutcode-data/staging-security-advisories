summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: nft_set_rbtree:
  fix overlap expiration walk  The lazy gc on insert that should remove timed-out entries fails
  to release the other half of the interval, if any.  Can be reproduced with tests/shell/testcases/sets/0044interval_overlap_0
  in nftables.git and kmemleak enabled kernel.  Second bug is the use of rbe_prev vs. prev pointer.
  If rbe_prev() returns NULL after at least one iteration, rbe_prev points to element that is
  not an end interval, hence it should not be removed.  Lastly, check the genmask of the end
  interval if this is active in the current generation.'
