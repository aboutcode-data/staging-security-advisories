summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dax: Fix dax_mapping_release()
  use after free  A CONFIG_DEBUG_KOBJECT_RELEASE test of removing a device-dax region provider
  (like modprobe -r dax_hmem) yields:   kobject: ''mapping0'' (ffff93eb460e8800): kobject_release,
  parent 0000000000000000 (delayed 2000)  [..]  DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(1)  WARNING: CPU: 23 PID:

  to attempting ida_free() on an ida object that has already been freed. Devices typically only
  hold a reference on their parent while registered. If a child needs a parent object to complete
  its release it needs to hold a reference that it drops from its release callback. Arrange
  for a dax_mapping to pin its parent dev_dax instance until dax_mapping_release().'
