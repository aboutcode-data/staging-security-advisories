  - CVE-2024-35808
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  md/dm-raid: don''t
  call md_reap_sync_thread() directly  Currently md_reap_sync_thread() is called from raid_message()
  directly without holding ''reconfig_mutex'', this is definitely unsafe because md_reap_sync_thread()
  can change many fields that is protected by ''reconfig_mutex''.  However, hold ''reconfig_mutex''
  here is still problematic because this will cause deadlock, for example, commit 130443d60b1b
  ("md: refactor idle/frozen_sync_thread() to fix deadlock").  Fix this problem by using stop_sync_thread()
  to unregister sync_thread, like md/raid did.'
