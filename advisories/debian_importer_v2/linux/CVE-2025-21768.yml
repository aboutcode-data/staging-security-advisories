  - CVE-2025-21768
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: ipv6: fix
  dst ref loops in rpl, seg6 and ioam6 lwtunnels  Some lwtunnels have a dst cache for post-transformation
  dst. If the packet destination did not change we may end up recording a reference to the lwtunnel
  in its own cache, and the lwtunnel state will never be freed.  Discovered by the ioam6.sh
  test, kmemleak was recently fixed to catch per-cpu memory leaks. I''m not sure if rpl and
  seg6 can actually hit this, but in principle I don''t see why not.'
