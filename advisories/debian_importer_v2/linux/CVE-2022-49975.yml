summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Don''t redirect
  packets with invalid pkt_len  Syzbot found an issue [1]: fq_codel_drop() try to drop a flow
  whitout any skbs, that is, the flow->head is null. The root cause, as the [2] says, is because
  that bpf_prog_test_run_skb() run a bpf prog which redirects empty skbs. So we should determine
  whether the length of the packet modified by bpf prog or others like bpf_prog_test is valid
  before forwarding it directly.'
