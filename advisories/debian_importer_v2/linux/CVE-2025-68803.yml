summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  NFSD: NFSv4 file
  creation neglects setting ACL  An NFSv4 client that sets an ACL with a named principal during
  file creation retrieves the ACL afterwards, and finds that it is only a default ACL (based
  on the mode bits) and not the ACL that was requested during file creation. This violates RFC
  8881 section 6.4.1.3: "the ACL attribute is set as given".  The issue occurs in nfsd_create_setattr(),
  which calls nfsd_attrs_valid() to determine whether to call nfsd_setattr(). However, nfsd_attrs_valid()
  checks only for iattr changes and security labels, but not POSIX ACLs. When only an ACL is
  present, the function returns false, nfsd_setattr() is skipped, and the POSIX ACL is never
  applied to the inode.  Subsequently, when the client retrieves the ACL, the server finds no
  POSIX ACL on the inode and returns one generated from the file''s mode bits rather than returning
  the originally-specified ACL.'
