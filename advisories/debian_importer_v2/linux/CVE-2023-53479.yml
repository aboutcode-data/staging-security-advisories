summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cxl/acpi: Fix
  a use-after-free in cxl_parse_cfmws()  KASAN and KFENCE detected an user-after-free in the
  CXL driver. This happens in the cxl_decoder_add() fail path. KASAN prints the following error:     BUG:
  KASAN: slab-use-after-free in cxl_parse_cfmws (drivers/cxl/acpi.c:299)  This happens in cxl_parse_cfmws(),
  where put_device() is called, releasing cxld, which is accessed later.  Use the local variables
  in the dev_err() instead of pointing to the released memory. Since the dev_err() is printing
  a resource, change the open coded print format to use the %pr format specifier.'
