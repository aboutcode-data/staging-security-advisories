summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/vmware: Fix
  hypercall clobbers  Fedora QA reported the following panic:    BUG: unable to handle page
  fault for address: 0000000040003e54   #PF: supervisor write access in kernel mode   #PF: error_code(0x0002)
  - not-present page   Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS edk2-20251119-3.fc43
  11/19/2025   RIP: 0010:vmware_hypercall4.constprop.0+0x52/0x90   ..   Call Trace:    vmmouse_report_events+0x13e/0x1b0    psmouse_handle_byte+0x15/0x60    ps2_interrupt+0x8a/0xd0    ...  because
  the QEMU VMware mouse emulation is buggy, and clears the top 32 bits of %rdi that the kernel
  kept a pointer in.  The QEMU vmmouse driver saves and restores the register state in a "uint32_t
  data[6];" and as a result restores the state with the high bits all cleared.  RDI originally
  contained the value of a valid kernel stack address (0xff5eeb3240003e54).  After the vmware
  hypercall it now contains 0x40003e54, and we get a page fault as a result when it is dereferenced.  The
  proper fix would be in QEMU, but this works around the issue in the kernel to keep old setups
  working, when old kernels had not happened to keep any state in %rdi over the hypercall.  In
  theory this same issue exists for all the hypercalls in the vmmouse driver; in practice it
  has only been seen with vmware_hypercall3() and vmware_hypercall4().  For now, just mark RDI/RSI
  as clobbered for those two calls.  This should have a minimal effect on code generation overall
  as it should be rare for the compiler to want to make RDI/RSI live across hypercalls.'
