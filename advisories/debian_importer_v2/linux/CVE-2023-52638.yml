summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: j1939: prevent
  deadlock by changing j1939_socks_lock to rwlock  The following 3 locks would race against
  each other, causing the deadlock situation in the Syzbot bug report:  - j1939_socks_lock -
  active_session_list_lock - sk_session_queue_lock  A reasonable fix is to change j1939_socks_lock
  to an rwlock, since in the rare situations where a write lock is required for the linked list
  that j1939_socks_lock is protecting, the code does not attempt to acquire any more locks.
  This would break the circular lock dependency, where, for example, the current thread already
  locks j1939_socks_lock and attempts to acquire sk_session_queue_lock, and at the same time,
  another thread attempts to acquire j1939_socks_lock while holding sk_session_queue_lock.  NOTE:
  This patch along does not fix the unregister_netdevice bug reported by Syzbot; instead, it
  solves a deadlock situation to prepare for one or more further patches to actually fix the
  Syzbot bug, which appears to be a reference counting problem within the j1939 codebase.  [mkl:
