summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  s390/ism: add
  release function for struct device  According to device_release() in /drivers/base/core.c,
  a device without a release function is a broken device and must be fixed.  The current code
  directly frees the device after calling device_add() without waiting for other kernel parts
  to release their references. Thus, a reference could still be held to a struct device, e.g.,
  by sysfs, leading to potential use-after-free issues if a proper release function is not set.'
