summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  staging: rtl8723bs:
  fix out-of-bounds read in OnBeacon ESR IE parsing  The Extended Supported Rates (ESR) IE handling
  in OnBeacon accessed *(p + 1 + ielen) and *(p + 2 + ielen) without verifying that these offsets
  lie within the received frame buffer. A malformed beacon with an ESR IE positioned at the
  end of the buffer could cause an out-of-bounds read, potentially triggering a kernel panic.  Add
  a boundary check to ensure that the ESR IE body and the subsequent bytes are within the limits
  of the frame before attempting to access them.  This prevents OOB reads caused by malformed
  beacon frames.'
