summary: 'An issue was discovered in netfilter in the Linux kernel before 5.10. There can be
  a use-after-free in the packet processing context, because the per-CPU sequence count is mishandled
  during concurrent iptables rules replacement. This could be exploited with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
  capability in an unprivileged namespace. NOTE: cc00bca was reverted in 5.12.'
