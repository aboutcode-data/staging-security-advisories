summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/xe: Make
  dma-fences compliant with the safe access rules  Xe can free some of the data pointed to by
  the dma-fences it exports. Most notably the timeline name can get freed if userspace closes
  the associated submit queue. At the same time the fence could have been exported to a third
  party (for example a sync_fence fd) which will then cause an use- after-free on subsequent
  access.  To make this safe we need to make the driver compliant with the newly documented
  dma-fence rules. Driver has to ensure a RCU grace period between signalling a fence and freeing
  any data pointed to by said fence.  For the timeline name we simply make the queue be freed
  via kfree_rcu and for the shared lock associated with multiple queues we add a RCU grace period
  before freeing the per GT structure holding the lock.'
