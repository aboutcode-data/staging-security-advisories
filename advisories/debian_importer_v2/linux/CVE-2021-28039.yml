  - CVE-2021-28039
summary: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 5.9.x through 5.11.3, as used with Xen.
  In some less-common configurations, an x86 PV guest OS user can crash a Dom0 or driver domain
  via a large amount of I/O activity. The issue relates to misuse of guest physical addresses
  when a configuration has CONFIG_XEN_UNPOPULATED_ALLOC but not CONFIG_XEN_BALLOON_MEMORY_HOTPLUG.
