summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: rose: convert
  ''use'' field to refcount_t  The ''use'' field in struct rose_neigh is used as a reference
  counter but lacks atomicity. This can lead to race conditions where a rose_neigh structure
  is freed while still being referenced by other code paths.  For example, when rose_neigh->use
  becomes zero during an ioctl operation via rose_rt_ioctl(), the structure may be removed while
  its timer is still active, potentially causing use-after-free issues.  This patch changes
  the type of ''use'' from unsigned short to refcount_t and updates all code paths to use rose_neigh_hold()
  and rose_neigh_put() which operate reference counts atomically.'
