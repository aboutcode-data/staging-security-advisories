summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fs/ntfs3: reject
  index allocation if $BITMAP is empty but blocks exist  Index allocation requires at least
  one bit in the $BITMAP attribute to track usage of index entries. If the bitmap is empty while
  index blocks are already present, this reflects on-disk corruption.  syzbot triggered this
  condition using a malformed NTFS image. During a rename() operation involving a long filename
  (which spans multiple index entries), the empty bitmap allowed the name to be added without
  valid tracking. Subsequent deletion of the original entry failed with -ENOENT, due to unexpected
  index state.  Reject such cases by verifying that the bitmap is not empty when index blocks
  exist.'
