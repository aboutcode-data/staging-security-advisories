  - CVE-2025-37887
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  pds_core: handle
  unsupported PDS_CORE_CMD_FW_CONTROL result  If the FW doesn''t support the PDS_CORE_CMD_FW_CONTROL
  command the driver might at the least print garbage and at the worst crash when the user runs
  the "devlink dev info" devlink command.  This happens because the stack variable fw_list is
  not 0 initialized which results in fw_list.num_fw_slots being a garbage value from the stack.  Then
  the driver tries to access fw_list.fw_names[i] with i >= ARRAY_SIZE and runs off the end of
  the array.  Fix this by initializing the fw_list and by not failing completely if the devcmd
  fails because other useful information is printed via devlink dev info even if the devcmd
  fails.'
