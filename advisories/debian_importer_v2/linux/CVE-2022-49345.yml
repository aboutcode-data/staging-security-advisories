summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: xfrm: unexport
  __init-annotated xfrm4_protocol_init()  EXPORT_SYMBOL and __init is a bad combination because
  the .init.text section is freed up after the initialization. Hence, modules cannot use symbols
  annotated __init. The access to a freed symbol may end up with kernel panic.  modpost used
  to detect it, but it has been broken for a decade.  Recently, I fixed modpost so it started
  to warn it again, then this showed up in linux-next builds.  There are two ways to fix it:    -
  Remove __init   - Remove EXPORT_SYMBOL  I chose the latter for this case because the only
  in-tree call-site, net/ipv4/xfrm4_policy.c is never compiled as modular. (CONFIG_XFRM is boolean)'
