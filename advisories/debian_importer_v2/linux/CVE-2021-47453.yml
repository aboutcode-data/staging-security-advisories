summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ice: Avoid crash
  from unnecessary IDA free  In the remove path, there is an attempt to free the aux_idx IDA
  whether it was allocated or not.  This can potentially cause a crash when unloading the driver
  on systems that do not initialize support for RDMA. But, this free cannot be gated by the
  status bit for RDMA, since it is allocated if the driver detects support for RDMA at probe
  time, but the driver can enter into a state where RDMA is not supported after the IDA has
  been allocated at probe time and this would lead to a memory leak.  Initialize aux_idx to
  an invalid value and check for a valid value when unloading to determine if an IDA free is
  necessary.'
