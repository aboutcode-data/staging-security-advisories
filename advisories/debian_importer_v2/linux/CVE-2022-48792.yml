summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: pm8001:
  Fix use-after-free for aborted SSP/STP sas_task  Currently a use-after-free may occur if a
  sas_task is aborted by the upper layer before we handle the I/O completion in mpi_ssp_completion()
  or mpi_sata_completion().  In this case, the following are the two steps in handling those
  I/O completions:   - Call complete() to inform the upper layer handler of completion of    the
  I/O.   - Release driver resources associated with the sas_task in    pm8001_ccb_task_free()
  call.  When complete() is called, the upper layer may free the sas_task. As such, we should
  not touch the associated sas_task afterwards, but we do so in the pm8001_ccb_task_free() call.  Fix
  by swapping the complete() and pm8001_ccb_task_free() calls ordering.'
