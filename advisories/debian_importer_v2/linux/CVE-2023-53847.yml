summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb-storage:
  alauda: Fix uninit-value in alauda_check_media()  Syzbot got KMSAN to complain about access
  to an uninitialized value in the alauda subdriver of usb-storage:  BUG: KMSAN: uninit-value
  in alauda_transport+0x462/0x57f0 drivers/usb/storage/alauda.c:1137 CPU: 0 PID: 12279 Comm:
  usb-storage Not tainted 5.3.0-rc7+ #0 Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute
  Engine, BIOS Google 01/01/2011 Call Trace:   __dump_stack lib/dump_stack.c:77 [inline]   dump_stack+0x191/0x1f0
  lib/dump_stack.c:113   kmsan_report+0x13a/0x2b0 mm/kmsan/kmsan_report.c:108   __msan_warning+0x73/0xe0
  mm/kmsan/kmsan_instr.c:250   alauda_check_media+0x344/0x3310 drivers/usb/storage/alauda.c:460  The
  problem is that alauda_check_media() doesn''t verify that its USB transfer succeeded before
  trying to use the received data.  What should happen if the transfer fails isn''t entirely
  clear, but a reasonably conservative approach is to pretend that no media is present.  A similar
  problem exists in a usb_stor_dbg() call in alauda_get_media_status().  In this case, when
  an error occurs the call is redundant, because usb_stor_ctrl_transfer() already will print
  a debugging message.  Finally, unrelated to the uninitialized memory access, is the fact that
  alauda_check_media() performs DMA to a buffer on the stack. Fortunately usb-storage provides
  a general purpose DMA-able buffer for uses like this.  We''ll use it instead.'
