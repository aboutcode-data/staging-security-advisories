summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: av7110:
  prevent underflow in write_ts_to_decoder()  The buf[4] value comes from the user via ts_play().  It
  is a value in the u8 range.  The final length we pass to av7110_ipack_instant_repack() is
  "len - (buf[4] + 1) - 4" so add a check to ensure that the length is not negative.  It''s
  not clear that passing a negative len value does anything bad necessarily, but it''s not best
  practice.  With the new bounds checking the "if (!len)" condition is no longer possible or
  required so remove that.'
