summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xsk: Fix corrupted
  packets for XDP_SHARED_UMEM  Fix an issue in XDP_SHARED_UMEM mode together with aligned mode
  where packets are corrupted for the second and any further sockets bound to the same umem.
  In other words, this does not affect the first socket bound to the umem. The culprit for this
  bug is that the initialization of the DMA addresses for the pre-populated xsk buffer pool
  entries was not performed for any socket but the first one bound to the umem. Only the linear
  array of DMA addresses was populated. Fix this by populating the DMA addresses in the xsk
  buffer pool for every socket bound to the same umem.'
