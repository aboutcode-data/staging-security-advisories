summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drivers: media:
  dvb-frontends/rtl2832: fix an out-of-bounds write error  Ensure index in rtl2832_pid_filter
  does not exceed 31 to prevent out-of-bounds access.  dev->filters is a 32-bit value, so set_bit
  and clear_bit functions should only operate on indices from 0 to 31. If index is 32, it will
  attempt to access a non-existent 33rd bit, leading to out-of-bounds access. Change the boundary
  check from index > 32 to index >= 32 to resolve this issue.  [hverkuil: added fixes tag, rtl2830_pid_filter
  -> rtl2832_pid_filter in logmsg]'
