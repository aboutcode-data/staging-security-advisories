summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: mpt3sas:
  Fix NULL pointer access in mpt3sas_transport_port_add()  Port is allocated by sas_port_alloc_num()
  and rphy is allocated by either sas_end_device_alloc() or sas_expander_alloc(), all of which
  may return NULL. So we need to check the rphy to avoid possible NULL pointer access.  If sas_rphy_add()
  returned with failure, rphy is set to NULL. We would access the rphy in the following lines
  which would also result NULL pointer access.'
