  - CVE-2025-38671
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i2c: qup: jump
  out of the loop in case of timeout  Original logic only sets the return value but doesn''t
  jump out of the loop if the bus is kept active by a client. This is not expected. A malicious
  or buggy i2c client can hang the kernel in this case and should be avoided. This is observed
  during a long time test with a PCA953x GPIO extender.  Fix it by changing the logic to not
  only sets the return value, but also jumps out of the loop and return to the caller with -ETIMEDOUT.'
