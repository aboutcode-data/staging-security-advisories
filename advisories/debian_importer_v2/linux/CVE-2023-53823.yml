summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  block/rq_qos:
  protect rq_qos apis with a new lock  commit 50e34d78815e ("block: disable the elevator int
  del_gendisk") move rq_qos_exit() from disk_release() to del_gendisk(), this will introduce
  some problems:  1) If rq_qos_add() is triggered by enabling iocost/iolatency through    cgroupfs,
  then it can concurrent with del_gendisk(), it''s not safe to    write ''q->rq_qos'' concurrently.  2)
  Activate cgroup policy that is relied on rq_qos will call    rq_qos_add() and blkcg_activate_policy(),
  and if rq_qos_exit() is    called in the middle, null-ptr-dereference will be triggered in    blkcg_activate_policy().  3)
  blkg_conf_open_bdev() can call blkdev_get_no_open() first to find the    disk, then if rq_qos_exit()
  from del_gendisk() is done before    rq_qos_add(), then memory will be leaked.  This patch
  add a new disk level mutex ''rq_qos_mutex'':  1) The lock will protect rq_qos_exit() directly.  2)
  For wbt that doesn''t relied on blk-cgroup, rq_qos_add() can only be    called from disk initialization
  for now because wbt can''t be    destructed until rq_qos_exit(), so it''s safe not to protect
  wbt for    now. Hoever, in case that rq_qos dynamically destruction is supported    in the
  furture, this patch also protect rq_qos_add() from wbt_init()    directly, this is enough
  because blk-sysfs already synchronize    writers with disk removal.  3) For iocost and iolatency,
  in order to synchronize disk removal and    cgroup configuration, the lock is held after blkdev_get_no_open()    from
  blkg_conf_open_bdev(), and is released in blkg_conf_exit().    In order to fix the above memory
  leak, disk_live() is checked after    holding the new lock.'
