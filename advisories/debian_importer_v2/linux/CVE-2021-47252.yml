summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  batman-adv: Avoid
  WARN_ON timing related checks  The soft/batadv interface for a queued OGM can be changed during
  the time the OGM was queued for transmission and when the OGM is actually transmitted by the
  worker.  But WARN_ON must be used to denote kernel bugs and not to print simple warnings.
  A warning can simply be printed using pr_warn.'
