  - CVE-2014-4014
summary: The capabilities implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.14.8 does not properly
  consider that namespaces are inapplicable to inodes, which allows local users to bypass intended
  chmod restrictions by first creating a user namespace, as demonstrated by setting the setgid
  bit on a file with group ownership of root.
