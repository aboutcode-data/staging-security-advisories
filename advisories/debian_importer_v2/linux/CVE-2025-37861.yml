  - CVE-2025-37861
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: mpi3mr:
  Synchronous access b/w reset and tm thread for reply queue  When the task management thread
  processes reply queues while the reset thread resets them, the task management thread accesses
  an invalid queue ID (0xFFFF), set by the reset thread, which points to unallocated memory,
  causing a crash.  Add flag ''io_admin_reset_sync'' to synchronize access between the reset,
  I/O, and admin threads. Before a reset, the reset handler sets this flag to block I/O and
  admin processing threads. If any thread bypasses the initial check, the reset thread waits
  up to 10 seconds for processing to finish. If the wait exceeds 10 seconds, the controller
  is marked as unrecoverable.'
