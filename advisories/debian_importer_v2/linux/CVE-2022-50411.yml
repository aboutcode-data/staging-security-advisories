summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ACPICA: Fix error
  code path in acpi_ds_call_control_method()  A use-after-free in acpi_ps_parse_aml() after
  a failing invocaion of acpi_ds_call_control_method() is reported by KASAN [1] and code inspection
  reveals that next_walk_state pushed to the thread by acpi_ds_create_walk_state() is freed
  on errors, but it is not popped from the thread beforehand.  Thus acpi_ds_get_current_walk_state()
  called by acpi_ps_parse_aml() subsequently returns it as the new walk state which is incorrect.  To
  address this, make acpi_ds_call_control_method() call acpi_ds_pop_walk_state() to pop next_walk_state
  from the thread before returning an error.'
