  - CVE-2020-11565
summary: 'An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.6.2. mpol_parse_str in mm/mempolicy.c
  has a stack-based out-of-bounds write because an empty nodelist is mishandled during mount
  option parsing, aka CID-aa9f7d5172fa. NOTE: Someone in the security community disagrees that
  this is a vulnerability because the issue “is a bug in parsing mount options which can only
  be specified by a privileged user, so triggering the bug does not grant any powers not already
  held.”'
