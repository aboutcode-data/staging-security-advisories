summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  erofs: handle
  NONHEAD !delta[1] lclusters gracefully  syzbot reported a WARNING in iomap_iter_done:  iomap_fiemap+0x73b/0x9b0
  fs/iomap/fiemap.c:80  ioctl_fiemap fs/ioctl.c:220 [inline]  Generally, NONHEAD lclusters won''t
  have delta[1]==0, except for crafted images and filesystems created by pre-1.0 mkfs versions.  Previously,
  it would immediately bail out if delta[1]==0, which led to inadequate decompressed lengths
  (thus FIEMAP is impacted).  Treat it as delta[1]=1 to work around these legacy mkfs versions.  `lclusterbits
  > 14` is illegal for compact indexes, error out too.'
