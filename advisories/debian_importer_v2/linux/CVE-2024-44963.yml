summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: do not
  BUG_ON() when freeing tree block after error  When freeing a tree block, at btrfs_free_tree_block(),
  if we fail to create a delayed reference we don''t deal with the error and just do a BUG_ON().
  The error most likely to happen is -ENOMEM, and we have a comment mentioning that only -ENOMEM
  can happen, but that is not true, because in case qgroups are enabled any error returned from
  btrfs_qgroup_trace_extent_post() (can be -EUCLEAN or anything returned from btrfs_search_slot()
  for example) can be propagated back to btrfs_free_tree_block().  So stop doing a BUG_ON()
  and return the error to the callers and make them abort the transaction to prevent leaking
  space. Syzbot was triggering this, likely due to memory allocation failure injection.'
