summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: dsa: realtek:
  fix out-of-bounds access  The probe function sets priv->chip_data to (void *)priv + sizeof(*priv)
  with the expectation that priv has enough trailing space.  However, only realtek-smi actually
  allocated this chip_data space. Do likewise in realtek-mdio to fix out-of-bounds accesses.  These
  accesses likely went unnoticed so far, because of an (unused) buf[4096] member in struct realtek_priv,
  which caused kmalloc to round up the allocated buffer to a big enough size, so nothing of
  value was overwritten. With a different allocator (like in the barebox bootloader port of
  the driver) or with KASAN, the memory corruption becomes quickly apparent.'
