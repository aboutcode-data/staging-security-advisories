summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mt76: mt7921:
  fix crash when startup fails.  If the nic fails to start, it is possible that the reset_work
  has already been scheduled.  Ensure the work item is canceled so we do not have use-after-free
  crash in case cleanup is called before the work item is executed.  This fixes crash on my
  x86_64 apu2 when mt7921k radio fails to work.  Radio still fails, but OS does not crash.'
