summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: hda: Fix
  Oops by 9.1 surround channel names  get_line_out_pfx() may trigger an Oops by overflowing
  the static array with more than 8 channels.  This was reported for MacBookPro 12,1 with Cirrus

  the code paths accessing the same array with the proper size check.'
