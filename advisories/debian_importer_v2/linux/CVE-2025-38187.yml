summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/nouveau:
  fix a use-after-free in r535_gsp_rpc_push()  The RPC container is released after being passed
  to r535_gsp_rpc_send().  When sending the initial fragment of a large RPC and passing the
  caller''s RPC container, the container will be freed prematurely. Subsequent attempts to send
  remaining fragments will therefore result in a use-after-free.  Allocate a temporary RPC container
  for holding the initial fragment of a large RPC when sending. Free the caller''s container
  when all fragments are successfully sent.  [ Rebase onto Blackwell changes. - Danilo ]'
