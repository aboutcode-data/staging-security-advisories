summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vsock: Do not
  allow binding to VMADDR_PORT_ANY  It is possible for a vsock to autobind to VMADDR_PORT_ANY.
  This can cause a use-after-free when a connection is made to the bound socket. The socket
  returned by accept() also has port VMADDR_PORT_ANY but is not on the list of unbound sockets.
  Binding it will result in an extra refcount decrement similar to the one fixed in fcdd2242c023
  (vsock: Keep the binding until socket destruction).  Modify the check in __vsock_bind_connectible()
  to also prevent binding to VMADDR_PORT_ANY.'
