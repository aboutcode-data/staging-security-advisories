summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/sched: sch_fq:
  fix integer overflow of "credit"  if sch_fq is configured with "initial quantum" having values
  greater than INT_MAX, the first assignment of "credit" does signed integer overflow to a very
  negative value. In this situation, the syzkaller script provided by Cristoph triggers the
  CPU soft-lockup warning even with few sockets. It''s not an infinite loop, but "credit" wasn''t
  probably meant to be minus 2Gb for each new flow. Capping "initial quantum" to INT_MAX proved
  to fix the issue.  v2: validation of "initial quantum" is done in fq_policy, instead of open     coding
  in fq_change() _ suggested by Jakub Kicinski'
