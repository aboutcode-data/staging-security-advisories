summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  arm64: kexec:\
  \ initialize kexec_buf struct in load_other_segments()  Patch series \"kexec: Fix invalid\
  \ field access\".  The kexec_buf structure was previously declared without initialization.\
  \  commit bf454ec31add (\"kexec_file: allow to place kexec_buf randomly\") added a field that\
  \ is always read but not consistently populated by all architectures.  This un-initialized\
  \ field will contain garbage.  This is also triggering a UBSAN warning when the uninitialized\
  \ data was accessed:  \t------------[ cut here ]------------ \tUBSAN: invalid-load in ./include/linux/kexec.h:210:10\
  \ \tload of value 252 is not a valid value for type '_Bool'  Zero-initializing kexec_buf at\
  \ declaration ensures all fields are cleanly set, preventing future instances of uninitialized\
  \ memory being used.  An initial fix was already landed for arm64[0], and this patchset fixes\
  \ the problem on the remaining arm64 code and on riscv, as raised by Mark.  Discussions about\
  \ this problem could be found at[1][2].   This patch (of 3):  The kexec_buf structure was\
  \ previously declared without initialization. commit bf454ec31add (\"kexec_file: allow to\
  \ place kexec_buf randomly\") added a field that is always read but not consistently populated\
  \ by all architectures. This un-initialized field will contain garbage.  This is also triggering\
  \ a UBSAN warning when the uninitialized data was accessed:  \t------------[ cut here ]------------\
  \ \tUBSAN: invalid-load in ./include/linux/kexec.h:210:10 \tload of value 252 is not a valid\
  \ value for type '_Bool'  Zero-initializing kexec_buf at declaration ensures all fields are\
  \ cleanly set, preventing future instances of uninitialized memory being used."
