summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: core: Fix
  error handling of scsi_host_alloc()  After device is initialized via device_initialize(),
  or its name is set via dev_set_name(), the device has to be freed via put_device().  Otherwise
  device name will be leaked because it is allocated dynamically in dev_set_name().  Fix the
  leak by replacing kfree() with put_device(). Since scsi_host_dev_release() properly handles
  IDA and kthread removal, remove special-casing these from the error handling as well.'
