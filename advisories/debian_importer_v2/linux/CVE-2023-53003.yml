summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  EDAC/qcom: Do
  not pass llcc_driv_data as edac_device_ctl_info''s pvt_info  The memory for llcc_driv_data
  is allocated by the LLCC driver. But when it is passed as the private driver info to the EDAC
  core, it will get freed during the qcom_edac driver release. So when the qcom_edac driver
  gets probed again, it will try to use the freed data leading to the use-after-free bug.  Hence,
  do not pass llcc_driv_data as pvt_info but rather reference it using the platform_data pointer
  in the qcom_edac driver.'
