summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  octeon_ep: Add
  SKB allocation failures handling in __octep_oq_process_rx()  build_skb() returns NULL in case
  of a memory allocation failure so handle it inside __octep_oq_process_rx() to avoid NULL pointer
  dereference.  __octep_oq_process_rx() is called during NAPI polling by the driver. If skb
  allocation fails, keep on pulling packets out of the Rx DMA queue: we shouldn''t break the
  polling immediately and thus falsely indicate to the octep_napi_poll() that the Rx pressure
  is going down. As there is no associated skb in this case, don''t process the packets and
  don''t push them up the network stack - they are skipped.  Helper function is implemented
  to unmmap/flush all the fragment buffers used by the dropped packet. ''alloc_failures'' counter
  is incremented to mark the skb allocation error in driver statistics.  Found by Linux Verification
  Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.'
