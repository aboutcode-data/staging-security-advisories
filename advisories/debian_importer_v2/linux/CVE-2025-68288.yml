summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: storage:
  Fix memory leak in USB bulk transport  A kernel memory leak was identified by the ''ioctl_sg01''
  test from Linux Test Project (LTP). The following bytes were mainly observed: 0x53425355.  When
  USB storage devices incorrectly skip the data phase with status data, the code extracts/validates
  the CSW from the sg buffer, but fails to clear it afterwards. This leaves status protocol
  data in srb''s transfer buffer, such as the US_BULK_CS_SIGN ''USBS'' signature observed here.
  Thus, this can lead to USB protocols leaks to user space through SCSI generic (/dev/sg*) interfaces,
  such as the one seen here when the LTP test requested 512 KiB.  Fix the leak by zeroing the
  CSW data in srb''s transfer buffer immediately after the validation of devices that skip data
  phase.  Note: Differently from CVE-2018-1000204, which fixed a big leak by zero- ing pages
  at allocation time, this leak occurs after allocation, when USB protocol data is written to
  already-allocated sg pages.'
