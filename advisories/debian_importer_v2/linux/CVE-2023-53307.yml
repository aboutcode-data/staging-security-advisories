summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rbd: avoid use-after-free
  in do_rbd_add() when rbd_dev_create() fails  If getting an ID or setting up a work queue in
  rbd_dev_create() fails, use-after-free on rbd_dev->rbd_client, rbd_dev->spec and rbd_dev->opts
  is triggered in do_rbd_add().  The root cause is that the ownership of these structures is
  transfered to rbd_dev prematurely and they all end up getting freed when rbd_dev_create()
  calls rbd_dev_free() prior to returning to do_rbd_add().  Found by Linux Verification Center
  (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE, an incomplete patch submitted by Natalia Petrova <n.petrova@fintech.ru>.'
