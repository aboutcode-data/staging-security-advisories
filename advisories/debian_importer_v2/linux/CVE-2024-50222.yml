summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iov_iter: fix
  copy_page_from_iter_atomic() if KMAP_LOCAL_FORCE_MAP  generic/077 on x86_32 CONFIG_DEBUG_KMAP_LOCAL_FORCE_MAP=y
  with highmem, on huge=always tmpfs, issues a warning and then hangs (interruptibly):  WARNING:
  CPU: 5 PID: 3517 at mm/highmem.c:622 kunmap_local_indexed+0x62/0xc9 CPU: 5 UID: 0 PID: 3517
  Comm: cp Not tainted 6.12.0-rc4 #2 ... copy_page_from_iter_atomic+0xa6/0x5ec generic_perform_write+0xf6/0x1b4
  shmem_file_write_iter+0x54/0x67  Fix copy_page_from_iter_atomic() by limiting it in that case
  (include/linux/skbuff.h skb_frag_must_loop() does similar).  But going forward, perhaps CONFIG_DEBUG_KMAP_LOCAL_FORCE_MAP
  is too surprising, has outlived its usefulness, and should just be removed?'
