summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommufd: Prevent
  ALIGN() overflow  When allocating IOVA the candidate range gets aligned to the target alignment.
  If the range is close to ULONG_MAX then the ALIGN() can wrap resulting in a corrupted iova.  Open
  code the ALIGN() using get_add_overflow() to prevent this. This simplifies the checks as we
  don''t need to check for length earlier either.  Consolidate the two copies of this code under
  a single helper.  This bug would allow userspace to create a mapping that overlaps with some
  other mapping or a reserved range.'
