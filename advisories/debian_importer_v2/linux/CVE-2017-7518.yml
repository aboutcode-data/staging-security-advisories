aliases:
  - CVE-2017-7518
summary: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel before version 4.12 in the way the KVM module
  processed the trap flag(TF) bit in EFLAGS during emulation of the syscall instruction, which
  leads to a debug exception(#DB) being raised in the guest stack. A user/process inside a guest
  could use this flaw to potentially escalate their privileges inside the guest. Linux guests
  are not affected by this.
