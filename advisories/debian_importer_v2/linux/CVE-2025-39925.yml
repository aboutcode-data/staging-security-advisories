summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: j1939: implement
  NETDEV_UNREGISTER notification handler  syzbot is reporting    unregister_netdevice: waiting
  for vcan0 to become free. Usage count = 2  problem, for j1939 protocol did not have NETDEV_UNREGISTER
  notification handler for undoing changes made by j1939_sk_bind().  Commit 25fe97cb7620 ("can:
  j1939: move j1939_priv_put() into sk_destruct callback") expects that a call to j1939_priv_put()
  can be unconditionally delayed until j1939_sk_sock_destruct() is called. But we need to call
  j1939_priv_put() against an extra ref held by j1939_sk_bind() call (as a part of undoing changes
  made by j1939_sk_bind()) as soon as NETDEV_UNREGISTER notification fires (i.e. before j1939_sk_sock_destruct()
  is called via j1939_sk_release()). Otherwise, the extra ref on "struct j1939_priv" held by
  j1939_sk_bind() call prevents "struct net_device" from dropping the usage count to 1; making
  it impossible for unregister_netdevice() to continue.  [mkl: remove space in front of label]'
