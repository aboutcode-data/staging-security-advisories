summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: tipc: fix
  refcount warning in tipc_aead_encrypt  syzbot reported a refcount warning [1] caused by calling
  get_net() on a network namespace that is being destroyed (refcount=0). This happens when a
  TIPC discovery timer fires during network namespace cleanup.  The recently added get_net()
  call in commit e279024617134 ("net/tipc: fix slab-use-after-free Read in tipc_aead_encrypt_done")
  attempts to hold a reference to the network namespace. However, if the namespace is already
  being destroyed, its refcount might be zero, leading to the use-after-free warning.  Replace
  get_net() with maybe_get_net(), which safely checks if the refcount is non-zero before incrementing
  it. If the namespace is being destroyed, return -ENODEV early, after releasing the bearer
  reference.  [1]: https://lore.kernel.org/all/68342b55.a70a0220.253bc2.0091.GAE@google.com/T/#m12019cf9ae77e1954f666914640efa36d52704a2'
