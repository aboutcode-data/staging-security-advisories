summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: f_fs: Fix\
  \ use-after-free for epfile  Consider a case where ffs_func_eps_disable is called from ffs_func_disable\
  \ as part of composition switch and at the same time ffs_epfile_release get called from userspace.\
  \ ffs_epfile_release will free up the read buffer and call ffs_data_closed which in turn destroys\
  \ ffs->epfiles and mark it as NULL. While this was happening the driver has already initialized\
  \ the local epfile in ffs_func_eps_disable which is now freed and waiting to acquire the spinlock.\
  \ Once spinlock is acquired the driver proceeds with the stale value of epfile and tries to\
  \ free the already freed read buffer causing use-after-free.  Following is the illustration\
  \ of the race:        CPU1                                  CPU2     ffs_func_eps_disable\
  \    epfiles (local copy) \t\t\t\t\tffs_epfile_release \t\t\t\t\tffs_data_closed \t\t\t\t\t\
  if (last file closed) \t\t\t\t\tffs_data_reset \t\t\t\t\tffs_data_clear \t\t\t\t\tffs_epfiles_destroy\
  \ spin_lock dereference epfiles  Fix this races by taking epfiles local copy & assigning it\
  \ under spinlock and if epfiles(local) is null then update it in ffs->epfiles then finally\
  \ destroy it. Extending the scope further from the race, protecting the ep related structures,\
  \ and concurrent accesses."
