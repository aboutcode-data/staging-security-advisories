summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tty: n_gsm: fix
  possible out-of-bounds in gsm0_receive()  Assuming the following: - side A configures the
  n_gsm in basic option mode - side B sends the header of a basic option mode frame with data
  length 1 - side A switches to advanced option mode - side B sends 2 data bytes which exceeds
  gsm->len   Reason: gsm->len is not used in advanced option mode. - side A switches to basic
  option mode - side B keeps sending until gsm0_receive() writes past gsm->buf   Reason: Neither
  gsm->state nor gsm->len have been reset after   reconfiguration.  Fix this by changing gsm->count
  to gsm->len comparison from equal to less than. Also add upper limit checks against the constant
  MAX_MRU in gsm0_receive() and gsm1_receive() to harden against memory corruption of gsm->len
  and gsm->mru.  All other checks remain as we still need to limit the data according to the
  user configuration and actual payload size.'
