  - CVE-2022-4696
summary: There exists a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel through io_uring and
  the IORING_OP_SPLICE operation. If IORING_OP_SPLICE is missing the IO_WQ_WORK_FILES flag,
  which signals that the operation won't use current->nsproxy, so its reference counter is not
  increased. This assumption is not always true as calling io_splice on specific files will
  call the get_uts function which will use current->nsproxy leading to invalidly decreasing
  its reference counter later causing the use-after-free vulnerability. We recommend upgrading
  to version 5.10.160 or above
