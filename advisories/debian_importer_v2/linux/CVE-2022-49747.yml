summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  erofs/zmap.c:
  Fix incorrect offset calculation  Effective offset to add to length was being incorrectly
  calculated, which resulted in iomap->length being set to 0, triggering a WARN_ON in iomap_iter_done().  Fix
  that, and describe it in comments.  This was reported as a crash by syzbot under an issue
  about a warning encountered in iomap_iter_done(), but unrelated to erofs.  C reproducer: https://syzkaller.appspot.com/text?tag=ReproC&x=1037a6b2880000
