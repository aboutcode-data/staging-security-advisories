summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  userfaultfd:
  change src_folio after ensuring it''s unpinned in UFFDIO_MOVE  Commit d7a08838ab74 ("mm: userfaultfd:
  fix unexpected change to src_folio when UFFDIO_MOVE fails") moved the src_folio->{mapping,
  index} changing to after clearing the page-table and ensuring that it''s not pinned.  This
  avoids failure of swapout+migration and possibly memory corruption.  However, the commit missed
  fixing it in the huge-page case.'
