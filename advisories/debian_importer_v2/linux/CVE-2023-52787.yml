  - CVE-2023-52787
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  blk-mq: make
  sure active queue usage is held for bio_integrity_prep()  blk_integrity_unregister() can come
  if queue usage counter isn''t held for one bio with integrity prepared, so this request may
  be completed with calling profile->complete_fn, then kernel panic.  Another constraint is
  that bio_integrity_prep() needs to be called before bio merge.  Fix the issue by:  - call
  bio_integrity_prep() with one queue usage counter grabbed reliably  - call bio_integrity_prep()
  before bio merge'
