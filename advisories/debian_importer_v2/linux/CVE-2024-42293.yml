summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  arm64: mm: Fix
  lockless walks with static and dynamic page-table folding  Lina reports random oopsen originating
  from the fast GUP code when 16K pages are used with 4-level page-tables, the fourth level
  being folded at runtime due to lack of LPA2.  In this configuration, the generic implementation
  of p4d_offset_lockless() will return a ''p4d_t *'' corresponding to the ''pgd_t'' allocated
  on the stack of the caller, gup_fast_pgd_range(). This is normally fine, but when the fourth
  level of page-table is folded at runtime, pud_offset_lockless() will offset from the address
  of the ''p4d_t'' to calculate the address of the PUD in the same page-table page. This results
  in a stray stack read when the ''p4d_t'' has been allocated on the stack and can send the
  walker into the weeds.  Fix the problem by providing our own definition of p4d_offset_lockless()
  when CONFIG_PGTABLE_LEVELS <= 4 which returns the real page-table pointer rather than the
  address of the local stack variable.'
