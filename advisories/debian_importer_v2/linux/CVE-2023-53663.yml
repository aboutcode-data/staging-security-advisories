summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: nSVM: Check\
  \ instead of asserting on nested TSC scaling support  Check for nested TSC scaling support\
  \ on nested SVM VMRUN instead of asserting that TSC scaling is exposed to L1 if L1's MSR_AMD64_TSC_RATIO\
  \ has diverged from KVM's default.  Userspace can trigger the WARN at will by writing the\
  \ MSR and then updating guest CPUID to hide the feature (modifying guest CPUID is allowed\
  \ anytime before KVM_RUN).  E.g. hacking KVM's state_test selftest to do  \t\tvcpu_set_msr(vcpu,\
  \ MSR_AMD64_TSC_RATIO, 0); \t\tvcpu_clear_cpuid_feature(vcpu, X86_FEATURE_TSCRATEMSR);  after\
  \ restoring state in a new VM+vCPU yields an endless supply of:    ------------[ cut here\
