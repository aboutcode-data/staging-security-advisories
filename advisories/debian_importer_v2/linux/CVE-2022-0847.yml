  - CVE-2022-0847
summary: A flaw was found in the way the "flags" member of the new pipe buffer structure was
  lacking proper initialization in copy_page_to_iter_pipe and push_pipe functions in the Linux
  kernel and could thus contain stale values. An unprivileged local user could use this flaw
  to write to pages in the page cache backed by read only files and as such escalate their privileges
  on the system.
