  - CVE-2023-53276
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ubifs: Free memory
  for tmpfile name  When opening a ubifs tmpfile on an encrypted directory, function fscrypt_setup_filename
  allocates memory for the name that is to be stored in the directory entry, but after the name
  has been copied to the directory entry inode, the memory is not freed.  When running kmemleak
  on it we see that it is registered as a leak. The report below is triggered by a simple program
  ''tmpfile'' just opening a tmpfile:    unreferenced object 0xffff88810178f380 (size 32):     comm
  "tmpfile", pid 509, jiffies 4294934744 (age 1524.742s)     backtrace:       __kmem_cache_alloc_node       __kmalloc       fscrypt_setup_filename       ubifs_tmpfile       vfs_tmpfile       path_openat  Free
  this memory after it has been copied to the inode.'
