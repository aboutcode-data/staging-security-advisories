summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/sched: sch_qfq:
  Fix null-deref in agg_dequeue  To prevent a potential crash in agg_dequeue (net/sched/sch_qfq.c)
  when cl->qdisc->ops->peek(cl->qdisc) returns NULL, we check the return value before using
  it, similar to the existing approach in sch_hfsc.c.  To avoid code duplication, the following
  changes are made:  1. Changed qdisc_warn_nonwc(include/net/pkt_sched.h) into a static inline
  function.  2. Moved qdisc_peek_len from net/sched/sch_hfsc.c to include/net/pkt_sched.h so
  that sch_qfq can reuse it.  3. Applied qdisc_peek_len in agg_dequeue to avoid crashing.'
