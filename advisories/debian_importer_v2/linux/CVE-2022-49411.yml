summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bfq: Make sure
  bfqg for which we are queueing requests is online  Bios queued into BFQ IO scheduler can be
  associated with a cgroup that was already offlined. This may then cause insertion of this
  bfq_group into a service tree. But this bfq_group will get freed as soon as last bio associated
  with it is completed leading to use after free issues for service tree users. Fix the problem
  by making sure we always operate on online bfq_group. If the bfq_group associated with the
  bio is not online, we pick the first online parent.'
