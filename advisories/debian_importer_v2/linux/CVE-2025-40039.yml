summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ksmbd: Fix race
  condition in RPC handle list access  The ''sess->rpc_handle_list'' XArray manages RPC handles
  within a ksmbd session. Access to this list is intended to be protected by ''sess->rpc_lock''
  (an rw_semaphore). However, the locking implementation was flawed, leading to potential race
  conditions.  In ksmbd_session_rpc_open(), the code incorrectly acquired only a read lock before
  calling xa_store() and xa_erase(). Since these operations modify the XArray structure, a write
  lock is required to ensure exclusive access and prevent data corruption from concurrent modifications.  Furthermore,
  ksmbd_session_rpc_method() accessed the list using xa_load() without holding any lock at all.
  This could lead to reading inconsistent data or a potential use-after-free if an entry is
  concurrently removed and the pointer is dereferenced.  Fix these issues by: 1. Using down_write()
  and up_write() in ksmbd_session_rpc_open()    to ensure exclusive access during XArray modification,
  and ensuring    the lock is correctly released on error paths. 2. Adding down_read() and up_read()
  in ksmbd_session_rpc_method()    to safely protect the lookup.'
