summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  atm: clip: Fix
  potential null-ptr-deref in to_atmarpd().  atmarpd is protected by RTNL since commit f3a0592b37b8
  ("[ATM]: clip causes unregister hang").  However, it is not enough because to_atmarpd() is
  called without RTNL, especially clip_neigh_solicit() / neigh_ops->solicit() is unsleepable.  Also,
  there is no RTNL dependency around atmarpd.  Let''s use a private mutex and RCU to protect
  access to atmarpd in to_atmarpd().'
