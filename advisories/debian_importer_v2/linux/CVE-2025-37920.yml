summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xsk: Fix race
  condition in AF_XDP generic RX path  Move rx_lock from xsk_socket to xsk_buff_pool. Fix synchronization
  for shared umem mode in generic RX path where multiple sockets share single xsk_buff_pool.  RX
  queue is exclusive to xsk_socket, while FILL queue can be shared between multiple sockets.
  This could result in race condition where two CPU cores access RX path of two different sockets
  sharing the same umem.  Protect both queues by acquiring spinlock in shared xsk_buff_pool.  Lock
  contention may be minimized in the future by some per-thread FQ buffering.  It''s safe and
  necessary to move spin_lock_bh(rx_lock) after xsk_rcv_check(): * xs->pool and spinlock_init
  is synchronized by   xsk_bind() -> xsk_is_bound() memory barriers. * xsk_rcv_check() may return
  true at the moment   of xsk_release() or xsk_unbind_dev(),   however this will not cause any
  data races or   race conditions. xsk_unbind_dev() removes xdp   socket from all maps and waits
  for completion   of all outstanding rx operations. Packets in   RX path will either complete
  safely or drop.'
