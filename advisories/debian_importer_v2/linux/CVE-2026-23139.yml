summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: nf_conncount:
  update last_gc only when GC has been performed  Currently last_gc is being updated everytime
  a new connection is tracked, that means that it is updated even if a GC wasn''t performed.
  With a sufficiently high packet rate, it is possible to always bypass the GC, causing the
  list to grow infinitely.  Update the last_gc value only when a GC has been actually performed.'
