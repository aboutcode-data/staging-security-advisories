  - CVE-2018-12633
summary: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.2. vbg_misc_device_ioctl()
  in drivers/virt/vboxguest/vboxguest_linux.c reads the same user data twice with copy_from_user.
  The header part of the user data is double-fetched, and a malicious user thread can tamper
  with the critical variables (hdr.size_in and hdr.size_out) in the header between the two fetches
  because of a race condition, leading to severe kernel errors, such as buffer over-accesses.
  This bug can cause a local denial of service and information leakage.
