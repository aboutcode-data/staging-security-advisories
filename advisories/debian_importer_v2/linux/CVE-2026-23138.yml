summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tracing: Add
  recursion protection in kernel stack trace recording  A bug was reported about an infinite
  recursion caused by tracing the rcu events with the kernel stack trace trigger enabled. The
  stack trace code called back into RCU which then called the stack trace again.  Expand the
  ftrace recursion protection to add a set of bits to protect events from recursion. Each bit
  represents the context that the event is in (normal, softirq, interrupt and NMI).  Have the
  stack trace code use the interrupt context to protect against recursion.  Note, the bug showed
  an issue in both the RCU code as well as the tracing stacktrace code. This only handles the
  tracing stack trace side of the bug. The RCU fix will be handled separately.'
