summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  arm64: acpi:
  Harden get_cpu_for_acpi_id() against missing CPU entry  In a review discussion of the changes
  to support vCPU hotplug where a check was added on the GICC being enabled if was online, it
  was noted that there is need to map back to the cpu and use that to index into a cpumask.
  As such, a valid ID is needed.  If an MPIDR check fails in acpi_map_gic_cpu_interface() it
  is possible for the entry in cpu_madt_gicc[cpu] == NULL.  This function would then cause a
  NULL pointer dereference.   Whilst a path to trigger this has not been established, harden
  this caller against the possibility.'
