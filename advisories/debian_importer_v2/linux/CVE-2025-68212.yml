summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fs: Fix uninitialized
  ''offp'' in statmount_string()  In statmount_string(), most flags assign an output offset
  pointer (offp) which is later updated with the string offset. However, the STATMOUNT_MNT_UIDMAP
  and STATMOUNT_MNT_GIDMAP cases directly set the struct fields instead of using offp. This
  leaves offp uninitialized, leading to a possible uninitialized dereference when *offp is updated.  Fix
  it by assigning offp for UIDMAP and GIDMAP as well, keeping the code path consistent.'
