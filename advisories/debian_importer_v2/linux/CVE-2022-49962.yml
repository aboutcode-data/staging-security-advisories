summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xhci: Fix null
  pointer dereference in remove if xHC has only one roothub  The remove path in xhci platform
  driver tries to remove and put both main and shared hcds even if only a main hcd exists (one
  roothub)  This causes a null pointer dereference in reboot for those controllers.  Check that
  the shared_hcd exists before trying to remove it.'
