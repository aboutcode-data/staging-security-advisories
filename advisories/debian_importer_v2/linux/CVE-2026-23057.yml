summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vsock/virtio:
  Coalesce only linear skb  vsock/virtio common tries to coalesce buffers in rx queue: if a
  linear skb (with a spare tail room) is followed by a small skb (length limited by GOOD_COPY_LEN
  = 128), an attempt is made to join them.  Since the introduction of MSG_ZEROCOPY support,
  assumption that a small skb will always be linear is incorrect. In the zerocopy case, data
  is lost and the linear skb is appended with uninitialized kernel memory.  Of all 3 supported
  virtio-based transports, only loopback-transport is affected. G2H virtio-transport rx queue
  operates on explicitly linear skbs; see virtio_vsock_alloc_linear_skb() in virtio_vsock_rx_fill().
  H2G vhost-transport may allocate non-linear skbs, but only for sizes that are not considered
  for coalescence; see PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER in virtio_vsock_alloc_skb().  Ensure only linear
  skbs are coalesced. Note that skb_tailroom(last_skb) > 0 guarantees last_skb is linear.'
