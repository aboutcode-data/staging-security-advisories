summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mlxsw: spectrum:
  Protect driver from buggy firmware  When processing port up/down events generated by the device''s
  firmware, the driver protects itself from events reported for non-existent local ports, but
  not the CPU port (local port 0), which exists, but lacks a netdev.  This can result in a NULL
  pointer dereference when calling netif_carrier_{on,off}().  Fix this by bailing early when
  processing an event reported for the CPU port. Problem was only observed when running on top
  of a buggy emulator.'
