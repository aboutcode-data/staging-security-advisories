summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  virtio-net: fix
  overflow inside virtnet_rq_alloc  When the frag just got a page, then may lead to regression
  on VM. Specially if the sysctl net.core.high_order_alloc_disable value is 1, then the frag
  always get a page when do refill.  Which could see reliable crashes or scp failure (scp a
  file 100M in size to VM).  The issue is that the virtnet_rq_dma takes up 16 bytes at the beginning
  of a new frag. When the frag size is larger than PAGE_SIZE, everything is fine. However, if
  the frag is only one page and the total size of the buffer and virtnet_rq_dma is larger than
  one page, an overflow may occur.  The commit f9dac92ba908 ("virtio_ring: enable premapped
  mode whatever use_dma_api") introduced this problem. And we reverted some commits to fix this
  in last linux version. Now we try to enable it and fix this bug directly.  Here, when the
  frag size is not enough, we reduce the buffer len to fix this problem.'
