summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: vhci:
  Prevent use-after-free by removing debugfs files early  Move the creation of debugfs files
  into a dedicated function, and ensure they are explicitly removed during vhci_release(), before
  associated data structures are freed.  Previously, debugfs files such as "force_suspend",
  "force_wakeup", and others were created under hdev->debugfs but not removed in vhci_release().
  Since vhci_release() frees the backing vhci_data structure, any access to these files after
  release would result in use-after-free errors.  Although hdev->debugfs is later freed in hci_release_dev(),
  user can access files after vhci_data is freed but before hdev->debugfs is released.'
