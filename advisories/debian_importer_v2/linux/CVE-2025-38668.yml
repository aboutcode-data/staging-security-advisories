summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  regulator: core:
  fix NULL dereference on unbind due to stale coupling data  Failing to reset coupling_desc.n_coupled
  after freeing coupled_rdevs can lead to NULL pointer dereference when regulators are accessed
  post-unbind.  This can happen during runtime PM or other regulator operations that rely on
  coupling metadata.  For example, on ridesx4, unbinding the ''reg-dummy'' platform device triggers
  a panic in regulator_lock_recursive() due to stale coupling state.  Ensure n_coupled is set
  to 0 to prevent access to invalid pointers.'
