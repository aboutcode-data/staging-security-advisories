summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: xhci: Check
  for xhci->interrupters being allocated in xhci_mem_clearup()  If xhci_mem_init() fails, it
  calls into xhci_mem_cleanup() to mop up the damage. If it fails early enough, before xhci->interrupters
  is allocated but after xhci->max_interrupters has been set, which happens in most (all?) cases,
  things get uglier, as xhci_mem_cleanup() unconditionally derefences xhci->interrupters. With
  prejudice.  Gate the interrupt freeing loop with a check on xhci->interrupters being non-NULL.  Found
  while debugging a DMA allocation issue that led the XHCI driver on this exact path.'
