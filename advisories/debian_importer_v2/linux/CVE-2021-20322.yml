  - CVE-2021-20322
summary: A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect)
  in the Linux kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP
  ports. This flaw allows an off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP
  randomization. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly
  integrity, because software that relies on UDP source port randomization are indirectly affected
  as well.
