summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sunrpc: fix handling
  of server side tls alerts  Scott Mayhew discovered a security exploit in NFS over TLS in tls_alert_recv()
  due to its assumption it can read data from the msg iterator''s kvec..  kTLS implementation
  splits TLS non-data record payload between the control message buffer (which includes the
  type such as TLS aler or TLS cipher change) and the rest of the payload (say TLS alert''s
  level/description) which goes into the msg payload buffer.  This patch proposes to rework
  how control messages are setup and used by sock_recvmsg().  If no control message structure
  is setup, kTLS layer will read and process TLS data record types. As soon as it encounters
  a TLS control message, it would return an error. At that point, NFS can setup a kvec backed
  msg buffer and read in the control message such as a TLS alert. Msg iterator can advance the
  kvec pointer as a part of the copy process thus we need to revert the iterator before calling
  into the tls_alert_recv.'
