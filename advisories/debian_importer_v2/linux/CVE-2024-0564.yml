  - CVE-2024-0564
summary: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's memory deduplication mechanism. The max page
  sharing of Kernel Samepage Merging (KSM), added in Linux kernel version 4.4.0-96.119, can
  create a side channel. When the attacker and the victim share the same host and the default
  setting of KSM is "max page sharing=256", it is possible for the attacker to time the unmap
  to merge with the victim's page. The unmapping time depends on whether it merges with the
  victim's page and additional physical pages are created beyond the KSM's "max page share".
  Through these operations, the attacker can leak the victim's page.
