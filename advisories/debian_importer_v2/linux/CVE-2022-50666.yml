summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/siw: Fix
  QP destroy to wait for all references dropped.  Delay QP destroy completion until all siw
  references to QP are dropped. The calling RDMA core will free QP structure after successful
  return from siw_qp_destroy() call, so siw must not hold any remaining reference to the QP
  upon return. A use-after-free was encountered in xfstest generic/460, while testing NFSoRDMA.
  Here, after a TCP connection drop by peer, the triggered siw_cm_work_handler got delayed until
  after QP destroy call, referencing a QP which has already freed.'
