summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  perf: Fix event
  leak upon exec and file release  The perf pending task work is never waited upon the matching
  event release. In the case of a child event, released via free_event() directly, this can
  potentially result in a leaked event, such as in the following scenario that doesn''t even
  require a weak IRQ work implementation to trigger:  schedule()    prepare_task_switch() =======>
  <NMI>       perf_event_overflow()          event->pending_sigtrap = ...          irq_work_queue(&event->pending_irq)
  <======= </NMI>       perf_event_task_sched_out()           event_sched_out()               event->pending_sigtrap
  = 0;               atomic_long_inc_not_zero(&event->refcount)               task_work_add(&event->pending_task)    finish_lock_switch()
  =======> <IRQ>    perf_pending_irq()       //do nothing, rely on pending task work <=======
  </IRQ>  begin_new_exec()    perf_event_exit_task()       perf_event_exit_event()          //
  If is child event          free_event()             WARN(atomic_long_cmpxchg(&event->refcount,
  1, 0) != 1)             // event is leaked  Similar scenarios can also happen with perf_event_remove_on_exec()
  or simply against concurrent perf_event_release().  Fix this with synchonizing against the
  possibly remaining pending task work while freeing the event, just like is done with remaining
  pending IRQ work. This means that the pending task callback neither need nor should hold a
  reference to the event, preventing it from ever beeing freed.'
