summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wl1251: dynamically
  allocate memory used for DMA  With introduction of vmap''ed stacks, stack parameters can no
  longer be used for DMA and now leads to kernel panic.  It happens at several places for the
  wl1251 (e.g. when accessed through SDIO) making it unuseable on e.g. the OpenPandora.  We
  solve this by allocating temporary buffers or use wl1251_read32().  Tested on v5.18-rc5 with
  OpenPandora.'
