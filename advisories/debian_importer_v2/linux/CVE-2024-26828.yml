summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cifs: fix underflow
  in parse_server_interfaces()  In this loop, we step through the buffer and after each item
  we check if the size_left is greater than the minimum size we need.  However, the problem
  is that "bytes_left" is type ssize_t while sizeof() is type size_t.  That means that because
  of type promotion, the comparison is done as an unsigned and if we have negative bytes left
  the loop continues instead of ending.'
