summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display:
  Check null pointers before multiple uses  [WHAT & HOW] Poniters, such as stream_enc and dc->bw_vbios,
  are null checked previously in the same function, so Coverity warns "implies that stream_enc
  and dc->bw_vbios might be null". They are used multiple times in the subsequent code and need
  to be checked.  This fixes 10 FORWARD_NULL issues reported by Coverity.'
