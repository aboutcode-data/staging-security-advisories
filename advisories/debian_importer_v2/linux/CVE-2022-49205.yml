summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf, sockmap:
  Fix double uncharge the mem of sk_msg  If tcp_bpf_sendmsg is running during a tear down operation,
  psock may be freed.  tcp_bpf_sendmsg()  tcp_bpf_send_verdict()   sk_msg_return()   tcp_bpf_sendmsg_redir()    unlikely(!psock))      sk_msg_free()  The
  mem of msg has been uncharged in tcp_bpf_send_verdict() by sk_msg_return(), and would be uncharged
  by sk_msg_free() again. When psock is null, we can simply returning an error code, this would
  then trigger the sk_msg_free_nocharge in the error path of __SK_REDIRECT and would have the
  side effect of throwing an error up to user space. This would be a slight change in behavior
  from user side but would look the same as an error if the redirect on the socket threw an
  error.  This issue can cause the following info: WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 2136 at net/ipv4/af_inet.c:155
