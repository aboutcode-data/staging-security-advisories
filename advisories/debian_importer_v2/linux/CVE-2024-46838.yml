  - CVE-2024-46838
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  userfaultfd:
  don''t BUG_ON() if khugepaged yanks our page table  Since khugepaged was changed to allow
  retracting page tables in file mappings without holding the mmap lock, these BUG_ON()s are
  wrong - get rid of them.  We could also remove the preceding "if (unlikely(...))" block, but
  then we could reach pte_offset_map_lock() with transhuge pages not just for file mappings
  but also for anonymous mappings - which would probably be fine but I think is not necessarily
  expected.'
