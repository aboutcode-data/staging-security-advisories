aliases:
  - CVE-2024-0562
summary: A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux Kernel. When a disk is removed, bdi_unregister
  is called to stop further write-back and waits for associated delayed work to complete. However,
  wb_inode_writeback_end() may schedule bandwidth estimation work after this has completed,
  which can result in the timer attempting to access the recently freed bdi_writeback.
