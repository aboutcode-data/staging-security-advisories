summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  zsmalloc: fix
  races between asynchronous zspage free and page migration  The asynchronous zspage free worker
  tries to lock a zspage''s entire page list without defending against page migration.  Since
  pages which haven''t yet been locked can concurrently migrate off the zspage page list while
  lock_zspage() churns away, lock_zspage() can suffer from a few different lethal races.  It
  can lock a page which no longer belongs to the zspage and unsafely dereference page_private(),
  it can unsafely dereference a torn pointer to the next page (since there''s a data race),
  and it can observe a spurious NULL pointer to the next page and thus not lock all of the zspage''s
  pages (since a single page migration will reconstruct the entire page list, and create_page_chain()
  unconditionally zeroes out each list pointer in the process).  Fix the races by using migrate_read_lock()
  in lock_zspage() to synchronize with page migration.'
