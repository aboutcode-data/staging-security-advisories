summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring: check
  if we need to reschedule during overflow flush  In terms of normal application usage, this
  list will always be empty. And if an application does overflow a bit, it''ll have a few entries.
  However, nothing obviously prevents syzbot from running a test case that generates a ton of
  overflow entries, and then flushing them can take quite a while.  Check for needing to reschedule
  while flushing, and drop our locks and do so if necessary. There''s no state to maintain here
  as overflows always prune from head-of-list, hence it''s fine to drop and reacquire the locks
  at the end of the loop.'
