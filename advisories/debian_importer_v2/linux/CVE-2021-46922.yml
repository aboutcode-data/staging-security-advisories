summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KEYS: trusted:
  Fix TPM reservation for seal/unseal  The original patch 8c657a0590de ("KEYS: trusted: Reserve
  TPM for seal and unseal operations") was correct on the mailing list:  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-integrity/20210128235621.127925-4-jarkko@kernel.org/  But
  somehow got rebased so that the tpm_try_get_ops() in tpm2_seal_trusted() got lost.  This causes
  an imbalanced put of the TPM ops and causes oopses on TIS based hardware.  This fix puts back
  the lost tpm_try_get_ops()'
