summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iomap: allocate
  s_dio_done_wq for async reads as well  Since commit 222f2c7c6d14 ("iomap: always run error
  completions in user context"), read error completions are deferred to s_dio_done_wq.  This
  means the workqueue also needs to be allocated for async reads.'
