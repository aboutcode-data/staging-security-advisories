summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Revert "arm64:
  dts: qcom: sdm845: Affirm IDR0.CCTW on apps_smmu"  There are reports that the pagetable walker
  cache coherency is not a given across the spectrum of SDM845/850 devices, leading to lock-ups
  and resets. It works fine on some devices (like the Dragonboard 845c, but not so much on the
  Lenovo Yoga C630).  This unfortunately looks like a fluke in firmware development, where likely
  somewhere in the vast hypervisor stack, a change to accommodate for this was only introduced
  after the initial software release (which often serves as a baseline for products).  Revert
  the change to avoid additional guesswork around crashes.  This reverts commit 6b31a9744b8726c69bb0af290f8475a368a4b805.'
