  - CVE-2025-68799
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  caif: fix integer
  underflow in cffrml_receive()  The cffrml_receive() function extracts a length field from
  the packet header and, when FCS is disabled, subtracts 2 from this length without validating
  that len >= 2.  If an attacker sends a malicious packet with a length field of 0 or 1 to an
  interface with FCS disabled, the subtraction causes an integer underflow.  This can lead to
  memory exhaustion and kernel instability, potential information disclosure if padding contains
  uninitialized kernel memory.  Fix this by validating that len >= 2 before performing the subtraction.'
