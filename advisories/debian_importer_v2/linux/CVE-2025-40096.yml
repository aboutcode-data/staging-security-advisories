summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/sched: Fix
  potential double free in drm_sched_job_add_resv_dependencies  When adding dependencies with
  drm_sched_job_add_dependency(), that function consumes the fence reference both on success
  and failure, so in the latter case the dma_fence_put() on the error path (xarray failed to
  expand) is a double free.  Interestingly this bug appears to have been present ever since
  commit ebd5f74255b9 ("drm/sched: Add dependency tracking"), since the code back then looked
  like this:  drm_sched_job_add_implicit_dependencies(): ...        for (i = 0; i < fence_count;
  i++) {                ret = drm_sched_job_add_dependency(job, fences[i]);                if
  (ret)                        break;        }         for (; i < fence_count; i++)                dma_fence_put(fences[i]);  Which
  means for the failing ''i'' the dma_fence_put was already a double free. Possibly there were
  no users at that time, or the test cases were insufficient to hit it.  The bug was then only
  noticed and fixed after commit 9c2ba265352a ("drm/scheduler: use new iterator in drm_sched_job_add_implicit_dependencies
  v2") landed, with its fixup of commit 4eaf02d6076c ("drm/scheduler: fix drm_sched_job_add_implicit_dependencies").  At
  that point it was a slightly different flavour of a double free, which commit 963d0b356935
  ("drm/scheduler: fix drm_sched_job_add_implicit_dependencies harder") noticed and attempted
  to fix.  But it only moved the double free from happening inside the drm_sched_job_add_dependency(),
  when releasing the reference not yet obtained, to the caller, when releasing the reference
  already released by the former in the failure case.  As such it is not easy to identify the
  right target for the fixes tag so lets keep it simple and just continue the chain.  While
  fixing we also improve the comment and explain the reason for taking the reference and not
  dropping it.'
