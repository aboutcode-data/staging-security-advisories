summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/coco: Require
  seeding RNG with RDRAND on CoCo systems  There are few uses of CoCo that don''t rely on working
  cryptography and hence a working RNG. Unfortunately, the CoCo threat model means that the
  VM host cannot be trusted and may actively work against guests to extract secrets or manipulate
  computation. Since a malicious host can modify or observe nearly all inputs to guests, the
  only remaining source of entropy for CoCo guests is RDRAND.  If RDRAND is broken -- due to
  CPU hardware fault -- the RNG as a whole is meant to gracefully continue on gathering entropy
  from other sources, but since there aren''t other sources on CoCo, this is catastrophic. This
  is mostly a concern at boot time when initially seeding the RNG, as after that the consequences
  of a broken RDRAND are much more theoretical.  So, try at boot to seed the RNG using 256 bits
  of RDRAND output. If this fails, panic(). This will also trigger if the system is booted without
  RDRAND, as RDRAND is essential for a safe CoCo boot.  Add this deliberately to be "just a
  CoCo x86 driver feature" and not part of the RNG itself. Many device drivers and platforms
  have some desire to contribute something to the RNG, and add_device_randomness() is specifically
  meant for this purpose.  Any driver can call it with seed data of any quality, or even garbage
  quality, and it can only possibly make the quality of the RNG better or have no effect, but
  can never make it worse.  Rather than trying to build something into the core of the RNG,
  consider the particular CoCo issue just a CoCo issue, and therefore separate it all out into
  driver (well, arch/platform) code.    [ bp: Massage commit message. ]'
