summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  riscv: Fix loading
  64-bit NOMMU kernels past the start of RAM  commit 3335068f8721 ("riscv: Use PUD/P4D/PGD pages
  for the linear mapping") added logic to allow using RAM below the kernel load address. However,
  this does not work for NOMMU, where PAGE_OFFSET is fixed to the kernel load address. Since
  that range of memory corresponds to PFNs below ARCH_PFN_OFFSET, mm initialization runs off
  the beginning of mem_map and corrupts adjacent kernel memory. Fix this by restoring the previous
  behavior for NOMMU kernels.'
