summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: xhci: Fix
  invalid pointer dereference in Etron workaround  This check is performed before prepare_transfer()
  and prepare_ring(), so enqueue can already point at the final link TRB of a segment. And indeed
  it will, some 0.4% of times this code is called.  Then enqueue + 1 is an invalid pointer.
  It will crash the kernel right away or load some junk which may look like a link TRB and cause
  the real link TRB to be replaced with a NOOP. This wouldn''t end well.  Use a functionally
  equivalent test which doesn''t dereference the pointer and always gives correct result.  Something
  has crashed my machine twice in recent days while playing with an Etron HC, and a control
  transfer stress test ran for confirmation has just crashed it again. The same test passes
  with this patch applied.'
