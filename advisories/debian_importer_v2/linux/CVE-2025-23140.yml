summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  misc: pci_endpoint_test:
  Avoid issue of interrupts remaining after request_irq error  After devm_request_irq() fails
  with error in pci_endpoint_test_request_irq(), the pci_endpoint_test_free_irq_vectors() is
  called assuming that all IRQs have been released.  However, some requested IRQs remain unreleased,
  so there are still /proc/irq/* entries remaining, and this results in WARN() with the following
  message:    remove_proc_entry: removing non-empty directory ''irq/30'', leaking at least ''pci-endpoint-test.0''   WARNING:
  CPU: 0 PID: 202 at fs/proc/generic.c:719 remove_proc_entry +0x190/0x19c  To solve this issue,
  set the number of remaining IRQs to test->num_irqs, and release IRQs in advance by calling
  pci_endpoint_test_release_irq().  [kwilczynski: commit log]'
