summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  char: xillybus:
  Don''t destroy workqueue from work item running on it  Triggered by a kref decrement, destroy_workqueue()
  may be called from within a work item for destroying its own workqueue. This illegal situation
  is averted by adding a module-global workqueue for exclusive use of the offending work item.
  Other work items continue to be queued on per-device workqueues to ensure performance.'
