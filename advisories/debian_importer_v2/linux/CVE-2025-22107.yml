summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: dsa: sja1105:
  fix kasan out-of-bounds warning in sja1105_table_delete_entry()  There are actually 2 problems:
  - deleting the last element doesn''t require the memmove of elements   [i + 1, end) over it.
  Actually, element i+1 is out of bounds. - The memmove itself should move size - i - 1 elements,
  because the last   element is out of bounds.  The out-of-bounds element still remains out
  of bounds after being accessed, so the problem is only that we touch it, not that it becomes
  in active use. But I suppose it can lead to issues if the out-of-bounds element is part of
  an unmapped page.'
