summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommu/s390: Fix
  memory corruption when using identity domain  zpci_get_iommu_ctrs() returns counter information
  to be reported as part of device statistics; these counters are stored as part of the s390_domain.
  The problem, however, is that the identity domain is not backed by an s390_domain and so the
  conversion via to_s390_domain() yields a bad address that is zero''d initially and read on-demand
  later via a sysfs read. These counters aren''t necessary for the identity domain; just return
  NULL in this case.  This issue was discovered via KASAN with reports that look like: BUG:
  KASAN: global-out-of-bounds in zpci_fmb_enable_device when using the identity domain for a
  device on s390.'
