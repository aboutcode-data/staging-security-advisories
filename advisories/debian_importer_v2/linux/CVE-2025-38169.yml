summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  arm64/fpsimd:
  Avoid clobbering kernel FPSIMD state with SMSTOP  On system with SME, a thread''s kernel FPSIMD
  state may be erroneously clobbered during a context switch immediately after that state is
  restored. Systems without SME are unaffected.  If the CPU happens to be in streaming SVE mode
  before a context switch to a thread with kernel FPSIMD state, fpsimd_thread_switch() will
  restore the kernel FPSIMD state using fpsimd_load_kernel_state() while the CPU is still in
  streaming SVE mode. When fpsimd_thread_switch() subsequently calls fpsimd_flush_cpu_state(),
  this will execute an SMSTOP, causing an exit from streaming SVE mode. The exit from streaming
  SVE mode will cause the hardware to reset a number of FPSIMD/SVE/SME registers, clobbering
  the FPSIMD state.  Fix this by calling fpsimd_flush_cpu_state() before restoring the kernel
  FPSIMD state.'
