  - CVE-2022-2991
summary: A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the Linux kernel's LightNVM subsystem. The
  issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior
  to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. This vulnerability allows a local attacker
  to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel. The attacker
  must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target system to exploit
  this vulnerability.
