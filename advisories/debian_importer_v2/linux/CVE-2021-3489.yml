summary: 'The eBPF RINGBUF bpf_ringbuf_reserve() function in the Linux kernel did not check
  that the allocated size was smaller than the ringbuf size, allowing an attacker to perform
  out-of-bounds writes within the kernel and therefore, arbitrary code execution. This issue
  was fixed via commit 4b81ccebaeee ("bpf, ringbuf: Deny reserve of buffers larger than ringbuf")
  (v5.13-rc4) and backported to the stable kernels in v5.12.4, v5.11.21, and v5.10.37. It was
  introduced via 457f44363a88 ("bpf: Implement BPF ring buffer and verifier support for it")
  (v5.8-rc1).'
