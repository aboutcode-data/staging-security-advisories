summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: mpi3mr:
  Fix missing mrioc->evtack_cmds initialization  Commit c1af985d27da ("scsi: mpi3mr: Add Event
  acknowledgment logic") introduced an array mrioc->evtack_cmds but initialization of the array
  elements was missed. They are just zero cleared. The function mpi3mr_complete_evt_ack() refers
  host_tag field of the elements. Due to the zero value of the host_tag field, the function
  calls clear_bit() for mrico->evtack_cmds_bitmap with wrong bit index. This results in memory
  access to invalid address and "BUG: KASAN: use-after-free". This BUG was observed at eHBA-9600
  firmware update to version 8.3.1.0. To fix it, add the missing initialization of mrioc->evtack_cmds.'
