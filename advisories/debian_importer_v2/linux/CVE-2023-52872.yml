summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tty: n_gsm: fix
  race condition in status line change on dead connections  gsm_cleanup_mux() cleans up the
  gsm by closing all DLCIs, stopping all timers, removing the virtual tty devices and clearing
  the data queues. This procedure, however, may cause subsequent changes of the virtual modem
  status lines of a DLCI. More data is being added the outgoing data queue and the deleted kick
  timer is restarted to handle this. At this point many resources have already been removed
  by the cleanup procedure. Thus, a kernel panic occurs.  Fix this by proving in gsm_modem_update()
  that the cleanup procedure has not been started and the mux is still alive.  Note that writing
  to a virtual tty is already protected by checks against the DLCI specific connection state.'
