summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/panfrost:
  Fix GEM handle creation ref-counting  panfrost_gem_create_with_handle() previously returned
  a BO but with the only reference being from the handle, which user space could in theory guess
  and release, causing a use-after-free. Additionally if the call to panfrost_gem_mapping_get()
  in panfrost_ioctl_create_bo() failed then a(nother) reference on the BO was dropped.  The
  _create_with_handle() is a problematic pattern, so ditch it and instead create the handle
  in panfrost_ioctl_create_bo(). If the call to panfrost_gem_mapping_get() fails then this means
  that user space has indeed gone behind our back and freed the handle. In which case just return
  an error code.'
