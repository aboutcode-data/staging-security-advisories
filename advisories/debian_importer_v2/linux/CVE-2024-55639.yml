summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: renesas:
  rswitch: avoid use-after-put for a device tree node  The device tree node saved in the rswitch_device
  structure is used at several driver locations. So passing this node to of_node_put() after
  the first use is wrong.  Move of_node_put() for this node to exit paths.'
