  - CVE-2024-42237
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  firmware: cs_dsp:
  Validate payload length before processing block  Move the payload length check in cs_dsp_load()
  and cs_dsp_coeff_load() to be done before the block is processed.  The check that the length
  of a block payload does not exceed the number of remaining bytes in the firwmware file buffer
  was being done near the end of the loop iteration. However, some code before that check used
  the length field without validating it.'
