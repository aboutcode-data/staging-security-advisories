summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  riscv: Sync efi
  page table''s kernel mappings before switching  The EFI page table is initially created as
  a copy of the kernel page table. With VMAP_STACK enabled, kernel stacks are allocated in the
  vmalloc area: if the stack is allocated in a new PGD (one that was not present at the moment
  of the efi page table creation or not synced in a previous vmalloc fault), the kernel will
  take a trap when switching to the efi page table when the vmalloc kernel stack is accessed,
  resulting in a kernel panic.  Fix that by updating the efi kernel mappings before switching
  to the efi page table.'
