summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: qcom: sc7280:
  Fix missing Soundwire runtime stream alloc  Commit 15c7fab0e047 ("ASoC: qcom: Move Soundwire
  runtime stream alloc to soundcards") moved the allocation of Soundwire stream runtime from
  the Qualcomm Soundwire driver to each individual machine sound card driver, except that it
  forgot to update SC7280 card.  Just like for other Qualcomm sound cards using Soundwire, the
  card driver should allocate and release the runtime.  Otherwise sound playback will result
  in a NULL pointer dereference or other effect of uninitialized memory accesses (which was
  confirmed on SDM845 having similar issue).'
