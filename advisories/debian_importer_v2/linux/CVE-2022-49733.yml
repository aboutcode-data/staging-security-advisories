summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: pcm: oss:
  Fix race at SNDCTL_DSP_SYNC  There is a small race window at snd_pcm_oss_sync() that is called
  from OSS PCM SNDCTL_DSP_SYNC ioctl; namely the function calls snd_pcm_oss_make_ready() at
  first, then takes the params_lock mutex for the rest.  When the stream is set up again by
  another thread between them, it leads to inconsistency, and may result in unexpected results
  such as NULL dereference of OSS buffer as a fuzzer spotted recently.  The fix is simply to
  cover snd_pcm_oss_make_ready() call into the same params_lock mutex with snd_pcm_oss_make_ready_locked()
  variant.'
