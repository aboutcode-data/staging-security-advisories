summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: usbtv:
  Remove useless locks in usbtv_video_free()  Remove locks calls in usbtv_video_free() because
  are useless and may led to a deadlock as reported here: https://syzkaller.appspot.com/x/bisect.txt?x=166dc872180000
  Also remove usbtv_stop() call since it will be called when unregistering the device.  Before
  ''c838530d230b'' this issue would only be noticed if you disconnect while streaming and now
  it is noticeable even when disconnecting while not streaming.   [hverkuil: fix minor spelling
  mistake in log message]'
