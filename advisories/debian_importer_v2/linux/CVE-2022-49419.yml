summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  video: fbdev:
  vesafb: Fix a use-after-free due early fb_info cleanup  Commit b3c9a924aab6 ("fbdev: vesafb:
  Cleanup fb_info in .fb_destroy rather than .remove") fixed a use-after-free error due the
  vesafb driver freeing the fb_info in the .remove handler instead of doing it in .fb_destroy.  This
  can happen if the .fb_destroy callback is executed after the .remove callback, since the former
  tries to access a pointer freed by the latter.  But that change didn''t take into account
  that another possible scenario is that .fb_destroy is called before the .remove callback.
  For example, if no process has the fbdev chardev opened by the time the driver is removed.  If
  that''s the case, fb_info will be freed when unregister_framebuffer() is called, making the
  fb_info pointer accessed in vesafb_remove() after that to no longer be valid.  To prevent
  that, move the expression containing the info->par to happen before the unregister_framebuffer()
  function call.'
