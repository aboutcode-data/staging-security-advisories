summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ovl: don''t allow
  datadir only  In theory overlayfs could support upper layer directly referring to a data layer,
  but there''s no current use case for this.  Originally, when data-only layers were introduced,
  this wasn''t allowed, only introduced by the "datadir+" feature, but without actually handling
  this case, resulting in an Oops.  Fix by disallowing datadir without lowerdir.'
