summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: lpfc: Fix
  link down processing to address NULL pointer dereference  If an FC link down transition while
  PLOGIs are outstanding to fabric well known addresses, outstanding ABTS requests may result
  in a NULL pointer dereference. Driver unload requests may hang with repeated "2878" log messages.  The
  Link down processing results in ABTS requests for outstanding ELS requests. The Abort WQEs
  are sent for the ELSs before the driver had set the link state to down. Thus the driver is
  sending the Abort with the expectation that an ABTS will be sent on the wire. The Abort request
  is stalled waiting for the link to come up. In some conditions the driver may auto-complete
  the ELSs thus if the link does come up, the Abort completions may reference an invalid structure.  Fix
  by ensuring that Abort set the flag to avoid link traffic if issued due to conditions where
  the link failed.'
