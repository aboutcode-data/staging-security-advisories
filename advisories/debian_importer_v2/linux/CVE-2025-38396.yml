summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fs: export anon_inode_make_secure_inode()
  and fix secretmem LSM bypass  Export anon_inode_make_secure_inode() to allow KVM guest_memfd
  to create anonymous inodes with proper security context. This replaces the current pattern
  of calling alloc_anon_inode() followed by inode_init_security_anon() for creating security
  context manually.  This change also fixes a security regression in secretmem where the S_PRIVATE
  flag was not cleared after alloc_anon_inode(), causing LSM/SELinux checks to be bypassed for
  secretmem file descriptors.  As guest_memfd currently resides in the KVM module, we need to
  export this symbol for use outside the core kernel. In the future, guest_memfd might be moved
  to core-mm, at which point the symbols no longer would have to be exported. When/if that happens
  is still unclear.'
