summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  serial: pch:
  Fix PCI device refcount leak in pch_request_dma()  As comment of pci_get_slot() says, it returns
  a pci_device with its refcount increased. The caller must decrement the reference count by
  calling pci_dev_put().  Since ''dma_dev'' is only used to filter the channel in filter(),
  we can call pci_dev_put() before exiting from pch_request_dma(). Add the missing pci_dev_put()
  for the normal and error path.'
