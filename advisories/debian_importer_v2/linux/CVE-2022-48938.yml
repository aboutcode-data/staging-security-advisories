summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  CDC-NCM: avoid
  overflow in sanity checking  A broken device may give an extreme offset like 0xFFF0 and a
  reasonable length for a fragment. In the sanity check as formulated now, this will create
  an integer overflow, defeating the sanity check. Both offset and offset + len need to be checked
  in such a manner that no overflow can occur. And those quantities should be unsigned.'
