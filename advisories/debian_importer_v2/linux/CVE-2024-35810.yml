summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/vmwgfx: Fix
  the lifetime of the bo cursor memory  The cleanup can be dispatched while the atomic update
  is still active, which means that the memory acquired in the atomic update needs to not be
  invalidated by the cleanup. The buffer objects in vmw_plane_state instead of using the builtin
  map_and_cache were trying to handle the lifetime of the mapped memory themselves, leading
  to crashes.  Use the map_and_cache instead of trying to manage the lifetime of the buffer
  objects held by the vmw_plane_state.  Fixes kernel oops''es in IGT''s kms_cursor_legacy forked-bo.'
