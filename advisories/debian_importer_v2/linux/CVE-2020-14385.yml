aliases:
  - CVE-2020-14385
summary: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel before 5.9-rc4. A failure of the file system metadata
  validator in XFS can cause an inode with a valid, user-creatable extended attribute to be
  flagged as corrupt. This can lead to the filesystem being shutdown, or otherwise rendered
  inaccessible until it is remounted, leading to a denial of service. The highest threat from
  this vulnerability is to system availability.
