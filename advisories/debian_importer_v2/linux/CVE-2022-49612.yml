summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  power: supply:
  core: Fix boundary conditions in interpolation  The functions power_supply_temp2resist_simple
  and power_supply_ocv2cap_simple handle boundary conditions incorrectly. The change was introduced
  in a4585ba2050f460f749bbaf2b67bd56c41e30283 ("power: supply: core: Use library interpolation").
  There are two issues: First, the lines "high = i - 1" and "high = i" in ocv2cap have the wrong
  order compared to temp2resist. As a consequence, ocv2cap sets high=-1 if ocv>table[0].ocv,
  which causes an out-of-bounds read. Second, the logic of temp2resist is also not correct.
  Consider the case table[] = {{20, 100}, {10, 80}, {0, 60}}. For temp=5, we expect a resistance
  of 70% by interpolation. However, temp2resist sets high=low=2 and returns 60.'
