summary: 'Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information
  record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond
  to which CVE.] Xen offers the ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically
  referred to as "driver domains". Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security
  advantage: if a driver domain gets compromised, it doesn''t have the privileges to take over
  the system. However, a malicious driver domain could try to attack other guests via sending
  events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in the guest due to trying to service
  interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected backends: * blkfront patch
  1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch 3, CVE-2021-28713'
