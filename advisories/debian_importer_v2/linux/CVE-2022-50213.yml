summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: nf_tables:
  do not allow SET_ID to refer to another table  When doing lookups for sets on the same batch
  by using its ID, a set from a different table can be used.  Then, when the table is removed,
  a reference to the set may be kept after the set is freed, leading to a potential use-after-free.  When
  looking for sets by ID, use the table that was used for the lookup by name, and only return
  sets belonging to that same table.  This fixes CVE-2022-2586, also reported as ZDI-CAN-17470.'
