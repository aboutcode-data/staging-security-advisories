summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  staging: vt6655:
  fix some erroneous memory clean-up loops  In some initialization functions of this driver,
  memory is allocated with ''i'' acting as an index variable and increasing from 0. The commit
  in "Fixes" introduces some clean-up codes in case of allocation failure, which free memory
  in reverse order with ''i'' decreasing to 0. However, there are some problems:   - The case
  i=0 is left out. Thus memory is leaked.   - In case memory allocation fails right from the
  start, the memory     freeing loops will start with i=-1 and invalid memory locations will     be
  accessed.  One of these loops has been fixed in commit c8ff91535880 ("staging: vt6655: fix
  potential memory leak"). Fix the remaining erroneous loops.'
