  - CVE-2019-19039
summary: '__btrfs_free_extent in fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.12 calls
  btrfs_print_leaf in a certain ENOENT case, which allows local users to obtain potentially
  sensitive information about register values via the dmesg program. NOTE: The BTRFS development
  team disputes this issues as not being a vulnerability because “1) The kernel provide facilities
  to restrict access to dmesg - dmesg_restrict=1 sysctl option. So it''s really up to the system
  administrator to judge whether dmesg access shall be disallowed or not. 2) WARN/WARN_ON are
  widely used macros in the linux kernel. If this CVE is considered valid this would mean there
  are literally thousands CVE lurking in the kernel - something which clearly is not the case.'
