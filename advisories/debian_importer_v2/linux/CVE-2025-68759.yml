summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: rtl818x:
  Fix potential memory leaks in rtl8180_init_rx_ring()  In rtl8180_init_rx_ring(), memory is
  allocated for skb packets and DMA allocations in a loop. When an allocation fails, the previously
  successful allocations are not freed on exit.  Fix that by jumping to err_free_rings label
  on error, which calls rtl8180_free_rx_ring() to free the allocations. Remove the free of rx_ring
  in rtl8180_init_rx_ring() error path, and set the freed priv->rx_buf entry to null, to avoid
  double free.'
