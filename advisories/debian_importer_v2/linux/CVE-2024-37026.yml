summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/xe: Only
  use reserved BCS instances for usm migrate exec queue  The GuC context scheduling queue is
  2 entires deep, thus it is possible for a migration job to be stuck behind a fault if migration
  exec queue shares engines with user jobs. This can deadlock as the migrate exec queue is required
  to service page faults. Avoid deadlock by only using reserved BCS instances for usm migrate
  exec queue.  (cherry picked from commit 04f4a70a183a688a60fe3882d6e4236ea02cfc67)'
