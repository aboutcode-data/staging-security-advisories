summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ethtool: ioctl:
  fix potential NULL deref in ethtool_set_coalesce()  ethtool_set_coalesce() now uses both the
  .get_coalesce() and .set_coalesce() callbacks. But the check for their availability is buggy,
  so changing the coalesce settings on a device where the driver provides only _one_ of the
  callbacks results in a NULL pointer dereference instead of an -EOPNOTSUPP.  Fix the condition
  so that the availability of both callbacks is ensured. This also matches the netlink code.  Note
  that reproducing this requires some effort - it only affects the legacy ioctl path, and needs
  a specific combination of driver options: - have .get_coalesce() and .coalesce_supported but
  no  .set_coalesce(), or - have .set_coalesce() but no .get_coalesce(). Here eg. ethtool doesn''t   cause
  the crash as it first attempts to call ethtool_get_coalesce()   and bails out on error.'
