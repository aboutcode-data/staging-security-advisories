summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  backlight: led-bl:\
  \ Add devlink to supplier LEDs  LED Backlight is a consumer of one or multiple LED class devices,\
  \ but devlink is currently unable to create correct supplier-producer links when the supplier\
  \ is a class device. It creates instead a link where the supplier is the parent of the expected\
  \ device.  One consequence is that removal order is not correctly enforced.  Issues happen\
  \ for example with the following sections in a device tree overlay:      // An LED driver\
  \ chip     pca9632@62 {         compatible = \"nxp,pca9632\";         reg = <0x62>;  \t//\
  \ ...          addon_led_pwm: led-pwm@3 {             reg = <3>;             label = \"addon:led:pwm\"\
  ;         };     };      backlight-addon {         compatible = \"led-backlight\";       \
  \  leds = <&addon_led_pwm>;         brightness-levels = <255>;         default-brightness-level\
  \ = <255>;     };  In this example, the devlink should be created between the backlight-addon\
  \ (consumer) and the pca9632@62 (supplier). Instead it is created between the backlight-addon\
  \ (consumer) and the parent of the pca9632@62, which is typically the I2C bus adapter.  On\
  \ removal of the above overlay, the LED driver can be removed before the backlight device,\
  \ resulting in:      Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000010\
  \     ...     Call trace:      led_put+0xe0/0x140      devm_led_release+0x6c/0x98  Another\
  \ way to reproduce the bug without any device tree overlays is unbinding the LED class device\
  \ (pca9632@62) before unbinding the consumer (backlight-addon):    echo 11-0062 >/sys/bus/i2c/drivers/leds-pca963x/unbind\
  \   echo ...backlight-dock >/sys/bus/platform/drivers/led-backlight/unbind  Fix by adding\
  \ a devlink between the consuming led-backlight device and the supplying LED device, as other\
  \ drivers and subsystems do as well."
