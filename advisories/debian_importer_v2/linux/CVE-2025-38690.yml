summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/xe/migrate:
  prevent infinite recursion  If the buf + offset is not aligned to XE_CAHELINE_BYTES we fallback
  to using a bounce buffer. However the bounce buffer here is allocated on the stack, and the
  only alignment requirement here is that it''s naturally aligned to u8, and not XE_CACHELINE_BYTES.
  If the bounce buffer is also misaligned we then recurse back into the function again, however
  the new bounce buffer might also not be aligned, and might never be until we eventually blow
  through the stack, as we keep recursing.  Instead of using the stack use kmalloc, which should
  respect the power-of-two alignment request here. Fixes a kernel panic when triggering this
  path through eudebug.  v2 (Stuart):  - Add build bug check for power-of-two restriction  -
  s/EINVAL/ENOMEM/  (cherry picked from commit 38b34e928a08ba594c4bbf7118aa3aadacd62fff)'
