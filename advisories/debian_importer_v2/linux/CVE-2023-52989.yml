summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  firewire: fix
  memory leak for payload of request subaction to IEC 61883-1 FCP region  This patch is fix
  for Linux kernel v2.6.33 or later.  For request subaction to IEC 61883-1 FCP region, Linux
  FireWire subsystem have had an issue of use-after-free. The subsystem allows multiple user
  space listeners to the region, while data of the payload was likely released before the listeners
  execute read(2) to access to it for copying to user space.  The issue was fixed by a commit
  281e20323ab7 ("firewire: core: fix use-after-free regression in FCP handler"). The object
  of payload is duplicated in kernel space for each listener. When the listener executes ioctl(2)
  with FW_CDEV_IOC_SEND_RESPONSE request, the object is going to be released.  However, it causes
  memory leak since the commit relies on call of release_request() in drivers/firewire/core-cdev.c.
  Against the expectation, the function is never called due to the design of release_client_resource().
  The function delegates release task to caller when called with non-NULL fourth argument. The
  implementation of ioctl_send_response() is the case. It should release the object explicitly.  This
  commit fixes the bug.'
