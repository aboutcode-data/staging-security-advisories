summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: comp
  - Use same definition of context alloc and free ops  In commit 42d9f6c77479 ("crypto: acomp
  - Move scomp stream allocation code into acomp"), the crypto_acomp_streams struct was made
  to rely on having the alloc_ctx and free_ctx operations defined in the same order as the scomp_alg
  struct. But in that same commit, the alloc_ctx and free_ctx members of scomp_alg may be randomized
  by structure layout randomization, since they are contained in a pure ops structure (containing
  only function pointers). If the pointers within scomp_alg are randomized, but those in crypto_acomp_streams
  are not, then the order may no longer match. This fixes the problem by removing the union
  from scomp_alg so that both crypto_acomp_streams and scomp_alg will share the same definition
  of alloc_ctx and free_ctx, ensuring they will always have the same layout.'
