summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  blk-iocost: avoid
  out of bounds shift  UBSAN catches undefined behavior in blk-iocost, where sometimes iocg->delay
  is shifted right by a number that is too large, resulting in undefined behavior on some architectures.  [  186.556576]
  ------------[ cut here ]------------ UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in block/blk-iocost.c:1366:23
  shift exponent 64 is too large for 64-bit type ''u64'' (aka ''unsigned long long'') CPU: 16
  PID: 0 Comm: swapper/16 Tainted: G S          E    N 6.9.0-0_fbk700_debug_rc2_kbuilder_0_gc85af715cac0

  Trace:  <IRQ>  dump_stack_lvl+0x8f/0xe0  __ubsan_handle_shift_out_of_bounds+0x22c/0x280  iocg_kick_delay+0x30b/0x310  ioc_timer_fn+0x2fb/0x1f80  __run_timer_base+0x1b6/0x250
  ...  Avoid that undefined behavior by simply taking the "delay = 0" branch if the shift is
  too large.  I am not sure what the symptoms of an undefined value delay will be, but I suspect
  it could be more than a little annoying to debug.'
