summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: hantro:
  Check whether reset op is defined before use  The i.MX8MM/N/P does not define the .reset op
  since reset of the VPU is done by genpd. Check whether the .reset op is defined before calling
  it to avoid NULL pointer dereference.  Note that the Fixes tag is set to the commit which
  removed the reset op from i.MX8M Hantro G2 implementation, this is because before this commit
  all the implementations did define the .reset op.'
