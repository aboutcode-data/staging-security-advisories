  - CVE-2025-37849
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: arm64: Tear
  down vGIC on failed vCPU creation  If kvm_arch_vcpu_create() fails to share the vCPU page
  with the hypervisor, we propagate the error back to the ioctl but leave the vGIC vCPU data
  initialised. Note only does this leak the corresponding memory when the vCPU is destroyed
  but it can also lead to use-after-free if the redistributor device handling tries to walk
  into the vCPU.  Add the missing cleanup to kvm_arch_vcpu_create(), ensuring that the vGIC
  vCPU structures are destroyed on error.'
