summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring/poll:
  don''t reissue in case of poll race on multishot request  A previous commit fixed a poll race
  that can occur, but it''s only applicable for multishot requests. For a multishot request,
  we can safely ignore a spurious wakeup, as we never leave the waitqueue to begin with.  A
  blunt reissue of a multishot armed request can cause us to leak a buffer, if they are ring
  provided. While this seems like a bug in itself, it''s not really defined behavior to reissue
  a multishot request directly. It''s less efficient to do so as well, and not required to rearm
  anything like it is for singleshot poll requests.'
