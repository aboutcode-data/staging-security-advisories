summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nios2: ensure
  that memblock.current_limit is set when setting pfn limits  On nios2, with CONFIG_FLATMEM
  set, the kernel relies on memblock_get_current_limit() to determine the limits of mem_map,
  in particular for max_low_pfn. Unfortunately, memblock.current_limit is only default initialized
  to MEMBLOCK_ALLOC_ANYWHERE at this point of the bootup, potentially leading to situations
  where max_low_pfn can erroneously exceed the value of max_pfn and, thus, the valid range of
  available DRAM.  This can in turn cause kernel-level paging failures, e.g.:  [   76.900000]
  Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 20303000 [   76.900000] ea = c0080890,
  ra = c000462c, cause = 14 [   76.900000] Kernel panic - not syncing: Oops [   76.900000] ---[
  end Kernel panic - not syncing: Oops ]---  This patch fixes this by pre-calculating memblock.current_limit
  based on the upper limits of the available memory ranges via adjust_lowmem_bounds, a simplified
  version of the equivalent implementation within the arm architecture.'
