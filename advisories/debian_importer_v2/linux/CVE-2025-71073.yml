  - CVE-2025-71073
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Input: lkkbd
  - disable pending work before freeing device  lkkbd_interrupt() schedules lk->tq via schedule_work(),
  and the work handler lkkbd_reinit() dereferences the lkkbd structure and its serio/input_dev
  fields.  lkkbd_disconnect() and error paths in lkkbd_connect() free the lkkbd structure without
  preventing the reinit work from being queued again until serio_close() returns. This can allow
  the work handler to run after the structure has been freed, leading to a potential use-after-free.  Use
  disable_work_sync() instead of cancel_work_sync() to ensure the reinit work cannot be re-queued,
  and call it both in lkkbd_disconnect() and in lkkbd_connect() error paths after serio_open().'
