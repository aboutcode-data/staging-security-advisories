summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix potential
  out-of-bounds memory access in nilfs_find_entry()  Syzbot reported that when searching for
  records in a directory where the inode''s i_size is corrupted and has a large value, memory
  access outside the folio/page range may occur, or a use-after-free bug may be detected if
  KASAN is enabled.  This is because nilfs_last_byte(), which is called by nilfs_find_entry()
  and others to calculate the number of valid bytes of directory data in a page from i_size
  and the page index, loses the upper 32 bits of the 64-bit size information due to an inappropriate
  type of local variable to which the i_size value is assigned.  This caused a large byte offset
  value due to underflow in the end address calculation in the calling nilfs_find_entry(), resulting
  in memory access that exceeds the folio/page size.  Fix this issue by changing the type of
  the local variable causing the bit loss from "unsigned int" to "u64".  The return value of
  nilfs_last_byte() is also of type "unsigned int", but it is truncated so as not to exceed
  PAGE_SIZE and no bit loss occurs, so no change is required.'
