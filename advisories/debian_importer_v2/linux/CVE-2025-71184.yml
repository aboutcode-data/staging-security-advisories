summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: fix NULL
  dereference on root when tracing inode eviction  When evicting an inode the first thing we
  do is to setup tracing for it, which implies fetching the root''s id. But in btrfs_evict_inode()
  the root might be NULL, as implied in the next check that we do in btrfs_evict_inode().  Hence,
  we either should set the ->root_objectid to 0 in case the root is NULL, or we move tracing
  setup after checking that the root is not NULL. Setting the rootid to 0 at least gives us
  the possibility to trace this call even in the case when the root is NULL, so that''s the
  solution taken here.'
