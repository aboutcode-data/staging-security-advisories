summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: amd: acp:
  Fix incorrect retrival of acp_chip_info  Use dev_get_drvdata(dev->parent) instead of dev_get_platdata(dev)
  to correctly obtain acp_chip_info members in the acp I2S driver. Previously, some members
  were not updated properly due to incorrect data access, which could potentially lead to null
  pointer dereferences.  This issue was missed in the earlier commit ("ASoC: amd: acp: Fix NULL
  pointer deref in acp_i2s_set_tdm_slot"), which only addressed set_tdm_slot(). This change
  ensures that all relevant functions correctly retrieve acp_chip_info, preventing further null
  pointer dereference issues.'
