summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfc: pn533: Clear
  nfc_target before being used  Fix a slab-out-of-bounds read that occurs in nla_put() called
  from nfc_genl_send_target() when target->sensb_res_len, which is duplicated from an nfc_target
  in pn533, is too large as the nfc_target is not properly initialized and retains garbage values.
  Clear nfc_targets with memset() before they are used.  Found by a modified version of syzkaller.  BUG:
  KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in nla_put Call Trace:  memcpy  nla_put  nfc_genl_dump_targets  genl_lock_dumpit  netlink_dump  __netlink_dump_start  genl_family_rcv_msg_dumpit  genl_rcv_msg  netlink_rcv_skb  genl_rcv  netlink_unicast  netlink_sendmsg  sock_sendmsg  ____sys_sendmsg  ___sys_sendmsg  __sys_sendmsg  do_syscall_64'
