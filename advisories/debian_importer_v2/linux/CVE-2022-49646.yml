summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: mac80211:
  fix queue selection for mesh/OCB interfaces  When using iTXQ, the code assumes that there
  is only one vif queue for broadcast packets, using the BE queue. Allowing non-BE queue marking
  violates that assumption and txq->ac == skb_queue_mapping is no longer guaranteed. This can
  cause issues with queue handling in the driver and also causes issues with the recent ATF
  change, resulting in an AQL underflow warning.'
