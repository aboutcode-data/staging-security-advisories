summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  firmware: arm_scmi:
  Fix list protocols enumeration in the base protocol  While enumerating protocols implemented
  by the SCMI platform using BASE_DISCOVER_LIST_PROTOCOLS, the number of returned protocols
  is currently validated in an improper way since the check employs a sum between unsigned integers
  that could overflow and cause the check itself to be silently bypassed if the returned value
  ''loop_num_ret'' is big enough.  Fix the validation avoiding the addition.'
