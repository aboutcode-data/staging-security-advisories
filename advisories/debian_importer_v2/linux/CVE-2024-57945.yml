summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  riscv: mm: Fix
  the out of bound issue of vmemmap address  In sparse vmemmap model, the virtual address of
  vmemmap is calculated as: ((struct page *)VMEMMAP_START - (phys_ram_base >> PAGE_SHIFT)).
  And the struct page''s va can be calculated with an offset: (vmemmap + (pfn)).  However, when
  initializing struct pages, kernel actually starts from the first page from the same section
  that phys_ram_base belongs to. If the first page''s physical address is not (phys_ram_base
  >> PAGE_SHIFT), then we get an va below VMEMMAP_START when calculating va for it''s struct
  page.  For example, if phys_ram_base starts from 0x82000000 with pfn 0x82000, the first page
  in the same section is actually pfn 0x80000. During init_unavailable_range(), we will initialize
  struct page for pfn 0x80000 with virtual address ((struct page *)VMEMMAP_START - 0x2000),
  which is below VMEMMAP_START as well as PCI_IO_END.  This commit fixes this bug by introducing
  a new variable ''vmemmap_start_pfn'' which is aligned with memory section size and using it
  to calculate vmemmap address instead of phys_ram_base.'
