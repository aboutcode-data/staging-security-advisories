summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  open_tree_attr:
  do not allow id-mapping changes without OPEN_TREE_CLONE  As described in commit 7a54947e727b
  (''Merge patch series "fs: allow changing idmappings"''), open_tree_attr(2) was necessary
  in order to allow for a detached mount to be created and have its idmappings changed without
  the risk of any racing threads operating on it. For this reason, mount_setattr(2) still does
  not allow for id-mappings to be changed.  However, there was a bug in commit 2462651ffa76
  ("fs: allow changing idmappings") which allowed users to bypass this restriction by calling
  open_tree_attr(2) *without* OPEN_TREE_CLONE.  can_idmap_mount() prevented this bug from allowing
  an attached mountpoint''s id-mapping from being modified (thanks to an is_anon_ns() check),
  but this still allows for detached (but visible) mounts to have their be id-mapping changed.
  This risks the same UAF and locking issues as described in the merge commit, and was likely
  unintentional.'
