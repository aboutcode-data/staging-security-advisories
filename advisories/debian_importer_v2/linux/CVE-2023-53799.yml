summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: api -
  Use work queue in crypto_destroy_instance  The function crypto_drop_spawn expects to be called
  in process context.  However, when an instance is unregistered while it still has active users,
  the last user may cause the instance to be freed in atomic context.  Fix this by delaying
  the freeing to a work queue.'
