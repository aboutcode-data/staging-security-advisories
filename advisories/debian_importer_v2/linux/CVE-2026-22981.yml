summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  idpf: detach\
  \ and close netdevs while handling a reset  Protect the reset path from callbacks by setting\
  \ the netdevs to detached state and close any netdevs in UP state until the reset handling\
  \ has completed. During a reset, the driver will de-allocate resources for the vport, and\
  \ there is no guarantee that those will recover, which is why the existing vport_ctrl_lock\
  \ does not provide sufficient protection.  idpf_detach_and_close() is called right before\
  \ reset handling. If the reset handling succeeds, the netdevs state is recovered via call\
  \ to idpf_attach_and_open(). If the reset handling fails the netdevs remain down. The detach/down\
  \ calls are protected with RTNL lock to avoid racing with callbacks. On the recovery side\
  \ the attach can be done without holding the RTNL lock as there are no callbacks expected\
  \ at that point, due to detach/close always being done first in that flow.  The previous logic\
  \ restoring the netdevs state based on the IDPF_VPORT_UP_REQUESTED flag in the init task is\
  \ not needed anymore, hence the removal of idpf_set_vport_state(). The IDPF_VPORT_UP_REQUESTED\
  \ is still being used to restore the state of the netdevs following the reset, but has no\
  \ use outside of the reset handling flow.  idpf_init_hard_reset() is converted to void, since\
  \ it was used as such and there is no error handling being done based on its return value.\
  \  Before this change, invoking hard and soft resets simultaneously will cause the driver\
  \ to lose the vport state: ip -br a <inf>\tUP echo 1 > /sys/class/net/ens801f0/device/reset&\
  \ \\ ethtool -L ens801f0 combined 8 ip -br a <inf>\tDOWN ip link set <inf> up ip -br a <inf>\t\
  DOWN  Also in case of a failure in the reset path, the netdev is left exposed to external\
  \ callbacks, while vport resources are not initialized, leading to a crash on subsequent ifup/down:\
