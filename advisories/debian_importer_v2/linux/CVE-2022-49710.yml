  - CVE-2022-49710
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dm mirror log:
  round up region bitmap size to BITS_PER_LONG  The code in dm-log rounds up bitset_size to
  32 bits. It then uses find_next_zero_bit_le on the allocated region. find_next_zero_bit_le
  accesses the bitmap using unsigned long pointers. So, on 64-bit architectures, it may access
  4 bytes beyond the allocated size.  Fix this bug by rounding up bitset_size to BITS_PER_LONG.  This
  bug was found by running the lvm2 testsuite with kasan.'
