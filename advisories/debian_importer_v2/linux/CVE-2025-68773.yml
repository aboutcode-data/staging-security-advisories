summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  spi: fsl-cpm:
  Check length parity before switching to 16 bit mode  Commit fc96ec826bce ("spi: fsl-cpm: Use
  16 bit mode for large transfers with even size") failed to make sure that the size is really
  even before switching to 16 bit mode. Until recently the problem went unnoticed because kernfs
  uses a pre-allocated bounce buffer of size PAGE_SIZE for reading EEPROM.  But commit 8ad6249c51d0
  ("eeprom: at25: convert to spi-mem API") introduced an additional dynamically allocated bounce
  buffer whose size is exactly the size of the transfer, leading to a buffer overrun in the
  fsl-cpm driver when that size is odd.  Add the missing length parity verification and remain
  in 8 bit mode when the length is not even.'
