summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: dwc3: core:
  Prevent USB core invalid event buffer address access  This commit addresses an issue where
  the USB core could access an invalid event buffer address during runtime suspend, potentially
  causing SMMU faults and other memory issues in Exynos platforms. The problem arises from the
  following sequence.         1. In dwc3_gadget_suspend, there is a chance of a timeout when         moving
  the USB core to the halt state after clearing the         run/stop bit by software.         2.
  In dwc3_core_exit, the event buffer is cleared regardless of         the USB core''s status,
  which may lead to an SMMU faults and         other memory issues. if the USB core tries to
  access the event         buffer address.  To prevent this hardware quirk on Exynos platforms,
  this commit ensures that the event buffer address is not cleared by software  when the USB
  core is active during runtime suspend by checking its status before clearing the buffer address.'
