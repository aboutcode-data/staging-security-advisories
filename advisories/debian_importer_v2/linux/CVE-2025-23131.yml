summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dlm: prevent
  NPD when writing a positive value to event_done  do_uevent returns the value written to event_done.
  In case it is a positive value, new_lockspace would undo all the work, and lockspace would
  not be set. __dlm_new_lockspace, however, would treat that positive value as a success due
  to commit 8511a2728ab8 ("dlm: fix use count with multiple joins").  Down the line, device_create_lockspace
  would pass that NULL lockspace to dlm_find_lockspace_local, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.  Treating
  such positive values as successes prevents the problem. Given this has been broken for so
  long, this is unlikely to break userspace expectations.'
