summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: etas_es58x:
  es58x_rx_err_msg(): fix memory leak in error path  In es58x_rx_err_msg(), if can->do_set_mode()
  fails, the function directly returns without calling netif_rx(skb). This means that the skb
  previously allocated by alloc_can_err_skb() is not freed. In other terms, this is a memory
  leak.  This patch simply removes the return statement in the error branch and let the function
  continue.  Issue was found with GCC -fanalyzer, please follow the link below for details.'
