summary: A use-after-free flaw was found in fs/userfaultfd.c in the Linux kernel before 4.13.6.
  The issue is related to the handling of fork failure when dealing with event messages. Failure
  to fork correctly can lead to a situation where a fork event will be removed from an already
  freed list of events with userfaultfd_ctx_put().
