summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i40e: fix race\
  \ condition by adding filter's intermediate sync state  Fix a race condition in the i40e driver\
  \ that leads to MAC/VLAN filters becoming corrupted and leaking. Address the issue that occurs\
  \ under heavy load when multiple threads are concurrently modifying MAC/VLAN filters by setting\
  \ mac and port VLAN.  1. Thread T0 allocates a filter in i40e_add_filter() within        \
  \ i40e_ndo_set_vf_port_vlan(). 2. Thread T1 concurrently frees the filter in __i40e_del_filter()\
  \ within         i40e_ndo_set_vf_mac(). 3. Subsequently, i40e_service_task() calls i40e_sync_vsi_filters(),\
  \ which         refers to the already freed filter memory, causing corruption.  Reproduction\
  \ steps: 1. Spawn multiple VFs. 2. Apply a concurrent heavy load by running parallel operations\
  \ to change         MAC addresses on the VFs and change port VLANs on the host. 3. Observe\
  \ errors in dmesg: \"Error I40E_AQ_RC_ENOSPC adding RX filters on VF XX, \tplease set promiscuous\
  \ on manually for VF XX\".  Exact code for stable reproduction Intel can't open-source now.\
  \  The fix involves implementing a new intermediate filter state, I40E_FILTER_NEW_SYNC, for\
  \ the time when a filter is on a tmp_add_list. These filters cannot be deleted from the hash\
  \ list directly but must be removed using the full process."
