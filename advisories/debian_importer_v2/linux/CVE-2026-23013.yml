summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: octeon_ep_vf:
  fix free_irq dev_id mismatch in IRQ rollback  octep_vf_request_irqs() requests MSI-X queue
  IRQs with dev_id set to ioq_vector. If request_irq() fails part-way, the rollback loop calls
  free_irq() with dev_id set to ''oct'', which does not match the original dev_id and may leave
  the irqaction registered.  This can keep IRQ handlers alive while ioq_vector is later freed
  during unwind/teardown, leading to a use-after-free or crash when an interrupt fires.  Fix
  the error path to free IRQs with the same ioq_vector dev_id used during request_irq().'
