summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ocfs2: handle
  a symlink read error correctly  Patch series "Convert ocfs2 to use folios".  Mark did a conversion
  of ocfs2 to use folios and sent it to me as a giant patch for review ;-)  So I''ve redone
  it as individual patches, and credited Mark for the patches where his code is substantially
  the same.  It''s not a bad way to do it; his patch had some bugs and my patches had some bugs.  Hopefully
  all our bugs were different from each other.  And hopefully Mark likes all the changes I made
  to his code!   This patch (of 23):  If we can''t read the buffer, be sure to unlock the page
  before returning.'
