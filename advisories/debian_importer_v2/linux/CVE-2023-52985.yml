  Do not power down eth-phy  Currently if suspending using either freeze or memory state, the
  fec driver tries to power down the phy which leads to crash of the kernel and non-responsible
  kernel with the following call trace:  [   24.839889 ] Call trace: [   24.839892 ]  phy_error+0x18/0x60
  [   24.839898 ]  kszphy_handle_interrupt+0x6c/0x80 [   24.839903 ]  phy_interrupt+0x20/0x2c
  [   24.839909 ]  irq_thread_fn+0x30/0xa0 [   24.839919 ]  irq_thread+0x178/0x2c0 [   24.839925
  ]  kthread+0x154/0x160 [   24.839932 ]  ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20  Since there is currently
