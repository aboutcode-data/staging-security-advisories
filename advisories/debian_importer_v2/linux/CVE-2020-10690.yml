  - CVE-2020-10690
summary: There is a use-after-free in kernel versions before 5.5 due to a race condition between
  the release of ptp_clock and cdev while resource deallocation. When a (high privileged) process
  allocates a ptp device file (like /dev/ptpX) and voluntarily goes to sleep. During this time
  if the underlying device is removed, it can cause an exploitable condition as the process
  wakes up to terminate and clean all attached files. The system crashes due to the cdev structure
  being invalid (as already freed) which is pointed to by the inode.
