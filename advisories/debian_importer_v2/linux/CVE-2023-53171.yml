summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vfio/type1: prevent
  underflow of locked_vm via exec()  When a vfio container is preserved across exec, the task
  does not change, but it gets a new mm with locked_vm=0, and loses the count from existing
  dma mappings.  If the user later unmaps a dma mapping, locked_vm underflows to a large unsigned
  value, and a subsequent dma map request fails with ENOMEM in __account_locked_vm.  To avoid
  underflow, grab and save the mm at the time a dma is mapped. Use that mm when adjusting locked_vm,
  rather than re-acquiring the saved task''s mm, which may have changed.  If the saved mm is
  dead, do nothing.  locked_vm is incremented for existing mappings in a subsequent patch.'
