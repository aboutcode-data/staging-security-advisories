summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KEYS: trusted:
  dcp: fix improper sg use with CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y  With vmalloc stack addresses enabled (CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y)
  DCP trusted keys can crash during en- and decryption of the blob encryption key via the DCP
  crypto driver. This is caused by improperly using sg_init_one() with vmalloc''d stack buffers
  (plain_key_blob).  Fix this by always using kmalloc() for buffers we give to the DCP crypto
  driver.'
