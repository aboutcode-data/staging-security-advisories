summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ocfs2: fix data
  corruption after failed write  When buffered write fails to copy data into underlying page
  cache page, ocfs2_write_end_nolock() just zeroes out and dirties the page.  This can leave
  dirty page beyond EOF and if page writeback tries to write this page before write succeeds
  and expands i_size, page gets into inconsistent state where page dirty bit is clear but buffer
  dirty bits stay set resulting in page data never getting written and so data copied to the
  page is lost.  Fix the problem by invalidating page beyond EOF after failed write.'
