summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fbdev: Fix vmalloc
  out-of-bounds write in fast_imageblit  This issue triggers when a userspace program does an
  ioctl FBIOPUT_CON2FBMAP by passing console number and frame buffer number. Ideally this maps
  console to frame buffer and updates the screen if console is visible.  As part of mapping
  it has to do resize of console according to frame buffer info. if this resize fails and returns
  from vc_do_resize() and continues further. At this point console and new frame buffer are
  mapped and sets display vars. Despite failure still it continue to proceed updating the screen
  at later stages where vc_data is related to previous frame buffer and frame buffer info and
  display vars are mapped to new frame buffer and eventully leading to out-of-bounds write in
  fast_imageblit(). This bheviour is excepted only when fg_console is equal to requested console
  which is a visible console and updates screen with invalid struct references in fbcon_putcs().'
