  - CVE-2021-47368
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  enetc: Fix illegal
  access when reading affinity_hint  irq_set_affinity_hit() stores a reference to the cpumask_t
  parameter in the irq descriptor, and that reference can be accessed later from irq_affinity_hint_proc_show().
  Since the cpu_mask parameter passed to irq_set_affinity_hit() has only temporary storage (it''s
  on the stack memory), later accesses to it are illegal. Thus reads from the corresponding
  procfs affinity_hint file can result in paging request oops.  The issue is fixed by the get_cpu_mask()
  helper, which provides a permanent storage for the cpumask_t parameter.'
