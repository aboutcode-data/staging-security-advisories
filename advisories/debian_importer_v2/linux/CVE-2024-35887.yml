summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ax25: fix use-after-free
  bugs caused by ax25_ds_del_timer  When the ax25 device is detaching, the ax25_dev_device_down()
  calls ax25_ds_del_timer() to cleanup the slave_timer. When the timer handler is running, the
  ax25_ds_del_timer() that calls del_timer() in it will return directly. As a result, the use-after-free
  bugs could happen, one of the scenarios is shown below:        (Thread 1)          |      (Thread
  2)                           | ax25_ds_timeout() ax25_dev_device_down()    |   ax25_ds_del_timer()     |     del_timer()           |   ax25_dev_put()
  //FREE   |                           |  ax25_dev-> //USE  In order to mitigate bugs, when
  the device is detaching, use timer_shutdown_sync() to stop the timer.'
