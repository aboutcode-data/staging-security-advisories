  - CVE-2022-50567
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fs: jfs: fix
  shift-out-of-bounds in dbAllocAG  Syzbot found a crash : UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in dbAllocAG.
  The underlying bug is the missing check of bmp->db_agl2size. The field can be greater than
  64 and trigger the shift-out-of-bounds.  Fix this bug by adding a check of bmp->db_agl2size
  in dbMount since this field is used in many following functions. The upper bound for this
  field is L2MAXL2SIZE - L2MAXAG, thanks for the help of Dave Kleikamp. Note that, for maintenance,
  I reorganized error handling code of dbMount.'
