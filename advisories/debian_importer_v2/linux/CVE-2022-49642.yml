summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: stmmac:
  dwc-qos: Disable split header for Tegra194  There is a long-standing issue with the Synopsys
  DWC Ethernet driver for Tegra194 where random system crashes have been observed [0]. The problem
  occurs when the split header feature is enabled in the stmmac driver. In the bad case, a larger
  than expected buffer length is received and causes the calculation of the total buffer length
  to overflow. This results in a very large buffer length that causes the kernel to crash. Why
  this larger buffer length is received is not clear, however, the feedback from the NVIDIA
  design team is that the split header feature is not supported for Tegra194. Therefore, disable
  split header support for Tegra194 to prevent these random crashes from occurring.  [0] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-tegra/b0b17697-f23e-8fa5-3757-604a86f3a095@nvidia.com/'
