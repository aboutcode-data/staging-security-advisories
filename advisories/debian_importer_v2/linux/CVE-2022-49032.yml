summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iio: health:
  afe4404: Fix oob read in afe4404_[read|write]_raw  KASAN report out-of-bounds read as follows:  BUG:
  KASAN: global-out-of-bounds in afe4404_read_raw+0x2ce/0x380 Read of size 4 at addr ffffffffc00e4658
  by task cat/278  Call Trace:  afe4404_read_raw  iio_read_channel_info  dev_attr_show  The
  buggy address belongs to the variable:  afe4404_channel_leds+0x18/0xffffffffffffe9c0  This
  issue can be reproduce by singe command:   $ cat /sys/bus/i2c/devices/0-0058/iio\:device0/in_intensity6_raw  The
  array size of afe4404_channel_leds and afe4404_channel_offdacs are less than channels, so
  access with chan->address cause OOB read in afe4404_[read|write]_raw. Fix it by moving access
  before use them.'
