  - CVE-2013-1958
summary: The scm_check_creds function in net/core/scm.c in the Linux kernel before 3.8.6 does
  not properly enforce capability requirements for controlling the PID value associated with
  a UNIX domain socket, which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging
  the time interval during which a user namespace has been created but a PID namespace has not
  been created.
