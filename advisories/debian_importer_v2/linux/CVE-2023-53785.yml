summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mt76: mt7921:
  don''t assume adequate headroom for SDIO headers  mt7921_usb_sdio_tx_prepare_skb() calls mt7921_usb_sdio_write_txwi()
  and mt7921_skb_add_usb_sdio_hdr(), both of which blindly assume that adequate headroom will
  be available in the passed skb. This assumption typically is satisfied when the skb was allocated
  in the net core for transmission via the mt7921 netdev (although even that is only an optimization
  and is not strictly guaranteed), but the assumption is sometimes not satisfied when the skb
  originated in the receive path of another netdev and was passed through to the mt7921, such
  as by the bridge layer. Blindly prepending bytes to an skb is always wrong.  This commit introduces
  a call to skb_cow_head() before the call to mt7921_usb_sdio_write_txwi() in mt7921_usb_sdio_tx_prepare_skb()
  to ensure that at least MT_SDIO_TXD_SIZE + MT_SDIO_HDR_SIZE bytes can be pushed onto the skb.  Without
  this fix, I can trivially cause kernel panics by bridging an MT7921AU-based USB 802.11ax interface
  with an Ethernet interface on an Intel Atom-based x86 system using its onboard RTL8169 PCI
  Ethernet adapter and also on an ARM-based Raspberry Pi 1 using its onboard SMSC9512 USB Ethernet
  adapter. Note that the panics do not occur in every system configuration, as they occur only
  if the receiving netdev leaves less headroom in its received skbs than the mt7921 needs for
  its SDIO headers.  Here is an example stack trace of this panic on Raspberry Pi OS Lite 2023-02-21
  running kernel 6.1.24+ [1]:   skb_panic from skb_push+0x44/0x48  skb_push from mt7921_usb_sdio_tx_prepare_skb+0xd4/0x190

  the mt7921 interface works fine on both of my previously problematic systems.  [1] https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/tree/5c276f55a4b21345cd4d6200a504ee991851ff7a'
