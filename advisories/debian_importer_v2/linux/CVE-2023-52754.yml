summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: imon:
  fix access to invalid resource for the second interface  imon driver probes two USB interfaces,
  and at the probe of the second interface, the driver assumes blindly that the first interface
  got bound with the same imon driver.  It''s usually true, but it''s still possible that the
  first interface is bound with another driver via a malformed descriptor.  Then it may lead
  to a memory corruption, as spotted by syzkaller; imon driver accesses the data from drvdata
  as struct imon_context object although it''s a completely different one that was assigned
  by another driver.  This patch adds a sanity check -- whether the first interface is really
  bound with the imon driver or not -- for avoiding the problem above at the probe time.'
