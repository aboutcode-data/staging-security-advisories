summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  spi: bcm2835:
  Fix out-of-bounds access with more than 4 slaves  Commit 571e31fa60b3 ("spi: bcm2835: Cache
  CS register value for ->prepare_message()") limited the number of slaves to 3 at compile-time.
  The limitation was necessitated by a statically-sized array prepare_cs[] in the driver private
  data which contains a per-slave register value.  The commit sought to enforce the limitation
  at run-time by setting the controller''s num_chipselect to 3:  Slaves with a higher chipselect
  are rejected by spi_add_device().  However the commit neglected that num_chipselect only limits
  the number of *native* chipselects.  If GPIO chipselects are specified in the device tree
  for more than 3 slaves, num_chipselect is silently raised by of_spi_get_gpio_numbers() and
  the result are out-of-bounds accesses to the statically-sized array prepare_cs[].  As a bandaid
  fix which is backportable to stable, raise the number of allowed slaves to 24 (which "ought
  to be enough for anybody"), enforce the limitation on slave ->setup and revert num_chipselect
  to 3 (which is the number of native chipselects supported by the controller). An upcoming
  for-next commit will allow an arbitrary number of slaves.'
