summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: nxp: imx8-isi:
  Check whether crossbar pad is non-NULL before access  When translating source to sink streams
  in the crossbar subdev, the driver tries to locate the remote subdev connected to the sink
  pad. The remote pad may be NULL, if userspace tries to enable a stream that ends at an unconnected
  crossbar sink. When that occurs, the driver dereferences the NULL pad, leading to a crash.  Prevent
  the crash by checking if the pad is NULL before using it, and return an error if it is.'
