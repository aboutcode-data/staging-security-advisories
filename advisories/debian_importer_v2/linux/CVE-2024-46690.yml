summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfsd: fix nfsd4_deleg_getattr_conflict
  in presence of third party lease  It is not safe to dereference fl->c.flc_owner without first
  confirming fl->fl_lmops is the expected manager.  nfsd4_deleg_getattr_conflict() tests fl_lmops
  but largely ignores the result and assumes that flc_owner is an nfs4_delegation anyway.  This
  is wrong.  With this patch we restore the "!= &nfsd_lease_mng_ops" case to behave as it did
  before the change mentioned below.  This is the same as the current code, but without any
  reference to a possible delegation.'
