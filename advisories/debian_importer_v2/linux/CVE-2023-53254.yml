summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cacheinfo: Fix\
  \ shared_cpu_map to handle shared caches at different levels  The cacheinfo sets up the shared_cpu_map\
  \ by checking whether the caches with the same index are shared between CPUs. However, this\
  \ will trigger slab-out-of-bounds access if the CPUs do not have the same cache hierarchy.\
  \ Another problem is the mismatched shared_cpu_map when the shared cache does not have the\
  \ same index between CPUs.  CPU0\tI\tD\tL3 index\t0\t1\t2\tx \t^\t^\t^\t^ index\t0\t1\t2\t\
  3 CPU1\tI\tD\tL2\tL3  This patch checks each cache is shared with all caches on other CPUs."
