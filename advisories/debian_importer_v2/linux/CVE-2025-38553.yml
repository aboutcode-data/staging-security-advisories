summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/sched: Restrict
  conditions for adding duplicating netems to qdisc tree  netem_enqueue''s duplication prevention
  logic breaks when a netem resides in a qdisc tree with other netems - this can lead to a soft
  lockup and OOM loop in netem_dequeue, as seen in [1]. Ensure that a duplicating netem cannot
  exist in a tree with other netems.  Previous approaches suggested in discussions in chronological
  order:  1) Track duplication status or ttl in the sk_buff struct. Considered too specific
  a use case to extend such a struct, though this would be a resilient fix and address other
  previous and potential future DOS bugs like the one described in loopy fun [2].  2) Restrict
  netem_enqueue recursion depth like in act_mirred with a per cpu variable. However, netem_dequeue
  can call enqueue on its child, and the depth restriction could be bypassed if the child is
  a netem.  3) Use the same approach as in 2, but add metadata in netem_skb_cb to handle the
  netem_dequeue case and track a packet''s involvement in duplication. This is an overly complex
  approach, and Jamal notes that the skb cb can be overwritten to circumvent this safeguard.  4)
  Prevent the addition of a netem to a qdisc tree if its ancestral path contains a netem. However,
  filters and actions can cause a packet to change paths when re-enqueued to the root from netem
  duplication, leading us to the current solution: prevent a duplicating netem from inhabiting
  the same tree as other netems.  [1] https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/8DuRWwfqjoRDLDmBMlIfbrsZg9Gx50DHJc1ilxsEBNe2D6NMoigR_eIRIG0LOjMc3r10nUUZtArXx4oZBIdUfZQrwjcQhdinnMis_0G7VEk=@willsroot.io/
