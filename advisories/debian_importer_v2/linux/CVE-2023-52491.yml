summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: mtk-jpeg:\
  \ Fix use after free bug due to error path handling in mtk_jpeg_dec_device_run  In mtk_jpeg_probe,\
  \ &jpeg->job_timeout_work is bound with mtk_jpeg_job_timeout_work.  In mtk_jpeg_dec_device_run,\
  \ if error happens in mtk_jpeg_set_dec_dst, it will finally start the worker while mark the\
  \ job as finished by invoking v4l2_m2m_job_finish.  There are two methods to trigger the bug.\
  \ If we remove the module, it which will call mtk_jpeg_remove to make cleanup. The possible\
  \ sequence is as follows, which will cause a use-after-free bug.  CPU0                  CPU1\
  \ mtk_jpeg_dec_...    |   start worker\t    |                     |mtk_jpeg_job_timeout_work\
  \ mtk_jpeg_remove     |   v4l2_m2m_release  |     kfree(m2m_dev); |                     |\
  \                     | v4l2_m2m_get_curr_priv                     |   m2m_dev->curr_ctx //use\
  \  If we close the file descriptor, which will call mtk_jpeg_release, it will have a similar\
  \ sequence.  Fix this bug by starting timeout worker only if started jpegdec worker successfully.\
  \ Then v4l2_m2m_job_finish will only be called in either mtk_jpeg_job_timeout_work or mtk_jpeg_dec_device_run."
