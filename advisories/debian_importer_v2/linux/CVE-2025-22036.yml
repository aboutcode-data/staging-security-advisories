summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  exfat: fix random\
  \ stack corruption after get_block  When get_block is called with a buffer_head allocated\
  \ on the stack, such as do_mpage_readpage, stack corruption due to buffer_head UAF may occur\
  \ in the following race condition situation.       <CPU 0>                      <CPU 1> mpage_read_folio\
  \   <<bh on stack>>   do_mpage_readpage     exfat_get_block       bh_read         __bh_read\
  \ \t  get_bh(bh)           submit_bh           wait_on_buffer                            \
  \   ...                               end_buffer_read_sync                               \

  \    .    . another_function   <<variable A on stack>>                                   \
  \ put_bh(bh)                                      atomic_dec(bh->b_count)   * stack corruption\
  \ here *  This patch returns -EAGAIN if a folio does not have buffers when bh_read needs to\
  \ be called. By doing this, the caller can fallback to functions like block_read_full_folio(),\
  \ create a buffer_head in the folio, and then call get_block again.  Let's do not call bh_read()\
  \ with on-stack buffer_head."
