summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cfg80211: fix
  management registrations locking  The management registrations locking was broken, the list
  was locked for each wdev, but cfg80211_mgmt_registrations_update() iterated it without holding
  all the correct spinlocks, causing list corruption.  Rather than trying to fix it with fine-grained
  locking, just move the lock to the wiphy/rdev (still need the list on each wdev), we already
  need to hold the wdev lock to change it, so there''s no contention on the lock in any case.
  This trivially fixes the bug since we hold one wdev''s lock already, and now will hold the
  lock that protects all lists.'
