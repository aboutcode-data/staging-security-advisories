summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: fix out-of-bounds
  access in ops_init  net_alloc_generic is called by net_alloc, which is called without any
  locking. It reads max_gen_ptrs, which is changed under pernet_ops_rwsem. It is read twice,
  first to allocate an array, then to set s.len, which is later used to limit the bounds of
  the array access.  It is possible that the array is allocated and another thread is registering
  a new pernet ops, increments max_gen_ptrs, which is then used to set s.len with a larger than
  allocated length for the variable array.  Fix it by reading max_gen_ptrs only once in net_alloc_generic.
  If max_gen_ptrs is later incremented, it will be caught in net_assign_generic.'
