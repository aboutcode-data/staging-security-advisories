summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PM: sleep: Fix
  possible deadlocks in core system-wide PM code  It is reported that in low-memory situations
  the system-wide resume core code deadlocks, because async_schedule_dev() executes its argument
  function synchronously if it cannot allocate memory (and not only in that case) and that function
  attempts to acquire a mutex that is already held.  Executing the argument function synchronously
  from within dpm_async_fn() may also be problematic for ordering reasons (it may cause a consumer
  device''s resume callback to be invoked before a requisite supplier device''s one, for example).  Address
  this by changing the code in question to use async_schedule_dev_nocall() for scheduling the
  asynchronous execution of device suspend and resume functions and to directly run them synchronously
  if async_schedule_dev_nocall() returns false.'
