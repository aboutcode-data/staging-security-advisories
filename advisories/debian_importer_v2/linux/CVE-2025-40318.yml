summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: hci_sync:
  fix race in hci_cmd_sync_dequeue_once  hci_cmd_sync_dequeue_once() does lookup and then cancel
  the entry under two separate lock sections. Meanwhile, hci_cmd_sync_work() can also delete
  the same entry, leading to double list_del() and "UAF".  Fix this by holding cmd_sync_work_lock
  across both lookup and cancel, so that the entry cannot be removed concurrently.'
