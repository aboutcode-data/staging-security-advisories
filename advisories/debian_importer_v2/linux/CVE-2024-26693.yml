summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: iwlwifi:
  mvm: fix a crash when we run out of stations  A DoS tool that injects loads of authentication
  frames made our AP crash. The iwl_mvm_is_dup() function couldn''t find the per-queue dup_data
  which was not allocated.  The root cause for that is that we ran out of stations in the firmware
  and we didn''t really add the station to the firmware, yet we didn''t return an error to mac80211.
  Mac80211 was thinking that we have the station and because of that, sta_info::uploaded was
  set to 1. This allowed ieee80211_find_sta_by_ifaddr() to return a valid station object, but
  that ieee80211_sta didn''t have any iwl_mvm_sta object initialized and that caused the crash
  mentioned earlier when we got Rx on that station.'
