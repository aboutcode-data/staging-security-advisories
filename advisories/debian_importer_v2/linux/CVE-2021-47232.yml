summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: j1939: fix
  Use-after-Free, hold skb ref while in use  This patch fixes a Use-after-Free found by the
  syzbot.  The problem is that a skb is taken from the per-session skb queue, without incrementing
  the ref count. This leads to a Use-after-Free if the skb is taken concurrently from the session
  queue due to a CTS.'
