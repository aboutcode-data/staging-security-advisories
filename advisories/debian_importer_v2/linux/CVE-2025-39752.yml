summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ARM: rockchip:
  fix kernel hang during smp initialization  In order to bring up secondary CPUs main CPU write
  trampoline code to SRAM. The trampoline code is written while secondary CPUs are powered on
  (at least that true for RK3188 CPU). Sometimes that leads to kernel hang. Probably because
  secondary CPU execute trampoline code while kernel doesn''t expect.  The patch moves SRAM
  initialization step to the point where all secondary CPUs are powered down.  That fixes rarely
  hangs on RK3188: [    0.091568] CPU0: thread -1, cpu 0, socket 0, mpidr 80000000 [    0.091996]
  rockchip_smp_prepare_cpus: ncores 4'
