  - CVE-2018-16882
summary: A use-after-free issue was found in the way the Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor processed
  posted interrupts when nested(=1) virtualization is enabled. In nested_get_vmcs12_pages(),
  in case of an error while processing posted interrupt address, it unmaps the 'pi_desc_page'
  without resetting 'pi_desc' descriptor address, which is later used in pi_test_and_clear_on().
  A guest user/process could use this flaw to crash the host kernel resulting in DoS or potentially
  gain privileged access to a system. Kernel versions before 4.14.91 and before 4.19.13 are
  vulnerable.
