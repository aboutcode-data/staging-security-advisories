summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: isotp: check
  CAN address family in isotp_bind()  Add missing check to block non-AF_CAN binds.  Syzbot created
  some code which matched the right sockaddr struct size but used AF_XDP (0x2C) instead of AF_CAN
  (0x1D) in the address family field:  bind$xdp(r2, &(0x7f0000000540)={0x2c, 0x0, r4, 0x0, r2},
  0x10)                                 ^^^^ This has no funtional impact but the userspace
  should be notified about the wrong address family field content.'
