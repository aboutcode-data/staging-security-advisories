summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/huge_memory:
  fix NULL pointer deference when splitting folio  Commit c010d47f107f ("mm: thp: split huge
  page to any lower order pages") introduced an early check on the folio''s order via mapping->flags
  before proceeding with the split work.  This check introduced a bug: for shmem folios in the
  swap cache and truncated folios, the mapping pointer can be NULL.  Accessing mapping->flags
  in this state leads directly to a NULL pointer dereference.  This commit fixes the issue by
  moving the check for mapping != NULL before any attempt to access mapping->flags.'
