  - CVE-2021-28691
summary: Guest triggered use-after-free in Linux xen-netback A malicious or buggy network PV
  frontend can force Linux netback to disable the interface and terminate the receive kernel
  thread associated with queue 0 in response to the frontend sending a malformed packet. Such
  kernel thread termination will lead to a use-after-free in Linux netback when the backend
  is destroyed, as the kernel thread associated with queue 0 will have already exited and thus
  the call to kthread_stop will be performed against a stale pointer.
