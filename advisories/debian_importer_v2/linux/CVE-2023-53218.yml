  - CVE-2023-53218
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rxrpc: Make it
  so that a waiting process can be aborted  When sendmsg() creates an rxrpc call, it queues
  it to wait for a connection and channel to be assigned and then waits before it can start
  shovelling data as the encrypted DATA packet content includes a summary of the connection
  parameters.  However, sendmsg() may get interrupted before a connection gets assigned and
  further sendmsg() calls will fail with EBUSY until an assignment is made.  Fix this so that
  the call can at least be aborted without failing on EBUSY.  We have to be careful here as
  sendmsg() mustn''t be allowed to start the call timer if the call doesn''t yet have a connection
  assigned as an oops may follow shortly thereafter.'
