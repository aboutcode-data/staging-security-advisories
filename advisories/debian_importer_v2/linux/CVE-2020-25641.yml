aliases:
  - CVE-2020-25641
summary: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of biovecs in versions before
  5.9-rc7. A zero-length biovec request issued by the block subsystem could cause the kernel
  to enter an infinite loop, causing a denial of service. This flaw allows a local attacker
  with basic privileges to issue requests to a block device, resulting in a denial of service.
  The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.
