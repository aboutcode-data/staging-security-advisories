summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  NFSD: Define
  actions for the new time_deleg FATTR4 attributes  NFSv4 clients won''t send legitimate GETATTR
  requests for these new attributes because they are intended to be used only with CB_GETATTR
  and SETATTR. But NFSD has to do something besides crashing if it ever sees a GETATTR request
  that queries these attributes.  RFC 8881 Section 18.7.3 states:  > The server MUST return
  a value for each attribute that the client > requests if the attribute is supported by the
  server for the > target file system. If the server does not support a particular > attribute
  on the target file system, then it MUST NOT return the > attribute value and MUST NOT set
  the attribute bit in the result > bitmap. The server MUST return an error if it supports an
  > attribute on the target but cannot obtain its value. In that case, > no attribute values
  will be returned.  Further, RFC 9754 Section 5 states:  > These new attributes are invalid
  to be used with GETATTR, VERIFY, > and NVERIFY, and they can only be used with CB_GETATTR
  and SETATTR > by a client holding an appropriate delegation.  Thus there does not appear to
  be a specific server response mandated by specification. Taking the guidance that querying
  these attributes via GETATTR is "invalid", NFSD will return nfserr_inval, failing the request
  entirely.'
