summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powerpc/mm: Fix
  lockup on kernel exec fault  The powerpc kernel is not prepared to handle exec faults from
  kernel. Especially, the function is_exec_fault() will return ''false'' when an exec fault
  is taken by kernel, because the check is based on reading current->thread.regs->trap which
  contains the trap from user.  For instance, when provoking a LKDTM EXEC_USERSPACE test, current->thread.regs->trap
  is set to SYSCALL trap (0xc00), and the fault taken by the kernel is not seen as an exec fault
  by set_access_flags_filter().  Commit d7df2443cd5f ("powerpc/mm: Fix spurious segfaults on
  radix with autonuma") made it clear and handled it properly. But later on commit d3ca587404b3
  ("powerpc/mm: Fix reporting of kernel execute faults") removed that handling, introducing
  test based on error_code. And here is the problem, because on the 603 all upper bits of SRR1
  get cleared when the TLB instruction miss handler bails out to ISI.  Until commit cbd7e6ca0210
  ("powerpc/fault: Avoid heavy search_exception_tables() verification"), an exec fault from
  kernel at a userspace address was indirectly caught by the lack of entry for that address
  in the exception tables. But after that commit the kernel mainly relies on KUAP or on core
  mm handling to catch wrong user accesses. Here the access is not wrong, so mm handles it.
  It is a minor fault because PAGE_EXEC is not set, set_access_flags_filter() should set PAGE_EXEC
  and voila. But as is_exec_fault() returns false as explained in the beginning, set_access_flags_filter()
  bails out without setting PAGE_EXEC flag, which leads to a forever minor exec fault.  As the
  kernel is not prepared to handle such exec faults, the thing to do is to fire in bad_kernel_fault()
  for any exec fault taken by the kernel, as it was prior to commit d3ca587404b3.'
