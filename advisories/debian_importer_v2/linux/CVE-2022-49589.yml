summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  igmp: Fix data-races
  around sysctl_igmp_qrv.  While reading sysctl_igmp_qrv, it can be changed concurrently. Thus,
  we need to add READ_ONCE() to its readers.  This test can be packed into a helper, so such
  changes will be in the follow-up series after net is merged into net-next.    qrv ?: READ_ONCE(net->ipv4.sysctl_igmp_qrv);'
