  - CVE-2023-53055
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fscrypt: destroy
  keyring after security_sb_delete()  fscrypt_destroy_keyring() must be called after all potentially-encrypted
  inodes were evicted; otherwise it cannot safely destroy the keyring. Since inodes that are
  in-use by the Landlock LSM don''t get evicted until security_sb_delete(), this means that
  fscrypt_destroy_keyring() must be called *after* security_sb_delete().  This fixes a WARN_ON
  followed by a NULL dereference, only possible if Landlock was being used on encrypted files.'
