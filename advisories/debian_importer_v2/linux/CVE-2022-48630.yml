  - CVE-2022-48630
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: qcom-rng
  - fix infinite loop on requests not multiple of WORD_SZ  The commit referenced in the Fixes
  tag removed the ''break'' from the else branch in qcom_rng_read(), causing an infinite loop
  whenever ''max'' is not a multiple of WORD_SZ. This can be reproduced e.g. by running:      kcapi-rng
  -b 67 >/dev/null  There are many ways to fix this without adding back the ''break'', but they
  all seem more awkward than simply adding it back, so do just that.  Tested on a machine with
  Qualcomm Amberwing processor.'
