summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nvmet: fix memory
  leak of bio integrity  If nvmet receives commands with metadata there is a continuous memory
  leak of kmalloc-128 slab or more precisely bio->bi_integrity.  Since commit bf4c89fc8797 ("block:
  don''t call bio_uninit from bio_endio") each user of bio_init has to use bio_uninit as well.
  Otherwise the bio integrity is not getting free. Nvmet uses bio_init for inline bios.  Uninit
  the inline bio to complete deallocation of integrity in bio.'
