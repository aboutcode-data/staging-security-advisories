  - CVE-2020-10781
summary: A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel before 5.8-rc6 in the ZRAM kernel module, where
  a user with a local account and the ability to read the /sys/class/zram-control/hot_add file
  can create ZRAM device nodes in the /dev/ directory. This read allocates kernel memory and
  is not accounted for a user that triggers the creation of that ZRAM device. With this vulnerability,
  continually reading the device may consume a large amount of system memory and cause the Out-of-Memory
  (OOM) killer to activate and terminate random userspace processes, possibly making the system
  inoperable.
