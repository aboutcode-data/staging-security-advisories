summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring/fdinfo:
  grab ctx->uring_lock around io_uring_show_fdinfo()  Not everything requires locking in there,
  which is why the ''has_lock'' variable exists. But enough does that it''s a bit unwieldy to
  manage. Wrap the whole thing in a ->uring_lock trylock, and just return with no output if
  we fail to grab it. The existing trylock() will already have greatly diminished utility/output
  for the failure case.  This fixes an issue with reading the SQE fields, if the ring is being
  actively resized at the same time.'
