summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  platform/x86:
  int3472: Fix double free of GPIO device during unregister  regulator_unregister() already
  frees the associated GPIO device. On ThinkPad X9 (Lunar Lake), this causes a double free issue
  that leads to random failures when other drivers (typically Intel THC) attempt to allocate
  interrupts. The root cause is that the reference count of the pinctrl_intel_platform module
  unexpectedly drops to zero when this driver defers its probe.  This behavior can also be reproduced
  by unloading the module directly.  Fix the issue by removing the redundant release of the
  GPIO device during regulator unregistration.'
