  - CVE-2023-3640
summary: A possible unauthorized memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's cpu_entry_area
  mapping of X86 CPU data to memory, where a user may guess the location of exception stacks
  or other important data. Based on the previous CVE-2023-0597, the 'Randomize per-cpu entry
  area' feature was implemented in /arch/x86/mm/cpu_entry_area.c, which works through the init_cea_offsets()
  function when KASLR is enabled. However, despite this feature, there is still a risk of per-cpu
  entry area leaks. This issue could allow a local user to gain access to some important data
  with memory in an expected location and potentially escalate their privileges on the system.
