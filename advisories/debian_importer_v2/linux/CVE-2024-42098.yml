summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: ecdh
  - explicitly zeroize private_key  private_key is overwritten with the key parameter passed
  in by the caller (if present), or alternatively a newly generated private key. However, it
  is possible that the caller provides a key (or the newly generated key) which is shorter than
  the previous key. In that scenario, some key material from the previous key would not be overwritten.
  The easiest solution is to explicitly zeroize the entire private_key array first.  Note that
  this patch slightly changes the behavior of this function: previously, if the ecc_gen_privkey
  failed, the old private_key would remain. Now, the private_key is always zeroized. This behavior
  is consistent with the case where params.key is set and ecc_is_key_valid fails.'
