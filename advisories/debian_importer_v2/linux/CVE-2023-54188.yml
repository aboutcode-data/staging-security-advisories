summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dmaengine: apple-admac:
  Fix ''current_tx'' not getting freed  In terminate_all we should queue up all submitted descriptors
  to be freed. We do that for the content of the ''issued'' and ''submitted'' lists, but the
  ''current_tx'' descriptor falls through the cracks as it''s removed from the ''issued'' list
  once it gets assigned to be the current descriptor. Explicitly queue up freeing of the ''current_tx''
  descriptor to address a memory leak that is otherwise present.'
