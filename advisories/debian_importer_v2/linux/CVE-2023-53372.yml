summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sctp: fix a potential
  overflow in sctp_ifwdtsn_skip  Currently, when traversing ifwdtsn skips with _sctp_walk_ifwdtsn,
  it only checks the pos against the end of the chunk. However, the data left for the last pos
  may be < sizeof(struct sctp_ifwdtsn_skip), and dereference it as struct sctp_ifwdtsn_skip
  may cause coverflow.  This patch fixes it by checking the pos against "the end of the chunk
  - sizeof(struct sctp_ifwdtsn_skip)" in sctp_ifwdtsn_skip, similar to sctp_fwdtsn_skip.'
