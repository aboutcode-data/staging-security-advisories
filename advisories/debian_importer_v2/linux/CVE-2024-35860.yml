summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: support
  deferring bpf_link dealloc to after RCU grace period  BPF link for some program types is passed
  as a "context" which can be used by those BPF programs to look up additional information.
  E.g., for multi-kprobes and multi-uprobes, link is used to fetch BPF cookie values.  Because
  of this runtime dependency, when bpf_link refcnt drops to zero there could still be active
  BPF programs running accessing link data.  This patch adds generic support to defer bpf_link
  dealloc callback to after RCU GP, if requested. This is done by exposing two different deallocation
  callbacks, one synchronous and one deferred. If deferred one is provided, bpf_link_free()
  will schedule dealloc_deferred() callback to happen after RCU GP.  BPF is using two flavors
  of RCU: "classic" non-sleepable one and RCU tasks trace one. The latter is used when sleepable
  BPF programs are used. bpf_link_free() accommodates that by checking underlying BPF program''s
  sleepable flag, and goes either through normal RCU GP only for non-sleepable, or through RCU
  tasks trace GP *and* then normal RCU GP (taking into account rcu_trace_implies_rcu_gp() optimization),
  if BPF program is sleepable.  We use this for multi-kprobe and multi-uprobe links, which dereference
  link during program run. We also preventively switch raw_tp link to use deferred dealloc callback,
  as upcoming changes in bpf-next tree expose raw_tp link data (specifically, cookie value)
  to BPF program at runtime as well.'
