summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  kheaders: Use
  array declaration instead of char  Under CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE, memcpy() will check the size
  of destination and source buffers. Defining kernel_headers_data as "char" would trip this
  check. Since these addresses are treated as byte arrays, define them as arrays (as done everywhere
  else).  This was seen with:    $ cat /sys/kernel/kheaders.tar.xz >> /dev/null    detected
  buffer overflow in memcpy   kernel BUG at lib/string_helpers.c:1027!   ...   RIP: 0010:fortify_panic+0xf/0x20   [...]   Call
