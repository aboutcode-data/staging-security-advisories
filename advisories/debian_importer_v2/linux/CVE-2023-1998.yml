summary: The Linux kernel allows userspace processes to enable mitigations by calling prctl
  with PR_SET_SPECULATION_CTRL which disables the speculation feature as well as by using seccomp.
  We had noticed that on VMs of at least one major cloud provider, the kernel still left the
  victim process exposed to attacks in some cases even after enabling the spectre-BTI mitigation
  with prctl. The same behavior can be observed on a bare-metal machine when forcing the mitigation
  to IBRS on boot command line.  This happened because when plain IBRS was enabled (not enhanced
  IBRS), the kernel had some logic that determined that STIBP was not needed. The IBRS bit implicitly
  protects against cross-thread branch target injection. However, with legacy IBRS, the IBRS
  bit was cleared on returning to userspace, due to performance reasons, which disabled the
  implicit STIBP and left userspace threads vulnerable to cross-thread branch target injection
  against which STIBP protects.
