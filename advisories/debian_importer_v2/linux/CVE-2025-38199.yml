summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath12k:
  Fix memory leak due to multiple rx_stats allocation  rx_stats for each arsta is allocated
  when adding a station. arsta->rx_stats will be freed when a station is removed.  Redundant
  allocations are occurring when the same station is added multiple times. This causes ath12k_mac_station_add()
  to be called multiple times, and rx_stats is allocated each time. As a result there is memory
  leaks.  Prevent multiple allocations of rx_stats when ath12k_mac_station_add() is called repeatedly
  by checking if rx_stats is already allocated before allocating again. Allocate arsta->rx_stats
  if arsta->rx_stats is NULL respectively.  Tested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.3.1-00173-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1
  Tested-on: WCN7850 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HMT.1.0.c5-00481-QCAHMTSWPL_V1.0_V2.0_SILICONZ-3'
