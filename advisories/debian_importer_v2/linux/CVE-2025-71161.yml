  - CVE-2025-71161
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dm-verity: disable
  recursive forward error correction  There are two problems with the recursive correction:  1.
  It may cause denial-of-service. In fec_read_bufs, there is a loop that has 253 iterations.
  For each iteration, we may call verity_hash_for_block recursively. There is a limit of 4 nested
  recursions - that means that there may be at most 253^4 (4 billion) iterations. Red Hat QE
  team actually created an image that pushes dm-verity to this limit - and this image just makes
  the udev-worker process get stuck in the ''D'' state.  2. It doesn''t work. In fec_read_bufs
  we store data into the variable "fio->bufs", but fio bufs is shared between recursive invocations,
  if "verity_hash_for_block" invoked correction recursively, it would overwrite partially filled
  fio->bufs.'
