summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display:
  Fix array-index-out-of-bounds in dml2/FCLKChangeSupport  [Why] Potential out of bounds access
  in dml2_calculate_rq_and_dlg_params() because the value of out_lowest_state_idx used as an
  index for FCLKChangeSupport array can be greater than 1.  [How] Currently dml2 core specifies
  identical values for all FCLKChangeSupport elements. Always use index 0 in the condition to
  avoid out of bounds access.'
