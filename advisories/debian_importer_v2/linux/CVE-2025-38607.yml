  - CVE-2025-38607
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: handle jset
  (if a & b ...) as a jump in CFG computation  BPF_JSET is a conditional jump and currently
  verifier.c:can_jump() does not know about that. This can lead to incorrect live registers
  and SCC computation.  E.g. in the following example:     1: r0 = 1;    2: r2 = 2;    3: if
  r1 & 0x7 goto +1;    4: exit;    5: r0 = r2;    6: exit;  W/o this fix insn_successors(3)
  will return only (4), a jump to (5) would be missed and r2 won''t be marked as alive at (3).'
