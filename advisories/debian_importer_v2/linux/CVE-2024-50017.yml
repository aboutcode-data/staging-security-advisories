summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/mm/ident_map:
  Use gbpages only where full GB page should be mapped.  When ident_pud_init() uses only GB
  pages to create identity maps, large ranges of addresses not actually requested can be included
  in the resulting table; a 4K request will map a full GB.  This can include a lot of extra
  address space past that requested, including areas marked reserved by the BIOS.  That allows
  processor speculation into reserved regions, that on UV systems can cause system halts.  Only
  use GB pages when map creation requests include the full GB page of space.  Fall back to using
  smaller 2M pages when only portions of a GB page are included in the request.  No attempt
  is made to coalesce mapping requests. If a request requires a map entry at the 2M (pmd) level,
  subsequent mapping requests within the same 1G region will also be at the pmd level, even
  if adjacent or overlapping such requests could have been combined to map a full GB page. Existing
  usage starts with larger regions and then adds smaller regions, so this should not have any
  great consequence.'
