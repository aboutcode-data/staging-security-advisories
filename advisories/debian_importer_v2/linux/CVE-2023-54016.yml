summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath12k:
  Fix memory leak in rx_desc and tx_desc  Currently when ath12k_dp_cc_desc_init() is called
  we allocate memory to rx_descs and tx_descs. In ath12k_dp_cc_cleanup(), during descriptor
  cleanup rx_descs and tx_descs memory is not freed.  This is cause of memory leak. These allocated
  memory should be freed in ath12k_dp_cc_cleanup.  In ath12k_dp_cc_desc_init(), we can save
  base address of rx_descs and tx_descs. In ath12k_dp_cc_cleanup(), we can free rx_descs and
  tx_descs memory using their base address.  Tested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.0.1-00029-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1'
