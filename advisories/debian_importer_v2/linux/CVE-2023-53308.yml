  - CVE-2023-53308
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: fec: Better
  handle pm_runtime_get() failing in .remove()  In the (unlikely) event that pm_runtime_get()
  (disguised as pm_runtime_resume_and_get()) fails, the remove callback returned an error early.
  The problem with this is that the driver core ignores the error value and continues removing
  the device. This results in a resource leak. Worse the devm allocated resources are freed
  and so if a callback of the driver is called later the register mapping is already gone which
  probably results in a crash.'
