  [nf_tables] [..]  Currently nf_tables will traverse the entire table (chain graph), starting
  from the entry points (base chains), exploring all possible paths (chain jumps).  But there
  are cases where we could avoid revalidation.  Consider: 1  input -> j2 -> j3 2  input -> j2
  -> j3 3  input -> j1 -> j2 -> j3  Then the second rule does not need to revalidate j2, and,
  by extension j3, because this was already checked during validation of the first rule. We
  need to validate it only for rule 3.  This is needed because chain loop detection also ensures
  we do not exceed the jump stack: Just because we know that j2 is cycle free, its last jump
  might now exceed the allowed stack size.  We also need to update all reachable chains with
  the new largest observed call depth.  Care has to be taken to revalidate even if the chain
  depth won''t be an issue: chain validation also ensures that expressions are not called from
  invalid base chains.  For example, the masquerade expression can only be called from NAT postrouting
  base chains.  Therefore we also need to keep record of the base chain context (type, hooknum)
  and revalidate if the chain becomes reachable from a different hook location.'
