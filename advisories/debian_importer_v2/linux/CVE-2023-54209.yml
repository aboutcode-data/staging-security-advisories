summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  block: fix blktrace
  debugfs entries leakage  Commit 99d055b4fd4b ("block: remove per-disk debugfs files in blk_unregister_queue")
  moves blk_trace_shutdown() from blk_release_queue() to blk_unregister_queue(), this is safe
  if blktrace is created through sysfs, however, there is a regression in corner case.  blktrace
  can still be enabled after del_gendisk() through ioctl if the disk is opened before del_gendisk(),
  and if blktrace is not shutdown through ioctl before closing the disk, debugfs entries will
  be leaked.  Fix this problem by shutdown blktrace in disk_release(), this is safe because
  blk_trace_remove() is reentrant.'
