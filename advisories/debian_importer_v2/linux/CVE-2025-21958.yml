summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Revert "openvswitch:
  switch to per-action label counting in conntrack"  Currently, ovs_ct_set_labels() is only
  called for confirmed conntrack entries (ct) within ovs_ct_commit(). However, if the conntrack
  entry does not have the labels_ext extension, attempting to allocate it in ovs_ct_get_conn_labels()
  for a confirmed entry triggers a warning in nf_ct_ext_add():    WARN_ON(nf_ct_is_confirmed(ct));  This
  happens when the conntrack entry is created externally before OVS increments net->ct.labels_used.
  The issue has become more likely since commit fcb1aa5163b1 ("openvswitch: switch to per-action
  label counting in conntrack"), which changed to use per-action label counting and increment
  net->ct.labels_used when a flow with ct action is added.  Since there’s no straightforward
  way to fully resolve this issue at the moment, this reverts the commit to avoid breaking existing
  use cases.'
