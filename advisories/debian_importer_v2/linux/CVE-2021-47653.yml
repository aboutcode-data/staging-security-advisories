summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: davinci:
  vpif: fix use-after-free on driver unbind  The driver allocates and registers two platform
  device structures during probe, but the devices were never deregistered on driver unbind.  This
  results in a use-after-free on driver unbind as the device structures were allocated using
  devres and would be freed by driver core when remove() returns.  Fix this by adding the missing
  deregistration calls to the remove() callback and failing probe on registration errors.  Note
  that the platform device structures must be freed using a proper release callback to avoid
  leaking associated resources like device names.'
