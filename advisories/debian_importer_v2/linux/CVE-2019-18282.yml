  - CVE-2019-18282
summary: The flow_dissector feature in the Linux kernel 4.3 through 5.x before 5.3.10 has a
  device tracking vulnerability, aka CID-55667441c84f. This occurs because the auto flowlabel
  of a UDP IPv6 packet relies on a 32-bit hashrnd value as a secret, and because jhash (instead
  of siphash) is used. The hashrnd value remains the same starting from boot time, and can be
  inferred by an attacker. This affects net/core/flow_dissector.c and related code.
