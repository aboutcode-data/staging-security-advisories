summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  libceph: make
  calc_target() set t->paused, not just clear it  Currently calc_target() clears t->paused if
  the request shouldn''t be paused anymore, but doesn''t ever set t->paused even though it''s
  able to determine when the request should be paused.  Setting t->paused is left to __submit_request()
  which is fine for regular requests but doesn''t work for linger requests -- since __submit_request()
  doesn''t operate on linger requests, there is nowhere for lreq->t.paused to be set. One consequence
  of this is that watches don''t get reestablished on paused -> unpaused transitions in cases
  where requests have been paused long enough for the (paused) unwatch request to time out and
  for the subsequent (re)watch request to enter the paused state.  On top of the watch not getting
  reestablished, rbd_reregister_watch() gets stuck with rbd_dev->watch_mutex held:    rbd_register_watch     __rbd_register_watch       ceph_osdc_watch         linger_reg_commit_wait  It''s
  waiting for lreq->reg_commit_wait to be completed, but for that to happen the respective request
  needs to end up on need_resend_linger list and be kicked when requests are unpaused.  There
  is no chance for that if the request in question is never marked paused in the first place.  The
  fact that rbd_dev->watch_mutex remains taken out forever then prevents the image from getting
  unmapped -- "rbd unmap" would inevitably hang in D state on an attempt to grab the mutex.'
