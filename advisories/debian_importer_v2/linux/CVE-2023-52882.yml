  - CVE-2023-52882
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: sunxi-ng:
  h6: Reparent CPUX during PLL CPUX rate change  While PLL CPUX clock rate change when CPU is
  running from it works in vast majority of cases, now and then it causes instability. This
  leads to system crashes and other undefined behaviour. After a lot of testing (30+ hours)
  while also doing a lot of frequency switches, we can''t observe any instability issues anymore
  when doing reparenting to stable clock like 24 MHz oscillator.'
