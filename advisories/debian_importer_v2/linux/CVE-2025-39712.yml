summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: mt9m114:
  Fix deadlock in get_frame_interval/set_frame_interval  Getting / Setting the frame interval
  using the V4L2 subdev pad ops get_frame_interval/set_frame_interval causes a deadlock, as
  the subdev state is locked in the [1] but also in the driver itself.  In [2] it''s described
  that the caller is responsible to acquire and release the lock in this case. Therefore, acquiring
  the lock in the driver is wrong.  Remove the lock acquisitions/releases from mt9m114_ifp_get_frame_interval()
  and mt9m114_ifp_set_frame_interval().  [1] drivers/media/v4l2-core/v4l2-subdev.c - line 1129
