summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: micrel:
  Fix receiving the timestamp in the frame for lan8841  The blamed commit started to use the
  ptp workqueue to get the second part of the timestamp. And when the port was set down, then
  this workqueue is stopped. But if the config option NETWORK_PHY_TIMESTAMPING is not enabled,
  then the ptp_clock is not initialized so then it would crash when it would try to access the
  delayed work. So then basically by setting up and then down the port, it would crash. The
  fix consists in checking if the ptp_clock is initialized and only then cancel the delayed
  work.'
