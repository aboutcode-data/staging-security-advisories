aliases:
  - CVE-2018-10938
summary: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel present since v4.0-rc1 and through v4.13-rc4.
  A crafted network packet sent remotely by an attacker may force the kernel to enter an infinite
  loop in the cipso_v4_optptr() function in net/ipv4/cipso_ipv4.c leading to a denial-of-service.
  A certain non-default configuration of LSM (Linux Security Module) and NetLabel should be
  set up on a system before an attacker could leverage this flaw.
