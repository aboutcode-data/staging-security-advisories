summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: rtl8xxxu:
  fix slab-out-of-bounds in rtl8xxxu_sta_add  The driver does not set hw->sta_data_size, which
  causes mac80211 to allocate insufficient space for driver private station data in __sta_info_alloc().
  When rtl8xxxu_sta_add() accesses members of struct rtl8xxxu_sta_info through sta->drv_priv,
  this results in a slab-out-of-bounds write.  KASAN report on RISC-V (VisionFive 2) with RTL8192EU
  adapter:    BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in rtl8xxxu_sta_add+0x31c/0x346   Write of size
  8 at addr ffffffd6d3e9ae88 by task kworker/u16:0/12  Set hw->sta_data_size to sizeof(struct
  rtl8xxxu_sta_info) during probe, similar to how hw->vif_data_size is configured. This ensures
  mac80211 allocates sufficient space for the driver''s per-station private data.  Tested on
  StarFive VisionFive 2 v1.2A board.'
