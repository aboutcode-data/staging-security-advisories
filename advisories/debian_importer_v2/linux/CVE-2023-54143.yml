summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: mediatek:
  vcodec: fix resource leaks in vdec_msg_queue_init()  If we encounter any error in the vdec_msg_queue_init()
  then we need to set "msg_queue->wdma_addr.size = 0;".  Normally, this is done inside the vdec_msg_queue_deinit()
  function.  However, if the first call to allocate &msg_queue->wdma_addr fails, then the vdec_msg_queue_deinit()
  function is a no-op.  For that situation, just set the size to zero explicitly and return.  There
  were two other error paths which did not clean up before returning. Change those error paths
  to goto mem_alloc_err.'
