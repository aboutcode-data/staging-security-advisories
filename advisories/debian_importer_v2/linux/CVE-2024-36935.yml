summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ice: ensure the
  copied buf is NUL terminated  Currently, we allocate a count-sized kernel buffer and copy
  count bytes from userspace to that buffer. Later, we use sscanf on this buffer but we don''t
  ensure that the string is terminated inside the buffer, this can lead to OOB read when using
  sscanf. Fix this issue by using memdup_user_nul instead of memdup_user.'
