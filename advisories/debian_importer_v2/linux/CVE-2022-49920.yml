summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: nf_tables:
  netlink notifier might race to release objects  commit release path is invoked via call_rcu
  and it runs lockless to release the objects after rcu grace period. The netlink notifier handler
  might win race to remove objects that the transaction context is still referencing from the
  commit release path.  Call rcu_barrier() to ensure pending rcu callbacks run to completion
  if the list of transactions to be destroyed is not empty.'
