summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display:
  Disable PSR-SU on Parade 08-01 TCON too  Stuart Hayhurst has found that both at bootup and
  fullscreen VA-API video is leading to black screens for around 1 second and kernel WARNING
  [1] traces when calling dmub_psr_enable() with Parade 08-01 TCON.  These symptoms all go away
  with PSR-SU disabled for this TCON, so disable it for now while DMUB traces [2] from the failure
  can be analyzed and the failure state properly root caused.  (cherry picked from commit afb634a6823d8d9db23c5fb04f79c5549349628b)'
