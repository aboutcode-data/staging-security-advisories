summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Input: iforce
  - invert valid length check when fetching device IDs  syzbot is reporting uninitialized value
  at iforce_init_device() [1], for commit 6ac0aec6b0a6 ("Input: iforce - allow callers supply
  data buffer when fetching device IDs") is checking that valid length is shorter than bytes
  to read. Since iforce_get_id_packet() stores valid length when returning 0, the caller needs
  to check that valid length is longer than or equals to bytes to read.'
