summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: sunxi-ng:
  mp: Fix dual-divider clock rate readback  When dual-divider clock support was introduced,
  the P divider offset was left out of the .recalc_rate readback function. This causes the clock
  rate to become bogus or even zero (possibly due to the P divider being 1, leading to a divide-by-zero).  Fix
  this by incorporating the P divider offset into the calculation.'
