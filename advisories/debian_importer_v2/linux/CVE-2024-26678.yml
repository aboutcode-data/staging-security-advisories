summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/efistub:
  Use 1:1 file:memory mapping for PE/COFF .compat section  The .compat section is a dummy PE
  section that contains the address of the 32-bit entrypoint of the 64-bit kernel image if it
  is bootable from 32-bit firmware (i.e., CONFIG_EFI_MIXED=y)  This section is only 8 bytes
  in size and is only referenced from the loader, and so it is placed at the end of the memory
  view of the image, to avoid the need for padding it to 4k, which is required for sections
  appearing in the middle of the image.  Unfortunately, this violates the PE/COFF spec, and
  even if most EFI loaders will work correctly (including the Tianocore reference implementation),
  PE loaders do exist that reject such images, on the basis that both the file and memory views
  of the file contents should be described by the section headers in a monotonically increasing
  manner without leaving any gaps.  So reorganize the sections to avoid this issue. This results
  in a slight padding overhead (< 4k) which can be avoided if desired by disabling CONFIG_EFI_MIXED
  (which is only needed in rare cases these days)'
