summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: sparx5:
  Fix use after free inside sparx5_del_mact_entry  Based on the static analyzis of the code
  it looks like when an entry from the MAC table was removed, the entry was still used after
  being freed. More precise the vid of the mac_entry was used after calling devm_kfree on the
  mac_entry. The fix consists in first using the vid of the mac_entry to delete the entry from
  the HW and after that to free it.'
