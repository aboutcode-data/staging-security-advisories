  - CVE-2017-5972
summary: 'The TCP stack in the Linux kernel 3.x does not properly implement a SYN cookie protection
  mechanism for the case of a fast network connection, which allows remote attackers to cause
  a denial of service (CPU consumption) by sending many TCP SYN packets, as demonstrated by
  an attack against the kernel-3.10.0 package in CentOS Linux 7. NOTE: third parties have been
  unable to discern any relationship between the GitHub Engineering finding and the Trigemini.c
  attack code.'
