summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display:
  Disable DMCUB timeout for DCN35  [Why] DMCUB can intermittently take longer than expected
  to process commands.  Old ASIC policy was to continue while logging a diagnostic error - which
  works fine for ASIC without IPS, but with IPS this could lead to a race condition where we
  attempt to access DCN state while it''s inaccessible, leading to a system hang when the NIU
  port is not disabled or register accesses that timeout and the display configuration in an
  undefined state.  [How] We need to investigate why these accesses take longer than expected,
  but for now we should disable the timeout on DCN35 to avoid this race condition. Since the
  waits happen only at lower interrupt levels the risk of taking too long at higher IRQ and
  causing a system watchdog timeout are minimal.'
