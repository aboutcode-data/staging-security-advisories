summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vmci: prevent
  speculation leaks by sanitizing event in event_deliver()  Coverity spotted that event_msg
  is controlled by user-space, event_msg->event_data.event is passed to event_deliver() and
  used as an index without sanitization.  This change ensures that the event index is sanitized
  to mitigate any possibility of speculative information leaks.  This bug was discovered and
  resolved using Coverity Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) by Synopsys, Inc.  Only compile
  tested, no access to HW.'
