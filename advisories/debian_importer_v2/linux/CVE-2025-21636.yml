summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sctp: sysctl:
  plpmtud_probe_interval: avoid using current->nsproxy  As mentioned in a previous commit of
  this series, using the ''net'' structure via ''current'' is not recommended for different
  reasons:  - Inconsistency: getting info from the reader''s/writer''s netns vs only   from
  the opener''s netns.  - current->nsproxy can be NULL in some cases, resulting in an ''Oops''   (null-ptr-deref),
  e.g. when the current task is exiting, as spotted by   syzbot [1] using acct(2).  The ''net''
  structure can be obtained from the table->data using container_of().  Note that table->data
  could also be used directly, as this is the only member needed from the ''net'' structure,
  but that would increase the size of this fix, to use ''*data'' everywhere ''net->sctp.probe_interval''
  is used.'
