summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Revert "readahead:
  properly shorten readahead when falling back to do_page_cache_ra()"  This reverts commit 7c877586da3178974a8a94577b6045a48377ff25.  Anders
  and Philippe have reported that recent kernels occasionally hang when used with NFS in readahead
  code.  The problem has been bisected to 7c877586da3 ("readahead: properly shorten readahead
  when falling back to do_page_cache_ra()").  The cause of the problem is that ra->size can
  be shrunk by read_pages() call and subsequently we end up calling do_page_cache_ra() with
  negative (read huge positive) number of pages.  Let''s revert 7c877586da3 for now until we
  can find a proper way how the logic in read_pages() and page_cache_ra_order() can coexist.  This
  can lead to reduced readahead throughput due to readahead window confusion but that''s better
  than outright hangs.'
