summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ceph: fix NULL
  pointer dereference in ceph_mds_auth_match()  The CephFS kernel client has regression starting
  from 6.18-rc1. We have issue in ceph_mds_auth_match() if fs_name == NULL:      const char
  fs_name = mdsc->fsc->mount_options->mds_namespace;     ...     if (auth->match.fs_name &&
  strcmp(auth->match.fs_name, fs_name)) {             / fsname mismatch, try next one */             return
  0;     }  Patrick Donnelly suggested that: In summary, we should definitely start decoding
  `fs_name` from the MDSMap and do strict authorizations checks against it. Note that the `-o
  mds_namespace=foo` should only be used for selecting the file system to mount and nothing
  else. It''s possible no mds_namespace is specified but the kernel will mount the only file
  system that exists which may have name "foo".  This patch reworks ceph_mdsmap_decode() and
  namespace_equals() with the goal of supporting the suggested concept. Now struct ceph_mdsmap
  contains m_fs_name field that receives copy of extracted FS name by ceph_extract_encoded_string().
  For the case of "old" CephFS file systems, it is used "cephfs" name.  [ idryomov: replace
  redundant %*pE with %s in ceph_mdsmap_decode(),   get rid of a series of strlen() calls in
  ceph_namespace_match(),   drop changes to namespace_equals() body to avoid treating empty   mds_namespace
  as equal, drop changes to ceph_mdsc_handle_fsmap()   as namespace_equals() isn''t an equivalent
  substitution there ]'
