summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  perf: Fix sample
  vs do_exit()  Baisheng Gao reported an ARM64 crash, which Mark decoded as being a synchronous
  external abort -- most likely due to trying to access MMIO in bad ways.  The crash further
  shows perf trying to do a user stack sample while in exit_mmap()''s tlb_finish_mmu() -- i.e.
  while tearing down the address space it is trying to access.  It turns out that we stop perf
  after we tear down the userspace mm; a receipie for disaster, since perf likes to access userspace
  for various reasons.  Flip this order by moving up where we stop perf in do_exit().  Additionally,
  harden PERF_SAMPLE_CALLCHAIN and PERF_SAMPLE_STACK_USER to abort when the current task does
  not have an mm (exit_mm() makes sure to set current->mm = NULL; before commencing with the
  actual teardown). Such that CPU wide events don''t trip on this same problem.'
