  - CVE-2025-40179
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: verify
  orphan file size is not too big  In principle orphan file can be arbitrarily large. However
  orphan replay needs to traverse it all and we also pin all its buffers in memory. Thus filesystems
  with absurdly large orphan files can lead to big amounts of memory consumed. Limit orphan
  file size to a sane value and also use kvmalloc() for allocating array of block descriptor
  structures to avoid large order allocations for sane but large orphan files.'
