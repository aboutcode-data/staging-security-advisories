summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vsock: prevent
  null-ptr-deref in vsock_*[has_data|has_space]  Recent reports have shown how we sometimes
  call vsock_*_has_data() when a vsock socket has been de-assigned from a transport (see attached
  links), but we shouldn''t.  Previous commits should have solved the real problems, but we
  may have more in the future, so to avoid null-ptr-deref, we can return 0 (no space, no data
  available) but with a warning.  This way the code should continue to run in a nearly consistent
  state and have a warning that allows us to debug future problems.'
