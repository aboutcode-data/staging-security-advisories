summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gve: guard XSK
  operations on the existence of queues  This patch predicates the enabling and disabling of
  XSK pools on the existence of queues. As it stands, if the interface is down, disabling or
  enabling XSK pools would result in a crash, as the RX queue pointer would be NULL. XSK pool
  registration will occur as part of the next interface up.  Similarly, xsk_wakeup needs be
  guarded against queues disappearing while the function is executing, so a check against the
  GVE_PRIV_FLAGS_NAPI_ENABLED flag is added to synchronize with the disabling of the bit and
  the synchronize_net() in gve_turndown.'
