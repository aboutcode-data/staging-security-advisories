summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/edid: In
  connector_bad_edid() cap num_of_ext by num_blocks read  In commit e11f5bd8228f ("drm: Add
  support for DP 1.4 Compliance edid corruption test") the function connector_bad_edid() started
  assuming that the memory for the EDID passed to it was big enough to hold `edid[0x7e] + 1`
  blocks of data (1 extra for the base block). It completely ignored the fact that the function
  was passed `num_blocks` which indicated how much memory had been allocated for the EDID.  Let''s
  fix this by adding a bounds check.  This is important for handling the case where there''s
  an error in the first block of the EDID. In that case we will call connector_bad_edid() without
  having re-allocated memory based on `edid[0x7e]`.'
