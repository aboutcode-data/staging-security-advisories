aliases:
  - CVE-2021-31440
summary: This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations
  of Linux Kernel 5.11.15. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged
  code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists
  within the handling of eBPF programs. The issue results from the lack of proper validation
  of user-supplied eBPF programs prior to executing them. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability
  to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel. Was ZDI-CAN-13661.
