summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ftrace: Do not
  blindly read the ip address in ftrace_bug()  It was reported that a bug on arm64 caused a
  bad ip address to be used for updating into a nop in ftrace_init(), but the error path (rightfully)
  returned -EINVAL and not -EFAULT, as the bug caused more than one error to occur. But because
  -EINVAL was returned, the ftrace_bug() tried to report what was at the location of the ip
  address, and read it directly. This caused the machine to panic, as the ip was not pointing
  to a valid memory address.  Instead, read the ip address with copy_from_kernel_nofault() to
  safely access the memory, and if it faults, report that the address faulted, otherwise report
  what was in that location.'
