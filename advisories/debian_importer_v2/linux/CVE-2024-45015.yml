summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/msm/dpu:
  move dpu_encoder''s connector assignment to atomic_enable()  For cases where the crtc''s connectors_changed
  was set without enable/active getting toggled , there is an atomic_enable() call followed
  by an atomic_disable() but without an atomic_mode_set().  This results in a NULL ptr access
  for the dpu_encoder_get_drm_fmt() call in the atomic_enable() as the dpu_encoder''s connector
  was cleared in the atomic_disable() but not re-assigned as there was no atomic_mode_set()
  call.  Fix the NULL ptr access by moving the assignment for atomic_enable() and also use drm_atomic_get_new_connector_for_encoder()
  to get the connector from the atomic_state.  Patchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/606729/'
