  - CVE-2025-68748
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/panthor:
  Fix UAF race between device unplug and FW event processing  The function panthor_fw_unplug()
  will free the FW memory sections. The problem is that there could still be pending FW events
  which are yet not handled at this point. process_fw_events_work() can in this case try to
  access said freed memory.  Simply call disable_work_sync() to both drain and prevent future
  invocation of process_fw_events_work().'
