summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: fix use-after-free
  on inode when scanning root during em shrinking  At btrfs_scan_root() we are accessing the
  inode''s root (and fs_info) in a call to btrfs_fs_closing() after we have scheduled the inode
  for a delayed iput, and that can result in a use-after-free on the inode in case the cleaner
  kthread does the iput before we dereference the inode in the call to btrfs_fs_closing().  Fix
  this by using the fs_info stored already in a local variable instead of doing inode->root->fs_info.'
