summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  NFS/localio:
  Fix a race in nfs_local_open_fh()  Once the clp->cl_uuid.lock has been dropped, another CPU
  could come in and free the struct nfsd_file that was just added. To prevent that from happening,
  take the RCU read lock before dropping the spin lock.'
