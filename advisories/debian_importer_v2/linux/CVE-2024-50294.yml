summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rxrpc: Fix missing
  locking causing hanging calls  If a call gets aborted (e.g. because kafs saw a signal) between
  it being queued for connection and the I/O thread picking up the call, the abort will be prioritised
  over the connection and it will be removed from local->new_client_calls by rxrpc_disconnect_client_call()
  without a lock being held.  This may cause other calls on the list to disappear if a race
  occurs.  Fix this by taking the client_call_lock when removing a call from whatever list its
  ->wait_link happens to be on.'
