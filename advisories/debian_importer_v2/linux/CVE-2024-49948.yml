summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: add more
  sanity checks to qdisc_pkt_len_init()  One path takes care of SKB_GSO_DODGY, assuming skb->len
  is bigger than hdr_len.  virtio_net_hdr_to_skb() does not fully dissect TCP headers, it only
  make sure it is at least 20 bytes.  It is possible for an user to provide a malicious ''GSO''
  packet, total length of 80 bytes.  - 20 bytes of IPv4 header - 60 bytes TCP header - a small
  gso_size like 8  virtio_net_hdr_to_skb() would declare this packet as a normal GSO packet,
  because it would see 40 bytes of payload, bigger than gso_size.  We need to make detect this
  case to not underflow qdisc_skb_cb(skb)->pkt_len.'
