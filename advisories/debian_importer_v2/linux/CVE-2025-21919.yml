summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sched/fair: Fix
  potential memory corruption in child_cfs_rq_on_list  child_cfs_rq_on_list attempts to convert
  a ''prev'' pointer to a cfs_rq. This ''prev'' pointer can originate from struct rq''s leaf_cfs_rq_list,
  making the conversion invalid and potentially leading to memory corruption. Depending on the
  relative positions of leaf_cfs_rq_list and the task group (tg) pointer within the struct,
  this can cause a memory fault or access garbage data.  The issue arises in list_add_leaf_cfs_rq,
  where both cfs_rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list and rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list are added to the same leaf list.
  Also, rq->tmp_alone_branch can be set to rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list.  This adds a check `if (prev
  == &rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list)` after the main conditional in child_cfs_rq_on_list. This ensures
  that the container_of operation will convert a correct cfs_rq struct.  This check is sufficient
  because only cfs_rqs on the same CPU are added to the list, so verifying the ''prev'' pointer
  against the current rq''s list head is enough.  Fixes a potential memory corruption issue
  that due to current struct layout might not be manifesting as a crash but could lead to unpredictable
  behavior when the layout changes.'
