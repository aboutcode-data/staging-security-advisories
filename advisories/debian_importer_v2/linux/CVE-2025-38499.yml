  - CVE-2025-38499
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clone_private_mnt():
  make sure that caller has CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the right userns  What we want is to verify there
  is that clone won''t expose something hidden by a mount we wouldn''t be able to undo.  "Wouldn''t
  be able to undo" may be a result of MNT_LOCKED on a child, but it may also come from lacking
  admin rights in the userns of the namespace mount belongs to.  clone_private_mnt() checks
  the former, but not the latter.  There''s a number of rather confusing CAP_SYS_ADMIN checks
  in various userns during the mount, especially with the new mount API; they serve different
  purposes and in case of clone_private_mnt() they usually, but not always end up covering the
  missing check mentioned above.'
