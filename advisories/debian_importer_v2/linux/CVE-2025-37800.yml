summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  driver core:
  fix potential NULL pointer dereference in dev_uevent()  If userspace reads "uevent" device
  attribute at the same time as another threads unbinds the device from its driver, change to
  dev->driver from a valid pointer to NULL may result in crash. Fix this by using READ_ONCE()
  when fetching the pointer, and take bus'' drivers klist lock to make sure driver instance
  will not disappear while we access it.  Use WRITE_ONCE() when setting the driver pointer to
  ensure there is no tearing.'
