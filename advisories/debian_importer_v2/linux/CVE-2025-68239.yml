summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  binfmt_misc:
  restore write access before closing files opened by open_exec()  bm_register_write() opens
  an executable file using open_exec(), which internally calls do_open_execat() and denies write
  access on the file to avoid modification while it is being executed.  However, when an error
  occurs, bm_register_write() closes the file using filp_close() directly. This does not restore
  the write permission, which may cause subsequent write operations on the same file to fail.  Fix
  this by calling exe_file_allow_write_access() before filp_close() to restore the write permission
  properly.'
