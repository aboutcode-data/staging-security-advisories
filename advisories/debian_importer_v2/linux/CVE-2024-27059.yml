summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  USB: usb-storage:
  Prevent divide-by-0 error in isd200_ata_command  The isd200 sub-driver in usb-storage uses
  the HEADS and SECTORS values in the ATA ID information to calculate cylinder and head values
  when creating a CDB for READ or WRITE commands.  The calculation involves division and modulus
  operations, which will cause a crash if either of these values is 0.  While this never happens
  with a genuine device, it could happen with a flawed or subversive emulation, as reported
  by the syzbot fuzzer.  Protect against this possibility by refusing to bind to the device
  if either the ATA_ID_HEADS or ATA_ID_SECTORS value in the device''s ID information is 0.  This
  requires isd200_Initialization() to return a negative error code when initialization fails;
  currently it always returns 0 (even when there is an error).'
