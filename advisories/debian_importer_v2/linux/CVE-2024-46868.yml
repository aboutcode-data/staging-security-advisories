summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  firmware: qcom:
  uefisecapp: Fix deadlock in qcuefi_acquire()  If the __qcuefi pointer is not set, then in
  the original code, we would hold onto the lock.  That means that if we tried to set it later,
  then it would cause a deadlock.  Drop the lock on the error path.  That''s what all the callers
  are expecting.'
