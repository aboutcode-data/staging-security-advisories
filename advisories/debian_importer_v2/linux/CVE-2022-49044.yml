summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dm integrity:
  fix memory corruption when tag_size is less than digest size  It is possible to set up dm-integrity
  in such a way that the "tag_size" parameter is less than the actual digest size. In this situation,
  a part of the digest beyond tag_size is ignored.  In this case, dm-integrity would write beyond
  the end of the ic->recalc_tags array and corrupt memory. The corruption happened in integrity_recalc->integrity_sector_checksum->crypto_shash_final.  Fix
  this corruption by increasing the tags array so that it has enough padding at the end to accomodate
  the loop in integrity_recalc() being able to write a full digest size for the last member
  of the tags array.'
