summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net_sched: hfsc:
  Fix a UAF vulnerability in class with netem as child qdisc  As described in Gerrard''s report
  [1], we have a UAF case when an hfsc class has a netem child qdisc. The crux of the issue
  is that hfsc is assuming that checking for cl->qdisc->q.qlen == 0 guarantees that it hasn''t
  inserted the class in the vttree or eltree (which is not true for the netem duplicate case).  This
  patch checks the n_active class variable to make sure that the code won''t insert the class
  in the vttree or eltree twice, catering for the reentrant case.  [1] https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/CAHcdcOm+03OD2j6R0=YHKqmy=VgJ8xEOKuP6c7mSgnp-TEJJbw@mail.gmail.com/'
