summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/panthor:
  Prevent potential UAF in group creation  This commit prevents the possibility of a use after
  free issue in the GROUP_CREATE ioctl function, which arose as pointer to the group is accessed
  in that ioctl function after storing it in the Xarray. A malicious userspace can second guess
  the handle of a group and try to call GROUP_DESTROY ioctl from another thread around the same
  time as GROUP_CREATE ioctl.  To prevent the use after free exploit, this commit uses a mark
  on an entry of group pool Xarray which is added just before returning from the GROUP_CREATE
  ioctl function. The mark is checked for all ioctls that specify the group handle and so userspace
  won''t be abe to delete a group that isn''t marked yet.  v2: Add R-bs and fixes tags'
