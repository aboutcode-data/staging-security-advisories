  - CVE-2021-26930
summary: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 3.11 through 5.10.16, as used by Xen. To
  service requests to the PV backend, the driver maps grant references provided by the frontend.
  In this process, errors may be encountered. In one case, an error encountered earlier might
  be discarded by later processing, resulting in the caller assuming successful mapping, and
  hence subsequent operations trying to access space that wasn't mapped. In another case, internal
  state would be insufficiently updated, preventing safe recovery from the error. This affects
  drivers/block/xen-blkback/blkback.c.
