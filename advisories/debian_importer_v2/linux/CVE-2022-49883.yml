summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: x86: smm:
  number of GPRs in the SMRAM image depends on the image format  On 64 bit host, if the guest
  doesn''t have X86_FEATURE_LM, KVM will access 16 gprs to 32-bit smram image, causing out-ouf-bound
  ram access.  On 32 bit host, the rsm_load_state_64/enter_smm_save_state_64 is compiled out,
  thus access overflow can''t happen.'
