summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Revert "usb:
  typec: ucsi: add a common function ucsi_unregister_connectors()"  The recent commit 87d0e2f41b8c
  ("usb: typec: ucsi: add a common function ucsi_unregister_connectors()") introduced a regression
  that caused NULL dereference at reading the power supply sysfs.  It''s a stale sysfs entry
  that should have been removed but remains with NULL ops.  The commit changed the error handling
  to skip the entries after a NULL con->wq, and this leaves the power device unreleased.  For
  addressing the regression, the straight revert is applied here. Further code improvements
  can be done from the scratch again.'
