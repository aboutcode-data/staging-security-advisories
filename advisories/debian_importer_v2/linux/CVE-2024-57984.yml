summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i3c: dw: Fix
  use-after-free in dw_i3c_master driver due to race condition  In dw_i3c_common_probe, &master->hj_work
  is bound with dw_i3c_hj_work. And dw_i3c_master_irq_handler can call dw_i3c_master_irq_handle_ibis
  function to start the work.  If we remove the module which will call dw_i3c_common_remove
  to make cleanup, it will free master->base through i3c_master_unregister while the work mentioned
  above will be used. The sequence of operations that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:  CPU0                                      CPU1                                       |
  dw_i3c_hj_work dw_i3c_common_remove                 | i3c_master_unregister(&master->base)
  | device_unregister(&master->dev)      | device_release                       | //free master->base                  |                                      |
  i3c_master_do_daa(&master->base)                                      | //use master->base  Fix
  it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding with the cleanup in dw_i3c_common_remove.'
