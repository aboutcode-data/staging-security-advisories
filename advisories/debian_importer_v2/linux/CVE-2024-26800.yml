summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tls: fix use-after-free
  on failed backlog decryption  When the decrypt request goes to the backlog and crypto_aead_decrypt
  returns -EBUSY, tls_do_decryption will wait until all async decryptions have completed. If
  one of them fails, tls_do_decryption will return -EBADMSG and tls_decrypt_sg jumps to the
  error path, releasing all the pages. But the pages have been passed to the async callback,
  and have already been released by tls_decrypt_done.  The only true async case is when crypto_aead_decrypt
  returns  -EINPROGRESS. With -EBUSY, we already waited so we can tell tls_sw_recvmsg that the
  data is available for immediate copy, but we need to notify tls_decrypt_sg (via the new ->async_done
  flag) that the memory has already been released.'
