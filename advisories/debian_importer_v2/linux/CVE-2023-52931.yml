summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/i915: Avoid
  potential vm use-after-free  Adding the vm to the vm_xa table makes it visible to userspace,
  which could try to race with us to close the vm.  So we need to take our extra reference before
  putting it in the table.  (cherry picked from commit 99343c46d4e2b34c285d3d5f68ff04274c2f9fb4)'
