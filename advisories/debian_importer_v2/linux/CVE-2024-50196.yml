summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  pinctrl: ocelot:\
  \ fix system hang on level based interrupts  The current implementation only calls chained_irq_enter()\
  \ and chained_irq_exit() if it detects pending interrupts.  ``` for (i = 0; i < info->stride;\
  \ i++) { \turegmap_read(info->map, id_reg + 4 * i, &reg); \tif (!reg) \t\tcontinue;  \tchained_irq_enter(parent_chip,\
  \ desc); ```  However, in case of GPIO pin configured in level mode and the parent controller\
  \ configured in edge mode, GPIO interrupt might be lowered by the hardware. In the result,\
  \ if the interrupt is short enough, the parent interrupt is still pending while the GPIO interrupt\
  \ is cleared; chained_irq_enter() never gets called and the system hangs trying to service\
  \ the parent interrupt.  Moving chained_irq_enter() and chained_irq_exit() outside the for\
  \ loop ensures that they are called even when GPIO interrupt is lowered by the hardware. \
  \ The similar code with chained_irq_enter() / chained_irq_exit() functions wrapping interrupt\
  \ checking loop may be found in many other drivers: ``` grep -r -A 10 chained_irq_enter drivers/pinctrl\
  \ ```"
