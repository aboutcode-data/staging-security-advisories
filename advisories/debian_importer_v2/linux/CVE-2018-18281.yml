summary: 'Since Linux kernel version 3.2, the mremap() syscall performs TLB flushes after dropping
  pagetable locks. If a syscall such as ftruncate() removes entries from the pagetables of a
  task that is in the middle of mremap(), a stale TLB entry can remain for a short time that
  permits access to a physical page after it has been released back to the page allocator and
  reused. This is fixed in the following kernel versions: 4.9.135, 4.14.78, 4.18.16, 4.19.'
