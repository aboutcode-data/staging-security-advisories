summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: mpi3mr:
  Bad drive in topology results kernel crash  When the SAS Transport Layer support is enabled
  and a device exposed to the OS by the driver fails INQUIRY commands, the driver frees up the
  memory allocated for an internal HBA port data structure. However, in some places, the reference
  to the freed memory is not cleared. When the firmware sends the Device Info change event for
  the same device again, the freed memory is accessed and that leads to memory corruption and
  OS crash.'
