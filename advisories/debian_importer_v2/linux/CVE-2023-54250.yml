  - CVE-2023-54250
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ksmbd: avoid
  out of bounds access in decode_preauth_ctxt()  Confirm that the accessed pneg_ctxt->HashAlgorithms
  address sits within the SMB request boundary; deassemble_neg_contexts() only checks that the
  eight byte smb2_neg_context header + (client controlled) DataLength are within the packet
  boundary, which is insufficient.  Checking for sizeof(struct smb2_preauth_neg_context) is
  overkill given that the type currently assumes SMB311_SALT_SIZE bytes of trailing Salt.'
