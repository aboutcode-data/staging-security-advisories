summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  amd/amdkfd: sync
  all devices to wait all processes being evicted  If there are more than one device doing reset
  in parallel, the first device will call kfd_suspend_all_processes() to evict all processes
  on all devices, this call takes time to finish. other device will start reset and recover
  without waiting. if the process has not been evicted before doing recover, it will be restored,
  then caused page fault.'
