  - CVE-2025-38436
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/scheduler:
  signal scheduled fence when kill job  When an entity from application B is killed, drm_sched_entity_kill()
  removes all jobs belonging to that entity through drm_sched_entity_kill_jobs_work(). If application
  A''s job depends on a scheduled fence from application B''s job, and that fence is not properly
  signaled during the killing process, application A''s dependency cannot be cleared.  This
  leads to application A hanging indefinitely while waiting for a dependency that will never
  be resolved. Fix this issue by ensuring that scheduled fences are properly signaled when an
  entity is killed, allowing dependent applications to continue execution.'
