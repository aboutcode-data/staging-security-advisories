summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpftool: Fix
  undefined behavior in qsort(NULL, 0, ...)  When netfilter has no entry to display, qsort is
  called with qsort(NULL, 0, ...). This results in undefined behavior, as UBSan reports:  net.c:827:2:
  runtime error: null pointer passed as argument 1, which is declared to never be null  Although
  the C standard does not explicitly state whether calling qsort with a NULL pointer when the
  size is 0 constitutes undefined behavior, Section 7.1.4 of the C standard (Use of library
  functions) mentions:  "Each of the following statements applies unless explicitly stated otherwise
  in the detailed descriptions that follow: If an argument to a function has an invalid value
  (such as a value outside the domain of the function, or a pointer outside the address space
  of the program, or a null pointer, or a pointer to non-modifiable storage when the corresponding
  parameter is not const-qualified) or a type (after promotion) not expected by a function with
  variable number of arguments, the behavior is undefined."  To avoid this, add an early return
  when nf_link_info is NULL to prevent calling qsort with a NULL pointer.'
