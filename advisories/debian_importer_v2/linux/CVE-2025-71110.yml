summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/slub: reset
  KASAN tag in defer_free() before accessing freed memory  When CONFIG_SLUB_TINY is enabled,
  kfree_nolock() calls kasan_slab_free() before defer_free(). On ARM64 with MTE (Memory Tagging
  Extension), kasan_slab_free() poisons the memory and changes the tag from the original (e.g.,
  0xf3) to a poison tag (0xfe).  When defer_free() then tries to write to the freed object to
  build the deferred free list via llist_add(), the pointer still has the old tag, causing a
  tag mismatch and triggering a KASAN use-after-free report:    BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free
  in defer_free+0x3c/0xbc mm/slub.c:6537   Write at addr f3f000000854f020 by task kworker/u8:6/983   Pointer
  tag: [f3], memory tag: [fe]  Fix this by calling kasan_reset_tag() before accessing the freed
  memory. This is safe because defer_free() is part of the allocator itself and is expected
  to manipulate freed memory for bookkeeping purposes.'
