summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: tls: handle
  backlogging of crypto requests  Since we''re setting the CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_BACKLOG flag on
  our requests to the crypto API, crypto_aead_{encrypt,decrypt} can return  -EBUSY instead of
  -EINPROGRESS in valid situations. For example, when the cryptd queue for AESNI is full (easy
  to trigger with an artificially low cryptd.cryptd_max_cpu_qlen), requests will be enqueued
  to the backlog but still processed. In that case, the async callback will also be called twice:
  first with err == -EINPROGRESS, which it seems we can just ignore, then with err == 0.  Compared
  to Sabrina''s original patch this version uses the new tls_*crypt_async_wait() helpers and
  converts the EBUSY to EINPROGRESS to avoid having to modify all the error handling paths.
  The handling is identical.'
