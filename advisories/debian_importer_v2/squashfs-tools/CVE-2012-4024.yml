aliases:
  - CVE-2012-4024
summary: 'Stack-based buffer overflow in the get_component function in unsquashfs.c in unsquashfs
  in Squashfs 4.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted
  list file (aka a crafted file for the -ef option).  NOTE: probably in most cases, the list
  file is a trusted file constructed by the program''s user; however, there are some realistic
  situations in which a list file would be obtained from an untrusted remote source.'
