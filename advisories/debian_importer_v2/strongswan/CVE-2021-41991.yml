  - CVE-2021-41991
summary: The in-memory certificate cache in strongSwan before 5.9.4 has a remote integer overflow
  upon receiving many requests with different certificates to fill the cache and later trigger
  the replacement of cache entries. The code attempts to select a less-often-used cache entry
  by means of a random number generator, but this is not done correctly. Remote code execution
  might be a slight possibility.
