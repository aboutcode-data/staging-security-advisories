  - CVE-2019-18397
summary: A buffer overflow in the fribidi_get_par_embedding_levels_ex() function in lib/fribidi-bidi.c
  of GNU FriBidi through 1.0.7 allows an attacker to cause a denial of service or possibly execute
  arbitrary code by delivering crafted text content to a user, when this content is then rendered
  by an application that uses FriBidi for text layout calculations. Examples include any GNOME
  or GTK+ based application that uses Pango for text layout, as this internally uses FriBidi
  for bidirectional text layout. For example, the attacker can construct a crafted text file
  to be opened in GEdit, or a crafted IRC message to be viewed in HexChat.
