  - CVE-2005-2097
summary: xpdf and kpdf do not properly validate the "loca" table in PDF files, which allows
  local users to cause a denial of service (disk consumption and hang) via a PDF file with a
  "broken" loca table, which causes a large temporary file to be created when xpdf attempts
  to reconstruct the information.
