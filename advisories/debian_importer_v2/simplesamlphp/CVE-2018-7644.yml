aliases:
  - CVE-2018-7644
summary: The XmlSecLibs library as used in the saml2 library in SimpleSAMLphp before 1.15.3
  incorrectly verifies signatures on SAML assertions, allowing a remote attacker to construct
  a crafted SAML assertion on behalf of an Identity Provider that would pass as cryptographically
  valid, thereby allowing them to impersonate a user from that Identity Provider, aka a key
  confusion issue.
