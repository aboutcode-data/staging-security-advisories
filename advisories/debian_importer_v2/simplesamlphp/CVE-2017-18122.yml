  - CVE-2017-18122
summary: A signature-validation bypass issue was discovered in SimpleSAMLphp through 1.14.16.
  A SimpleSAMLphp Service Provider using SAML 1.1 will regard as valid any unsigned SAML response
  containing more than one signed assertion, provided that the signature of at least one of
  the assertions is valid. Attributes contained in all the assertions received will be merged
  and the entityID of the first assertion received will be used, allowing an attacker to impersonate
  any user of any IdP given an assertion signed by the targeted IdP.
