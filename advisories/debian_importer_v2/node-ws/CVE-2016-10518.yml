  - CVE-2016-10518
summary: A vulnerability was found in the ping functionality of the ws module before 1.0.0 which
  allowed clients to allocate memory by sending a ping frame. The ping functionality by default
  responds with a pong frame and the previously given payload of the ping frame. This is exactly
  what you expect, but internally ws always transforms all data that we need to send to a Buffer
  instance and that is where the vulnerability existed. ws didn't do any checks for the type
  of data it was sending. With buffers in node when you allocate it when a number instead of
  a string it will allocate the amount of bytes.
