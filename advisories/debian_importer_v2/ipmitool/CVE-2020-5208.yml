aliases:
  - CVE-2020-5208
summary: It's been found that multiple functions in ipmitool before 1.8.19 neglect proper checking
  of the data received from a remote LAN party, which may lead to buffer overflows and potentially
  to remote code execution on the ipmitool side. This is especially dangerous if ipmitool is
  run as a privileged user. This problem is fixed in version 1.8.19.
