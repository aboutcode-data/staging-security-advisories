summary: 'The GitHub CLI version 2.6.1 and earlier are vulnerable to remote code execution through
  a malicious codespace SSH server when using `gh codespace ssh` or `gh codespace logs` commands.
  This has been patched in the cli v2.62.0.  Developers connect to remote codespaces through
  an SSH server running within the devcontainer, which is generally provided through the [default
  devcontainer image]( https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-...
  https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers#using-the-default-dev-container-configuration)
  . GitHub CLI [retrieves SSH connection details]( https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/30066b0042d0c5928d959e288144300cb28196c9/internal/codespaces/rpc/inv...
  https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/30066b0042d0c5928d959e288144300cb28196c9/internal/codespaces/rpc/invoker.go#L230-L244
  ), such as remote username, which is used in [executing `ssh` commands]( https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/e356c69a6f0125cfaac782c35acf77314f18908d/pkg/cmd/codespace/ssh.go#L2...
  https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/e356c69a6f0125cfaac782c35acf77314f18908d/pkg/cmd/codespace/ssh.go#L263
  ) for `gh codespace ssh` or `gh codespace logs` commands.  This exploit occurs when a malicious
  third-party devcontainer contains a modified SSH server that injects `ssh` arguments within
  the SSH connection details. `gh codespace ssh` and `gh codespace logs` commands could execute
  arbitrary code on the user''s workstation if the remote username contains something like `-oProxyCommand="echo
  hacked" #`.  The `-oProxyCommand` flag causes `ssh` to execute the provided command while
  `#` shell comment causes any other `ssh` arguments to be ignored.  In `2.62.0`, the remote
  username information is being validated before being used.'
