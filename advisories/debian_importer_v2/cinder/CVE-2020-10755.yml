  - CVE-2020-10755
summary: 'An insecure-credentials flaw was found in all openstack-cinder versions before openstack-cinder
  14.1.0, all openstack-cinder 15.x.x versions before openstack-cinder 15.2.0 and all openstack-cinder
  16.x.x versions before openstack-cinder 16.1.0. When using openstack-cinder with the Dell
  EMC ScaleIO or VxFlex OS backend storage driver, credentials for the entire backend are exposed
  in the ``connection_info`` element in all Block Storage v3 Attachments API calls containing
  that element. This flaw enables an end-user to create a volume, make an API call to show the
  attachment detail information, and retrieve a username and password that may be used to connect
  to another user''s volume. Additionally, these credentials are valid for the ScaleIO or VxFlex
  OS Management API, should an attacker discover the Management API endpoint. Source: OpenStack
