  - CVE-2000-1221
summary: The line printer daemon (lpd) in the lpr package in multiple Linux operating systems
  authenticates by comparing the reverse-resolved hostname of the local machine to the hostname
  of the print server as returned by gethostname, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended
  access controls by modifying the DNS for the attacking IP.
