summary: Randomly-generated alphanumeric strings contain significantly less entropy than expected.
  The RandomAlphaNumeric and CryptoRandomAlphaNumeric functions always return strings containing
  at least one digit from 0 to 9. This significantly reduces the amount of entropy in short
  strings generated by these functions.
