aliases:
  - CVE-2021-23351
summary: The package github.com/pires/go-proxyproto before 0.5.0 are vulnerable to Denial of
  Service (DoS) via the parseVersion1() function. The reader in this package is a default bufio.Reader
  wrapping a net.Conn. It will read from the connection until it finds a newline. Since no limits
  are implemented in the code, a deliberately malformed V1 header could be used to exhaust memory
  in a server process using this code - and create a DoS. This can be exploited by sending a
  stream starting with PROXY and continuing to send data (which does not contain a newline)
  until the target stops acknowledging. The risk here is small, because only trusted sources
  should be allowed to send proxy protocol headers.
