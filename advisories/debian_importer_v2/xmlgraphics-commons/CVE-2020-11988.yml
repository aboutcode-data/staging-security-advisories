  - CVE-2020-11988
summary: Apache XmlGraphics Commons 2.4 and earlier is vulnerable to server-side request forgery,
  caused by improper input validation by the XMPParser. By using a specially-crafted argument,
  an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the underlying server to make arbitrary
  GET requests. Users should upgrade to 2.6 or later.
