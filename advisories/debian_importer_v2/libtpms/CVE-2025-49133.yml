  - CVE-2025-49133
summary: 'Libtpms is a library that targets the integration of TPM functionality into hypervisors,
  primarily into Qemu. Libtpms, which is derived from the TPM 2.0 reference implementation code
  published by the Trusted Computing Group, is prone to a potential out of bounds (OOB) read
  vulnerability. The vulnerability occurs in the ‘CryptHmacSign’ function with an inconsistent
  pairing of the signKey and signScheme parameters, where the signKey is ALG_KEYEDHASH key and
  inScheme is an ECC or RSA scheme. The reported vulnerability is in the ‘CryptHmacSign’ function,
  which is defined in the "Part 4: Supporting Routines – Code" document, section "7.151 - /tpm/src/crypt/CryptUtil.c
  ". This vulnerability can be triggered from user-mode applications by sending malicious commands
  to a TPM 2.0/vTPM (swtpm) whose firmware is based on an affected TCG reference implementation.
  The effect on libtpms is that it will cause an abort due to the detection of the out-of-bounds
  access, thus for example making a vTPM (swtpm) unavailable to a VM. This vulnerability is
  fixed in 0.7.12, 0.8.10, 0.9.7, and 0.10.1.'
