  - CVE-2026-21444
summary: libtpms, a library that provides software emulation of a Trusted Platform Module, has
  a flaw in versions 0.10.0 and 0.10.1. The commonly used integration of libtpms with OpenSSL
  3.x contained a vulnerability related to the returned IV (initialization vector) when certain
  symmetric ciphers were used. Instead of returning the last IV it returned the initial IV to
  the caller, thus weakening the subsequent encryption and decryption steps. The highest threat
  from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality. Version 0.10.2 fixes the issue. No known
  workarounds are available.
