  - CVE-2020-13696
summary: An issue was discovered in LinuxTV xawtv before 3.107. The function dev_open() in v4l-conf.c
  does not perform sufficient checks to prevent an unprivileged caller of the program from opening
  unintended filesystem paths. This allows a local attacker with access to the v4l-conf setuid-root
  program to test for the existence of arbitrary files and to trigger an open on arbitrary files
  with mode O_RDWR. To achieve this, relative path components need to be added to the device
  path, as demonstrated by a v4l-conf -c /dev/../root/.bash_history command.
