aliases:
  - CVE-2016-1522
summary: Code.cpp in Libgraphite in Graphite 2 1.2.4, as used in Mozilla Firefox before 43.0
  and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.6.1, does not consider recursive load calls during a size check,
  which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or
  possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted Graphite smart font.
