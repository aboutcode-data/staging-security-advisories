  - CVE-2021-29462
summary: The Portable SDK for UPnP Devices is an SDK for development of UPnP device and control
  point applications. The server part of pupnp (libupnp) appears to be vulnerable to DNS rebinding
  attacks because it does not check the value of the `Host` header. This can be mitigated by
  using DNS revolvers which block DNS-rebinding attacks. The vulnerability is fixed in version
  1.14.6 and later.
