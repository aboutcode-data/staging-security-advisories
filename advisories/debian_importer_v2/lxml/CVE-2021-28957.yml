  - CVE-2021-28957
summary: An XSS vulnerability was discovered in python-lxml's clean module versions before 4.6.3.
  When disabling the safe_attrs_only and forms arguments, the Cleaner class does not remove
  the formaction attribute allowing for JS to bypass the sanitizer. A remote attacker could
  exploit this flaw to run arbitrary JS code on users who interact with incorrectly sanitized
  HTML. This issue is patched in lxml 4.6.3.
