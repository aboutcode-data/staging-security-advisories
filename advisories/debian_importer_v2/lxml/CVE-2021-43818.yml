  - CVE-2021-43818
summary: lxml is a library for processing XML and HTML in the Python language. Prior to version
  4.6.5, the HTML Cleaner in lxml.html lets certain crafted script content pass through, as
  well as script content in SVG files embedded using data URIs. Users that employ the HTML cleaner
  in a security relevant context should upgrade to lxml 4.6.5 to receive a patch. There are
  no known workarounds available.
