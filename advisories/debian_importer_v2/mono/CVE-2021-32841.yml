summary: 'SharpZipLib (or #ziplib) is a Zip, GZip, Tar and BZip2 library. Starting version 1.3.0
  and prior to version 1.3.3, a check was added if the destination file is under destination
  directory. However, it is not enforced that `destDir` ends with slash. If the `destDir` is
  not slash terminated like `/home/user/dir` it is possible to create a file with a name thats
  begins with the destination directory, i.e. `/home/user/dir.sh`. Because of the file name
  and destination directory constraints, the arbitrary file creation impact is limited and depends
  on the use case. Version 1.3.3 contains a patch for this vulnerability.'
