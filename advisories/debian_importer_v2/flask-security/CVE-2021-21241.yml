summary: The Python "Flask-Security-Too" package is used for adding security features to your
  Flask application. It is an is a independently maintained version of Flask-Security based
  on the 3.0.0 version of Flask-Security. In Flask-Security-Too from version 3.3.0 and before
  version 3.4.5, the /login and /change endpoints can return the authenticated user's authentication
  token in response to a GET request. Since GET requests aren't protected with a CSRF token,
  this could lead to a malicious 3rd party site acquiring the authentication token. Version
  3.4.5 and version 4.0.0 are patched. As a workaround, if you aren't using authentication tokens
  - you can set the SECURITY_TOKEN_MAX_AGE to "0" (seconds) which should make the token unusable.
