  - CVE-2018-13410
summary: 'Info-ZIP Zip 3.0, when the -T and -TT command-line options are used, allows attackers
  to cause a denial of service (invalid free and application crash) or possibly have unspecified
  other impact because of an off-by-one error. NOTE: it is unclear whether there are realistic
  scenarios in which an untrusted party controls the -TT value, given that the entire purpose
  of -TT is execution of arbitrary commands'
