summary: 'Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE (component:
  2D). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u261, 8u251, 11.0.7 and 14.0.1; Java
  SE Embedded: 8u251. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with
  network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful
  attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability
  is in Java SE, Java SE Embedded, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful
  attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized creation, deletion or modification
  access to critical data or all Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: This vulnerability
  applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications
  or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the
  internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to
  Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed
  by an administrator). CVSS 3.1 Base Score 7.4 (Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N).'
