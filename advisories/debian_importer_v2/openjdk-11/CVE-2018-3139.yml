summary: 'Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent:
  Networking). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u201, 7u191, 8u182 and 11;
  Java SE Embedded: 8u181. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker
  with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful
  attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks
  of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, Java
  SE Embedded accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically
  in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java
  SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g. code that comes from the internet) and rely
  on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically
  in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g. code installed by an administrator).
