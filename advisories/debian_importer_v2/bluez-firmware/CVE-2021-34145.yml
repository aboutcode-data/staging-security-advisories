aliases:
  - CVE-2021-34145
summary: The Bluetooth Classic implementation in the Cypress WICED BT stack through 2.9.0 for
  CYW20735B1 devices does not properly handle the reception of LMP_max_slot with an invalid
  Baseband packet type (and LT_ADDRESS and LT_ADDR) after completion of the LMP setup procedure,
  allowing attackers in radio range to trigger a denial of service (firmware crash) via a crafted
  LMP packet.
