  - CVE-2026-27606
summary: Rollup is a module bundler for JavaScript. Versions prior to 2.80.0, 3.30.0, and 4.59.0
  of the Rollup module bundler (specifically v4.x and present in current source) is vulnerable
  to an Arbitrary File Write via Path Traversal. Insecure file name sanitization in the core
  engine allows an attacker to control output filenames (e.g., via CLI named inputs, manual
  chunk aliases, or malicious plugins) and use traversal sequences (`../`) to overwrite files
  anywhere on the host filesystem that the build process has permissions for. This can lead
  to persistent Remote Code Execution (RCE) by overwriting critical system or user configuration
  files. Versions 2.80.0, 3.30.0, and 4.59.0 contain a patch for the issue.
