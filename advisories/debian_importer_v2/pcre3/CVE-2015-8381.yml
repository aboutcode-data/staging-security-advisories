  - CVE-2015-8381
summary: The compile_regex function in pcre_compile.c in PCRE before 8.38 and pcre2_compile.c
  in PCRE2 before 10.2x mishandles the /(?J:(?|(:(?|(?'R')(\k'R')|((?'R')))H'Rk'Rf)|s(?'R'))))/
  and /(?J:(?|(:(?|(?'R')(\z(?|(?'R')(\k'R')|((?'R')))k'R')|((?'R')))H'Ak'Rf)|s(?'R')))/ patterns,
  and related patterns with certain group references, which allows remote attackers to cause
  a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact
  via a crafted regular expression, as demonstrated by a JavaScript RegExp object encountered
  by Konqueror.
