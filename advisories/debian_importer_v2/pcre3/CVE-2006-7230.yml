  - CVE-2006-7230
summary: Perl-Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library before 7.0 does not properly calculate
  the amount of memory needed for a compiled regular expression pattern when the (1) -x or (2)
  -i UTF-8 options change within the pattern, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause
  a denial of service (PCRE or glibc crash) via crafted regular expressions.
