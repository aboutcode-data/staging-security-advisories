  - CVE-2007-1661
summary: Perl-Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library before 7.3 backtracks too far when
  matching certain input bytes against some regex patterns in non-UTF-8 mode, which allows context-dependent
  attackers to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service (crash), as demonstrated
  by the "\X?\d" and "\P{L}?\d" patterns.
