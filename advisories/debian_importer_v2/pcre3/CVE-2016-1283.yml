summary: The pcre_compile2 function in pcre_compile.c in PCRE 8.38 mishandles the /((?:F?+(?:^(?(R)a+\"){99}-))(?J)(?'R'(?'R'<((?'RR'(?'R'\){97)?J)?J)(?'R'(?'R'\){99|(:(?|(?'R')(\k'R')|((?'R')))H'R'R)(H'R))))))/
  pattern and related patterns with named subgroups, which allows remote attackers to cause
  a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact
  via a crafted regular expression, as demonstrated by a JavaScript RegExp object encountered
  by Konqueror.
