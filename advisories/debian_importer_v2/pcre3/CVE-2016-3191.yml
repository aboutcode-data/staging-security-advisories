  - CVE-2016-3191
summary: The compile_branch function in pcre_compile.c in PCRE 8.x before 8.39 and pcre2_compile.c
  in PCRE2 before 10.22 mishandles patterns containing an (*ACCEPT) substring in conjunction
  with nested parentheses, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause
  a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow) via a crafted regular expression, as demonstrated
  by a JavaScript RegExp object encountered by Konqueror, aka ZDI-CAN-3542.
