  - CVE-2005-4872
summary: 'Perl-Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library before 6.2 does not properly count
  the number of named capturing subpatterns, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause
  a denial of service (crash) via a regular expression with a large number of named subpatterns,
  which triggers a buffer overflow.  NOTE: this issue was originally subsumed by CVE-2006-7224,
  but that CVE has been REJECTED and split.'
