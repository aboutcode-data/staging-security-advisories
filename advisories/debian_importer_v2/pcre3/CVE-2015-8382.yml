aliases:
  - CVE-2015-8382
summary: The match function in pcre_exec.c in PCRE before 8.37 mishandles the /(?:((abcd))|(((?:(?:(?:(?:abc|(?:abcdef))))b)abcdefghi)abc)|((*ACCEPT)))/
  pattern and related patterns involving (*ACCEPT), which allows remote attackers to obtain
  sensitive information from process memory or cause a denial of service (partially initialized
  memory and application crash) via a crafted regular expression, as demonstrated by a JavaScript
  RegExp object encountered by Konqueror, aka ZDI-CAN-2547.
