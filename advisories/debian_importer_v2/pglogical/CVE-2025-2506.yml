aliases:
  - CVE-2025-2506
summary: When pglogical attempts to replicate data, it does not verify it is using a replication
  connection, which means a user with CONNECT access to a database configured for replication
  can execute the pglogical command to obtain read access to replicated tables. When pglogical
  runs it should verify it is running on a replication connection but does not perform this
  check. This vulnerability was introduced in the pglogical 3.x codebase, which is proprietary
  to EDB. The same code base has been integrated into BDR/PGD 4 and 5. To exploit the vulnerability
  the attacker needs at least CONNECT permissions to a database configured for replication and
  must understand a number of pglogical3/BDR specific commands and be able to decode the binary
  protocol.
