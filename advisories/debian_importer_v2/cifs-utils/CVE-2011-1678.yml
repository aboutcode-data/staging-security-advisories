aliases:
  - CVE-2011-1678
summary: smbfs in Samba 3.5.8 and earlier attempts to use (1) mount.cifs to append to the /etc/mtab
  file and (2) umount.cifs to append to the /etc/mtab.tmp file without first checking whether
  resource limits would interfere, which allows local users to trigger corruption of the /etc/mtab
  file via a process with a small RLIMIT_FSIZE value, a related issue to CVE-2011-1089.
