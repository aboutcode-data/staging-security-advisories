summary: Off-by-one error in the inflate function in Zlib.xs in Compress::Raw::Zlib Perl module
  before 2.017, as used in AMaViS, SpamAssassin, and possibly other products, allows context-dependent
  attackers to cause a denial of service (hang or crash) via a crafted zlib compressed stream
  that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild by Trojan.Downloader-71014
  in June 2009.
