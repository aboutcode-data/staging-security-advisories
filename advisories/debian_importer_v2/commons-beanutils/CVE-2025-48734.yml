  - CVE-2025-48734
summary: Improper Access Control vulnerability in Apache Commons.    A special BeanIntrospector
  class was added in version 1.9.2. This can be used to stop attackers from using the declared
  class property of Java enum objects to get access to the classloader. However this protection
  was not enabled by default. PropertyUtilsBean (and consequently BeanUtilsBean) now disallows
  declared class level property access by default.      Releases 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 address
  a potential security issue when accessing enum properties in an uncontrolled way. If an application
  using Commons BeanUtils passes property paths from an external source directly to the getProperty()
  method of PropertyUtilsBean, an attacker can access the enum’s class loader via the “declaredClass”
  property available on all Java “enum” objects. Accessing the enum’s “declaredClass” allows
  remote attackers to access the ClassLoader and execute arbitrary code. The same issue exists
  with PropertyUtilsBean.getNestedProperty(). Starting in versions 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 a special
  BeanIntrospector suppresses the “declaredClass” property. Note that this new BeanIntrospector
  is enabled by default, but you can disable it to regain the old behavior; see section 2.5
  of the user's guide and the unit tests.  This issue affects Apache Commons BeanUtils 1.x before
  1.11.0, and 2.x before 2.0.0-M2.Users of the artifact commons-beanutils:commons-beanutils   1.x
  are recommended to upgrade to version 1.11.0, which fixes the issue.   Users of the artifact
  org.apache.commons:commons-beanutils2   2.x are recommended to upgrade to version 2.0.0-M2,
  which fixes the issue.
