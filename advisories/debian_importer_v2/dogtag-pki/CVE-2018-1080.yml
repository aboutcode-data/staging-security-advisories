aliases:
  - CVE-2018-1080
summary: Dogtag PKI, through version 10.6.1, has a vulnerability in AAclAuthz.java that, under
  certain configurations, causes the application of ACL allow and deny rules to be reversed.
  If a server is configured to process allow rules before deny rules (authz.evaluateOrder=allow,deny),
  then allow rules will deny access and deny rules will grant access. This may result in an
  escalation of privileges or have other unintended consequences.
