  - CVE-2022-31116
summary: UltraJSON is a fast JSON encoder and decoder written in pure C with bindings for Python
  3.7+. Affected versions were found to improperly decode certain characters. JSON strings that
  contain escaped surrogate characters not part of a proper surrogate pair were decoded incorrectly.
  Besides corrupting strings, this allowed for potential key confusion and value overwriting
  in dictionaries. All users parsing JSON from untrusted sources are vulnerable. From version
  5.4.0, UltraJSON decodes lone surrogates in the same way as the standard library's `json`
  module does, preserving them in the parsed output. Users are advised to upgrade. There are
  no known workarounds for this issue.
