  - CVE-2021-3181
summary: rfc822.c in Mutt through 2.0.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (mailbox unavailability) by sending email messages with sequences of semicolon characters
  in RFC822 address fields (aka terminators of empty groups). A small email message from the
  attacker can cause large memory consumption, and the victim may then be unable to see email
  messages from other persons.
