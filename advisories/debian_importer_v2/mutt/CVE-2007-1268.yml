  - CVE-2007-1268
summary: Mutt 1.5.13 and earlier does not properly use the --status-fd argument when invoking
  GnuPG, which prevents Mutt from visually distinguishing between signed and unsigned portions
  of OpenPGP messages with multiple components, which allows remote attackers to forge the contents
  of a message without detection.
