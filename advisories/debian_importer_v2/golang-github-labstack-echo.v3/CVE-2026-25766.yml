  - CVE-2026-25766
summary: Echo is a Go web framework. In versions 5.0.0 through 5.0.2 on Windows, Echo’s `middleware.Static`
  using the default filesystem allows path traversal via backslashes, enabling unauthenticated
  remote file read outside the static root. In `middleware/static.go`, the requested path is
  unescaped and normalized with `path.Clean` (URL semantics). `path.Clean` does not treat `\`
  as a path separator, so `..\` sequences remain in the cleaned path. The resulting path is
  then passed to `currentFS.Open(...)`. When the filesystem is left at the default (nil), Echo
  uses `defaultFS` which calls `os.Open` (`echo.go:792`). On Windows, `os.Open` treats `\` as
  a path separator and resolves `..\`, allowing traversal outside the static root. Version 5.0.3
  fixes the issue.
