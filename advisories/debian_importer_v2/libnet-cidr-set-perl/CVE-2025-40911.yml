  - CVE-2025-40911
summary: Net::CIDR::Set versions 0.10 through 0.13 for Perl does not properly handle leading
  zero characters in IP CIDR address strings, which could allow attackers to bypass access control
  that is based on IP addresses.  Leading zeros are used to indicate octal numbers, which can
  confuse users who are intentionally using octal notation, as well as users who believe they
  are using decimal notation.  Net::CIDR::Set used code from Net::CIDR::Lite, which had a similar
  vulnerability CVE-2021-47154.
