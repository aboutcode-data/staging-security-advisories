  - CVE-2022-31622
summary: 'MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. In extra/mariabackup/ds_compress.cc,
  when an error occurs (pthread_create returns a nonzero value) while executing the method create_worker_threads,
  the held lock is not released correctly, which allows local users to trigger a denial of service
  due to the deadlock. Note: The vendor argues this is just an improper locking bug and not
  a vulnerability with adverse effects.'
