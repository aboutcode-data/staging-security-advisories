  - CVE-2023-31132
summary: Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management framework. Affected
  versions are subject to a privilege escalation vulnerability. A low-privileged OS user with
  access to a Windows host where Cacti is installed can create arbitrary PHP files in a web
  document directory. The user can then execute the PHP files under the security context of
  SYSTEM. This allows an attacker to escalate privilege from a normal user account to SYSTEM.
  This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no
  known workarounds for this vulnerability.
