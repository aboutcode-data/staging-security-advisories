  - CVE-2023-39361
summary: Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management framework. Affected
  versions are subject to a SQL injection discovered in graph_view.php. Since guest users can
  access graph_view.php without authentication by default, if guest users are being utilized
  in an enabled state, there could be the potential for significant damage. Attackers may exploit
  this vulnerability, and there may be possibilities for actions such as the usurpation of administrative
  privileges or remote code execution. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users
  are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
