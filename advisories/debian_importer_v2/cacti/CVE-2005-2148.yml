aliases:
  - CVE-2005-2148
summary: Cacti 0.8.6e and earlier does not perform proper input validation to protect against
  common attacks, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands or SQL by sending
  a legitimate value in a POST request or cookie, then specifying the attack string in the URL,
  which causes the get_request_var function to return the wrong value in the $_REQUEST variable,
  which is cleansed while the original malicious $_GET value remains unmodified, as demonstrated
  in (1) graph_image.php and (2) graph.php.
