  - CVE-2023-39357
summary: Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management framework. A defect
  in the sql_save function was discovered. When the column type is numeric, the sql_save function
  directly utilizes user input. Many files and functions calling the sql_save function do not
  perform prior validation of user input, leading to the existence of multiple SQL injection
  vulnerabilities in Cacti. This allows authenticated users to exploit these SQL injection vulnerabilities
  to perform privilege escalation and remote code execution. This issue has been addressed in
  version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
