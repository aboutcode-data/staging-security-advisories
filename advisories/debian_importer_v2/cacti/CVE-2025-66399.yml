  - CVE-2025-66399
summary: Cacti is an open source performance and fault management framework. Prior to 1.2.29,
  there is an input-validation flaw in the SNMP device configuration functionality. An authenticated
  Cacti user can supply crafted SNMP community strings containing control characters (including
  newlines) that are accepted, stored verbatim in the database, and later embedded into backend
  SNMP operations. In environments where downstream SNMP tooling or wrappers interpret newline-separated
  tokens as command boundaries, this can lead to unintended command execution with the privileges
  of the Cacti process. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.2.29.
