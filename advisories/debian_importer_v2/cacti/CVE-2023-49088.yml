  - CVE-2023-49088
summary: 'Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management framework. The
  fix applied for CVE-2023-39515 in version 1.2.25 is incomplete as it enables an adversary
  to have a victim browser execute malicious code when a victim user hovers their mouse over
  the malicious data source path in `data_debug.php`. To perform the cross-site scripting attack,
  the adversary needs to be an authorized cacti user with the following permissions: `General
  Administration>Sites/Devices/Data`. The victim of this attack could be any account with permissions
  to view `http://<HOST>/cacti/data_debug.php`. As of time of publication, no complete fix has
  been included in Cacti.'
