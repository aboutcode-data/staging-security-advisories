  - CVE-2023-30534
summary: Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management framework. There
  are two instances of insecure deserialization in Cacti version 1.2.24. While a viable gadget
  chain exists in Cacti’s vendor directory (phpseclib), the necessary gadgets are not included,
  making them inaccessible and the insecure deserializations not exploitable. Each instance
  of insecure deserialization is due to using the unserialize function without sanitizing the
  user input. Cacti has a “safe” deserialization that attempts to sanitize the content and check
  for specific values before calling unserialize, but it isn’t used in these instances. The
  vulnerable code lies in graphs_new.php, specifically within the host_new_graphs_save function.
  This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no
  known workarounds for this vulnerability.
