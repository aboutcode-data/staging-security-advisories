  - CVE-2023-39366
summary: Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management framework. Affected
  versions are subject to a Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability allows an authenticated
  user to poison data stored in the _cacti_'s database. These data will be viewed by administrative
  _cacti_ accounts and execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser at view-time. The `data_sources.php`
  script displays the data source management information (e.g. data source path, polling configuration
  etc.) for different data visualizations of the _cacti_ app.  CENSUS found that an adversary
  that is able to configure a malicious Device name, can deploy a stored XSS attack against
  any user of the same (or broader) privileges. A user that possesses the _General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data_
  permissions can configure the device names in _cacti_. This configuration occurs through `http://<HOST>/cacti/host.php`,
  while the rendered malicious payload is exhibited at `http://<HOST>/cacti/data_sources.php`.
  This vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. Users
  unable to update should manually filter HTML output.
