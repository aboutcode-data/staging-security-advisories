  - CVE-2023-39364
summary: Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management framework. In Cacti
  1.2.24, users with console access can be redirected to an arbitrary website after a change
  password performed via a specifically crafted URL. The `auth_changepassword.php` file accepts
  `ref` as a URL parameter and reflects it in the form used to perform the change password.
  It's value is used to perform a redirect via `header` PHP function. A user can be tricked
  in performing the change password operation, e.g., via a phishing message, and then interacting
  with the malicious website where the redirection has been performed, e.g., downloading malwares,
  providing credentials, etc. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised
  to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
