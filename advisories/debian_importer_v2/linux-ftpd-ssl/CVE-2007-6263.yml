aliases:
  - CVE-2007-6263
summary: 'The dataconn function in ftpd.c in netkit ftpd (netkit-ftpd) 0.17, when certain modifications
  to support SSL have been introduced, calls fclose on an uninitialized file stream, which allows
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) and possibly have unspecified
  other impact via some types of FTP over SSL protocol behavior, as demonstrated by breaking
  a passive FTP DATA connection in a way that triggers an error in the server''s SSL_accept
  function. NOTE: the netkit ftp issue is covered by CVE-2007-5769.'
