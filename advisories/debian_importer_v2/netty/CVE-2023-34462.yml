  - CVE-2023-34462
summary: Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development
  of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. The `SniHandler` can allocate
  up to 16MB of heap for each channel during the TLS handshake. When the handler or the channel
  does not have an idle timeout, it can be used to make a TCP server using the `SniHandler`
  to allocate 16MB of heap. The `SniHandler` class is a handler that waits for the TLS handshake
  to configure a `SslHandler` according to the indicated server name by the `ClientHello` record.
  For this matter it allocates a `ByteBuf` using the value defined in the `ClientHello` record.
  Normally the value of the packet should be smaller than the handshake packet but there are
  not checks done here and the way the code is written, it is possible to craft a packet that
  makes the `SslClientHelloHandler`. This vulnerability has been fixed in version 4.1.94.Final.
