  - CVE-2021-21409
summary: Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework for
  rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. In Netty (io.netty:netty-codec-http2)
  before version 4.1.61.Final there is a vulnerability that enables request smuggling. The content-length
  header is not correctly validated if the request only uses a single Http2HeaderFrame with
  the endStream set to to true. This could lead to request smuggling if the request is proxied
  to a remote peer and translated to HTTP/1.1. This is a followup of GHSA-wm47-8v5p-wjpj/CVE-2021-21295
  which did miss to fix this one case. This was fixed as part of 4.1.61.Final.
