aliases:
  - CVE-2021-37137
summary: The Snappy frame decoder function doesn't restrict the chunk length which may lead
  to excessive memory usage. Beside this it also may buffer reserved skippable chunks until
  the whole chunk was received which may lead to excessive memory usage as well. This vulnerability
  can be triggered by supplying malicious input that decompresses to a very big size (via a
  network stream or a file) or by sending a huge skippable chunk.
