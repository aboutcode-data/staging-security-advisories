  - CVE-2025-25193
summary: Netty, an asynchronous, event-driven network application framework, has a vulnerability
  in versions up to and including 4.1.118.Final. An unsafe reading of environment file could
  potentially cause a denial of service in Netty. When loaded on an Windows application, Netty
  attempts to load a file that does not exist. If an attacker creates such a large file, the
  Netty application crash. A similar issue was previously reported as CVE-2024-47535. This issue
  was fixed, but the fix was incomplete in that null-bytes were not counted against the input
  limit. Commit d1fbda62d3a47835d3fb35db8bd42ecc205a5386 contains an updated fix.
