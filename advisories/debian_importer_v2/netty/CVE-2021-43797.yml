  - CVE-2021-43797
summary: Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development
  of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. Netty prior to version 4.1.71.Final
  skips control chars when they are present at the beginning / end of the header name. It should
  instead fail fast as these are not allowed by the spec and could lead to HTTP request smuggling.
  Failing to do the validation might cause netty to "sanitize" header names before it forward
  these to another remote system when used as proxy. This remote system can't see the invalid
  usage anymore, and therefore does not do the validation itself. Users should upgrade to version
  4.1.71.Final.
