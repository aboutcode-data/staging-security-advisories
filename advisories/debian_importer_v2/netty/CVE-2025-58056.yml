summary: Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for development
  of maintainable high performance protocol servers and clients. In versions 4.1.124.Final,
  and 4.2.0.Alpha3 through 4.2.4.Final, Netty incorrectly accepts standalone newline characters
  (LF) as a chunk-size line terminator, regardless of a preceding carriage return (CR), instead
  of requiring CRLF per HTTP/1.1 standards. When combined with reverse proxies that parse LF
  differently (treating it as part of the chunk extension), attackers can craft requests that
  the proxy sees as one request but Netty processes as two, enabling request smuggling attacks.
  This is fixed in versions 4.1.125.Final and 4.2.5.Final.
