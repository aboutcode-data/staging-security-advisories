  - CVE-2025-55163
summary: Netty is an asynchronous, event-driven network application framework. Prior to versions
  4.1.124.Final and 4.2.4.Final, Netty is vulnerable to MadeYouReset DDoS. This is a logical
  vulnerability in the HTTP/2 protocol, that uses malformed HTTP/2 control frames in order to
  break the max concurrent streams limit - which results in resource exhaustion and distributed
  denial of service. This issue has been patched in versions 4.1.124.Final and 4.2.4.Final.
