aliases:
  - CVE-2010-1634
summary: 'Multiple integer overflows in audioop.c in the audioop module in Python 2.6, 2.7,
  3.1, and 3.2 allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash)
  via a large fragment, as demonstrated by a call to audioop.lin2lin with a long string in the
  first argument, leading to a buffer overflow.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of
  an incorrect fix for CVE-2008-3143.5.'
