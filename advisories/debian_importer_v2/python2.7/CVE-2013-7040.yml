  - CVE-2013-7040
summary: 'Python 2.7 before 3.4 only uses the last eight bits of the prefix to randomize hash
  values, which causes it to compute hash values without restricting the ability to trigger
  hash collisions predictably and makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to cause a
  denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application that maintains a hash
  table.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-1150.'
