summary: There's a flaw in Python 3's pydoc. A local or adjacent attacker who discovers or is
  able to convince another local or adjacent user to start a pydoc server could access the server
  and use it to disclose sensitive information belonging to the other user that they would not
  normally be able to access. The highest risk of this flaw is to data confidentiality. This
  flaw affects Python versions before 3.8.9, Python versions before 3.9.3 and Python versions
  before 3.10.0a7.
