  - CVE-2024-3219
summary: The  “socket” module provides a pure-Python fallback to the  socket.socketpair() function
  for platforms that don’t support AF_UNIX,  such as Windows. This pure-Python implementation
  uses AF_INET or  AF_INET6 to create a local connected pair of sockets. The connection  between
  the two sockets was not verified before passing the two sockets  back to the user, which leaves
  the server socket vulnerable to a  connection race from a malicious local peer.  Platforms
  that support AF_UNIX such as Linux and macOS are not affected by this vulnerability. Versions
  prior to CPython 3.5 are not affected due to the vulnerable API not being included.
