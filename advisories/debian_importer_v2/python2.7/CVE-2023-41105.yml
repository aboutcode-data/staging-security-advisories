  - CVE-2023-41105
summary: An issue was discovered in Python 3.11 through 3.11.4. If a path containing '\0' bytes
  is passed to os.path.normpath(), the path will be truncated unexpectedly at the first '\0'
  byte. There are plausible cases in which an application would have rejected a filename for
  security reasons in Python 3.10.x or earlier, but that filename is no longer rejected in Python
  3.11.x.
