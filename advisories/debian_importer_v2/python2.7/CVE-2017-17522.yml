summary: 'Lib/webbrowser.py in Python through 3.6.3 does not validate strings before launching
  the program specified by the BROWSER environment variable, which might allow remote attackers
  to conduct argument-injection attacks via a crafted URL. NOTE: a software maintainer indicates
  that exploitation is impossible because the code relies on subprocess.Popen and the default
  shell=False setting'
