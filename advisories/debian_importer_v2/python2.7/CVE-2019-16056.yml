  - CVE-2019-16056
summary: An issue was discovered in Python through 2.7.16, 3.x through 3.5.7, 3.6.x through
  3.6.9, and 3.7.x through 3.7.4. The email module wrongly parses email addresses that contain
  multiple @ characters. An application that uses the email module and implements some kind
  of checks on the From/To headers of a message could be tricked into accepting an email address
  that should be denied. An attack may be the same as in CVE-2019-11340; however, this CVE applies
  to Python more generally.
