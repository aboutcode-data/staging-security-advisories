aliases:
  - CVE-2010-2089
summary: The audioop module in Python 2.7 and 3.2 does not verify the relationships between
  size arguments and byte string lengths, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause
  a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) via crafted arguments, as demonstrated
  by a call to audioop.reverse with a one-byte string, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-1634.
