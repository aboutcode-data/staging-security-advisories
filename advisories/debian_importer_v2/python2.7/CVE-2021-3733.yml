summary: There's a flaw in urllib's AbstractBasicAuthHandler class. An attacker who controls
  a malicious HTTP server that an HTTP client (such as web browser) connects to, could trigger
  a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDOS) during an authentication request with a specially
  crafted payload that is sent by the server to the client. The greatest threat that this flaw
  poses is to application availability.
