  - CVE-2013-4238
summary: The ssl.match_hostname function in the SSL module in Python 2.6 through 3.4 does not
  properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of
  an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers
  via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority, a related issue
  to CVE-2009-2408.
