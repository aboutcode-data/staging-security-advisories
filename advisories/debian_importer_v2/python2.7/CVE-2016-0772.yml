  - CVE-2016-0772
summary: The smtplib library in CPython (aka Python) before 2.7.12, 3.x before 3.4.5, and 3.5.x
  before 3.5.2 does not return an error when StartTLS fails, which might allow man-in-the-middle
  attackers to bypass the TLS protections by leveraging a network position between the client
  and the registry to block the StartTLS command, aka a "StartTLS stripping attack."
