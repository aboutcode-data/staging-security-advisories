  - CVE-2011-3389
summary: The SSL protocol, as used in certain configurations in Microsoft Windows and Microsoft
  Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, and other products, encrypts data
  by using CBC mode with chained initialization vectors, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers
  to obtain plaintext HTTP headers via a blockwise chosen-boundary attack (BCBA) on an HTTPS
  session, in conjunction with JavaScript code that uses (1) the HTML5 WebSocket API, (2) the
  Java URLConnection API, or (3) the Silverlight WebClient API, aka a "BEAST" attack.
