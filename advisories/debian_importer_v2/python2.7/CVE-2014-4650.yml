  - CVE-2014-4650
summary: The CGIHTTPServer module in Python 2.7.5 and 3.3.4 does not properly handle URLs in
  which URL encoding is used for path separators, which allows remote attackers to read script
  source code or conduct directory traversal attacks and execute unintended code via a crafted
  character sequence, as demonstrated by a %2f separator.
