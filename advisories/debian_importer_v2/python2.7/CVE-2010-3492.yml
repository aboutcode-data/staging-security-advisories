aliases:
  - CVE-2010-3492
summary: The asyncore module in Python before 3.2 does not properly handle unsuccessful calls
  to the accept function, and does not have accompanying documentation describing how daemon
  applications should handle unsuccessful calls to the accept function, which makes it easier
  for remote attackers to conduct denial of service attacks that terminate these applications
  via network connections.
