summary: 'http.cookiejar.DefaultPolicy.domain_return_ok in Lib/http/cookiejar.py in Python before
  3.7.3 does not correctly validate the domain: it can be tricked into sending existing cookies
  to the wrong server. An attacker may abuse this flaw by using a server with a hostname that
  has another valid hostname as a suffix (e.g., pythonicexample.com to steal cookies for example.com).
  When a program uses http.cookiejar.DefaultPolicy and tries to do an HTTP connection to an
  attacker-controlled server, existing cookies can be leaked to the attacker. This affects 2.x
  through 2.7.16, 3.x before 3.4.10, 3.5.x before 3.5.7, 3.6.x before 3.6.9, and 3.7.x before
  3.7.3.'
