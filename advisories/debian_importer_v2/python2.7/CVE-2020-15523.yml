summary: 'In Python 3.6 through 3.6.10, 3.7 through 3.7.8, 3.8 through 3.8.4rc1, and 3.9 through
  3.9.0b4 on Windows, a Trojan horse python3.dll might be used in cases where CPython is embedded
  in a native application. This occurs because python3X.dll may use an invalid search path for
  python3.dll loading (after Py_SetPath has been used). NOTE: this issue CANNOT occur when using
  python.exe from a standard (non-embedded) Python installation on Windows.'
