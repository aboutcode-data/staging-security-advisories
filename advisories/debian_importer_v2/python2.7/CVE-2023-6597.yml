  - CVE-2023-6597
summary: An issue was found in the CPython `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` class affecting versions
  3.12.1, 3.11.7, 3.10.13, 3.9.18, and 3.8.18 and prior.  The tempfile.TemporaryDirectory class
  would dereference symlinks during cleanup of permissions-related errors. This means users
  which can run privileged programs are potentially able to modify permissions of files referenced
  by symlinks in some circumstances.
