  - CVE-2014-9365
summary: The HTTP clients in the (1) httplib, (2) urllib, (3) urllib2, and (4) xmlrpclib libraries
  in CPython (aka Python) 2.x before 2.7.9 and 3.x before 3.4.3, when accessing an HTTPS URL,
  do not (a) check the certificate against a trust store or verify that the server hostname
  matches a domain name in the subject's (b) Common Name or (c) subjectAltName field of the
  X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary
  valid certificate.
