summary: A flaw was found in Python, specifically within the urllib.parse module. This module
  helps break Uniform Resource Locator (URL) strings into components. The issue involves how
  the urlparse method does not sanitize input and allows characters like '\r' and '\n' in the
  URL path. This flaw allows an attacker to input a crafted URL, leading to injection attacks.
  This flaw affects Python versions prior to 3.10.0b1, 3.9.5, 3.8.11, 3.7.11 and 3.6.14.
