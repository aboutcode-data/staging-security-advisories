  - CVE-2019-12086
summary: A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before
  2.9.9. When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for a specific property) for an
  externally exposed JSON endpoint, the service has the mysql-connector-java jar (8.0.14 or
  earlier) in the classpath, and an attacker can host a crafted MySQL server reachable by the
  victim, an attacker can send a crafted JSON message that allows them to read arbitrary local
  files on the server. This occurs because of missing com.mysql.cj.jdbc.admin.MiniAdmin validation.
