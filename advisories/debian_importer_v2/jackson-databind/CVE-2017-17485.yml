aliases:
  - CVE-2017-17485
summary: FasterXML jackson-databind through 2.8.10 and 2.9.x through 2.9.3 allows unauthenticated
  remote code execution because of an incomplete fix for the CVE-2017-7525 deserialization flaw.
  This is exploitable by sending maliciously crafted JSON input to the readValue method of the
  ObjectMapper, bypassing a blacklist that is ineffective if the Spring libraries are available
  in the classpath.
