  - CVE-2018-12022
summary: An issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind prior to 2.7.9.4, 2.8.11.2, and
  2.9.6. When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for a specific property), the service
  has the Jodd-db jar (for database access for the Jodd framework) in the classpath, and an
  attacker can provide an LDAP service to access, it is possible to make the service execute
  a malicious payload.
