summary: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the handling of the MXIT protocol in Pidgin.
  Specially crafted MXIT data sent from the server could potentially result in arbitrary code
  execution. A malicious server or an attacker who intercepts the network traffic can send an
  invalid size for a packet which will trigger a buffer overflow.
