aliases:
  - CVE-2022-26491
summary: An issue was discovered in Pidgin before 2.14.9. A remote attacker who can spoof DNS
  responses can redirect a client connection to a malicious server. The client will perform
  TLS certificate verification of the malicious domain name instead of the original XMPP service
  domain, allowing the attacker to take over control over the XMPP connection and to obtain
  user credentials and all communication content. This is similar to CVE-2022-24968.
