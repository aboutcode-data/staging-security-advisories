aliases:
  - CVE-2010-0013
summary: 'Directory traversal vulnerability in slp.c in the MSN protocol plugin in libpurple
  in Pidgin 2.6.4 and Adium 1.3.8 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a .. (dot
  dot) in an application/x-msnmsgrp2p MSN emoticon (aka custom smiley) request, a related issue
  to CVE-2004-0122.  NOTE: it could be argued that this is resultant from a vulnerability in
  which an emoticon download request is processed even without a preceding text/x-mms-emoticon
  message that announced availability of the emoticon.'
