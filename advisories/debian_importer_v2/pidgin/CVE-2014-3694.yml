  - CVE-2014-3694
summary: The (1) bundled GnuTLS SSL/TLS plugin and the (2) bundled OpenSSL SSL/TLS plugin in
  libpurple in Pidgin before 2.10.10 do not properly consider the Basic Constraints extension
  during verification of X.509 certificates from SSL servers, which allows man-in-the-middle
  attackers to spoof servers and obtain sensitive information via a crafted certificate.
