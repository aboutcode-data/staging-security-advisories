aliases:
  - CVE-2016-2372
summary: An information leak exists in the handling of the MXIT protocol in Pidgin. Specially
  crafted MXIT data sent via the server could potentially result in an out-of-bounds read. A
  malicious user, server, or man-in-the-middle attacker can send an invalid size for a file
  transfer which will trigger an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. This could result in a denial
  of service or copy data from memory to the file, resulting in an information leak if the file
  is sent to another user.
