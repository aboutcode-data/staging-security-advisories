  - CVE-2009-2694
summary: 'The msn_slplink_process_msg function in libpurple/protocols/msn/slplink.c in libpurple,
  as used in Pidgin (formerly Gaim) before 2.5.9 and Adium 1.3.5 and earlier, allows remote
  attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application
  crash) by sending multiple crafted SLP (aka MSNSLP) messages to trigger an overwrite of an
  arbitrary memory location.  NOTE: this issue reportedly exists because of an incomplete fix
  for CVE-2009-1376.'
