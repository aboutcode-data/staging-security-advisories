summary: Interaction error in OpenStack Nova and Neutron before Havana 2013.2.1 and icehouse-1
  does not validate the instance ID of the tenant making a request, which allows remote tenants
  to obtain sensitive metadata by spoofing the device ID that is bound to a port, which is not
  properly handled by (1) api/metadata/handler.py in Nova and (2) the neutron-metadata-agent
  (agent/metadata/agent.py) in Neutron.
