  - CVE-2024-53916
summary: In OpenStack Neutron before 25.0.1, neutron/extensions/tagging.py can use an incorrect
  ID during policy enforcement. It does not apply the proper policy check for changing network
  tags. An unprivileged tenant is able to change (add and clear) tags on network objects that
  do not belong to the tenant, and this action is not subjected to the proper policy authorization
  check. This affects 23 before 23.2.1, 24 before 24.0.2, and 25 before 25.0.1.
