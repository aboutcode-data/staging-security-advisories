aliases:
  - CVE-2021-38598
summary: OpenStack Neutron before 16.4.1, 17.x before 17.1.3, and 18.0.0 allows hardware address
  impersonation when the linuxbridge driver with ebtables-nft is used on a Netfilter-based platform.
  By sending carefully crafted packets, anyone in control of a server instance connected to
  the virtual switch can impersonate the hardware addresses of other systems on the network,
  resulting in denial of service or in some cases possibly interception of traffic intended
  for other destinations.
