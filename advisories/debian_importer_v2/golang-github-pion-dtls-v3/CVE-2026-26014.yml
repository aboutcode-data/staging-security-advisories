  - CVE-2026-26014
summary: Pion DTLS is a Go implementation of Datagram Transport Layer Security. Pion DTLS versions
  v1.0.0 through v3.0.10 and 3.1.0 use random nonce generation with AES GCM ciphers, which makes
  it easier for remote attackers to obtain the authentication key and spoof data by leveraging
  the reuse of a nonce in a session and a "forbidden attack". Upgrade to v3.0.11, v3.1.1, or
  later.
