  - CVE-2013-2179
summary: X.Org xdm 1.1.10, 1.1.11, and possibly other versions, when performing authentication
  using certain implementations of the crypt API function that can return NULL, allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and crash) by attempting
  to log into an account whose password field contains invalid characters, as demonstrated using
  the crypt function from glibc 2.17 and later with (1) the "!" character in the salt portion
  of a password field or (2) a password that has been encrypted using DES or MD5 in FIPS-140
  mode.
