  - CVE-2026-25636
summary: calibre is an e-book manager. In 9.1.0 and earlier, a path traversal vulnerability
  in Calibre's EPUB conversion allows a malicious EPUB file to corrupt arbitrary existing files
  writable by the Calibre process. During conversion, Calibre resolves CipherReference URI from
  META-INF/encryption.xml to an absolute filesystem path and opens it in read-write mode, even
  when it points outside the conversion extraction directory. This vulnerability is fixed in
  9.2.0.
