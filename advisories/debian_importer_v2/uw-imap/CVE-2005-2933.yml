  - CVE-2005-2933
summary: Buffer overflow in the mail_valid_net_parse_work function in mail.c for Washington's
  IMAP Server (UW-IMAP) before imap-2004g allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
  via a mailbox name containing a single double-quote (") character without a closing quote,
  which causes bytes after the double-quote to be copied into a buffer indefinitely.
