summary: University of Washington IMAP Toolkit 2007f on UNIX, as used in imap_open() in PHP
  and other products, launches an rsh command (by means of the imap_rimap function in c-client/imap4r1.c
  and the tcp_aopen function in osdep/unix/tcp_unix.c) without preventing argument injection,
  which might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands if the IMAP server name
  is untrusted input (e.g., entered by a user of a web application) and if rsh has been replaced
  by a program with different argument semantics. For example, if rsh is a link to ssh (as seen
  on Debian and Ubuntu systems), then the attack can use an IMAP server name containing a "-oProxyCommand"
  argument.
