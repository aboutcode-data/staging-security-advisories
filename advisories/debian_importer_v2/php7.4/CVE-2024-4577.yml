aliases:
  - CVE-2024-4577
summary: In PHP versions 8.1.* before 8.1.29, 8.2.* before 8.2.20, 8.3.* before 8.3.8, when
  using Apache and PHP-CGI on Windows, if the system is set up to use certain code pages, Windows
  may use "Best-Fit" behavior to replace characters in command line given to Win32 API functions.
  PHP CGI module may misinterpret those characters as PHP options, which may allow a malicious
  user to pass options to PHP binary being run, and thus reveal the source code of scripts,
  run arbitrary PHP code on the server, etc.
