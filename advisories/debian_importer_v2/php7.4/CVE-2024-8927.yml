  - CVE-2024-8927
summary: In PHP versions 8.1.* before 8.1.30, 8.2.* before 8.2.24, 8.3.* before 8.3.12, HTTP_REDIRECT_STATUS
  variable is used to check whether or not CGI binary is being run by the HTTP server. However,
  in certain scenarios, the content of this variable can be controlled by the request submitter
  via HTTP headers, which can lead to cgi.force_redirect option not being correctly applied.
  In certain configurations this may lead to arbitrary file inclusion in PHP.
