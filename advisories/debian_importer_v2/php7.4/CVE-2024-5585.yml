  - CVE-2024-5585
summary: In PHP versions 8.1.* before 8.1.29, 8.2.* before 8.2.20, 8.3.* before 8.3.8, the fix
  for CVE-2024-1874 does not work if the command name includes trailing spaces. Original issue: when
  using proc_open() command with array syntax, due to insufficient escaping, if the arguments
  of the executed command are controlled by a malicious user, the user can supply arguments
  that would execute arbitrary commands in Windows shell.
