summary: In PHP versions 7.3.x below 7.3.29, 7.4.x below 7.4.21 and 8.0.x below 8.0.8, when
  using URL validation functionality via filter_var() function with FILTER_VALIDATE_URL parameter,
  an URL with invalid password field can be accepted as valid. This can lead to the code incorrectly
  parsing the URL and potentially leading to other security implications - like contacting a
  wrong server or making a wrong access decision.
