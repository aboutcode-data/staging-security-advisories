aliases:
  - CVE-2020-7066
summary: In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.29, 7.3.x below 7.3.16 and 7.4.x below 7.4.4, while
  using get_headers() with user-supplied URL, if the URL contains zero (\0) character, the URL
  will be silently truncated at it. This may cause some software to make incorrect assumptions
  about the target of the get_headers() and possibly send some information to a wrong server.
