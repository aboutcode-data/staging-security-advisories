aliases:
  - CVE-2020-7071
summary: In PHP versions 7.3.x below 7.3.26, 7.4.x below 7.4.14 and 8.0.0, when validating URL
  with functions like filter_var($url, FILTER_VALIDATE_URL), PHP will accept an URL with invalid
  password as valid URL. This may lead to functions that rely on URL being valid to mis-parse
  the URL and produce wrong data as components of the URL.
