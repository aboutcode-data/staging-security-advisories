  - CVE-2019-11048
summary: In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.31, 7.3.x below 7.3.18 and 7.4.x below 7.4.6, when
  HTTP file uploads are allowed, supplying overly long filenames or field names could lead PHP
  engine to try to allocate oversized memory storage, hit the memory limit and stop processing
  the request, without cleaning up temporary files created by upload request. This potentially
  could lead to accumulation of uncleaned temporary files exhausting the disk space on the target
  server.
