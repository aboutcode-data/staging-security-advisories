  - CVE-2021-21703
summary: In PHP versions 7.3.x up to and including 7.3.31, 7.4.x below 7.4.25 and 8.0.x below
  8.0.12, when running PHP FPM SAPI with main FPM daemon process running as root and child worker
  processes running as lower-privileged users, it is possible for the child processes to access
  memory shared with the main process and write to it, modifying it in a way that would cause
  the root process to conduct invalid memory reads and writes, which can be used to escalate
  privileges from local unprivileged user to the root user.
