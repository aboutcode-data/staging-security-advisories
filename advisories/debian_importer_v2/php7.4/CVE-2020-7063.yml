  - CVE-2020-7063
summary: In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.28, 7.3.x below 7.3.15 and 7.4.x below 7.4.3, when
  creating PHAR archive using PharData::buildFromIterator() function, the files are added with
  default permissions (0666, or all access) even if the original files on the filesystem were
  with more restrictive permissions. This may result in files having more lax permissions than
  intended when such archive is extracted.
