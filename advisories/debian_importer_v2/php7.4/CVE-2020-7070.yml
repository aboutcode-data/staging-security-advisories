aliases:
  - CVE-2020-7070
summary: In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.34, 7.3.x below 7.3.23 and 7.4.x below 7.4.11, when
  PHP is processing incoming HTTP cookie values, the cookie names are url-decoded. This may
  lead to cookies with prefixes like __Host confused with cookies that decode to such prefix,
  thus leading to an attacker being able to forge cookie which is supposed to be secure. See
  also CVE-2020-8184 for more information.
