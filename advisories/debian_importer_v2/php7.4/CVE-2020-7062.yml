  - CVE-2020-7062
summary: In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.28, 7.3.x below 7.3.15 and 7.4.x below 7.4.3, when
  using file upload functionality, if upload progress tracking is enabled, but session.upload_progress.cleanup
  is set to 0 (disabled), and the file upload fails, the upload procedure would try to clean
  up data that does not exist and encounter null pointer dereference, which would likely lead
  to a crash.
