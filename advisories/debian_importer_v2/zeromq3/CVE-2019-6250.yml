aliases:
  - CVE-2019-6250
summary: A pointer overflow, with code execution, was discovered in ZeroMQ libzmq (aka 0MQ)
  4.2.x and 4.3.x before 4.3.1. A v2_decoder.cpp zmq::v2_decoder_t::size_ready integer overflow
  allows an authenticated attacker to overwrite an arbitrary amount of bytes beyond the bounds
  of a buffer, which can be leveraged to run arbitrary code on the target system. The memory
  layout allows the attacker to inject OS commands into a data structure located immediately
  after the problematic buffer (i.e., it is not necessary to use a typical buffer-overflow exploitation
  technique that changes the flow of control).
