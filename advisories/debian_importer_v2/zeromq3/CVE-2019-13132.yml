  - CVE-2019-13132
summary: In ZeroMQ libzmq before 4.0.9, 4.1.x before 4.1.7, and 4.2.x before 4.3.2, a remote,
  unauthenticated client connecting to a libzmq application, running with a socket listening
  with CURVE encryption/authentication enabled, may cause a stack overflow and overwrite the
  stack with arbitrary data, due to a buffer overflow in the library. Users running public servers
  with the above configuration are highly encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible, as there
  are no known mitigations.
