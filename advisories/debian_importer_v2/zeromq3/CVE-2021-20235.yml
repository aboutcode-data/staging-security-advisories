aliases:
  - CVE-2021-20235
summary: There's a flaw in the zeromq server in versions before 4.3.3 in src/decoder_allocators.hpp.
  The decoder static allocator could have its sized changed, but the buffer would remain the
  same as it is a static buffer. A remote, unauthenticated attacker who sends a crafted request
  to the zeromq server could trigger a buffer overflow WRITE of arbitrary data if CURVE/ZAP
  authentication is not enabled. The greatest impact of this flaw is to application availability,
  data integrity, and confidentiality.
