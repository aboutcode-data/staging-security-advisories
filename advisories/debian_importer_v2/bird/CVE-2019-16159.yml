  - CVE-2019-16159
summary: BIRD Internet Routing Daemon 1.6.x through 1.6.7 and 2.x through 2.0.5 has a stack-based
  buffer overflow. The BGP daemon's support for RFC 8203 administrative shutdown communication
  messages included an incorrect logical expression when checking the validity of an input message.
  Sending a shutdown communication with a sufficient message length causes a four-byte overflow
  to occur while processing the message, where two of the overflow bytes are attacker-controlled
  and two are fixed.
