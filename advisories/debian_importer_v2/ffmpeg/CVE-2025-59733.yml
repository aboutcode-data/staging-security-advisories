  - CVE-2025-59733
summary: When decoding an OpenEXR file that uses DWAA or DWAB compression, there's an implicit
  assumption that all image channels have the same pixel type (and size), and that if there
  are four channels, the first four are "B", "G", "R" and "A". The channel parsing code can
  be found in decode_header. The buffer td->uncompressed_data is allocated in decode_block based
  on the xsize, ysize and computed current_channel_offset.  The function dwa_uncompress then
  assumes at [5] that if there are 4 channels, these are "B", "G", "R" and "A", and in the calculations
  at [6] and [7] that all channels are of the same type, which matches the type of the main
  color channels.  If we set the main color channels to a 4-byte type and add duplicate or unknown
  channels of the 2-byte EXR_HALF type, then the addition at [7] will increment the pointer
  by 4-bytes * xsize * nb_channels, which will exceed the allocated buffer.      We recommend
  upgrading to version 8.0 or beyond.
