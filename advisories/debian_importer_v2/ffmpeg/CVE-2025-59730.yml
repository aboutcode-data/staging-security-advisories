  - CVE-2025-59730
summary: 'When decoding a frame for a SANM file (ANIM v0 variant), the decoded data can be larger
  than the buffer allocated for it.  Frames encoded with codec 48 can specify their resolution
  (width x height). A buffer of appropriate size is allocated depending on the resolution.  This
  codec can encode the frame contents using a run-length encoding algorithm. There are no checks
  that the decoded frame fits in the allocated buffer, leading to a heap-buffer-overflow.  process_frame_obj initializes
  the buffers based on the frame resolution:    We recommend upgrading to version 8.0 or beyond.'
