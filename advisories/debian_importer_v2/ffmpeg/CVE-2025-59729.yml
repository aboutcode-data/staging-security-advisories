summary: When parsing the header for a DHAV file, there's an integer underflow in offset calculation
  that leads to reading the duration from before the start of the allocated buffer.  If we load
  a DHAV file that is larger than MAX_DURATION_BUFFER_SIZE bytes (0x100000) for example 0x101000
  bytes, then at [0] we have size = 0x101000. At [1] we have end_buffer_size = 0x100000, and
  at [2] we have end_buffer_pos = 0x1000.  The loop then scans backwards through the buffer
  looking for the dhav tag; when it is found, we'll calculate end_pos based on a 32-bit offset
  read from the buffer.  There is subsequently a check [3] that end_pos is within the section
  of the file that has been copied into end_buffer, but it only correctly handles the cases
  where end_pos is before the start of the file or after the section copied into end_buffer,
  and not the case where end_pos is within the the file, but before the section copied into
  end_buffer. If we provide such an offset, (end_pos - end_buffer_pos) can underflow, resulting
  in the subsequent access at [4] occurring before the beginning of the allocation.  We recommend
  upgrading to version 8.0 or beyond.
