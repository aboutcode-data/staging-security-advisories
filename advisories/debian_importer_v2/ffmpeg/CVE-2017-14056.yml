  - CVE-2017-14056
summary: In libavformat/rl2.c in FFmpeg 3.3.3, a DoS in rl2_read_header() due to lack of an
  EOF (End of File) check might cause huge CPU and memory consumption. When a crafted RL2 file,
  which claims a large "frame_count" field in the header but does not contain sufficient backing
  data, is provided, the loops (for offset and size tables) would consume huge CPU and memory
  resources, since there is no EOF check inside these loops.
