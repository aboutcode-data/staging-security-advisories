  - CVE-2024-39780
summary: A YAML deserialization vulnerability was found in the Robot Operating System (ROS)
  'dynparam', a command-line tool for getting, setting, and deleting parameters of a dynamically
  configurable node, affecting ROS distributions Noetic and earlier. The issue is caused by
  the use of the yaml.load() function in the 'set' and 'get' verbs, and allows for the creation
  of arbitrary Python objects. Through this flaw, a local or remote user can craft and execute
  arbitrary Python code.
