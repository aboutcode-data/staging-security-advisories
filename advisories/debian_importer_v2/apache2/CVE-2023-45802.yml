  - CVE-2023-45802
summary: When a HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there was a time window were
  the request's memory resources were not reclaimed immediately. Instead, de-allocation was
  deferred to connection close. A client could send new requests and resets, keeping the connection
  busy and open and causing the memory footprint to keep on growing. On connection close, all
  resources were reclaimed, but the process might run out of memory before that.  This was found
  by the reporter during testing of CVE-2023-44487 (HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Exploit) with their own
  test client. During "normal" HTTP/2 use, the probability to hit this bug is very low. The
  kept memory would not become noticeable before the connection closes or times out.  Users
  are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.
