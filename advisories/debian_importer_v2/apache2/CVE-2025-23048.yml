  - CVE-2025-23048
summary: In some mod_ssl configurations on Apache HTTP Server 2.4.35 through to 2.4.63, an access
  control bypass by trusted clients is possible using TLS 1.3 session resumption.  Configurations
  are affected when mod_ssl is configured for multiple virtual hosts, with each restricted to
  a different set of trusted client certificates (for example with a different SSLCACertificateFile/Path
  setting). In such a case, a client trusted to access one virtual host may be able to access
  another virtual host, if SSLStrictSNIVHostCheck is not enabled in either virtual host.
