  - CVE-2020-35452
summary: Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.46 A specially crafted Digest nonce can cause
  a stack overflow in mod_auth_digest. There is no report of this overflow being exploitable,
  nor the Apache HTTP Server team could create one, though some particular compiler and/or compilation
  option might make it possible, with limited consequences anyway due to the size (a single
  byte) and the value (zero byte) of the overflow
