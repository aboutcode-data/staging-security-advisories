  - CVE-2016-8743
summary: Apache HTTP Server, in all releases prior to 2.2.32 and 2.4.25, was liberal in the
  whitespace accepted from requests and sent in response lines and headers. Accepting these
  different behaviors represented a security concern when httpd participates in any chain of
  proxies or interacts with back-end application servers, either through mod_proxy or using
  conventional CGI mechanisms, and may result in request smuggling, response splitting and cache
  pollution.
