  - CVE-2003-0192
summary: Apache 2 before 2.0.47, and certain versions of mod_ssl for Apache 1.3, do not properly
  handle "certain sequences of per-directory renegotiations and the SSLCipherSuite directive
  being used to upgrade from a weak ciphersuite to a strong one," which could cause Apache to
  use the weak ciphersuite.
