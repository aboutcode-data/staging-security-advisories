aliases:
  - CVE-2017-9788
summary: In Apache httpd before 2.2.34 and 2.4.x before 2.4.27, the value placeholder in [Proxy-]Authorization
  headers of type 'Digest' was not initialized or reset before or between successive key=value
  assignments by mod_auth_digest. Providing an initial key with no '=' assignment could reflect
  the stale value of uninitialized pool memory used by the prior request, leading to leakage
  of potentially confidential information, and a segfault in other cases resulting in denial
  of service.
