  - CVE-2017-9798
summary: Apache httpd allows remote attackers to read secret data from process memory if the
  Limit directive can be set in a user's .htaccess file, or if httpd.conf has certain misconfigurations,
  aka Optionsbleed. This affects the Apache HTTP Server through 2.2.34 and 2.4.x through 2.4.27.
  The attacker sends an unauthenticated OPTIONS HTTP request when attempting to read secret
  data. This is a use-after-free issue and thus secret data is not always sent, and the specific
  data depends on many factors including configuration. Exploitation with .htaccess can be blocked
  with a patch to the ap_limit_section function in server/core.c.
