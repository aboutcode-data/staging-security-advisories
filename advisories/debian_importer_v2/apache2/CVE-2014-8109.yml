aliases:
  - CVE-2014-8109
summary: mod_lua.c in the mod_lua module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.3.x and 2.4.x through 2.4.10
  does not support an httpd configuration in which the same Lua authorization provider is used
  with different arguments within different contexts, which allows remote attackers to bypass
  intended access restrictions in opportunistic circumstances by leveraging multiple Require
  directives, as demonstrated by a configuration that specifies authorization for one group
  to access a certain directory, and authorization for a second group to access a second directory.
