  - CVE-2018-1283
summary: In Apache httpd 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, when mod_session is configured to forward its session
  data to CGI applications (SessionEnv on, not the default), a remote user may influence their
  content by using a "Session" header. This comes from the "HTTP_SESSION" variable name used
  by mod_session to forward its data to CGIs, since the prefix "HTTP_" is also used by the Apache
  HTTP Server to pass HTTP header fields, per CGI specifications.
