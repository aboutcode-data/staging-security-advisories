aliases:
  - CVE-2007-6203
summary: Apache HTTP Server 2.0.x and 2.2.x does not sanitize the HTTP Method specifier header
  from an HTTP request when it is reflected back in a "413 Request Entity Too Large" error message,
  which might allow cross-site scripting (XSS) style attacks using web client components that
  can send arbitrary headers in requests, as demonstrated via an HTTP request containing an
  invalid Content-length value, a similar issue to CVE-2006-3918.
