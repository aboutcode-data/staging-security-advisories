summary: In Apache httpd 2.0.23 to 2.0.65, 2.2.0 to 2.2.34, and 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, mod_authnz_ldap,
  if configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, uses the Accept-Language header value to lookup
  the right charset encoding when verifying the user's credentials. If the header value is not
  present in the charset conversion table, a fallback mechanism is used to truncate it to a
  two characters value to allow a quick retry (for example, 'en-US' is truncated to 'en'). A
  header value of less than two characters forces an out of bound write of one NUL byte to a
  memory location that is not part of the string. In the worst case, quite unlikely, the process
  would crash which could be used as a Denial of Service attack. In the more likely case, this
  memory is already reserved for future use and the issue has no effect at all.
