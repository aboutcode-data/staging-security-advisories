aliases:
  - CVE-2016-5387
summary: 'The Apache HTTP Server through 2.4.23 follows RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 and therefore
  does not protect applications from the presence of untrusted client data in the HTTP_PROXY
  environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to redirect an application''s outbound
  HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka
  an "httpoxy" issue.  NOTE: the vendor states "This mitigation has been assigned the identifier
  CVE-2016-5387"; in other words, this is not a CVE ID for a vulnerability.'
