  - CVE-2024-38475
summary: Improper escaping of output in mod_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier
  allows an attacker to map URLs to filesystem locations that are permitted to be served by
  the server but are not intentionally/directly reachable by any URL, resulting in code execution
  or source code disclosure.   Substitutions in server context that use a backreferences or
  variables as the first segment of the substitution are affected.  Some unsafe RewiteRules
  will be broken by this change and the rewrite flag "UnsafePrefixStat" can be used to opt back
  in once ensuring the substitution is appropriately constrained.
