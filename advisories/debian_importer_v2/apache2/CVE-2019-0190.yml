  - CVE-2019-0190
summary: A bug exists in the way mod_ssl handled client renegotiations. A remote attacker could
  send a carefully crafted request that would cause mod_ssl to enter a loop leading to a denial
  of service. This bug can be only triggered with Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.37 when using
  OpenSSL version 1.1.1 or later, due to an interaction in changes to handling of renegotiation
  attempts.
