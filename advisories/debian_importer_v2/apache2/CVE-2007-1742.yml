  - CVE-2007-1742
summary: 'suexec in Apache HTTP Server (httpd) 2.2.3 uses a partial comparison for verifying
  whether the current directory is within the document root, which might allow local users to
  perform unauthorized operations on incorrect directories, as demonstrated using "html_backup"
  and "htmleditor" under an "html" directory.  NOTE: the researcher, who is reliable, claims
  that the vendor disputes the issue because "the attacks described rely on an insecure server
  configuration" in which the user "has write access to the document root."'
