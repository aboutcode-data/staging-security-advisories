  - CVE-2005-1344
summary: 'Buffer overflow in htdigest in Apache 2.0.52 may allow attackers to execute arbitrary
  code via a long realm argument.  NOTE: since htdigest is normally only locally accessible
  and not setuid or setgid, there are few attack vectors which would lead to an escalation of
  privileges, unless htdigest is executed from a CGI program.  Therefore this may not be a vulnerability.'
