  - CVE-2020-9490
summary: Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43. A specially crafted value for the 'Cache-Digest'
  header in a HTTP/2 request would result in a crash when the server actually tries to HTTP/2
  PUSH a resource afterwards. Configuring the HTTP/2 feature via "H2Push off" will mitigate
  this vulnerability for unpatched servers.
