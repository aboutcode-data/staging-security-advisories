summary: 'Some mod_proxy configurations on Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 through 2.4.55
  allow a HTTP Request Smuggling attack.     Configurations are affected when mod_proxy is enabled
  along with some form of RewriteRule  or ProxyPassMatch in which a non-specific pattern matches  some
  portion of the user-supplied request-target (URL) data and is then  re-inserted into the proxied
  request-target using variable  substitution. For example, something like:     RewriteEngine
  on RewriteRule "^/here/(.*)" "http://example.com:8080/elsewhere?$1"; [P] ProxyPassReverse
  /here/ http://example.com:8080/   Request splitting/smuggling could result in bypass of access
  controls in the proxy server, proxying unintended URLs to existing origin servers, and cache
  poisoning. Users are recommended to update to at least version 2.4.56 of Apache HTTP Server.'
