  - CVE-2005-2088
summary: 'The Apache HTTP server before 1.3.34, and 2.0.x before 2.0.55, when acting as an HTTP
  proxy, allows remote attackers to poison the web cache, bypass web application firewall protection,
  and conduct XSS attacks via an HTTP request with both a "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" header
  and a Content-Length header, which causes Apache to incorrectly handle and forward the body
  of the request in a way that causes the receiving server to process it as a separate HTTP
  request, aka "HTTP Request Smuggling."'
