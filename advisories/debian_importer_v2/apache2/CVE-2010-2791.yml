aliases:
  - CVE-2010-2791
summary: 'mod_proxy in httpd in Apache HTTP Server 2.2.9, when running on Unix, does not close
  the backend connection if a timeout occurs when reading a response from a persistent connection,
  which allows remote attackers to obtain a potentially sensitive response intended for a different
  client in opportunistic circumstances via a normal HTTP request.  NOTE: this is the same issue
  as CVE-2010-2068, but for a different OS and set of affected versions.'
