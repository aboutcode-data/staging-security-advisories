  - CVE-2007-1743
summary: 'suexec in Apache HTTP Server (httpd) 2.2.3 does not verify combinations of user and
  group IDs on the command line, which might allow local users to leverage other vulnerabilities
  to create arbitrary UID/GID owned files if /proc is mounted.  NOTE: the researcher, who is
  reliable, claims that the vendor disputes the issue because "the attacks described rely on
  an insecure server configuration" in which the user "has write access to the document root."  In
  addition, because this is dependent on other vulnerabilities, perhaps this is resultant and
  should not be included in CVE.'
