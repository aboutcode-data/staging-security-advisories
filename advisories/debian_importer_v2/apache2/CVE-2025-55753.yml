summary: 'An integer overflow in the case of failed ACME certificate renewal leads, after a
  number of failures (~30 days in default configurations), to the backoff timer becoming 0.
  Attempts to renew the certificate then are repeated without delays until it succeeds.  This
  issue affects Apache HTTP Server: from 2.4.30 before 2.4.66.   Users are recommended to upgrade
  to version 2.4.66, which fixes the issue.'
