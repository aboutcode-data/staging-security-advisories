  - CVE-2018-1301
summary: A specially crafted request could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server prior to version
  2.4.30, due to an out of bound access after a size limit is reached by reading the HTTP header.
  This vulnerability is considered very hard if not impossible to trigger in non-debug mode
  (both log and build level), so it is classified as low risk for common server usage.
