  - CVE-2023-43622
summary: 'An attacker, opening a HTTP/2 connection with an initial window size of 0, was able
  to block handling of that connection indefinitely in Apache HTTP Server. This could be used
  to exhaust worker resources in the server, similar to the well known "slow loris" attack pattern.
  This has been fixed in version 2.4.58, so that such connection are terminated properly after
  the configured connection timeout.  This issue affects Apache HTTP Server: from 2.4.55 through
  2.4.57.  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.'
