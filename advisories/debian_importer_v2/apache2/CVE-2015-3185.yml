  - CVE-2015-3185
summary: The ap_some_auth_required function in server/request.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.4.x
  before 2.4.14 does not consider that a Require directive may be associated with an authorization
  setting rather than an authentication setting, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended
  access restrictions in opportunistic circumstances by leveraging the presence of a module
  that relies on the 2.2 API behavior.
