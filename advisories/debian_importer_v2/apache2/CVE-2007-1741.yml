  - CVE-2007-1741
summary: 'Multiple race conditions in suexec in Apache HTTP Server (httpd) 2.2.3 between directory
  and file validation, and their usage, allow local users to gain privileges and execute arbitrary
  code by renaming directories or performing symlink attacks. NOTE: the researcher, who is reliable,
  claims that the vendor disputes the issue because "the attacks described rely on an insecure
  server configuration" in which the user "has write access to the document root."'
