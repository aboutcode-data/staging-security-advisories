summary: 'The mod_proxy module in the Apache HTTP Server 1.3.x through 1.3.42, 2.0.x through
  2.0.64, and 2.2.x through 2.2.21, when the Revision 1179239 patch is in place, does not properly
  interact with use of (1) RewriteRule and (2) ProxyPassMatch pattern matches for configuration
  of a reverse proxy, which allows remote attackers to send requests to intranet servers via
  a malformed URI containing an @ (at sign) character and a : (colon) character in invalid positions.  NOTE:
  this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2011-3368.'
