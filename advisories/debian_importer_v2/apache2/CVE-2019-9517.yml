  - CVE-2019-9517
summary: Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to unconstrained interal data buffering,
  potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker opens the HTTP/2 window so the peer
  can send without constraint; however, they leave the TCP window closed so the peer cannot
  actually write (many of) the bytes on the wire. The attacker then sends a stream of requests
  for a large response object. Depending on how the servers queue the responses, this can consume
  excess memory, CPU, or both.
