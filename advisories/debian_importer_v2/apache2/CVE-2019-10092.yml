  - CVE-2019-10092
summary: In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.0-2.4.39, a limited cross-site scripting issue was reported
  affecting the mod_proxy error page. An attacker could cause the link on the error page to
  be malformed and instead point to a page of their choice. This would only be exploitable where
  a server was set up with proxying enabled but was misconfigured in such a way that the Proxy
  Error page was displayed.
