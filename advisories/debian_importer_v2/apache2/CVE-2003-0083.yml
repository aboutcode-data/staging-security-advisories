aliases:
  - CVE-2003-0083
summary: Apache 1.3 before 1.3.25 and Apache 2.0 before version 2.0.46 does not filter terminal
  escape sequences from its access logs, which could make it easier for attackers to insert
  those sequences into terminal emulators containing vulnerabilities related to escape sequences,
  a different vulnerability than CVE-2003-0020.
