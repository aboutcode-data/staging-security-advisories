aliases:
  - CVE-2002-1850
summary: mod_cgi in Apache 2.0.39 and 2.0.40 allows local users and possibly remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service (hang and memory consumption) by causing a CGI script to send
  a large amount of data to stderr, which results in a read/write deadlock between httpd and
  the CGI script.
