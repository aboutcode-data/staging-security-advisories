  - CVE-2003-1580
summary: The Apache HTTP Server 2.0.44, when DNS resolution is enabled for client IP addresses,
  uses a logging format that does not identify whether a dotted quad represents an unresolved
  IP address, which allows remote attackers to spoof IP addresses via crafted DNS responses
  containing numerical top-level domains, as demonstrated by a forged 123.123.123.123 domain
  name, related to an "Inverse Lookup Log Corruption (ILLC)" issue.
