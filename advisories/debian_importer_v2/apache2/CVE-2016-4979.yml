aliases:
  - CVE-2016-4979
summary: The Apache HTTP Server 2.4.18 through 2.4.20, when mod_http2 and mod_ssl are enabled,
  does not properly recognize the "SSLVerifyClient require" directive for HTTP/2 request authorization,
  which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the ability
  to send multiple requests over a single connection and aborting a renegotiation.
