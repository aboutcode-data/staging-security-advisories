  - CVE-2022-36033
summary: 'jsoup is a Java HTML parser, built for HTML editing, cleaning, scraping, and cross-site
  scripting (XSS) safety. jsoup may incorrectly sanitize HTML including `javascript:` URL expressions,
  which could allow XSS attacks when a reader subsequently clicks that link. If the non-default
  `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks` option is enabled, HTML including `javascript:` URLs that
  have been crafted with control characters will not be sanitized. If the site that this HTML
  is published on does not set a Content Security Policy, an XSS attack is then possible. This
  issue is patched in jsoup 1.15.3. Users should upgrade to this version. Additionally, as the
  unsanitized input may have been persisted, old content should be cleaned again using the updated
  version. To remediate this issue without immediately upgrading: - disable `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks`,
  which will rewrite input URLs as absolute URLs - ensure an appropriate [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)
  is defined. (This should be used regardless of upgrading, as a defence-in-depth best practice.)'
