  - CVE-2025-47287
summary: 'Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library. When Tornado''s
  ``multipart/form-data`` parser encounters certain errors, it logs a warning but continues
  trying to parse the remainder of the data. This allows remote attackers to generate an extremely
  high volume of logs, constituting a DoS attack. This DoS is compounded by the fact that the
  logging subsystem is synchronous. All versions of Tornado prior to 6.5.0 are affected. The
  vulnerable parser is enabled by default. Upgrade to Tornado version 6.50 to receive a patch.
  As a workaround, risk can be mitigated by blocking `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` in
  a proxy.'
