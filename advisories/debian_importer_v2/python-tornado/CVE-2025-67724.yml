  - CVE-2025-67724
summary: Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library. In versions
  6.5.2 and below, the supplied reason phrase is used unescaped in HTTP headers (where it could
  be used for header injection) or in HTML in the default error page (where it could be used
  for XSS) and can be exploited by passing untrusted or malicious data into the reason argument.
  Used by both RequestHandler.set_status and tornado.web.HTTPError, the argument is designed
  to allow applications to pass custom "reason" phrases (the "Not Found" in HTTP/1.1 404 Not
  Found) to the HTTP status line (mainly for non-standard status codes). This issue is fixed
  in version 6.5.3.
