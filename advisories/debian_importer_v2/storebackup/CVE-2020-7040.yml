aliases:
  - CVE-2020-7040
summary: storeBackup.pl in storeBackup through 3.5 relies on the /tmp/storeBackup.lock pathname,
  which allows symlink attacks that possibly lead to privilege escalation. (Local users can
  also create a plain file named /tmp/storeBackup.lock to block use of storeBackup until an
  admin manually deletes that file.)
