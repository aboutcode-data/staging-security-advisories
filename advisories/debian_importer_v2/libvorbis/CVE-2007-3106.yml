aliases:
  - CVE-2007-3106
summary: 'lib/info.c in libvorbis 1.1.2, and possibly other versions before 1.2.0, allows context-dependent
  attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via invalid (1)
  blocksize_0 and (2) blocksize_1 values, which trigger a "heap overwrite" in the _01inverse
  function in res0.c.  NOTE: this issue has been RECAST so that CVE-2007-4029 handles additional
  vectors.'
