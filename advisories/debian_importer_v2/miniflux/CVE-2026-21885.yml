summary: Miniflux 2 is an open source feed reader. Prior to version 2.2.16, Miniflux's media
  proxy endpoint (`GET /proxy/{encodedDigest}/{encodedURL}`) can be abused to perform Server-Side
  Request Forgery (SSRF). An authenticated user can cause Miniflux to generate a signed proxy
  URL for attacker-chosen media URLs embedded in feed entry content, including internal addresses
  (e.g., localhost, private RFC1918 ranges, or link-local metadata endpoints). Requesting the
  resulting `/proxy/...` URL makes Miniflux fetch and return the internal response. Version
  2.2.16 fixes the issue.
