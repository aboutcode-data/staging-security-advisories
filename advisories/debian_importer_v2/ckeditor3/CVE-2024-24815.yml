summary: CKEditor4 is an open source what-you-see-is-what-you-get HTML editor. A cross-site
  scripting vulnerability has been discovered in the core HTML parsing module in versions of
  CKEditor4 prior to 4.24.0-lts. It may affect all editor instances that enabled full-page editing
  mode or enabled CDATA elements in Advanced Content Filtering configuration (defaults to `script`
  and `style` elements). The vulnerability allows attackers to inject malformed HTML content
  bypassing Advanced Content Filtering mechanism, which could result in executing JavaScript
  code. An attacker could abuse faulty CDATA content detection and use it to prepare an intentional
  attack on the editor. A fix is available in version 4.24.0-lts.
