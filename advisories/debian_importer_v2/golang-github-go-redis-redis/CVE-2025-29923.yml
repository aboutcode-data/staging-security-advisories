  - CVE-2025-29923
summary: go-redis is the official Redis client library for the Go programming language. Prior
  to 9.5.5, 9.6.3, and 9.7.3, go-redis potentially responds out of order when `CLIENT SETINFO`
  times out during connection establishment. This can happen when the client is configured to
  transmit its identity, there are network connectivity issues, or the client was configured
  with aggressive timeouts. The problem occurs for multiple use cases. For sticky connections,
  you receive persistent out-of-order responses for the lifetime of the connection. All commands
  in the pipeline receive incorrect responses. When used with the default ConnPool once a connection
  is returned after use with ConnPool#Put the read buffer will be checked and the connection
  will be marked as bad due to the unread data. This means that at most one out-of-order response
  before the connection is discarded. This issue is fixed in 9.5.5, 9.6.3, and 9.7.3. You can
  prevent the vulnerability by setting the flag DisableIndentity to true when constructing the
  client instance.
