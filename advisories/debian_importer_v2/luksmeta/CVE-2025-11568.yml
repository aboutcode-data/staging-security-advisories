aliases:
  - CVE-2025-11568
summary: A data corruption vulnerability has been identified in the luksmeta utility when used
  with the LUKS1 disk encryption format. An attacker with the necessary permissions can exploit
  this flaw by writing a large amount of metadata to an encrypted device. The utility fails
  to correctly validate the available space, causing the metadata to overwrite and corrupt the
  user's encrypted data. This action leads to a permanent loss of the stored information. Devices
  using the LUKS formats other than LUKS1 are not affected by this issue.
