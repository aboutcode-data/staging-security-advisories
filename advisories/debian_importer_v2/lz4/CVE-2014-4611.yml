aliases:
  - CVE-2014-4611
summary: Integer overflow in the LZ4 algorithm implementation, as used in Yann Collet LZ4 before
  r118 and in the lz4_uncompress function in lib/lz4/lz4_decompress.c in the Linux kernel before
  3.15.2, on 32-bit platforms might allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service
  (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted Literal Run that
  would be improperly handled by programs not complying with an API limitation, a different
  vulnerability than CVE-2014-4715.
