aliases:
  - CVE-2024-48948
summary: The Elliptic package 6.5.7 for Node.js, in its for ECDSA implementation, does not correctly
  verify valid signatures if the hash contains at least four leading 0 bytes and when the order
  of the elliptic curve's base point is smaller than the hash, because of an _truncateToN anomaly.
  This leads to valid signatures being rejected. Legitimate transactions or communications may
  be incorrectly flagged as invalid.
