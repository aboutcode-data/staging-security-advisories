  - CVE-2020-28498
summary: The package elliptic before 6.5.4 are vulnerable to Cryptographic Issues via the secp256k1
  implementation in elliptic/ec/key.js. There is no check to confirm that the public key point
  passed into the derive function actually exists on the secp256k1 curve. This results in the
  potential for the private key used in this implementation to be revealed after a number of
  ECDH operations are performed.
