aliases:
  - CVE-2025-14505
summary: The ECDSA implementation of the Elliptic package generates incorrect signatures if
  an interim value of 'k' (as computed based on step 3.2 of  RFC 6979 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6979
  ) has leading zeros and is susceptible to cryptanalysis, which can lead to secret key exposure.
  This happens, because the byte-length of 'k' is incorrectly computed, resulting in its getting
  truncated during the computation. Legitimate transactions or communications will be broken
  as a result. Furthermore, due to the nature of the fault, attackers could–under certain conditions–derive
  the secret key, if they could get their hands on both a faulty signature generated by a vulnerable
  version of Elliptic and a correct signature for the same inputs.  This issue affects all known
  versions of Elliptic (at the time of writing, versions less than or equal to 6.6.1).
