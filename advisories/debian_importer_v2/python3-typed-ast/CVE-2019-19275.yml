aliases:
  - CVE-2019-19275
summary: typed_ast 1.3.0 and 1.3.1 has an ast_for_arguments out-of-bounds read. An attacker
  with the ability to cause a Python interpreter to parse Python source (but not necessarily
  execute it) may be able to crash the interpreter process. This could be a concern, for example,
  in a web-based service that parses (but does not execute) Python code. (This issue also affected
  certain Python 3.8.0-alpha prereleases.)
