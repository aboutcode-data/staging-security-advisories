  - CVE-2025-27607
summary: Python JSON Logger is a JSON Formatter for Python Logging. Between 30 December 2024
  and 4 March 2025 Python JSON Logger was vulnerable to RCE through a missing dependency. This
  occurred because msgspec-python313-pre was deleted by the owner leaving the name open to being
  claimed by a third party. If the package was claimed, it would allow them RCE on any Python
  JSON Logger user who installed the development dependencies on Python 3.13 (e.g. pip install
  python-json-logger[dev]). This issue has been resolved with 3.3.0.
