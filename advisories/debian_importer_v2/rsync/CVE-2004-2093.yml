  - CVE-2004-2093
summary: 'Buffer overflow in the open_socket_out function in socket.c for rsync 2.5.7 and earlier
  allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code
  via a long RSYNC_PROXY environment variable.  NOTE: since rsync is not setuid, this issue
  does not provide any additional privileges beyond those that are already available to the
  user.  Therefore this issue may be REJECTED in the future.'
