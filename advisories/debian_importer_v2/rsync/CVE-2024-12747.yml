  - CVE-2024-12747
summary: A flaw was found in rsync. This vulnerability arises from a race condition during rsync's
  handling of symbolic links. Rsync's default behavior when encountering symbolic links is to
  skip them. If an attacker replaced a regular file with a symbolic link at the right time,
  it was possible to bypass the default behavior and traverse symbolic links. Depending on the
  privileges of the rsync process, an attacker could leak sensitive information, potentially
  leading to privilege escalation.
