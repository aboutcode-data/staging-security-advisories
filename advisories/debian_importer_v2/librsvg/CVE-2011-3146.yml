aliases:
  - CVE-2011-3146
summary: librsvg before 2.34.1 uses the node name to identify the type of node, which allows
  context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) and possibly
  execute arbitrary code via a SVG file with a node with the element name starting with "fe,"
  which is misidentified as a RsvgFilterPrimitive.
