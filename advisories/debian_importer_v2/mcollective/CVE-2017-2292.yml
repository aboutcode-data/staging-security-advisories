  - CVE-2017-2292
summary: Versions of MCollective prior to 2.10.4 deserialized YAML from agents without calling
  safe_load, allowing the potential for arbitrary code execution on the server. The fix for
  this is to call YAML.safe_load on input. This has been tested in all Puppet-supplied MCollective
  plugins, but there is a chance that third-party plugins could rely on this insecure behavior.
