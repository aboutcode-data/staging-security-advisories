  - CVE-2024-38816
summary: 'Applications serving static resources through the functional web frameworks WebMvc.fn
  or WebFlux.fn are vulnerable to path traversal attacks. An attacker can craft malicious HTTP
  requests and obtain any file on the file system that is also accessible to the process in
  which the Spring application is running.  Specifically, an application is vulnerable when
  both of the following are true:    *  the web application uses RouterFunctions to serve static
  resources   *  resource handling is explicitly configured with a FileSystemResource location   However,
  malicious requests are blocked and rejected when any of the following is true:    *  the  Spring
  Security HTTP Firewall https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/exploits/firewall.html
   is in use   *  the application runs on Tomcat or Jetty'
