summary: A Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux application running on JDK 9+ may be vulnerable to remote
  code execution (RCE) via data binding. The specific exploit requires the application to run
  on Tomcat as a WAR deployment. If the application is deployed as a Spring Boot executable
  jar, i.e. the default, it is not vulnerable to the exploit. However, the nature of the vulnerability
  is more general, and there may be other ways to exploit it.
