  - CVE-2018-15756
summary: Spring Framework, version 5.1, versions 5.0.x prior to 5.0.10, versions 4.3.x prior
  to 4.3.20, and older unsupported versions on the 4.2.x branch provide support for range requests
  when serving static resources through the ResourceHttpRequestHandler, or starting in 5.0 when
  an annotated controller returns an org.springframework.core.io.Resource. A malicious user
  (or attacker) can add a range header with a high number of ranges, or with wide ranges that
  overlap, or both, for a denial of service attack. This vulnerability affects applications
  that depend on either spring-webmvc or spring-webflux. Such applications must also have a
  registration for serving static resources (e.g. JS, CSS, images, and others), or have an annotated
  controller that returns an org.springframework.core.io.Resource. Spring Boot applications
  that depend on spring-boot-starter-web or spring-boot-starter-webflux are ready to serve static
  resources out of the box and are therefore vulnerable.
