  - CVE-2020-5397
summary: Spring Framework, versions 5.2.x prior to 5.2.3 are vulnerable to CSRF attacks through
  CORS preflight requests that target Spring MVC (spring-webmvc module) or Spring WebFlux (spring-webflux
  module) endpoints. Only non-authenticated endpoints are vulnerable because preflight requests
  should not include credentials and therefore requests should fail authentication. However
  a notable exception to this are Chrome based browsers when using client certificates for authentication
  since Chrome sends TLS client certificates in CORS preflight requests in violation of spec
  requirements. No HTTP body can be sent or received as a result of this attack.
