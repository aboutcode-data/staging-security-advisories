  - CVE-2025-41242
summary: 'Spring Framework MVC applications can be vulnerable to a “Path Traversal Vulnerability”
  when deployed on a non-compliant Servlet container.  An application can be vulnerable when
  all the following are true:    *  the application is deployed as a WAR or with an embedded
  Servlet container   *  the Servlet container  does not reject suspicious sequences https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/6.1/jakarta-servlet-spec-6.1.html#uri-path-canonicalization    *  the
  application  serves static resources https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-config/static-resources.html#page-title
   with Spring resource handling   We have verified that applications deployed on Apache Tomcat
  or Eclipse Jetty are not vulnerable, as long as default security features are not disabled
  in the configuration. Because we cannot check exploits against all Servlet containers and
  configuration variants, we strongly recommend upgrading your application.'
