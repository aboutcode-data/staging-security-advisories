  - CVE-2020-11061
summary: In Bareos Director less than or equal to 16.2.10, 17.2.9, 18.2.8, and 19.2.7, a heap
  overflow allows a malicious client to corrupt the director's memory via oversized digest strings
  sent during initialization of a verify job. Disabling verify jobs mitigates the problem. This
  issue is also patched in Bareos versions 19.2.8, 18.2.9 and 17.2.10.
