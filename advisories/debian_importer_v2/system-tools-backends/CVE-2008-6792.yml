summary: system-tools-backends before 2.6.0-1ubuntu1.1 in Ubuntu 8.10, as used by "Users and
  Groups" in GNOME System Tools, hashes account passwords with 3DES and consequently limits
  effective password lengths to eight characters, which makes it easier for context-dependent
  attackers to successfully conduct brute-force password attacks.
