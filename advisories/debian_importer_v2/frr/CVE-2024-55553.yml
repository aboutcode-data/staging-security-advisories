  - CVE-2024-55553
summary: 'In FRRouting (FRR) before 10.3 from 6.0 onward, all routes are re-validated if the
  total size of an update received via RTR exceeds the internal socket''s buffer size, default
  4K on most OSes. An attacker can use this to trigger re-parsing of the RIB for FRR routers
  using RTR by causing more than this number of updates during an update interval (usually 30
  minutes). Additionally, this effect regularly occurs organically. Furthermore, an attacker
  can use this to trigger route validation continuously. Given that routers with large full
  tables may need more than 30 minutes to fully re-validate the table, continuous issuance/withdrawal
  of large numbers of ROA may be used to impact the route handling performance of all FRR instances
  using RPKI globally. Additionally, the re-validation will cause heightened BMP traffic to
  ingestors. Fixed Versions: 10.0.3, 10.1.2, 10.2.1, >= 10.3.'
