summary: bgpd in FRRouting FRR (aka Free Range Routing) 2.x and 3.x before 3.0.4, 4.x before
  4.0.1, 5.x before 5.0.2, and 6.x before 6.0.2 (not affecting Cumulus Linux or VyOS), when
  ENABLE_BGP_VNC is used for Virtual Network Control, allows remote attackers to cause a denial
  of service (peering session flap) via attribute 255 in a BGP UPDATE packet. This occurred
  during Disco in January 2019 because FRR does not implement RFC 7606, and therefore the packets
  with 255 were considered invalid VNC data and the BGP session was closed.
