summary: 'An issue was discovered in FRRouting FRR (aka Free Range Routing) through 7.3.1. When
  using the split-config feature, the init script creates an empty config file with world-readable
  default permissions, leading to a possible information leak via tools/frr.in and tools/frrcommon.sh.in.
  NOTE: some parties consider this user error, not a vulnerability, because the permissions
  are under the control of the user before any sensitive information is present in the file'
