aliases:
  - CVE-2013-1912
summary: Buffer overflow in HAProxy 1.4 through 1.4.22 and 1.5-dev through 1.5-dev17, when HTTP
  keep-alive is enabled, using HTTP keywords in TCP inspection rules, and running with rewrite
  rules that appends to requests, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
  and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted pipelined HTTP requests that prevent request
  realignment from occurring.
