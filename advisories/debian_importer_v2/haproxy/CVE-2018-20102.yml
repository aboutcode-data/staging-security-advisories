  - CVE-2018-20102
summary: An out-of-bounds read in dns_validate_dns_response in dns.c was discovered in HAProxy
  through 1.8.14. Due to a missing check when validating DNS responses, remote attackers might
  be able read the 16 bytes corresponding to an AAAA record from the non-initialized part of
  the buffer, possibly accessing anything that was left on the stack, or even past the end of
  the 8193-byte buffer, depending on the value of accepted_payload_size.
