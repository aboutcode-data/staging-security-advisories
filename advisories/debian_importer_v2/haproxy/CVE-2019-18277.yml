  - CVE-2019-18277
summary: A flaw was found in HAProxy before 2.0.6. In legacy mode, messages featuring a transfer-encoding
  header missing the "chunked" value were not being correctly rejected. The impact was limited
  but if combined with the "http-reuse always" setting, it could be used to help construct an
  HTTP request smuggling attack against a vulnerable component employing a lenient parser that
  would ignore the content-length header as soon as it saw a transfer-encoding one (even if
  not entirely valid according to the specification).
