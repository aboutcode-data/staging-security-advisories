  - CVE-2023-25725
summary: HAProxy before 2.7.3 may allow a bypass of access control because HTTP/1 headers are
  inadvertently lost in some situations, aka "request smuggling." The HTTP header parsers in
  HAProxy may accept empty header field names, which could be used to truncate the list of HTTP
  headers and thus make some headers disappear after being parsed and processed for HTTP/1.0
  and HTTP/1.1. For HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, the impact is limited because the headers disappear before
  being parsed and processed, as if they had not been sent by the client. The fixed versions
  are 2.7.3, 2.6.9, 2.5.12, 2.4.22, 2.2.29, and 2.0.31.
