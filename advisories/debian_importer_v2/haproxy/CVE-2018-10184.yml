  - CVE-2018-10184
summary: An issue was discovered in HAProxy before 1.8.8. The incoming H2 frame length was checked
  against the max_frame_size setting instead of being checked against the bufsize. The max_frame_size
  only applies to outgoing traffic and not to incoming, so if a large enough frame size is advertised
  in the SETTINGS frame, a wrapped frame will be defragmented into a temporary allocated buffer
  where the second fragment may overflow the heap by up to 16 kB. It is very unlikely that this
  can be exploited for code execution given that buffers are very short lived and their addresses
  not realistically predictable in production, but the likelihood of an immediate crash is absolutely
  certain.
