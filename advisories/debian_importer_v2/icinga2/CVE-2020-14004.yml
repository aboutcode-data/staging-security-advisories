  - CVE-2020-14004
summary: An issue was discovered in Icinga2 before v2.12.0-rc1. The prepare-dirs script (run
  as part of the icinga2 systemd service) executes chmod 2750 /run/icinga2/cmd. /run/icinga2
  is under control of an unprivileged user by default. If /run/icinga2/cmd is a symlink, then
  it will by followed and arbitrary files can be changed to mode 2750 by the unprivileged icinga2
  user.
