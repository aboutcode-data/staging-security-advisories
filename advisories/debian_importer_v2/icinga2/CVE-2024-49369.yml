  - CVE-2024-49369
summary: Icinga is a monitoring system which checks the availability of network resources, notifies
  users of outages, and generates performance data for reporting. The TLS certificate validation
  in all Icinga 2 versions starting from 2.4.0 was flawed, allowing an attacker to impersonate
  both trusted cluster nodes as well as any API users that use TLS client certificates for authentication
  (ApiUser objects with the client_cn attribute set). This vulnerability has been fixed in v2.14.3,
  v2.13.10, v2.12.11, and v2.11.12.
