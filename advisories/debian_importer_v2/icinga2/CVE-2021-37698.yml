  - CVE-2021-37698
summary: Icinga is a monitoring system which checks the availability of network resources, notifies
  users of outages, and generates performance data for reporting. In versions 2.5.0 through
  2.13.0, ElasticsearchWriter, GelfWriter, InfluxdbWriter and Influxdb2Writer do not verify
  the server's certificate despite a certificate authority being specified. Icinga 2 instances
  which connect to any of the mentioned time series databases (TSDBs) using TLS over a spoofable
  infrastructure should immediately upgrade to version 2.13.1, 2.12.6, or 2.11.11 to patch the
  issue. Such instances should also change the credentials (if any) used by the TSDB writer
  feature to authenticate against the TSDB. There are no workarounds aside from upgrading.
