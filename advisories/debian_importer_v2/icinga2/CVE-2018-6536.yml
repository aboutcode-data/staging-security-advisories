  - CVE-2018-6536
summary: An issue was discovered in Icinga 2.x through 2.8.1. The daemon creates an icinga2.pid
  file after dropping privileges to a non-root account, which might allow local users to kill
  arbitrary processes by leveraging access to this non-root account for icinga2.pid modification
  before a root script executes a "kill `cat /pathname/icinga2.pid`" command, as demonstrated
  by icinga2.init.d.cmake.
