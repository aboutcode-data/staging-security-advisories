summary: 'Icinga 2 is an open source monitoring system. From 2.10.0 to before 2.15.1, 2.14.7,
  and 2.13.13, when creating an invalid reference, such as a reference to null, dereferencing
  results in a segmentation fault. This can be used by any API user with access to an API endpoint

  in the following Icinga 2 versions: 2.15.1, 2.14.7, and 2.13.13.'
