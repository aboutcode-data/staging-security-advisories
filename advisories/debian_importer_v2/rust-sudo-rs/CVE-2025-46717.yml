  - CVE-2025-46717
summary: sudo-rs is a memory safe implementation of sudo and su written in Rust. Prior to version
  0.2.6, users with no (or very limited) sudo privileges can determine whether files exists
  in folders that they otherwise cannot access using `sudo --list <pathname>`. Users with local
  access to a machine can discover the existence/non-existence of certain files, revealing potentially
  sensitive information in the file names. This information can also be used in conjunction
  with other attacks. Version 0.2.6 fixes the vulnerability.
