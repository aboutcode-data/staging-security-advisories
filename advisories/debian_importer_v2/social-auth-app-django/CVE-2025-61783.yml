  - CVE-2025-61783
summary: Python Social Auth is a social authentication/registration mechanism. In versions prior
  to 5.6.0, upon authentication, the user could be associated by e-mail even if the `associate_by_email`
  pipeline was not included. This could lead to account compromise when a third-party authentication
  service does not validate provided e-mail addresses or doesn't require unique e-mail addresses.
  Version 5.6.0 contains a patch. As a workaround, review the authentication service policy
  on e-mail addresses; many will not allow exploiting this vulnerability.
