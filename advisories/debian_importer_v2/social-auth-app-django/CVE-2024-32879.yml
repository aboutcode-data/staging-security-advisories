  - CVE-2024-32879
summary: Python Social Auth is a social authentication/registration mechanism. Prior to version
  5.4.1, due to default case-insensitive collation in MySQL or MariaDB databases, third-party
  authentication user IDs are not case-sensitive and could cause different IDs to match. This
  issue has been addressed by a fix released in version 5.4.1. An immediate workaround would
  be to change collation of the affected field.
