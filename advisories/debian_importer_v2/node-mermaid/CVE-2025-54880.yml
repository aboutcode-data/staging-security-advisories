summary: Mermaid is a JavaScript based diagramming and charting tool that uses Markdown-inspired
  text definitions and a renderer to create and modify complex diagrams. In the default configuration
  of mermaid 11.9.0 and earlier, user supplied input for architecture diagram icons is passed
  to the d3 html() method, creating a sink for cross site scripting. This vulnerability is fixed
  in 11.10.0.
