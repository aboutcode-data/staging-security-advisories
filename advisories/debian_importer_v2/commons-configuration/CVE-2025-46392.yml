  - CVE-2025-46392
summary: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in Apache Commons Configuration 1.x.  There
  are a number of issues in Apache Commons Configuration 1.x that allow excessive resource consumption
  when loading untrusted configurations or using unexpected usage patterns. The Apache Commons
  Configuration team does not intend to fix these issues in 1.x. Apache Commons Configuration
  1.x is still safe to use in scenario's where you only load trusted configurations.    Users
  that load untrusted configurations or give attackers control over usage patterns are recommended
  to upgrade to the 2.x version line, which fixes these issues. Apache Commons Configuration
  2.x is not a drop-in replacement, but as it uses a separate Maven groupId and Java package
  namespace they can be loaded side-by-side, making it possible to do a gradual migration.
