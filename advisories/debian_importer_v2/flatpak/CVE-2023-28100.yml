  - CVE-2023-28100
summary: Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications
  on Linux. Versions prior to 1.10.8, 1.12.8, 1.14.4, and 1.15.4 contain a vulnerability similar
  to CVE-2017-5226, but using the `TIOCLINUX` ioctl command instead of `TIOCSTI`. If a Flatpak
  app is run on a Linux virtual console such as `/dev/tty1`, it can copy text from the virtual
  console and paste it into the command buffer, from which the command might be run after the
  Flatpak app has exited. Ordinary graphical terminal emulators like xterm, gnome-terminal and
  Konsole are unaffected. This vulnerability is specific to the Linux virtual consoles `/dev/tty1`,
  `/dev/tty2` and so on. A patch is available in versions 1.10.8, 1.12.8, 1.14.4, and 1.15.4.
  As a workaround, don't run Flatpak on a Linux virtual console. Flatpak is primarily designed
  to be used in a Wayland or X11 graphical environment.
