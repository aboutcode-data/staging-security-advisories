summary: 'Flatpak before 1.0.8, 1.1.x and 1.2.x before 1.2.4, and 1.3.x before 1.3.1 allows
  a sandbox bypass. Flatpak versions since 0.8.1 address CVE-2017-5226 by using a seccomp filter
  to prevent sandboxed apps from using the TIOCSTI ioctl, which could otherwise be used to inject
  commands into the controlling terminal so that they would be executed outside the sandbox
  after the sandboxed app exits. This fix was incomplete: on 64-bit platforms, the seccomp filter
  could be bypassed by an ioctl request number that has TIOCSTI in its 32 least significant
  bits and an arbitrary nonzero value in its 32 most significant bits, which the Linux kernel
  would treat as equivalent to TIOCSTI.'
