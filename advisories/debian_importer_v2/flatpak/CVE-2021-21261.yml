summary: Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications
  on Linux. A bug was discovered in the `flatpak-portal` service that can allow sandboxed applications
  to execute arbitrary code on the host system (a sandbox escape). This sandbox-escape bug is
  present in versions from 0.11.4 and before fixed versions 1.8.5 and 1.10.0. The Flatpak portal
  D-Bus service (`flatpak-portal`, also known by its D-Bus service name `org.freedesktop.portal.Flatpak`)
  allows apps in a Flatpak sandbox to launch their own subprocesses in a new sandbox instance,
  either with the same security settings as the caller or with more restrictive security settings.
  For example, this is used in Flatpak-packaged web browsers such as Chromium to launch subprocesses
  that will process untrusted web content, and give those subprocesses a more restrictive sandbox
  than the browser itself. In vulnerable versions, the Flatpak portal service passes caller-specified
  environment variables to non-sandboxed processes on the host system, and in particular to
  the `flatpak run` command that is used to launch the new sandbox instance. A malicious or
  compromised Flatpak app could set environment variables that are trusted by the `flatpak run`
  command, and use them to execute arbitrary code that is not in a sandbox. As a workaround,
  this vulnerability can be mitigated by preventing the `flatpak-portal` service from starting,
  but that mitigation will prevent many Flatpak apps from working correctly. This is fixed in
  versions 1.8.5 and 1.10.0.
