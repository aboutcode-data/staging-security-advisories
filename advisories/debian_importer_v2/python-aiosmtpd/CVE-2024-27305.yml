summary: aiosmtpd is a reimplementation of the Python stdlib smtpd.py based on asyncio. aiosmtpd
  is vulnerable to inbound SMTP smuggling. SMTP smuggling is a novel vulnerability based on
  not so novel interpretation differences of the SMTP protocol. By exploiting SMTP smuggling,
  an attacker may send smuggle/spoof e-mails with fake sender addresses, allowing advanced phishing
  attacks. This issue is also existed in other SMTP software like Postfix. With the right SMTP
  server constellation, an attacker can send spoofed e-mails to inbound/receiving aiosmtpd instances.
  This issue has been addressed in version 1.4.5. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no
  known workarounds for this vulnerability.
