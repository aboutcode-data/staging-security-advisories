  - CVE-2023-31124
summary: c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. When cross-compiling c-ares and using the
  autotools build system, CARES_RANDOM_FILE will not be set, as seen when cross compiling aarch64
  android.  This will downgrade to using rand() as a fallback which could allow an attacker
  to take advantage of the lack of entropy by not using a CSPRNG. This issue was patched in
  version 1.19.1.
