  - CVE-2024-25629
summary: c-ares is a C library for asynchronous DNS requests. `ares__read_line()` is used to
  parse local configuration files such as `/etc/resolv.conf`, `/etc/nsswitch.conf`, the `HOSTALIASES`
  file, and if using a c-ares version prior to 1.27.0, the `/etc/hosts` file. If any of these
  configuration files has an embedded `NULL` character as the first character in a new line,
  it can lead to attempting to read memory prior to the start of the given buffer which may
  result in a crash. This issue is fixed in c-ares 1.27.0. No known workarounds exist.
