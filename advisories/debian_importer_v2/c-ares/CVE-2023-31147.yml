  - CVE-2023-31147
summary: c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. When /dev/urandom or RtlGenRandom() are
  unavailable, c-ares uses rand() to generate random numbers used for DNS query ids. This is
  not a CSPRNG, and it is also not seeded by srand() so will generate predictable output. Input
  from the random number generator is fed into a non-compilant RC4 implementation and may not
  be as strong as the original RC4 implementation. No attempt is made to look for modern OS-provided
  CSPRNGs like arc4random() that is widely available. This issue has been fixed in version 1.19.1.
