  - CVE-2023-32067
summary: c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. c-ares is vulnerable to denial of service.
  If a target resolver sends a query, the attacker forges a malformed UDP packet with a length
  of 0 and returns them to the target resolver. The target resolver erroneously interprets the
  0 length as a graceful shutdown of the connection. This issue has been patched in version
  1.19.1.
