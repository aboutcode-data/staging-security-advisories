summary: Python 3.9.x before 3.9.16 and 3.10.x before 3.10.9 on Linux allows local privilege
  escalation in a non-default configuration. The Python multiprocessing library, when used with
  the forkserver start method on Linux, allows pickles to be deserialized from any user in the
  same machine local network namespace, which in many system configurations means any user on
  the same machine. Pickles can execute arbitrary code. Thus, this allows for local user privilege
  escalation to the user that any forkserver process is running as. Setting multiprocessing.util.abstract_sockets_supported
  to False is a workaround. The forkserver start method for multiprocessing is not the default
  start method. This issue is Linux specific because only Linux supports abstract namespace
  sockets. CPython before 3.9 does not make use of Linux abstract namespace sockets by default.
  Support for users manually specifying an abstract namespace socket was added as a bugfix in
  3.7.8 and 3.8.3, but users would need to make specific uncommon API calls in order to do that
  in CPython before 3.9.
