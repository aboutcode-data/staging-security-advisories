aliases:
  - CVE-2025-8291
summary: The 'zipfile' module would not check the validity of the ZIP64 End of Central Directory
  (EOCD) Locator record offset value would not be used to locate the ZIP64 EOCD record, instead
  the ZIP64 EOCD record would be assumed to be the previous record in the ZIP archive. This
  could be abused to create ZIP archives that are handled differently by the 'zipfile' module
  compared to other ZIP implementations.   Remediation maintains this behavior, but checks that
  the offset specified in the ZIP64 EOCD Locator record matches the expected value.
