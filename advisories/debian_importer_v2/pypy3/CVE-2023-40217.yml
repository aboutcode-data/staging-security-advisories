  - CVE-2023-40217
summary: An issue was discovered in Python before 3.8.18, 3.9.x before 3.9.18, 3.10.x before
  3.10.13, and 3.11.x before 3.11.5. It primarily affects servers (such as HTTP servers) that
  use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is created, receives data into
  the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly, there is a brief window where the SSLSocket
  instance will detect the socket as "not connected" and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered
  data will still be readable from the socket buffer. This data will not be authenticated if
  the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate authentication, and is indistinguishable
  from valid TLS stream data. Data is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer.
  (The TLS connection cannot directly be used for data exfiltration because the vulnerable code
  path requires that the connection be closed on initialization of the SSLSocket.)
