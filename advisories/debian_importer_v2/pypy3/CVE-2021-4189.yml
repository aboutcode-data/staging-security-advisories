aliases:
  - CVE-2021-4189
summary: A flaw was found in Python, specifically in the FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client
  library in PASV (passive) mode. The issue is how the FTP client trusts the host from the PASV
  response by default. This flaw allows an attacker to set up a malicious FTP server that can
  trick FTP clients into connecting back to a given IP address and port. This vulnerability
  could lead to FTP client scanning ports, which otherwise would not have been possible.
