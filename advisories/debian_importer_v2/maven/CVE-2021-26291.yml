  - CVE-2021-26291
summary: 'Apache Maven will follow repositories that are defined in a dependency’s Project Object
  Model (pom) which may be surprising to some users, resulting in potential risk if a malicious
  actor takes over that repository or is able to insert themselves into a position to pretend
  to be that repository. Maven is changing the default behavior in 3.8.1+ to no longer follow
  http (non-SSL) repository references by default. More details available in the referenced
  urls. If you are currently using a repository manager to govern the repositories used by your
  builds, you are unaffected by the risks present in the legacy behavior, and are unaffected
  by this vulnerability and change to default behavior. See this link for more information about
  repository management: https://maven.apache.org/repository-management.html'
