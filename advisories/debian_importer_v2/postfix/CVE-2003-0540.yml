aliases:
  - CVE-2003-0540
summary: The address parser code in Postfix 1.1.12 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause
  a denial of service (lock) via (1) a malformed envelope address to a local host that would
  generate a bounce and contains the ".!" string in the MAIL FROM or Errors-To headers, which
  causes nqmgr to lock up, or (2) via a valid MAIL FROM with a RCPT TO containing a ".!" string,
  which causes an instance of the SMTP listener to lock up.
