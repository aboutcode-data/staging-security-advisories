summary: Faye before version 1.4.0, there is a lack of certification validation in TLS handshakes.
  Faye uses em-http-request and faye-websocket in the Ruby version of its client. Those libraries
  both use the `EM::Connection#start_tls` method in EventMachine to implement the TLS handshake
  whenever a `wss:` URL is used for the connection. This method does not implement certificate
  verification by default, meaning that it does not check that the server presents a valid and
  trusted TLS certificate for the expected hostname. That means that any `https:` or `wss:`
  connection made using these libraries is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, since it
  does not confirm the identity of the server it is connected to. The first request a Faye client
  makes is always sent via normal HTTP, but later messages may be sent via WebSocket. Therefore
  it is vulnerable to the same problem that these underlying libraries are, and we needed both
  libraries to support TLS verification before Faye could claim to do the same. Your client
  would still be insecure if its initial HTTPS request was verified, but later WebSocket connections
  were not. This is fixed in Faye v1.4.0, which enables verification by default. For further
  background information on this issue, please see the referenced GitHub Advisory.
