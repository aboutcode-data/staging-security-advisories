aliases:
  - CVE-2007-3528
summary: The blowfish mode in DAR before 2.3.4 uses weak Blowfish-CBC cryptography by (1) discarding
  random bits by the blowfish::make_ivec function in libdar/crypto.cpp that results in predictable
  and repeating IV values, and (2) direct use of a password for keying, which makes it easier
  for context-dependent attackers to decrypt files.
