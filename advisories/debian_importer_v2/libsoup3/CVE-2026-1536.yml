aliases:
  - CVE-2026-1536
summary: A flaw was found in libsoup. An attacker who can control the input for the Content-Disposition
  header can inject CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) sequences into the header value. These
  sequences are then interpreted verbatim when the HTTP request or response is constructed,
  allowing arbitrary HTTP headers to be injected. This vulnerability can lead to HTTP header
  injection or HTTP response splitting without requiring authentication or user interaction.
