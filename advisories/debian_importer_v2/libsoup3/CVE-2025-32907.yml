  - CVE-2025-32907
summary: A flaw was found in libsoup. The implementation of HTTP range requests is vulnerable
  to a resource consumption attack. This flaw allows a malicious client to request the same
  range many times in a single HTTP request, causing the server to use large amounts of memory.
  This does not allow for a full denial of service.
