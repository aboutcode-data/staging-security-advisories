  - CVE-2026-1760
summary: 'A flaw was found in SoupServer. This HTTP request smuggling vulnerability occurs because
  SoupServer improperly handles requests that combine Transfer-Encoding: chunked and Connection:
  keep-alive headers. A remote, unauthenticated client can exploit this by sending specially
  crafted requests, causing SoupServer to fail to close the connection as required by RFC 9112.
  This allows the attacker to smuggle additional requests over the persistent connection, leading
  to unintended request processing and potential denial-of-service (DoS) conditions.'
