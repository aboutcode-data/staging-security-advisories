aliases:
  - CVE-2025-46421
summary: A flaw was found in libsoup. When libsoup clients encounter an HTTP redirect, they
  mistakenly send the HTTP Authorization header to the new host that the redirection points
  to. This allows the new host to impersonate the user to the original host that issued the
  redirect.
