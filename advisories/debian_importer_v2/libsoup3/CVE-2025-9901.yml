  - CVE-2025-9901
summary: A flaw was found in libsoup’s caching mechanism, SoupCache, where the HTTP Vary header
  is ignored when evaluating cached responses. This header ensures that responses vary appropriately
  based on request headers such as language or authentication. Without this check, cached content
  can be incorrectly reused across different requests, potentially exposing sensitive user information.
  While the issue is unlikely to affect everyday desktop use, it could result in confidentiality
  breaches in proxy or multi-user environments.
