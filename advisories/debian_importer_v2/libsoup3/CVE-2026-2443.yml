aliases:
  - CVE-2026-2443
summary: A flaw was identified in libsoup, a widely used HTTP library in GNOME-based systems.
  When processing specially crafted HTTP Range headers, the library may improperly validate
  requested byte ranges. In certain build configurations, this could allow a remote attacker
  to access portions of server memory beyond the intended response. Exploitation requires a
  vulnerable configuration and access to a server using the embedded SoupServer component.
