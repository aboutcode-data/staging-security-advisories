  - CVE-2025-11021
summary: A flaw was found in the cookie date handling logic of the libsoup HTTP library, widely
  used by GNOME and other applications for web communication. When processing cookies with specially
  crafted expiration dates, the library may perform an out-of-bounds memory read. This flaw
  could result in unintended disclosure of memory contents, potentially exposing sensitive information
  from the process using libsoup.
