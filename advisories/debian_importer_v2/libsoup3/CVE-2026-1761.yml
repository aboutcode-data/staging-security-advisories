  - CVE-2026-1761
summary: A flaw was found in libsoup. This stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability occurs
  during the parsing of multipart HTTP responses due to an incorrect length calculation. A remote
  attacker can exploit this by sending a specially crafted multipart HTTP response, which can
  lead to memory corruption. This issue may result in application crashes or arbitrary code
  execution in applications that process untrusted server responses, and it does not require
  authentication or user interaction.
