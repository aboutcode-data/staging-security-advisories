  - CVE-2025-4476
summary: A denial-of-service vulnerability has been identified in the libsoup HTTP client library.
  This flaw can be triggered when a libsoup client receives a 401 (Unauthorized) HTTP response
  containing a specifically crafted domain parameter within the WWW-Authenticate header. Processing
  this malformed header can lead to a crash of the client application using libsoup. An attacker
  could exploit this by setting up a malicious HTTP server. If a user's application using the
  vulnerable libsoup library connects to this malicious server, it could result in a denial-of-service.
  Successful exploitation requires tricking a user's client application into connecting to the
  attacker's malicious server.
