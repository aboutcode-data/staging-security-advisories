  - CVE-2024-56406
summary: A heap buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in Perl.   Release branches 5.34,
  5.36, 5.38 and 5.40 are affected, including development versions from 5.33.1 through 5.41.10.  When
  there are non-ASCII bytes in the left-hand-side of the `tr` operator, `S_do_trans_invmap`
  can overflow the destination pointer `d`.     $ perl -e '$_ = "\x{FF}" x 1000000; tr/\xFF/\x{100}/;'   
   Segmentation fault (core dumped)  It is believed that this vulnerability can enable Denial
  of Service and possibly Code Execution attacks on platforms that lack sufficient defenses.
