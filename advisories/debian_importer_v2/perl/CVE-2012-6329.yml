  - CVE-2012-6329
summary: The _compile function in Maketext.pm in the Locale::Maketext implementation in Perl
  before 5.17.7 does not properly handle backslashes and fully qualified method names during
  compilation of bracket notation, which allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary
  commands via crafted input to an application that accepts translation strings from users,
  as demonstrated by the TWiki application before 5.1.3, and the Foswiki application 1.0.x through
  1.0.10 and 1.1.x through 1.1.6.
