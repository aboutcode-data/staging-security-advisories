  - CVE-2023-47039
summary: A vulnerability was found in Perl. This security issue occurs while Perl for Windows
  relies on the system path environment variable to find the shell (`cmd.exe`). When running
  an executable that uses the Windows Perl interpreter, Perl attempts to find and execute `cmd.exe`
  within the operating system. However, due to path search order issues, Perl initially looks
  for cmd.exe in the current working directory. This flaw allows an attacker with limited privileges
  to place`cmd.exe` in locations with weak permissions, such as `C:\ProgramData`. By doing so,
  arbitrary code can be executed when an administrator attempts to use this executable from
  these compromised locations.
