  - CVE-2024-47072
summary: XStream is a simple library to serialize objects to XML and back again. This vulnerability
  may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error resulting
  in a denial of service only by manipulating the processed input stream when XStream is configured
  to use the BinaryStreamDriver. XStream 1.4.21 has been patched to detect the manipulation
  in the binary input stream causing the the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException
  instead. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may catch the StackOverflowError
  in the client code calling XStream if XStream is configured to use the BinaryStreamDriver.
