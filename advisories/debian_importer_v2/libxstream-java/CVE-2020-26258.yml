  - CVE-2020-26258
summary: XStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In XStream before
  version 1.4.15, a Server-Side Forgery Request vulnerability can be activated when unmarshalling.
  The vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to request data from internal resources that
  are not publicly available only by manipulating the processed input stream. If you rely on
  XStream's default blacklist of the Security Framework, you will have to use at least version
  1.4.15. The reported vulnerability does not exist if running Java 15 or higher. No user is
  affected who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's Security Framework with a whitelist!
  Anyone relying on XStream's default blacklist can immediately switch to a whilelist for the
  allowed types to avoid the vulnerability. Users of XStream 1.4.14 or below who still want
  to use XStream default blacklist can use a workaround described in more detailed in the referenced
  advisories.
