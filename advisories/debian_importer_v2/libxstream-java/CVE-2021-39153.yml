  - CVE-2021-39153
summary: XStream is a simple library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In affected
  versions this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary code
  from a remote host only by manipulating the processed input stream, if using the version out
  of the box with Java runtime version 14 to 8 or with JavaFX installed. No user is affected,
  who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited
  to the minimal required types. XStream 1.4.18 uses no longer a blacklist by default, since
  it cannot be secured for general purpose.
