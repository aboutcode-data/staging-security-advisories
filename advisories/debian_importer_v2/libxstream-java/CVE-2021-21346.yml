  - CVE-2021-21346
summary: XStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In XStream before
  version 1.4.16, there is a vulnerability which may allow a remote attacker to load and execute
  arbitrary code from a remote host only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user
  is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a
  whitelist limited to the minimal required types. If you rely on XStream's default blacklist
  of the Security Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.16.
