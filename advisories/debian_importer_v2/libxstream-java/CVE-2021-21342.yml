  - CVE-2021-21342
summary: XStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In XStream before
  version 1.4.16, there is a vulnerability where the processed stream at unmarshalling time
  contains type information to recreate the formerly written objects. XStream creates therefore
  new instances based on these type information. An attacker can manipulate the processed input
  stream and replace or inject objects, that result in a server-side forgery request. No user
  is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a
  whitelist limited to the minimal required types. If you rely on XStream's default blacklist
  of the Security Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.16.
