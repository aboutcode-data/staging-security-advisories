  - CVE-2019-13565
summary: An issue was discovered in OpenLDAP 2.x before 2.4.48. When using SASL authentication
  and session encryption, and relying on the SASL security layers in slapd access controls,
  it is possible to obtain access that would otherwise be denied via a simple bind for any identity
  covered in those ACLs. After the first SASL bind is completed, the sasl_ssf value is retained
  for all new non-SASL connections. Depending on the ACL configuration, this can affect different
  types of operations (searches, modifications, etc.). In other words, a successful authorization
  step completed by one user affects the authorization requirement for a different user.
