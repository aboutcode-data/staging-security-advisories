  - CVE-2019-13057
summary: An issue was discovered in the server in OpenLDAP before 2.4.48. When the server administrator
  delegates rootDN (database admin) privileges for certain databases but wants to maintain isolation
  (e.g., for multi-tenant deployments), slapd does not properly stop a rootDN from requesting
  authorization as an identity from another database during a SASL bind or with a proxyAuthz
  (RFC 4370) control. (It is not a common configuration to deploy a system where the server
  administrator and a DB administrator enjoy different levels of trust.)
