summary: libldap in certain third-party OpenLDAP packages has a certificate-validation flaw
  when the third-party package is asserting RFC6125 support. It considers CN even when there
  is a non-matching subjectAltName (SAN). This is fixed in, for example, openldap-2.4.46-10.el8
  in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
