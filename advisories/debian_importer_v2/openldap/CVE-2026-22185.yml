  - CVE-2026-22185
summary: OpenLDAP Lightning Memory-Mapped Database (LMDB) versions up to and including 0.9.14,
  prior to commit 8e1fda8, contain a heap buffer underflow in the readline() function of mdb_load.
  When processing malformed input containing an embedded NUL byte, an unsigned offset calculation
  can underflow and cause an out-of-bounds read of one byte before the allocated heap buffer.
  This can cause mdb_load to crash, leading to a limited denial-of-service condition.
