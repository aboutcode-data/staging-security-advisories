  - CVE-2017-14159
summary: slapd in OpenLDAP 2.4.45 and earlier creates a PID file after dropping privileges to
  a non-root account, which might allow local users to kill arbitrary processes by leveraging
  access to this non-root account for PID file modification before a root script executes a
  "kill `cat /pathname`" command, as demonstrated by openldap-initscript.
