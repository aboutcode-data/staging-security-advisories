aliases:
  - CVE-2009-3767
summary: libraries/libldap/tls_o.c in OpenLDAP 2.2 and 2.4, and possibly other versions, when
  OpenSSL is used, does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the subject's
  Common Name (CN) field of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to
  spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification
  Authority, a related issue to CVE-2009-2408.
