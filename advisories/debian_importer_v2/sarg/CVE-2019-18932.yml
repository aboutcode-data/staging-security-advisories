  - CVE-2019-18932
summary: log.c in Squid Analysis Report Generator (sarg) through 2.3.11 allows local privilege
  escalation. By default, it uses a fixed temporary directory /tmp/sarg. As the root user, sarg
  creates this directory or reuses an existing one in an insecure manner. An attacker can pre-create
  the directory, and place symlinks in it (after winning a /tmp/sarg/denied.int_unsort race
  condition). The outcome will be corrupted or newly created files in privileged file system
  locations.
