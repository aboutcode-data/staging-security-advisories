summary: 'lxc-user-nic when asked to delete a network interface will unconditionally open a
  user provided path. This code path may be used by an unprivileged user to check for the existence
  of a path which they wouldn''t otherwise be able to reach. It may also be used to trigger
  side effects by causing a (read-only) open of special kernel files (ptmx, proc, sys). Affected
