  - CVE-2019-5736
summary: 'runc through 1.0-rc6, as used in Docker before 18.09.2 and other products, allows
  attackers to overwrite the host runc binary (and consequently obtain host root access) by
  leveraging the ability to execute a command as root within one of these types of containers:
  (1) a new container with an attacker-controlled image, or (2) an existing container, to which
  the attacker previously had write access, that can be attached with docker exec. This occurs
  because of file-descriptor mishandling, related to /proc/self/exe.'
