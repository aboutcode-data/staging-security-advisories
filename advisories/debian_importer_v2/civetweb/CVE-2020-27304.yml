  - CVE-2020-27304
summary: The CivetWeb web library does not validate uploaded filepaths when running on an OS
  other than Windows, when using the built-in HTTP form-based file upload mechanism, via the
  mg_handle_form_request API. Web applications that use the file upload form handler, and use
  parts of the user-controlled filename in the output path, are susceptible to directory traversal
