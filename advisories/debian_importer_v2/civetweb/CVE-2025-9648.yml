aliases:
  - CVE-2025-9648
summary: A vulnerability in the CivetWeb library's function mg_handle_form_request allows remote
  attackers to trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition. By sending a specially crafted HTTP
  POST request containing a null byte in the payload, the server enters an infinite loop during
  form data parsing. Multiple malicious requests will result in complete CPU exhaustion and
  render the service unresponsive to further requests.  This issue was fixed in commit 782e189.
  This issue affects only the library, standalone executable pre-built by vendor is not affected.
