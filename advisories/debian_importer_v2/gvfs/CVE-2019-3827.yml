  - CVE-2019-3827
summary: An incorrect permission check in the admin backend in gvfs before version 1.39.4 was
  found that allows reading and modify arbitrary files by privileged users without asking for
  password when no authentication agent is running. This vulnerability can be exploited by malicious
  programs running under privileges of users belonging to the wheel group to further escalate
  its privileges by modifying system files without user's knowledge. Successful exploitation
  requires uncommon system configuration.
