summary: Atril Document Viewer is the default document reader of the MATE desktop environment
  for Linux. A path traversal and arbitrary file write vulnerability exists in versions of Atril
  prior to 1.26.2. This vulnerability is capable of writing arbitrary files anywhere on the
  filesystem to which the user opening a crafted document has access. The only limitation is
  that this vulnerability cannot be exploited to overwrite existing files, but that doesn't
  stop an attacker from achieving Remote Command Execution on the target system. Version 1.26.2
  of Atril contains a patch for this vulnerability.
