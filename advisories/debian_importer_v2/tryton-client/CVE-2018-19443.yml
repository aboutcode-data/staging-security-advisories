  - CVE-2018-19443
summary: The client in Tryton 5.x before 5.0.1 tries to make a connection to the bus in cleartext
  instead of encrypted under certain circumstances in bus.py and jsonrpc.py. This connection
  attempt fails, but it contains in the header the current session of the user. This session
  could then be stolen by a man-in-the-middle.
