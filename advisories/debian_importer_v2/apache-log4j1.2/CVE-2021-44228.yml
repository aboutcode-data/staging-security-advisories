  - CVE-2021-44228
summary: Apache Log4j2 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0 (excluding security releases 2.12.2, 2.12.3,
  and 2.3.1) JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect
  against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control
  log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers
  when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled
  by default. From version 2.16.0 (along with 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1), this functionality
  has been completely removed. Note that this vulnerability is specific to log4j-core and does
  not affect log4net, log4cxx, or other Apache Logging Services projects.
