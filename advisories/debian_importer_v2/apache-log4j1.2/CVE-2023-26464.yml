  - CVE-2023-26464
summary: '** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED **  When using the Chainsaw or SocketAppender components
  with Log4j 1.x on JRE less than 1.7, an attacker that manages to cause a logging entry involving
  a specially-crafted (ie, deeply nested)  hashmap or hashtable (depending on which logging
  component is in use) to be processed could exhaust the available memory in the virtual machine
  and achieve Denial of Service when the object is deserialized.  This issue affects Apache
  Log4j before 2. Affected users are recommended to update to Log4j 2.x.  NOTE: This vulnerability
  only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.'
