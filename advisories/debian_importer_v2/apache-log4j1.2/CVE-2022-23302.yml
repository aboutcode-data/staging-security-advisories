aliases:
  - CVE-2022-23302
summary: JMSSink in all versions of Log4j 1.x is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted
  data when the attacker has write access to the Log4j configuration or if the configuration
  references an LDAP service the attacker has access to. The attacker can provide a TopicConnectionFactoryBindingName
  configuration causing JMSSink to perform JNDI requests that result in remote code execution
  in a similar fashion to CVE-2021-4104. Note this issue only affects Log4j 1.x when specifically
  configured to use JMSSink, which is not the default. Apache Log4j 1.2 reached end of life
  in August 2015. Users should upgrade to Log4j 2 as it addresses numerous other issues from
  the previous versions.
