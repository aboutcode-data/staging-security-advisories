  - CVE-2021-4104
summary: JMSAppender in Log4j 1.2 is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data when the
  attacker has write access to the Log4j configuration. The attacker can provide TopicBindingName
  and TopicConnectionFactoryBindingName configurations causing JMSAppender to perform JNDI requests
  that result in remote code execution in a similar fashion to CVE-2021-44228. Note this issue
  only affects Log4j 1.2 when specifically configured to use JMSAppender, which is not the default.
  Apache Log4j 1.2 reached end of life in August 2015. Users should upgrade to Log4j 2 as it
  addresses numerous other issues from the previous versions.
