  - CVE-2015-4605
summary: The mcopy function in softmagic.c in file 5.x, as used in the Fileinfo component in
  PHP before 5.4.40, 5.5.x before 5.5.24, and 5.6.x before 5.6.8, does not properly restrict
  a certain offset value, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application
  crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted string that is mishandled by a "Python
  script text executable" rule.
