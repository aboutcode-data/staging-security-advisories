  - CVE-2014-9653
summary: readelf.c in file before 5.22, as used in the Fileinfo component in PHP before 5.4.37,
  5.5.x before 5.5.21, and 5.6.x before 5.6.5, does not consider that pread calls sometimes

  of service (uninitialized memory access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
  ELF file.
