  - CVE-2013-7345
summary: The BEGIN regular expression in the awk script detector in magic/Magdir/commands in
  file before 5.15 uses multiple wildcards with unlimited repetitions, which allows context-dependent
  attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted ASCII file that triggers
  a large amount of backtracking, as demonstrated via a file with many newline characters.
