summary: MooTools is a collection of JavaScript utilities for JavaScript developers. All known
  versions include a CSS selector parser that is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of
  Service (ReDoS). An attack requires that an attacker can inject a string into a CSS selector
  at runtime, which is quite common with e.g. jQuery CSS selectors. No patches are available
  for this issue.
