  - CVE-2012-3292
summary: The GridFTP in Globus Toolkit (GT) before 5.2.2, when certain autoconf macros are defined,
  does not properly check the return value from the getpwnam_r function, which might allow remote
  attackers to gain privileges by logging in with a user that does not exist, which causes GridFTP
  to run as the last user in the password file.
