  - CVE-2025-7394
summary: In the OpenSSL compatibility layer implementation, the function RAND_poll() was not
  behaving as expected and leading to the potential for predictable values returned from RAND_bytes()
  after fork() is called. This can lead to weak or predictable random numbers generated in applications
  that are both using RAND_bytes() and doing fork() operations. This only affects applications
  explicitly calling RAND_bytes() after fork() and does not affect any internal TLS operations.
  Although RAND_bytes() documentation in OpenSSL calls out not being safe for use with fork()
  without first calling RAND_poll(), an additional code change was also made in wolfSSL to make
  RAND_bytes() behave similar to OpenSSL after a fork() call without calling RAND_poll(). Now
  the Hash-DRBG used gets reseeded after detecting running in a new process. If making use of
  RAND_bytes() and calling fork() we recommend updating to the latest version of wolfSSL. Thanks
  to Per Allansson from Appgate for the report.
