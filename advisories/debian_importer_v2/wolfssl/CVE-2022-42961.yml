  - CVE-2022-42961
summary: An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 5.5.0. A fault injection attack on RAM via
  Rowhammer leads to ECDSA key disclosure. Users performing signing operations with private
  ECC keys, such as in server-side TLS connections, might leak faulty ECC signatures. These
  signatures can be processed via an advanced technique for ECDSA key recovery. (In 5.5.0 and
  later, WOLFSSL_CHECK_SIG_FAULTS can be used to address the vulnerability.)
