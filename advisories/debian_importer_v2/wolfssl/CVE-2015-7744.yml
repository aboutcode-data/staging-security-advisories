aliases:
  - CVE-2015-7744
summary: wolfSSL (formerly CyaSSL) before 3.6.8 does not properly handle faults associated with
  the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) process when allowing ephemeral key exchange without low
  memory optimizations on a server, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain private
  RSA keys by capturing TLS handshakes, aka a Lenstra attack.
