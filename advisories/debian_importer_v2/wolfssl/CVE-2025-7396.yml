  - CVE-2025-7396
summary: In wolfSSL release 5.8.2 blinding support is turned on by default for Curve25519 in
  applicable builds. The blinding configure option is only for the base C implementation of
  Curve25519. It is not needed, or available with; ARM assembly builds, Intel assembly builds,
  and the small Curve25519 feature. While the side-channel attack on extracting a private key
  would be very difficult to execute in practice, enabling blinding provides an additional layer
  of protection for devices that may be more susceptible to physical access or side-channel
  observation.
