aliases:
  - CVE-2024-5288
summary: An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 5.7.0. A safe-error attack via Rowhammer,
  namely FAULT+PROBE, leads to ECDSA key disclosure. When WOLFSSL_CHECK_SIG_FAULTS is used in
  signing operations with private ECC keys,  such as in server-side TLS connections, the connection
  is halted if any fault occurs. The success rate in a certain amount of connection requests
  can be processed via an advanced technique for ECDSA key recovery.
