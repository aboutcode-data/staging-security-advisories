  - CVE-2023-6935
summary: 'wolfSSL SP Math All RSA implementation is vulnerable to the Marvin Attack, new variation
  of a timing Bleichenbacher style attack, when built with the following options to configure:  --enable-all
  CFLAGS="-DWOLFSSL_STATIC_RSA"  The define “WOLFSSL_STATIC_RSA” enables static RSA cipher suites,
  which is not recommended, and has been disabled by default since wolfSSL 3.6.6.  Therefore
  the default build since 3.6.6, even with "--enable-all", is not vulnerable to the Marvin Attack.
  The vulnerability is specific to static RSA cipher suites, and expected to be padding-independent.  The
  vulnerability allows an attacker to decrypt ciphertexts and forge signatures after probing
  with a large number of test observations. However the server’s private key is not exposed.'
