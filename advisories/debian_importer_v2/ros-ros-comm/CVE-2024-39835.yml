summary: A code injection vulnerability has been identified in the Robot Operating System (ROS)
  'roslaunch' command-line tool, affecting ROS distributions Noetic Ninjemys and earlier. The
  vulnerability arises from the use of the eval() method to process user-supplied, unsanitized
  parameter values within the substitution args mechanism, which roslaunch evaluates before
  launching a node. This flaw allows attackers to craft and execute arbitrary Python code.
