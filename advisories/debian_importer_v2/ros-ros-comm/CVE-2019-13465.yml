  - CVE-2019-13465
summary: 'An issue was discovered in the ROS communications-related packages (aka ros_comm or
  ros-melodic-ros-comm) through 1.14.3. ROS_ASSERT_MSG only works when ROS_ASSERT_ENABLED is
  defined. This leads to a problem in the remove() function in clients/roscpp/src/libros/spinner.cpp.
  When ROS_ASSERT_ENABLED is not defined, the iterator loop will run out of the scope of the
  array, and cause denial of service for other components (that depend on the communication-related
  functions of this package). NOTE: The reporter of this issue now believes it was a false alarm.'
