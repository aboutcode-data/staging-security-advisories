aliases:
  - CVE-2006-0528
summary: 'The cairo library (libcairo), as used in GNOME Evolution and possibly other products,
  allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (persistent client crash) via an attached
  text file that contains "Content-Disposition: inline" in the header, and a very long line
  in the body, which causes the client to repeatedly crash until the e-mail message is manually
  removed, possibly due to a buffer overflow, as demonstrated using an XML attachment.'
