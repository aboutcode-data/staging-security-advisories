  - CVE-2022-23124
summary: This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected
  installations of Netatalk. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The
  specific flaw exists within the get_finderinfo method. The issue results from the lack of
  proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated
  buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute
  arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-15870.
