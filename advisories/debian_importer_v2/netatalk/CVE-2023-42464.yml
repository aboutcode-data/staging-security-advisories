  - CVE-2023-42464
summary: A Type Confusion vulnerability was found in the Spotlight RPC functions in afpd in
  Netatalk 3.1.x before 3.1.17. When parsing Spotlight RPC packets, one encoded data structure
  is a key-value style dictionary where the keys are character strings, and the values can be
  any of the supported types in the underlying protocol. Due to a lack of type checking in callers
  of the dalloc_value_for_key() function, which returns the object associated with a key, a
  malicious actor may be able to fully control the value of the pointer and theoretically achieve
  Remote Code Execution on the host. This issue is similar to CVE-2023-34967.
