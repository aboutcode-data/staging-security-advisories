aliases:
  - CVE-2023-7250
summary: A flaw was found in iperf, a utility for testing network performance using TCP, UDP,
  and SCTP. A malicious or malfunctioning client can send less than the expected amount of data
  to the iperf server, which can cause the server to hang indefinitely waiting for the remainder
  or until the connection gets closed. This will prevent other connections to the server, leading
  to a denial of service.
