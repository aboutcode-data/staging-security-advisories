  - CVE-2024-26146
summary: Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Carefully crafted headers can cause header
  parsing in Rack to take longer than expected resulting in a possible denial of service issue.
  Accept and Forwarded headers are impacted. Ruby 3.2 has mitigations for this problem, so Rack
  applications using Ruby 3.2 or newer are unaffected. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.0.9.4,
  2.1.4.4, 2.2.8.1, and 3.0.9.1.
