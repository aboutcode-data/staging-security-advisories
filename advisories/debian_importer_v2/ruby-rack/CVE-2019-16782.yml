  - CVE-2019-16782
summary: There's a possible information leak / session hijack vulnerability in Rack (RubyGem
  rack). This vulnerability is patched in versions 1.6.12 and 2.0.8. Attackers may be able to
  find and hijack sessions by using timing attacks targeting the session id. Session ids are
  usually stored and indexed in a database that uses some kind of scheme for speeding up lookups
  of that session id. By carefully measuring the amount of time it takes to look up a session,
  an attacker may be able to find a valid session id and hijack the session. The session id
  itself may be generated randomly, but the way the session is indexed by the backing store
  does not use a secure comparison.
