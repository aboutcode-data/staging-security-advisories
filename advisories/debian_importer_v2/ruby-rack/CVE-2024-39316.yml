  - CVE-2024-39316
summary: Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Starting in version 3.1.0 and prior to
  version 3.1.5, Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the `Rack::Request::Helpers`
  module when parsing HTTP Accept headers. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker
  sending specially crafted `Accept-Encoding` or `Accept-Language` headers, causing the server
  to spend excessive time processing the request and leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). The
  fix for CVE-2024-26146 was not applied to the main branch and thus while the issue was fixed
  for the Rack v3.0 release series, it was not fixed in the v3.1 release series until v3.1.5.
  Users of versions on the 3.1 branch should upgrade to version 3.1.5 to receive the fix.
