  - CVE-2025-49007
summary: Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Starting in version 3.1.0 and prior to
  version 3.1.16, there is a denial of service vulnerability in the Content-Disposition parsing
  component of Rack. This is very similar to the previous security issue CVE-2022-44571. Carefully
  crafted input can cause Content-Disposition header parsing in Rack to take an unexpected amount
  of time, possibly resulting in a denial of service attack vector. This header is used typically
  used in multipart parsing. Any applications that parse multipart posts using Rack (virtually
  all Rails applications) are impacted. Version 3.1.16 contains a patch for the vulnerability.
