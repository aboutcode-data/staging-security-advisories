summary: There is a denial of service vulnerability in the Content-Disposition parsingcomponent
  of Rack fixed in 2.0.9.2, 2.1.4.2, 2.2.4.1, 3.0.0.1. This could allow an attacker to craft
  an input that can cause Content-Disposition header parsing in Rackto take an unexpected amount

  used in multipartparsing. Any applications that parse multipart posts using Rack (virtuallyall
  Rails applications) are impacted.
