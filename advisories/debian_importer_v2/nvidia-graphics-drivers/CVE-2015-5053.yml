  - CVE-2015-5053
summary: The host memory mapping path feature in the NVIDIA GPU graphics driver R346 before
  346.87 and R352 before 352.41 for Linux and R352 before 352.46 for GRID vGPU and vSGA does
  not properly restrict access to third-party device IO memory, which allows attackers to gain
  privileges, cause a denial of service (resource consumption), or possibly have unspecified
  other impact via unknown vectors related to the follow_pfn kernel-mode API call.
