  - CVE-2021-33912
summary: libspf2 before 1.2.11 has a four-byte heap-based buffer overflow that might allow remote
  attackers to execute arbitrary code (via an unauthenticated e-mail message from anywhere on
  the Internet) with a crafted SPF DNS record, because of incorrect sprintf usage in SPF_record_expand_data
  in spf_expand.c. The vulnerable code may be part of the supply chain of a site's e-mail infrastructure
  (e.g., with additional configuration, Exim can use libspf2; the Postfix web site links to
  unofficial patches for use of libspf2 with Postfix; older versions of spfquery relied on libspf2)
  but most often is not.
