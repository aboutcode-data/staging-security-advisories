aliases:
  - CVE-2025-68119
summary: Downloading and building modules with malicious version strings can cause local code
  execution. On systems with Mercurial (hg) installed, downloading modules from non-standard
  sources (e.g., custom domains) can cause unexpected code execution due to how external VCS
  commands are constructed. This issue can also be triggered by providing a malicious version
  string to the toolchain. On systems with Git installed, downloading and building modules with
  malicious version strings can allow an attacker to write to arbitrary files on the filesystem.
  This can only be triggered by explicitly providing the malicious version strings to the toolchain
  and does not affect usage of @latest or bare module paths.
