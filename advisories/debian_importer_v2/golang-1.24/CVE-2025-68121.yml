  - CVE-2025-68121
summary: During session resumption in crypto/tls, if the underlying Config has its ClientCAs
  or RootCAs fields mutated between the initial handshake and the resumed handshake, the resumed
  handshake may succeed when it should have failed. This may happen when a user calls Config.Clone
  and mutates the returned Config, or uses Config.GetConfigForClient. This can cause a client
  to resume a session with a server that it would not have resumed with during the initial handshake,
  or cause a server to resume a session with a client that it would not have resumed with during
  the initial handshake.
