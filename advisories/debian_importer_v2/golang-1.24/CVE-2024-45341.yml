  - CVE-2024-45341
summary: A certificate with a URI which has a IPv6 address with a zone ID may incorrectly satisfy
  a URI name constraint that applies to the certificate chain. Certificates containing URIs
  are not permitted in the web PKI, so this only affects users of private PKIs which make use
  of URIs.
