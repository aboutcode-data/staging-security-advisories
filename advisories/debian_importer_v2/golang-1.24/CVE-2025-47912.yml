summary: 'The Parse function permits values other than IPv6 addresses to be included in square
  brackets within the host component of a URL. RFC 3986 permits IPv6 addresses to be included
  within the host component, enclosed within square brackets. For example: "http://[::1]/".
  IPv4 addresses and hostnames must not appear within square brackets. Parse did not enforce
  this requirement.'
