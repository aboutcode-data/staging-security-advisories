  - CVE-2025-61729
summary: Within HostnameError.Error(), when constructing an error string, there is no limit
  to the number of hosts that will be printed out. Furthermore, the error string is constructed
  by repeated string concatenation, leading to quadratic runtime. Therefore, a certificate provided
  by a malicious actor can result in excessive resource consumption.
