  - CVE-2024-11403
summary: There exists an out of bounds read/write in LibJXL versions prior to commit 9cc451b91b74ba470fd72bd48c121e9f33d24c99.
  The JPEG decoder used by the JPEG XL encoder when doing JPEG recompression (i.e. if using
  JxlEncoderAddJPEGFrame on untrusted input) does not properly check bounds in the presence
  of incomplete codes. This could lead to an out-of-bounds write. In jpegli which is released
  as part of the same project, the same vulnerability is present. However, the relevant buffer
  is part of a bigger structure, and the code makes no assumptions on the values that could
  be overwritten. The issue could however cause jpegli to read uninitialised memory, or addresses
  of functions.
