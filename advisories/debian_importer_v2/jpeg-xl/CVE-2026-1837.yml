  - CVE-2026-1837
summary: A specially-crafted file can cause libjxl's decoder to write pixel data to uninitialized
  unallocated memory. Soon after that data from another uninitialized unallocated region is
  copied to pixel data.  This can be done by requesting color transformation of grayscale images
  to another grayscale color space. Buffers allocated for 1-float-per-pixel are used as if they
  are allocated for 3-float-per-pixel. That happens only if LCMS2 is used as CMS engine. There
  is another CMS engine available (selected by build flags).
