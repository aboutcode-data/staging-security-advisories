summary: A specially-crafted file can cause libjxl's decoder to read pixel data from uninitialized
  (but allocated) memory.  This can be done by causing the decoder to reference an outside-image-bound
  area in a subsequent patches. An incorrect optimization causes the decoder to omit populating
  those areas.
