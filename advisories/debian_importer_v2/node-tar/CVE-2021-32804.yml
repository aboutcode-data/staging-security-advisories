  - CVE-2021-32804
summary: The npm package "tar" (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.1, 5.0.6, 4.4.14, and 3.3.2
  has a arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability due to insufficient absolute path sanitization.
  node-tar aims to prevent extraction of absolute file paths by turning absolute paths into
  relative paths when the `preservePaths` flag is not set to `true`. This is achieved by stripping
  the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc`
  would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. This logic was insufficient when file paths contained
  repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single
  path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the
  resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus
  allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2,
  4.4.14, 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating
  a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes
  entries with absolute paths. See referenced GitHub Advisory for details. Be aware of CVE-2021-32803
  which fixes a similar bug in later versions of tar.
