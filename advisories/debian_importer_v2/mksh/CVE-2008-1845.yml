aliases:
  - CVE-2008-1845
summary: The Korn shell (aka mksh) before R33d on MirOS (aka MirBSD) does not flush the tty's
  I/O when invoking mksh in a new terminal, which allows local users to gain privileges by opening
  a virtual terminal and entering command sequences, which might later be executed in opportunistic
  circumstances by a different user who launches mksh and specifies that terminal with the -T
  option.
