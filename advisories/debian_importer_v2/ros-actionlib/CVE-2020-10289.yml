aliases:
  - CVE-2020-10289
summary: Use of unsafe yaml load. Allows instantiation of arbitrary objects. The flaw itself
  is caused by an unsafe parsing of YAML values which happens whenever an action message is
  processed to be sent, and allows for the creation of Python objects. Through this flaw in
  the ROS core package of actionlib, an attacker with local or remote access can make the ROS
  Master, execute arbitrary code in Python form. Consider yaml.safe_load() instead. Located
  first in actionlib/tools/library.py:132. See links for more info on the bug.
