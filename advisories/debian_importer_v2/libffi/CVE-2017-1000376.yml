  - CVE-2017-1000376
summary: libffi requests an executable stack allowing attackers to more easily trigger arbitrary
  code execution by overwriting the stack. Please note that libffi is used by a number of other
  libraries. It was previously stated that this affects libffi version 3.2.1 but this appears
  to be incorrect. libffi prior to version 3.1 on 32 bit x86 systems was vulnerable, and upstream
  is believed to have fixed this issue in version 3.1.
