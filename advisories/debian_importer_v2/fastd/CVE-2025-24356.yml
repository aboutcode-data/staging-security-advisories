  - CVE-2025-24356
summary: fastd is a VPN daemon which tunnels IP packets and Ethernet frames over UDP. When receiving
  a data packet from an unknown IP address/port combination, fastd will assume that one of its
  connected peers has moved to a new address and initiate a reconnect by sending a handshake
  packet. This "fast reconnect" avoids having to wait for a session timeout (up to ~90s) until
  a new connection is established. Even a 1-byte UDP packet just containing the fastd packet
  type header can trigger a much larger handshake packet (~150 bytes of UDP payload). Including
  IPv4 and UDP headers, the resulting amplification factor is roughly 12-13. By sending data
  packets with a spoofed source address to fastd instances reachable on the internet, this amplification
  of UDP traffic might be used to facilitate a Distributed Denial of Service attack. This vulnerability
  is fixed in v23.
