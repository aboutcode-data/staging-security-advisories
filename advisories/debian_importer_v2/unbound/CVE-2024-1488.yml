aliases:
  - CVE-2024-1488
summary: A vulnerability was found in Unbound due to incorrect default permissions, allowing
  any process outside the unbound group to modify the unbound runtime configuration. If a process
  can connect over localhost to port 8953, it can alter the configuration of unbound.service.
  This flaw allows an unprivileged attacker to manipulate a running instance, potentially altering
  forwarders, allowing them to track all queries forwarded by the local resolver, and, in some
  cases, disrupting resolving altogether.
