summary: 'NLnet Labs Unbound version 1.18.0 up to and including version 1.19.1 contain a vulnerability
  that can cause denial of service by a certain code path that can lead to an infinite loop.
  Unbound 1.18.0 introduced a feature that removes EDE records from responses with size higher
  than the client''s advertised buffer size. Before removing all the EDE records however, it
  would try to see if trimming the extra text fields on those records would result in an acceptable
  size while still retaining the EDE codes. Due to an unchecked condition, the code that trims
  the text of the EDE records could loop indefinitely. This happens when Unbound would reply
  with attached EDE information on a positive reply and the client''s buffer size is smaller
  than the needed space to include EDE records. The vulnerability can only be triggered when
  the ''ede: yes'' option is used; non default configuration. From version 1.19.2 on, the code
  is fixed to avoid looping indefinitely.'
