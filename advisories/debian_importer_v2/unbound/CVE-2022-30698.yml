  - CVE-2022-30698
summary: NLnet Labs Unbound, up to and including version 1.16.1 is vulnerable to a novel type
  of the "ghost domain names" attack. The vulnerability works by targeting an Unbound instance.
  Unbound is queried for a subdomain of a rogue domain name. The rogue nameserver returns delegation
  information for the subdomain that updates Unbound's delegation cache. This action can be
  repeated before expiry of the delegation information by querying Unbound for a second level
  subdomain which the rogue nameserver provides new delegation information. Since Unbound is
  a child-centric resolver, the ever-updating child delegation information can keep a rogue
  domain name resolvable long after revocation. From version 1.16.2 on, Unbound checks the validity
  of parent delegation records before using cached delegation information.
