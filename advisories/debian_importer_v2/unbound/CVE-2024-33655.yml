summary: The DNS protocol in RFC 1035 and updates allows remote attackers to cause a denial
  of service (resource consumption) by arranging for DNS queries to be accumulated for seconds,
  such that responses are later sent in a pulsing burst (which can be considered traffic amplification
  in some cases), aka the "DNSBomb" issue.
