  - CVE-2025-5994
summary: A multi-vendor cache poisoning vulnerability named 'Rebirthday Attack' has been discovered
  in caching resolvers that support EDNS Client Subnet (ECS). Unbound is also vulnerable when
  compiled with ECS support, i.e., '--enable-subnet', AND configured to send ECS information
  along with queries to upstream name servers, i.e., at least one of the 'send-client-subnet',
  'client-subnet-zone' or 'client-subnet-always-forward' options is used. Resolvers supporting
  ECS need to segregate outgoing queries to accommodate for different outgoing ECS information.
  This re-opens up resolvers to a birthday paradox attack (Rebirthday Attack) that tries to
  match the DNS transaction ID in order to cache non-ECS poisonous replies.
