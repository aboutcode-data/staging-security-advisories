summary: GIMP ICNS File Parsing Heap-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.
  This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations
  of GIMP. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must
  visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing
  of ICNS files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied
  data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability
  to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-28530.
