  - CVE-2025-10923
summary: GIMP WBMP File Parsing Integer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability
  allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of GIMP. User
  interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
  page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of WBMP files.
  The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result
  in an integer overflow before allocating a buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability
  to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-27878.
