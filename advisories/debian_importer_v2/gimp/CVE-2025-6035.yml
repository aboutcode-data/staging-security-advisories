aliases:
  - CVE-2025-6035
summary: A flaw was found in GIMP. An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the GIMP "Despeckle"  plug-in.
  The issue occurs due to unchecked multiplication of image dimensions, such as width, height,
  and bytes-per-pixel (img_bpp), which can result in allocating insufficient memory and subsequently
  performing out-of-bounds writes. This issue could lead to heap corruption, a potential denial
  of service (DoS), or arbitrary code execution in certain scenarios.
