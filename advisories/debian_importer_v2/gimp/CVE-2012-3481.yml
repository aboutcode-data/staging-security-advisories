  - CVE-2012-3481
summary: 'Integer overflow in the ReadImage function in plug-ins/common/file-gif-load.c in the
  GIF image format plug-in in GIMP 2.8.x and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial
  of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted height and
  len properties in a GIF image file, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.  NOTE: some
  of these details are obtained from third party information.'
