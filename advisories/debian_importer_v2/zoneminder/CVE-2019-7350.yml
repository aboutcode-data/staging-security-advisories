  - CVE-2019-7350
summary: Session fixation exists in ZoneMinder through 1.32.3, as an attacker can fixate his
  own session cookies to the next logged-in user, thereby hijacking the victim's account. This
  occurs because a set of multiple cookies (between 3 and 5) is being generated when a user
  successfully logs in, and these sets overlap for successive logins.
