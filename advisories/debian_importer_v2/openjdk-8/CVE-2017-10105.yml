summary: 'Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: Deployment).
  Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u151, 7u141 and 8u131. Easily exploitable
  vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to
  compromise Java SE. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than
  the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update,
  insert or delete access to some of Java SE accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies
  to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or
  sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet)
  and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments,
  typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator).
  CVSS 3.0 Base Score 4.3 (Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).'
