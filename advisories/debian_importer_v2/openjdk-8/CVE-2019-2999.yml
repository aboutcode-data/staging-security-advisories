summary: 'Vulnerability in the Java SE product of Oracle Java SE (component: Javadoc). Supported
  versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u231, 8u221, 11.0.4 and 13. Difficult to exploit
  vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to
  compromise Java SE. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than
  the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java SE, attacks may significantly impact additional
  products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert
  or delete access to some of Java SE accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to
  a subset of Java SE accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments,
  typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets
  (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet)
  and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments,
  typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator).
  CVSS 3.0 Base Score 4.7 (Confidentiality and Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).'
