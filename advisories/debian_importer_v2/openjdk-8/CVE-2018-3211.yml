summary: 'Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent:
  Serviceability). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 8u182 and 11; Java SE Embedded:
  8u181. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with logon to the infrastructure
  where Java SE, Java SE Embedded executes to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful
  attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks
  of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized creation, deletion or modification access
  to critical data or all Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data as well as unauthorized
  access to critical data or complete access to all Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data.
  Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed
  Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted
  code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security.
  This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and
  run only trusted code (e.g. code installed by an administrator). This vulnerability can only
  be exploited when Java Usage Tracker functionality is being used. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 6.6
  (Confidentiality and Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).'
