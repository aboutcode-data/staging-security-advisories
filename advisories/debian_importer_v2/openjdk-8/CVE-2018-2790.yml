summary: 'Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent:
  Security). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u181, 7u171, 8u162 and 10; Java
  SE Embedded: 8u161. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with
  network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful
  attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks
  of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of
  Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments,
  typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets,
  that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the
  Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically
  in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator).
