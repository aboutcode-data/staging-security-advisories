aliases:
  - CVE-2015-2808
summary: The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, does not properly
  combine state data with key data during the initialization phase, which makes it easier for
  remote attackers to conduct plaintext-recovery attacks against the initial bytes of a stream
  by sniffing network traffic that occasionally relies on keys affected by the Invariance Weakness,
  and then using a brute-force approach involving LSB values, aka the "Bar Mitzvah" issue.
