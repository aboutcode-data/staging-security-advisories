  Deployment). The supported version that is affected is Java SE: 8u221; Java SE Embedded: 8u221.
  Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via
  multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human
  interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability
  can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Java SE, Java SE Embedded
  accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, Java SE Embedded
  accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients
  running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that
  load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java
  sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in
  servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS
  3.0 Base Score 4.2 (Confidentiality and Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).'
