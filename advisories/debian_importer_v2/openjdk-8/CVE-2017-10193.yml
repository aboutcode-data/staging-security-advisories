summary: 'Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent:
  Security). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u151, 7u141 and 8u131; Java
  SE Embedded: 8u131. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with
  network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful
  attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks
  of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, Java
  SE Embedded accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically
  in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load
  and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox
  for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers,
  that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base
  Score 3.1 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).'
