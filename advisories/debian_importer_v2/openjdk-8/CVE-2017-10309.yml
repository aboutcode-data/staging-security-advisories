  - CVE-2017-10309
summary: 'Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: Deployment).
  Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 8u144 and 9. Easily exploitable vulnerability
  allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java
  SE. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and
  while the vulnerability is in Java SE, attacks may significantly impact additional products.
  Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete
  access to some of Java SE accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset
  of Java SE accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial
  DOS) of Java SE. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients
  running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run
  untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for
  security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that
  load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score
  7.1 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L).'
