  as well as unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Java SE accessible
  data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed
  Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g.,
  code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability
  does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code
  (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 6.8 (Confidentiality and Integrity
  impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).'
