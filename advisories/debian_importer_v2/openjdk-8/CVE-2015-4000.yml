aliases:
  - CVE-2015-4000
summary: The TLS protocol 1.2 and earlier, when a DHE_EXPORT ciphersuite is enabled on a server
  but not on a client, does not properly convey a DHE_EXPORT choice, which allows man-in-the-middle
  attackers to conduct cipher-downgrade attacks by rewriting a ClientHello with DHE replaced
  by DHE_EXPORT and then rewriting a ServerHello with DHE_EXPORT replaced by DHE, aka the "Logjam"
  issue.
