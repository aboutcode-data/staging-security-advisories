summary: 'Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent:
  Libraries). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u131, 7u121 and 8u112; Java
  SE Embedded: 8u111. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with
  network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful
  attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks
  of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access
  to all Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java
  deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed
  Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and
  rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments,
  typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator).
  CVSS v3.0 Base Score 6.5 (Confidentiality impacts).'
