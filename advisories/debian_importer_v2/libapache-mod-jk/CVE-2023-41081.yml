summary: 'Important: Authentication Bypass CVE-2023-41081  The mod_jk component of Apache Tomcat
  Connectors in some circumstances, such as when a configuration included "JkOptions +ForwardDirectories"
  but the configuration did not       provide explicit mounts for all possible proxied requests,
  mod_jk would       use an implicit mapping and map the request to the first defined worker. Such
  an implicit mapping could result in the unintended exposure of the status worker and/or bypass
  security constraints configured in httpd. As of JK 1.2.49, the implicit mapping functionality
  has been removed and all mappings must now be via explicit configuration. Only mod_jk is affected by
  this issue. The ISAPI redirector is not affected.  This issue affects Apache Tomcat Connectors
  (mod_jk only): from 1.2.0 through 1.2.48.  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.2.49,
  which fixes the issue.  History 2023-09-13 Original advisory  2023-09-28 Updated summary'
