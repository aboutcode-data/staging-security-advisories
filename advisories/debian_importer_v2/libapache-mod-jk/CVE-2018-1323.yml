  - CVE-2018-1323
summary: The IIS/ISAPI specific code in the Apache Tomcat JK ISAPI Connector 1.2.0 to 1.2.42
  that normalised the requested path before matching it to the URI-worker map did not handle
  some edge cases correctly. If only a sub-set of the URLs supported by Tomcat were exposed
  via IIS, then it was possible for a specially constructed request to expose application functionality
  through the reverse proxy that was not intended for clients accessing Tomcat via the reverse
  proxy.
