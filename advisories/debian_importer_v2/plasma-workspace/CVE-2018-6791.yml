  - CVE-2018-6791
summary: An issue was discovered in soliduiserver/deviceserviceaction.cpp in KDE Plasma Workspace
  before 5.12.0. When a vfat thumbdrive that contains `` or $() in its volume label is plugged
  in and mounted through the device notifier, it's interpreted as a shell command, leading to
  a possibility of arbitrary command execution. An example of an offending volume label is "$(touch
  b)" -- this will create a file called b in the home folder.
