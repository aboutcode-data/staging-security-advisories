summary: 'Apache Traffic Server accepts characters that are not allowed for HTTP field names
  and forwards malformed requests to origin servers. This can be utilized for request smuggling
  and may also lead cache poisoning if the origin servers are vulnerable.  This issue affects
  Apache Traffic Server: from 8.0.0 through 8.1.10, from 9.0.0 through 9.2.4.  Users are recommended
  to upgrade to version 8.1.11 or 9.2.5, which fixes the issue.'
