  - CVE-2025-64718
summary: js-yaml is a JavaScript YAML parser and dumper. In js-yaml before 4.1.1 and 3.14.2,
  it's possible for an attacker to modify the prototype of the result of a parsed yaml document
  via prototype pollution (`__proto__`). All users who parse untrusted yaml documents may be
  impacted. The problem is patched in js-yaml 4.1.1 and 3.14.2. Users can protect against this
  kind of attack on the server by using `node --disable-proto=delete` or `deno` (in Deno, pollution
  protection is on by default).
