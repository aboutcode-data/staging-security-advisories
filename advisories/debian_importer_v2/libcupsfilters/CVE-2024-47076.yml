  - CVE-2024-47076
summary: CUPS is a standards-based, open-source printing system, and `libcupsfilters` contains
  the code of the filters of the former `cups-filters` package as library functions to be used
  for the data format conversion tasks needed in Printer Applications. The `cfGetPrinterAttributes5`
  function in `libcupsfilters` does not sanitize IPP attributes returned from an IPP server.
  When these IPP attributes are used, for instance, to generate a PPD file, this can lead to
  attacker controlled data to be provided to the rest of the CUPS system.
