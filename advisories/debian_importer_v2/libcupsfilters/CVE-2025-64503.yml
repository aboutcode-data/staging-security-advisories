summary: cups-filters contains backends, filters, and other software required to get the cups
  printing service working on operating systems other than macos. In cups-filters prior to 1.28.18,
  by crafting a PDF file with a large `MediaBox` value, an attacker can cause CUPS-Filter 1.x’s
  `pdftoraster` tool to write beyond the bounds of an array. First, a PDF with a large `MediaBox`
  width value causes `header.cupsWidth` to become large.  Next, the calculation of `bytesPerLine
  = (header.cupsBitsPerPixel * header.cupsWidth + 7) / 8` overflows, resulting in a small value.
  Then, `lineBuf` is allocated with the small `bytesPerLine` size. Finally, `convertLineChunked`
  calls `writePixel8`, which attempts to write to `lineBuf` outside of its buffer size (out
  of bounds write). In libcupsfilters, the maintainers found the same `bytesPerLine` multiplication
  without overflow check, but the provided test case does not cause an overflow there, because
  the values are different. Commit 50d94ca0f2fa6177613c97c59791bde568631865 contains a patch,
  which is incorporated into cups-filters version 1.28.18.
