  - CVE-2007-1267
summary: Sylpheed 2.2.7 and earlier does not properly use the --status-fd argument when invoking
  GnuPG, which prevents Sylpheed from visually distinguishing between signed and unsigned portions
  of OpenPGP messages with multiple components, which allows remote attackers to forge the contents
  of a message without detection.
