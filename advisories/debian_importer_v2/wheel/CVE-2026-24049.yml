  - CVE-2026-24049
summary: wheel is a command line tool for manipulating Python wheel files, as defined in PEP
  427. In versions 0.40.0 through 0.46.1, the unpack function is vulnerable to file permission
  modification through mishandling of file permissions after extraction. The logic blindly trusts
  the filename from the archive header for the chmod operation, even though the extraction process
  itself might have sanitized the path. Attackers can craft a malicious wheel file that, when
  unpacked, changes the permissions of critical system files (e.g., /etc/passwd, SSH keys, config
  files), allowing for Privilege Escalation or arbitrary code execution by modifying now-writable
  scripts. This issue has been fixed in version 0.46.2.
