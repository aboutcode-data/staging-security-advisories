  - CVE-2024-21510
summary: Versions of the package sinatra from 0.0.0 are vulnerable to Reliance on Untrusted
  Inputs in a Security Decision via the X-Forwarded-Host (XFH) header. When making a request
  to a method with redirect applied, it is possible to trigger an Open Redirect Attack by inserting
  an arbitrary address into this header. If used for caching purposes, such as with servers
  like Nginx, or as a reverse proxy, without handling the X-Forwarded-Host header, attackers
  can potentially exploit Cache Poisoning or Routing-based SSRF.
