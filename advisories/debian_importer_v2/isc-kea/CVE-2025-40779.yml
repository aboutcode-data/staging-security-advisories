  - CVE-2025-40779
summary: If a DHCPv4 client sends a request with some specific options, and Kea fails to find
  an appropriate subnet for the client, the `kea-dhcp4` process will abort with an assertion
  failure.  This happens only if the client request is unicast directly to Kea; broadcast messages
  do not cause the problem. This issue affects Kea versions 2.7.1 through 2.7.9, 3.0.0, and
  3.1.0.
