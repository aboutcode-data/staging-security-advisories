  - CVE-2013-4509
summary: The default configuration of IBUS 1.5.4, and possibly 1.5.2 and earlier, when IBus.InputPurpose.PASSWORD
  is not set and used with GNOME 3, does not obscure the entered password characters, which
  allows physically proximate attackers to obtain a user password by reading the lockscreen.
