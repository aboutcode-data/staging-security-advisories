  - CVE-2020-15157
summary: In containerd (an industry-standard container runtime) before version 1.2.14 there
  is a credential leaking vulnerability. If a container image manifest in the OCI Image format
  or Docker Image V2 Schema 2 format includes a URL for the location of a specific image layer
  (otherwise known as a “foreign layer”), the default containerd resolver will follow that URL
  to attempt to download it. In v1.2.x but not 1.3.0 or later, the default containerd resolver
  will provide its authentication credentials if the server where the URL is located presents
  an HTTP 401 status code along with registry-specific HTTP headers. If an attacker publishes
  a public image with a manifest that directs one of the layers to be fetched from a web server
  they control and they trick a user or system into pulling the image, they can obtain the credentials
  used for pulling that image. In some cases, this may be the user's username and password for
  the registry. In other cases, this may be the credentials attached to the cloud virtual instance
  which can grant access to other cloud resources in the account. The default containerd resolver
  is used by the cri-containerd plugin (which can be used by Kubernetes), the ctr development
  tool, and other client programs that have explicitly linked against it. This vulnerability
  has been fixed in containerd 1.2.14. containerd 1.3 and later are not affected. If you are
  using containerd 1.3 or later, you are not affected. If you are using cri-containerd in the
  1.2 series or prior, you should ensure you only pull images from trusted sources. Other container
  runtimes built on top of containerd but not using the default resolver (such as Docker) are
  not affected.
