  - CVE-2024-40635
summary: containerd is an open-source container runtime. A bug was found in containerd prior
  to versions 1.6.38, 1.7.27, and 2.0.4 where containers launched with a User set as a `UID:GID`
  larger than the maximum 32-bit signed integer can cause an overflow condition where the container
  ultimately runs as root (UID 0). This could cause unexpected behavior for environments that
  require containers to run as a non-root user. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.38,
  1.7.27, and 2.04. As a workaround, ensure that only trusted images are used and that only
  trusted users have permissions to import images.
