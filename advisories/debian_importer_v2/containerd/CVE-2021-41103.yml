  - CVE-2021-41103
summary: containerd is an open source container runtime with an emphasis on simplicity, robustness
  and portability. A bug was found in containerd where container root directories and some plugins
  had insufficiently restricted permissions, allowing otherwise unprivileged Linux users to
  traverse directory contents and execute programs. When containers included executable programs
  with extended permission bits (such as setuid), unprivileged Linux users could discover and
  execute those programs. When the UID of an unprivileged Linux user on the host collided with
  the file owner or group inside a container, the unprivileged Linux user on the host could
  discover, read, and modify those files. This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.4.11
  and containerd 1.5.7. Users should update to these version when they are released and may
  restart containers or update directory permissions to mitigate the vulnerability. Users unable
  to update should limit access to the host to trusted users. Update directory permission on
  container bundles directories.
