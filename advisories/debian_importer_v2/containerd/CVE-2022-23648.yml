  - CVE-2022-23648
summary: containerd is a container runtime available as a daemon for Linux and Windows. A bug
  was found in containerd prior to versions 1.6.1, 1.5.10, and 1.14.12 where containers launched
  through containerd’s CRI implementation on Linux with a specially-crafted image configuration
  could gain access to read-only copies of arbitrary files and directories on the host. This
  may bypass any policy-based enforcement on container setup (including a Kubernetes Pod Security
  Policy) and expose potentially sensitive information. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured
  to use containerd’s CRI implementation. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.1, 1.5.10,
  and 1.4.12. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue.
