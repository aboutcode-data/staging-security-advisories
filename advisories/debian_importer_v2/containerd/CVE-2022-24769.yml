summary: Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable and accelerate software
  containerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) prior to version 20.10.14 where
  containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities,
  creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities
  to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during `execve(2)`. Normally, when executable
  programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise unprivileged users and processes
  can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities up to the bounding set.
  Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities
  allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable
  file capabilities up to the container's bounding set. Containers which use Linux users and
  groups to perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted. This
  bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more
  capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in
  Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.14. Running containers should be stopped, deleted, and recreated
  for the inheritable capabilities to be reset. This fix changes Moby (Docker Engine) behavior
  such that containers are started with a more typical Linux environment. As a workaround, the
  entry point of a container can be modified to use a utility like `capsh(1)` to drop inheritable
  capabilities prior to the primary process starting.
