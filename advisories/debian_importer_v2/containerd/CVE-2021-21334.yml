aliases:
  - CVE-2021-21334
summary: In containerd (an industry-standard container runtime) before versions 1.3.10 and 1.4.4,
  containers launched through containerd's CRI implementation (through Kubernetes, crictl, or
  any other pod/container client that uses the containerd CRI service) that share the same image
  may receive incorrect environment variables, including values that are defined for other containers.
  If the affected containers have different security contexts, this may allow sensitive information
  to be unintentionally shared. If you are not using containerd's CRI implementation (through
  one of the mechanisms described above), you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not
  launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image which have different
  environment variables, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple
  containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image in rapid succession, you have reduced likelihood
  of being vulnerable to this issue This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.10 and
  containerd 1.4.4. Users should update to these versions.
