  - CVE-2023-38697
summary: 'protocol-http1 provides a low-level implementation of the HTTP/1 protocol. RFC 9112
  Section 7.1 defined the format of chunk size, chunk data and chunk extension. The value of
  Content-Length header should be a string of 0-9 digits, the chunk size should be a string
  of hex digits and should split from chunk data using CRLF, and the chunk extension shouldn''t
  contain any invisible character. However, Falcon has following behaviors while disobey the
  corresponding RFCs: accepting Content-Length header values that have `+` prefix, accepting
  Content-Length header values that written in hexadecimal with `0x` prefix, accepting `0x`
  and `+` prefixed chunk size, and accepting LF in chunk extension. This behavior can lead to
  desync when forwarding through multiple HTTP parsers, potentially results in HTTP request
  smuggling and firewall bypassing. This issue is fixed in `protocol-http1` v0.15.1. There are
  no known workarounds.'
