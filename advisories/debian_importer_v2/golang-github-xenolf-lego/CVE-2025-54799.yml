summary: Let's Encrypt client and ACME library written in Go (Lego). In versions 4.25.1 and
  below, the github.com/go-acme/lego/v4/acme/api package (thus the lego library and the lego
  cli as well) don't enforce HTTPS when talking to CAs as an ACME client. Unlike the http-01
  challenge which solves an ACME challenge over unencrypted HTTP, the ACME protocol requires
  HTTPS when a client communicates with the CA to performs ACME functions. However, the library
  fails to enforce HTTPS both in the original discover URL (configured by the library user)
  and in the subsequent addresses returned by the CAs in the directory and order objects. If
  users input HTTP URLs or CAs misconfigure endpoints, protocol operations occur over HTTP instead
  of HTTPS. This compromises privacy by exposing request/response details like account and request
  identifiers to network attackers. This was fixed in version 4.25.2.
