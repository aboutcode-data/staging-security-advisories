summary: 'pypdf is a free and open-source pure-python PDF library. Prior to version 6.7.4, an
  attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to large memory usage. This
  requires parsing the content stream using the RunLengthDecode filter. This has been fixed
  in pypdf 6.7.4. As a workaround, consider applying the changes from PR #3664.'
