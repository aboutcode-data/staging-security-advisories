  - CVE-2024-42353
summary: WebOb provides objects for HTTP requests and responses. When WebOb normalizes the HTTP
  Location header to include the request hostname, it does so by parsing the URL that the user
  is to be redirected to with Python's urlparse, and joining it to the base URL. `urlparse`
  however treats a `//` at the start of a string as a URI without a scheme, and then treats
  the next part as the hostname. `urljoin` will then use that hostname from the second part
  as the hostname replacing the original one from the request. This vulnerability is patched
  in WebOb version 1.8.8.
