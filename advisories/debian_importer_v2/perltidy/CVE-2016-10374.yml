  - CVE-2016-10374
summary: perltidy through 20160302, as used by perlcritic, check-all-the-things, and other software,
  relies on the current working directory for certain output files and does not have a symlink-attack
  protection mechanism, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files by creating a
  symlink, as demonstrated by creating a perltidy.ERR symlink that the victim cannot delete.
