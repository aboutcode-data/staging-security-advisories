summary: Vim is an open source, command line text editor. Vim is distributed with the tar.vim
  plugin, that allows easy editing and viewing of (compressed or uncompressed) tar files. Starting
  with 9.1.0858, the tar.vim plugin uses the ":read" ex command line to append below the cursor
  position, however the is not sanitized and is taken literally from the tar archive. This allows
  to execute shell commands via special crafted tar archives. Whether this really happens, depends
  on the shell being used ('shell' option, which is set using $SHELL). The issue has been fixed
  as of Vim patch v9.1.1164
