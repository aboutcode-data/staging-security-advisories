  - CVE-2023-48232
summary: Vim is an open source command line text editor. A floating point exception may occur
  when calculating the line offset for overlong lines and smooth scrolling is enabled and the
  cpo-settings include the 'n' flag. This may happen when a window border is present and when
  the wrapped line continues on the next physical line directly in the window border because
  the 'cpo' setting includes the 'n' flag. Only users with non-default settings are affected
  and the exception should only result in a crash. This issue has been addressed in commit `cb0b99f0`
  which has been included in release version 9.0.2107. Users are advised to upgrade. There are
  no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
