summary: Vim is an open source, command line text editor. Versions prior to 9.2.0077 have a
  heap-buffer-overflow and a segmentation fault (SEGV) exist in Vim's swap file recovery logic.
  Both are caused by unvalidated fields read from crafted pointer blocks within a swap file.
  Version 9.2.0077 fixes the issue.
