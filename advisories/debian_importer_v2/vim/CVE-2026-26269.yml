  - CVE-2026-26269
summary: Vim is an open source, command line text editor. Prior to 9.1.2148, a stack buffer
  overflow vulnerability exists in Vim's NetBeans integration when processing the specialKeys
  command, affecting Vim builds that enable and use the NetBeans feature. The Stack buffer overflow
  exists in special_keys() (in src/netbeans.c). The while (*tok) loop writes two bytes per iteration
  into a 64-byte stack buffer (keybuf) with no bounds check. A malicious NetBeans server can
  overflow keybuf with a single specialKeys command. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch
  v9.1.2148.
