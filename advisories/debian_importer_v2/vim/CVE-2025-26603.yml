  - CVE-2025-26603
summary: Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi. Vim allows to redirect
  screen messages using the `:redir` ex command to register, variables and files. It also allows
  to show the contents of registers using the `:registers` or `:display` ex command. When redirecting
  the output of `:display` to a register, Vim will free the register content before storing
  the new content in the register. Now when redirecting the `:display` command to a register
  that is being displayed, Vim will free the content while shortly afterwards trying to access
  it, which leads to a use-after-free. Vim pre 9.1.1115 checks in the ex_display() function,
  that it does not try to redirect to a register while displaying this register at the same
  time. However this check is not complete, and so Vim does not check the `+` and `*` registers
  (which typically donate the X11/clipboard registers, and when a clipboard connection is not
  possible will fall back to use register 0 instead. In Patch 9.1.1115 Vim will therefore skip
  outputting to register zero when trying to redirect to the clipboard registers `*` or `+`.
  Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
