summary: Vim is an open source, command line text editor. Prior to version 9.2.0073, an OS command
  injection vulnerability exists in the `netrw` standard plugin bundled with Vim. By inducing
  a user to open a crafted URL (e.g., using the `scp://` protocol handler), an attacker can
  execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the Vim process. Version 9.2.0073
  fixes the issue.
