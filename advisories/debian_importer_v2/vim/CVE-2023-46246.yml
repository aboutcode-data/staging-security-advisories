summary: Vim is an improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi. Heap-use-after-free in memory
  allocated in the function `ga_grow_inner` in in the file `src/alloc.c` at line 748, which
  is freed in the file `src/ex_docmd.c` in the function `do_cmdline` at line 1010 and then used
  again in `src/cmdhist.c` at line 759. When using the `:history` command, it's possible that
  the provided argument overflows the accepted value. Causing an Integer Overflow and potentially
  later an use-after-free. This vulnerability has been patched in version 9.0.2068.
