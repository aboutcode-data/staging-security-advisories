  - CVE-2025-55157
summary: Vim is an open source, command line text editor. In versions from 9.1.1231 to before
  9.1.1400, When processing nested tuples in Vim script, an error during evaluation can trigger
  a use-after-free in Vim’s internal tuple reference management. Specifically, the tuple_unref()
  function may access already freed memory due to improper lifetime handling, leading to memory
  corruption. The exploit requires direct user interaction, as the script must be explicitly
  executed within Vim. This issue has been patched in version 9.1.1400.
