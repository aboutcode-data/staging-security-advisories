  - CVE-2023-48706
summary: Vim is a UNIX editor that, prior to version 9.0.2121, has a heap-use-after-free vulnerability.
  When executing a `:s` command for the very first time and using a sub-replace-special atom
  inside the substitution part, it is possible that the recursive `:s` call causes free-ing
  of memory which may later then be accessed by the initial `:s` command. The user must intentionally
  execute the payload and the whole process is a bit tricky to do since it seems to work only
  reliably for the very first :s command. It may also cause a crash of Vim. Version 9.0.2121
  contains a fix for this issue.
