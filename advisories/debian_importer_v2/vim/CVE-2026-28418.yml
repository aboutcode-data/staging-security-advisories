summary: Vim is an open source, command line text editor. Prior to version 9.2.0074, a heap-based
  buffer overflow out-of-bounds read exists in Vim's Emacs-style tags file parsing logic. When
  processing a malformed tags file, Vim can be tricked into reading up to 7 bytes beyond the
  allocated memory boundary. Version 9.2.0074 fixes the issue.
