aliases:
  - CVE-2008-3074
summary: 'The shellescape function in Vim 7.0 through 7.2, including 7.2a.10, allows user-assisted
  attackers to execute arbitrary code via the "!" (exclamation point) shell metacharacter in
  (1) the filename of a tar archive and possibly (2) the filename of the first file in a tar
  archive, which is not properly handled by the VIM TAR plugin (tar.vim) v.10 through v.22,
  as demonstrated by the shellescape, tarplugin.v2, tarplugin, and tarplugin.updated test cases.  NOTE:
  this issue reportedly exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2008-2712. NOTE: this issue
  has the same root cause as CVE-2008-3075.  NOTE: due to the complexity of the associated disclosures
  and the incomplete information related to them, there may be inaccuracies in this CVE description
  and in external mappings to this identifier.'
