  - CVE-2024-47814
summary: Vim is an open source, command line text editor. A use-after-free was found in Vim
  < 9.1.0764. When closing a buffer (visible in a window) a BufWinLeave auto command can cause
  an use-after-free if this auto command happens to re-open the same buffer in a new split window.
  Impact is low since the user must have intentionally set up such a strange auto command and
  run some buffer unload commands. However this may lead to a crash. This issue has been addressed
  in version 9.1.0764 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for
  this vulnerability.
