  - CVE-2023-48233
summary: Vim is an open source command line text editor. If the count after the :s command is
  larger than what fits into a (signed) long variable, abort with e_value_too_large. Impact
  is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This
  issue has been addressed in commit `ac6378773` which has been included in release version
  9.0.2108. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
