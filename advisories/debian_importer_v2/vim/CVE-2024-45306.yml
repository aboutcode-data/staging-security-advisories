summary: Vim is an open source, command line text editor. Patch v9.1.0038 optimized how the
  cursor position is calculated and removed a loop, that verified that the cursor position always
  points inside a line and does not become invalid by pointing beyond the end of a line. Back
  then we assumed this loop is unnecessary. However, this change made it possible that the cursor
  position stays invalid and points beyond the end of a line, which would eventually cause a
  heap-buffer-overflow when trying to access the line pointer at the specified cursor position.
  It's not quite clear yet, what can lead to this situation that the cursor points to an invalid
  position. That's why patch v9.1.0707 does not include a test case. The only observed impact
  has been a program crash. This issue has been addressed in with the patch v9.1.0707. All users
  are advised to upgrade.
