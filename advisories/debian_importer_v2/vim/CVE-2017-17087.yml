aliases:
  - CVE-2017-17087
summary: fileio.c in Vim prior to 8.0.1263 sets the group ownership of a .swp file to the editor's
  primary group (which may be different from the group ownership of the original file), which
  allows local users to obtain sensitive information by leveraging an applicable group membership,
  as demonstrated by /etc/shadow owned by root:shadow mode 0640, but /etc/.shadow.swp owned
  by root:users mode 0640, a different vulnerability than CVE-2017-1000382.
