summary: Vim is an open source, command line text editor. A segmentation fault was found in
  Vim before 9.1.1043. In silent Ex mode (-s -e), Vim typically doesn't show a screen and just
  operates silently in batch mode. However, it is still possible to trigger the function that
  handles the scrolling of a gui version of Vim by feeding some binary characters to Vim. The
  function that handles the scrolling however may be triggering a redraw, which will access
  the ScreenLines pointer, even so this variable hasn't been allocated (since there is no screen).
  This vulnerability is fixed in 9.1.1043.
