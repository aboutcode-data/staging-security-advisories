  - CVE-2008-3294
summary: src/configure.in in Vim 5.0 through 7.1, when used for a build with Python support,
  does not ensure that the Makefile-conf temporary file has the intended ownership and permissions,
  which allows local users to execute arbitrary code by modifying this file during a time window,
  or by creating it ahead of time with permissions that prevent its modification by configure.
