summary: 'Vim 7.1.314, 6.4, and other versions allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute
  arbitrary commands via Vim scripts that do not properly sanitize inputs before invoking the
  execute or system functions, as demonstrated using (1) filetype.vim, (3) xpm.vim, (4) gzip_vim,
  and (5) netrw.  NOTE: the originally reported version was 7.1.314, but the researcher actually
  found this set of issues in 7.1.298.  NOTE: the zipplugin issue (originally vector 2 in this
  identifier) has been subsumed by CVE-2008-3075.'
