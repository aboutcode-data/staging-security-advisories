summary: 'autoload/netrw.vim (aka the Netrw Plugin) 109, 131, and other versions before 133k
  for Vim 7.1.266, other 7.1 versions, and 7.2 stores credentials for an FTP session, and sends
  those credentials when attempting to establish subsequent FTP sessions to servers on different
  hosts, which allows remote FTP servers to obtain sensitive information in opportunistic circumstances
  by logging usernames and passwords.  NOTE: the upstream vendor disputes a vector involving
  different ports on the same host, stating "I''m assuming that they''re using the same id and
  password on that unchanged hostname, deliberately."'
