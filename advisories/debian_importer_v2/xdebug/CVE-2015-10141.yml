  - CVE-2015-10141
summary: An unauthenticated OS command injection vulnerability exists within Xdebug versions
  2.5.5 and earlier, a PHP debugging extension developed by Derick Rethans. When remote debugging
  is enabled, Xdebug listens on port 9000 and accepts debugger protocol commands without authentication.
  An attacker can send a crafted eval command over this interface to execute arbitrary PHP code,
  which may invoke system-level functions such as system() or passthru(). This results in full
  compromise of the host under the privileges of the web server user.
