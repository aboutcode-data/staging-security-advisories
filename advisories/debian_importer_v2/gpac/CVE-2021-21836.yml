  - CVE-2021-21836
summary: An exploitable integer overflow vulnerability exists within the MPEG-4 decoding functionality
  of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content library v1.0.1. A specially crafted MPEG-4 input using
  the “ctts” FOURCC code can cause an integer overflow due to unchecked arithmetic resulting
  in a heap-based buffer overflow that causes memory corruption. An attacker can convince a
  user to open a video to trigger this vulnerability.
