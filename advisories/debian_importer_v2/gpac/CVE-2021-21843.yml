  - CVE-2021-21843
summary: Multiple exploitable integer overflow vulnerabilities exist within the MPEG-4 decoding
  functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content library v1.0.1. A specially crafted
  MPEG-4 input can cause an integer overflow due to unchecked arithmetic resulting in a heap-based
  buffer overflow that causes memory corruption. After validating the number of ranges, at [41]
  the library will multiply the count by the size of the GF_SubsegmentRangeInfo structure. On
  a 32-bit platform, this multiplication can result in an integer overflow causing the space
  of the array being allocated to be less than expected. An attacker can convince a user to
  open a video to trigger this vulnerability.
