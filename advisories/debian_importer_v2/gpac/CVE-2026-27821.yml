  - CVE-2026-27821
summary: GPAC is an open-source multimedia framework. In versions up to and including 26.02.0,
  a stack buffer overflow occurs during NHML file parsing in `src/filters/dmx_nhml.c`. The value
  of the xmlHeaderEnd XML attribute is copied from att->value into szXmlHeaderEnd[1000] using
  strcpy() without any length validation. If the input exceeds 1000 bytes, it overwrites beyond
  the stack buffer boundary. Commit 9bd7137fded2db40de61a2cf3045812c8741ec52 patches the issue.
