aliases:
  - CVE-2021-3978
summary: When copying files with rsync, octorpki uses the "-a" flag 0, which forces rsync to
  copy binaries with the suid bit set as root. Since the provided service definition defaults
  to root ( https://github.com/cloudflare/cfrpki/blob/master/package/octorpki.service ) this
  could allow for a vector, when combined with another vulnerability that causes octorpki to
  process a malicious TAL file, for a local privilege escalation.
