  - CVE-2021-43174
summary: NLnet Labs Routinator versions 0.9.0 up to and including 0.10.1, support the gzip transfer
  encoding when querying RRDP repositories. This encoding can be used by an RRDP repository
  to cause an out-of-memory crash in these versions of Routinator. RRDP uses XML which allows
  arbitrary amounts of white space in the encoded data. The gzip scheme compresses such white
  space extremely well, leading to very small compressed files that become huge when being decompressed
  for further processing, big enough that Routinator runs out of memory when parsing input data
  waiting for the next XML element.
