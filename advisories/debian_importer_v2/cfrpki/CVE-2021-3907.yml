aliases:
  - CVE-2021-3907
summary: OctoRPKI does not escape a URI with a filename containing "..", this allows a repository
  to create a file, (ex. rsync://example.org/repo/../../etc/cron.daily/evil.roa), which would
  then be written to disk outside the base cache folder. This could allow for remote code execution
  on the host machine OctoRPKI is running on.
