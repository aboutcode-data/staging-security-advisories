  - CVE-2023-51589
summary: BlueZ Audio Profile AVRCP parse_media_element Out-Of-Bounds Read Information Disclosure
  Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to disclose sensitive
  information via Bluetooth on affected installations of BlueZ. User interaction is required
  to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must connect to a malicious device.  The
  specific flaw exists within the handling of the AVRCP protocol. The issue results from the
  lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of
  an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities
  to execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-20853.
