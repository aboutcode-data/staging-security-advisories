summary: BlueZ OBEX Library Out-Of-Bounds Read Information Disclosure Vulnerability. This vulnerability
  allows network-adjacent attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations
  of BlueZ. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must
  connect to a malicious Bluetooth device.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of
  OBEX protocol parameters. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied
  data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage
  this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of
  root. Was ZDI-CAN-20937.
