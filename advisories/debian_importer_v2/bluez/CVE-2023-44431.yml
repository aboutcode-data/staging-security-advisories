summary: BlueZ Audio Profile AVRCP Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.
  This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code via Bluetooth
  on affected installations of BlueZ. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability
  in that the target must connect to a malicious device.  The specific flaw exists within the
  handling of the AVRCP protocol. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the
  length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An
  attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-19909.
