summary: BlueZ Phone Book Access Profile Heap-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.
  This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected
  installations of BlueZ. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that
  the target must connect to a malicious Bluetooth device.  The specific flaw exists within
  the handling of the Phone Book Access profile. The issue results from the lack of proper validation
  of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer.
  An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-20939.
