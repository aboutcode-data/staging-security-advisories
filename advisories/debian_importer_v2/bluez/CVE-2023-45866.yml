  - CVE-2023-45866
summary: 'Bluetooth HID Hosts in BlueZ may permit an unauthenticated Peripheral role HID Device
  to initiate and establish an encrypted connection, and accept HID keyboard reports, potentially
  permitting injection of HID messages when no user interaction has occurred in the Central
  role to authorize such access. An example affected package is bluez 5.64-0ubuntu1 in Ubuntu
  22.04LTS. NOTE: in some cases, a CVE-2020-0556 mitigation would have already addressed this
  Bluetooth HID Hosts issue.'
