aliases:
  - CVE-2021-3658
summary: bluetoothd from bluez incorrectly saves adapters' Discoverable status when a device
  is powered down, and restores it when powered up. If a device is powered down while discoverable,
  it will be discoverable when powered on again. This could lead to inadvertent exposure of
  the bluetooth stack to physically nearby attackers.
