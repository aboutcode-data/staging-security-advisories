aliases:
  - CVE-2020-26558
summary: Bluetooth LE and BR/EDR secure pairing in Bluetooth Core Specification 2.1 through
  5.2 may permit a nearby man-in-the-middle attacker to identify the Passkey used during pairing
  (in the Passkey authentication procedure) by reflection of the public key and the authentication
  evidence of the initiating device, potentially permitting this attacker to complete authenticated
  pairing with the responding device using the correct Passkey for the pairing session. The
  attack methodology determines the Passkey value one bit at a time.
