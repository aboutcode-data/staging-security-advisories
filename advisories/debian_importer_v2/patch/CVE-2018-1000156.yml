summary: GNU Patch version 2.7.6 contains an input validation vulnerability when processing
  patch files, specifically the EDITOR_PROGRAM invocation (using ed) can result in code execution.
  This attack appear to be exploitable via a patch file processed via the patch utility. This
  is similar to FreeBSD's CVE-2015-1418 however although they share a common ancestry the code
  bases have diverged over time.
