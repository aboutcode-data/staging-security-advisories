  - CVE-2022-21698
summary: client_golang is the instrumentation library for Go applications in Prometheus, and
  the promhttp package in client_golang provides tooling around HTTP servers and clients. In
  client_golang prior to version 1.11.1, HTTP server is susceptible to a Denial of Service through
  unbounded cardinality, and potential memory exhaustion, when handling requests with non-standard
  HTTP methods. In order to be affected, an instrumented software must use any of `promhttp.InstrumentHandler*`
  middleware except `RequestsInFlight`; not filter any specific methods (e.g GET) before middleware;
  pass metric with `method` label name to our middleware; and not have any firewall/LB/proxy
  that filters away requests with unknown `method`. client_golang version 1.11.1 contains a
  patch for this issue. Several workarounds are available, including removing the `method` label
  name from counter/gauge used in the InstrumentHandler; turning off affected promhttp handlers;
  adding custom middleware before promhttp handler that will sanitize the request method given
  by Go http.Request; and using a reverse proxy or web application firewall, configured to only
  allow a limited set of methods.
