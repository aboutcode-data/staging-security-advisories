  - CVE-2025-59088
summary: If kdcproxy receives a request for a realm which does not have server addresses defined
  in its configuration, by default, it will query SRV records in the DNS zone matching the requested
  realm name. This creates a server-side request forgery vulnerability, since an attacker could
  send a request for a realm matching a DNS zone where they created SRV records pointing to
  arbitrary ports and hostnames (which may resolve to loopback or internal IP addresses). This
  vulnerability can be exploited to probe internal network topology and firewall rules, perform
  port scanning, and exfiltrate data. Deployments where the "use_dns" setting is explicitly
  set to false are not affected.
