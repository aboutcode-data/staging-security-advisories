  - CVE-2025-59089
summary: If an attacker causes kdcproxy to connect to an attacker-controlled KDC server (e.g.
  through server-side request forgery), they can exploit the fact that kdcproxy does not enforce
  bounds on TCP response length to conduct a denial-of-service attack. While receiving the KDC's
  response, kdcproxy copies the entire buffered stream into a new buffer on each recv() call,
  even when the transfer is incomplete, causing excessive memory allocation and CPU usage. Additionally,
  kdcproxy accepts incoming response chunks as long as the received data length is not exactly
  equal to the length indicated in the response header, even when individual chunks or the total
  buffer exceed the maximum length of a Kerberos message. This allows an attacker to send unbounded
  data until the connection timeout is reached (approximately 12 seconds), exhausting server
  memory or CPU resources. Multiple concurrent requests can cause accept queue overflow, denying
  service to legitimate clients.
