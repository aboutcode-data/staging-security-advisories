summary: GStreamer AV1 Video Parsing Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.
  This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations
  of GStreamer. Interaction with this library is required to exploit this vulnerability but
  attack vectors may vary depending on the implementation.  The specific flaw exists within
  the parsing of metadata within AV1 encoded video files. The issue results from the lack of
  proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length
  stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context
  of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-22300.
