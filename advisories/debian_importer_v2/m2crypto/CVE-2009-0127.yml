aliases:
  - CVE-2009-0127
summary: 'M2Crypto does not properly check the return value from the OpenSSL EVP_VerifyFinal,
  DSA_verify, ECDSA_verify, DSA_do_verify, and ECDSA_do_verify functions, which might allow
  remote attackers to bypass validation of the certificate chain via a malformed SSL/TLS signature,
  a similar vulnerability to CVE-2008-5077.  NOTE: a Linux vendor disputes the relevance of
  this report to the M2Crypto product because "these functions are not used anywhere in m2crypto.'
