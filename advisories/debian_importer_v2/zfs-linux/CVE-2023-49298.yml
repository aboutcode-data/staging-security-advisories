  - CVE-2023-49298
summary: 'OpenZFS through 2.1.13 and 2.2.x through 2.2.1, in certain scenarios involving applications
  that try to rely on efficient copying of file data, can replace file contents with zero-valued
  bytes and thus potentially disable security mechanisms. NOTE: this issue is not always security
  related, but can be security related in realistic situations. A possible example is cp, from
  a recent GNU Core Utilities (coreutils) version, when attempting to preserve a rule set for
  denying unauthorized access. (One might use cp when configuring access control, such as with
  the /etc/hosts.deny file specified in the IBM Support reference.) NOTE: this issue occurs
  less often in version 2.2.1, and in versions before 2.1.4, because of the default configuration
  in those versions.'
