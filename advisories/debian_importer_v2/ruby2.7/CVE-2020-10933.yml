  - CVE-2020-10933
summary: 'An issue was discovered in Ruby 2.5.x through 2.5.7, 2.6.x through 2.6.5, and 2.7.0.
  If a victim calls BasicSocket#read_nonblock(requested_size, buffer, exception: false), the
  method resizes the buffer to fit the requested size, but no data is copied. Thus, the buffer
  string provides the previous value of the heap. This may expose possibly sensitive data from
  the interpreter.'
