summary: A buffer-overread issue was discovered in StringIO 3.0.1, as distributed in Ruby 3.0.x
  through 3.0.6 and 3.1.x through 3.1.4. The ungetbyte and ungetc methods on a StringIO can
  read past the end of a string, and a subsequent call to StringIO.gets may return the memory
  value. 3.0.3 is the main fixed version; however, for Ruby 3.0 users, a fixed version is stringio
  3.0.1.1, and for Ruby 3.1 users, a fixed version is stringio 3.0.1.2.
