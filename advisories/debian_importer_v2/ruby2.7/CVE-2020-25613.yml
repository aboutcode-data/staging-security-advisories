  - CVE-2020-25613
summary: An issue was discovered in Ruby through 2.5.8, 2.6.x through 2.6.6, and 2.7.x through
  2.7.1. WEBrick, a simple HTTP server bundled with Ruby, had not checked the transfer-encoding
  header value rigorously. An attacker may potentially exploit this issue to bypass a reverse
  proxy (which also has a poor header check), which may lead to an HTTP Request Smuggling attack.
