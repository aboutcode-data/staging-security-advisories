summary: An issue was discovered in Ruby through 2.6.7, 2.7.x through 2.7.3, and 3.x through
  3.0.1. A malicious FTP server can use the PASV response to trick Net::FTP into connecting
  back to a given IP address and port. This potentially makes curl extract information about
  services that are otherwise private and not disclosed (e.g., the attacker can conduct port
  scans and service banner extractions).
