  - CVE-2004-1311
summary: Integer overflow in the real_setup_and_get_header function in real.c for Unix MPlayer
  1.0pre5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly
  execute arbitrary code via a Real RTSP streaming media file with a -1 content-length field,
  which leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.
