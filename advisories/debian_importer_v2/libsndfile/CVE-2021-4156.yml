aliases:
  - CVE-2021-4156
summary: An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in libsndfile's FLAC codec functionality. An attacker
  who is able to submit a specially crafted file (via tricking a user to open or otherwise)
  to an application linked with libsndfile and using the FLAC codec, could trigger an out-of-bounds
  read that would most likely cause a crash but could potentially leak memory information that
  could be used in further exploitation of other flaws.
