aliases:
  - CVE-2024-34078
summary: html-sanitizer is an allowlist-based HTML cleaner. If using `keep_typographic_whitespace=False`
  (which is the default), the sanitizer normalizes unicode to the NFKC form at the end. Some
  unicode characters normalize to chevrons; this allows specially crafted HTML to escape sanitization.
  The problem has been fixed in 2.4.2.
