  - CVE-2021-41268
summary: Symfony/SecurityBundle is the security system for Symfony, a PHP framework for web
  and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. Since the rework of the Remember
  me cookie in version 5.3.0, the cookie is not invalidated when the user changes their password.
  Attackers can therefore maintain their access to the account even if the password is changed
  as long as they have had the chance to login once and get a valid remember me cookie. Starting
  with version 5.3.12, Symfony makes the password part of the signature by default. In that
  way, when the password changes, then the cookie is not valid anymore.
