  - CVE-2024-50342
summary: symfony/http-client is a module for the Symphony PHP framework which provides powerful
  methods to fetch HTTP resources synchronously or asynchronously. When using the `NoPrivateNetworkHttpClient`,
  some internal information is still leaking during host resolution, which leads to possible
  IP/port enumeration. As of versions 5.4.46, 6.4.14, and 7.1.7 the `NoPrivateNetworkHttpClient`
  now filters blocked IPs earlier to prevent such leaks. All users are advised to upgrade. There
  are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
