summary: An issue was discovered in Http Foundation in Symfony 2.7.0 through 2.7.48, 2.8.0 through
  2.8.43, 3.3.0 through 3.3.17, 3.4.0 through 3.4.13, 4.0.0 through 4.0.13, and 4.1.0 through
  4.1.2. It arises from support for a (legacy) IIS header that lets users override the path
  in the request URL via the X-Original-URL or X-Rewrite-URL HTTP request header. These headers
  are designed for IIS support, but it's not verified that the server is in fact running IIS,
  which means anybody who can send these requests to an application can trigger this. This affects
  \Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request::prepareRequestUri() where X-Original-URL and X_REWRITE_URL
  are both used. The fix drops support for these methods so that they cannot be used as attack
  vectors such as web cache poisoning.
