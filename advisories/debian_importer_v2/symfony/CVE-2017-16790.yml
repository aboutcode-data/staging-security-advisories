  - CVE-2017-16790
summary: An issue was discovered in Symfony before 2.7.38, 2.8.31, 3.2.14, 3.3.13, 3.4-BETA5,
  and 4.0-BETA5. When a form is submitted by the user, the request handler classes of the Form
  component merge POST data and uploaded files data into one array. This big array forms the
  data that are then bound to the form. At this stage there is no difference anymore between
  submitted POST data and uploaded files. A user can send a crafted HTTP request where the value
  of a "FileType" is sent as normal POST data that could be interpreted as a local file path
  on the server-side (for example, "file:///etc/passwd"). If the application did not perform
  any additional checks about the value submitted to the "FileType", the contents of the given
  file on the server could have been exposed to the attacker.
