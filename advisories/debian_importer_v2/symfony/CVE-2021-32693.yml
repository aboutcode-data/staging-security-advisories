summary: Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP
  components. A vulnerability related to firewall authentication is in Symfony starting with
  version 5.3.0 and prior to 5.3.2. When an application defines multiple firewalls, the token
  authenticated by one of the firewalls was available for all other firewalls. This could be
  abused when the application defines different providers for each part of the application,
  in such a situation, a user authenticated on a part of the application could be considered
  authenticated on the rest of the application. Starting in version 5.3.2, a patch ensures that
  the authenticated token is only available for the firewall that generates it.
