  - CVE-2013-4661
summary: CiviCRM 2.0.0 through 4.2.9 and 4.3.0 through 4.3.3 does not properly enforce role-based
  access control (RBAC) restrictions for default custom searches, which allows remote authenticated
  users with the "access CiviCRM" permission to bypass intended access restrictions, as demonstrated
  by accessing custom contribution data without having the "access CiviContribute" permission.
