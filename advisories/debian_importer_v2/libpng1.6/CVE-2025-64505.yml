  - CVE-2025-64505
summary: LIBPNG is a reference library for use in applications that read, create, and manipulate
  PNG (Portable Network Graphics) raster image files. Prior to version 1.6.51, a heap buffer
  over-read vulnerability exists in libpng's png_do_quantize function when processing PNG files
  with malformed palette indices. The vulnerability occurs when palette_lookup array bounds
  are not validated against externally-supplied image data, allowing an attacker to craft a
  PNG file with out-of-range palette indices that trigger out-of-bounds memory access. This
  issue has been patched in version 1.6.51.
