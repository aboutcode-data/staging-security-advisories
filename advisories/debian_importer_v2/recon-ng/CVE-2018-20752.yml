  - CVE-2018-20752
summary: An issue was discovered in Recon-ng before 4.9.5. Lack of validation in the modules/reporting/csv.py
  file allows CSV injection. More specifically, when a Twitter user possesses an Excel macro
  for a username, it will not be properly sanitized when exported to a CSV file. This can result
  in remote code execution for the attacker.
