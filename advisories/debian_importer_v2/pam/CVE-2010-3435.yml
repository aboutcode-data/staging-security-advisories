aliases:
  - CVE-2010-3435
summary: The (1) pam_env and (2) pam_mail modules in Linux-PAM (aka pam) before 1.1.2 use root
  privileges during read access to files and directories that belong to arbitrary user accounts,
  which might allow local users to obtain sensitive information by leveraging this filesystem
  activity, as demonstrated by a symlink attack on the .pam_environment file in a user's home
  directory.
