  - CVE-2024-10041
summary: A vulnerability was found in PAM. The secret information is stored in memory, where
  the attacker can trigger the victim program to execute by sending characters to its standard
  input (stdin). As this occurs, the attacker can train the branch predictor to execute an ROP
  chain speculatively. This flaw could result in leaked passwords, such as those found in /etc/shadow
  while performing authentications.
