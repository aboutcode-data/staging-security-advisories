  - CVE-2025-6018
summary: A Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) vulnerability has been discovered in pam-config
  within Linux Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM). This flaw allows an unprivileged local
  attacker (for example, a user logged in via SSH) to obtain the elevated privileges normally
  reserved for a physically present, "allow_active" user. The highest risk is that the attacker
  can then perform all allow_active yes Polkit actions, which are typically restricted to console
  users, potentially gaining unauthorized control over system configurations, services, or other
  sensitive operations.
