  - CVE-2020-15397
summary: HylaFAX+ through 7.0.2 and HylaFAX Enterprise have scripts that execute binaries from
  directories writable by unprivileged users (e.g., locations under /var/spool/hylafax that
  are writable by the uucp account). This allows these users to execute code in the context
  of the user calling these binaries (often root).
