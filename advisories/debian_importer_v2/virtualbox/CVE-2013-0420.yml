summary: 'Unspecified vulnerability in the VirtualBox component in Oracle Virtualization 4.0,
  4.1, and 4.2 allows local users to affect integrity and availability via unknown vectors related
  to Core.  NOTE: The previous information was obtained from the January 2013 Oracle CPU. Oracle

  to "draw more lines than necessary."'
