  - CVE-2025-54812
summary: 'Improper Output Neutralization for Logs vulnerability in Apache Log4cxx.   When using
  HTMLLayout, logger names are not properly escaped when writing out to the HTML file. If untrusted
  data is used to retrieve the name of a logger, an attacker could theoretically inject HTML
  or Javascript in order to hide information from logs or steal data from the user. In order
  to activate this, the following sequence must occur:      *  Log4cxx is configured to use
  HTMLLayout.    *  Logger name comes from an untrusted string    *  Logger with compromised
  name logs a message    *  User opens the generated HTML log file in their browser, leading
  to potential XSS   Because logger names are generally constant strings, we assess the impact
  to users as LOW   This issue affects Apache Log4cxx: before 1.5.0.   Users are recommended
  to upgrade to version 1.5.0, which fixes the issue.'
