  - CVE-2016-7966
summary: Through a malicious URL that contained a quote character it was possible to inject
  HTML code in KMail's plaintext viewer. Due to the parser used on the URL it was not possible
  to include the equal sign (=) or a space into the injected HTML, which greatly reduces the
  available HTML functionality. Although it is possible to include an HTML comment indicator
  to hide content.
