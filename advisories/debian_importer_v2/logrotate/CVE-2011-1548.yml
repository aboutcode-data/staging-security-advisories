aliases:
  - CVE-2011-1548
summary: The default configuration of logrotate on Debian GNU/Linux uses root privileges to
  process files in directories that permit non-root write access, which allows local users to
  conduct symlink and hard link attacks by leveraging logrotate's lack of support for untrusted
  directories, as demonstrated by /var/log/postgresql/.
