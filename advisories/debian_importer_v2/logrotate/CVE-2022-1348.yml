aliases:
  - CVE-2022-1348
summary: A vulnerability was found in logrotate in how the state file is created. The state
  file is used to prevent parallel executions of multiple instances of logrotate by acquiring
  and releasing a file lock. When the state file does not exist, it is created with world-readable
  permission, allowing an unprivileged user to lock the state file, stopping any rotation. This
  flaw affects logrotate versions before 3.20.0.
