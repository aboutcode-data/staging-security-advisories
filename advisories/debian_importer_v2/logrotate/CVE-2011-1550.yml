aliases:
  - CVE-2011-1550
summary: The default configuration of logrotate on SUSE openSUSE Factory uses root privileges
  to process files in directories that permit non-root write access, which allows local users
  to conduct symlink and hard link attacks by leveraging logrotate's lack of support for untrusted
  directories, as demonstrated by directories for the (1) cobbler, (2) inn, (3) safte-monitor,
  and (4) uucp packages.
