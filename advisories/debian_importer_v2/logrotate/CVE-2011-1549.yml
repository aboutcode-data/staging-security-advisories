aliases:
  - CVE-2011-1549
summary: The default configuration of logrotate on Gentoo Linux uses root privileges to process
  files in directories that permit non-root write access, which allows local users to conduct
  symlink and hard link attacks by leveraging logrotate's lack of support for untrusted directories,
  as demonstrated by directories under /var/log/ for packages.
