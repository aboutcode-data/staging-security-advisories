  - CVE-2022-2309
summary: NULL Pointer Dereference allows attackers to cause a denial of service (or application
  crash). This only applies when lxml is used together with libxml2 2.9.10 through 2.9.14. libxml2
  2.9.9 and earlier are not affected. It allows triggering crashes through forged input data,
  given a vulnerable code sequence in the application. The vulnerability is caused by the iterwalk
  function (also used by the canonicalize function). Such code shouldn't be in wide-spread use,
  given that parsing + iterwalk would usually be replaced with the more efficient iterparse
  function. However, an XML converter that serialises to C14N would also be vulnerable, for
  example, and there are legitimate use cases for this code sequence. If untrusted input is
  received (also remotely) and processed via iterwalk function, a crash can be triggered.
