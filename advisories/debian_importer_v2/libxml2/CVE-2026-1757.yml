aliases:
  - CVE-2026-1757
summary: A flaw was identified in the interactive shell of the xmllint utility, part of the
  libxml2 project, where memory allocated for user input is not properly released under certain
  conditions. When a user submits input consisting only of whitespace, the program skips command
  execution but fails to free the allocated buffer. Repeating this action causes memory to continuously
  accumulate. Over time, this can exhaust system memory and terminate the xmllint process, creating
  a denial-of-service condition on the local system.
