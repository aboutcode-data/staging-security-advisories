  - CVE-2026-0990
summary: A flaw was found in libxml2, an XML parsing library. This uncontrolled recursion vulnerability
  occurs in the xmlCatalogXMLResolveURI function when an XML catalog contains a delegate URI
  entry that references itself. A remote attacker could exploit this configuration-dependent
  issue by providing a specially crafted XML catalog, leading to infinite recursion and call
  stack exhaustion. This ultimately results in a segmentation fault, causing a Denial of Service
  (DoS) by crashing affected applications.
