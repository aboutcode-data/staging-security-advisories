aliases:
  - CVE-2021-3517
summary: There is a flaw in the xml entity encoding functionality of libxml2 in versions before
  2.9.11. An attacker who is able to supply a crafted file to be processed by an application
  linked with the affected functionality of libxml2 could trigger an out-of-bounds read. The
  most likely impact of this flaw is to application availability, with some potential impact
  to confidentiality and integrity if an attacker is able to use memory information to further
  exploit the application.
