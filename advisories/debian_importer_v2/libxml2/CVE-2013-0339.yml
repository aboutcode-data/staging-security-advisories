aliases:
  - CVE-2013-0339
summary: 'libxml2 through 2.9.1 does not properly handle external entities expansion unless
  an application developer uses the xmlSAX2ResolveEntity or xmlSetExternalEntityLoader function,
  which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption), send HTTP
  requests to intranet servers, or read arbitrary files via a crafted XML document, aka an XML
  External Entity (XXE) issue.  NOTE: it could be argued that because libxml2 already provides
  the ability to disable external entity expansion, the responsibility for resolving this issue
  lies with application developers; according to this argument, this entry should be REJECTed
  and each affected application would need its own CVE.'
