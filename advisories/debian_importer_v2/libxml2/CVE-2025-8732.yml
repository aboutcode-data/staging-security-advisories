summary: A vulnerability was found in libxml2 up to 2.14.5. It has been declared as problematic.
  This vulnerability affects the function xmlParseSGMLCatalog of the component xmlcatalog. The
  manipulation leads to uncontrolled recursion. Attacking locally is a requirement. The exploit
  has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The real existence of this vulnerability
  is still doubted at the moment. The code maintainer explains, that "[t]he issue can only be
  triggered with untrusted SGML catalogs and it makes absolutely no sense to use untrusted catalogs.
  I also doubt that anyone is still using SGML catalogs at all."
