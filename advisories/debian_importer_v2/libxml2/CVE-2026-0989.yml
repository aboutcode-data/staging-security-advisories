  - CVE-2026-0989
summary: A flaw was identified in the RelaxNG parser of libxml2 related to how external schema
  inclusions are handled. The parser does not enforce a limit on inclusion depth when resolving
  nested <include> directives. Specially crafted or overly complex schemas can cause excessive
  recursion during parsing. This may lead to stack exhaustion and application crashes, creating
  a denial-of-service risk.
