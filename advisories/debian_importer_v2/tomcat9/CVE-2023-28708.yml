summary: When using the RemoteIpFilter with requests received from a    reverse proxy via HTTP
  that include the X-Forwarded-Proto    header set to https, session cookies created by Apache
  Tomcat 11.0.0-M1 to 11.0.0.-M2, 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.5, 9.0.0-M1 to 9.0.71 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.85
  did not include the secure attribute. This could result in the user agent transmitting the
  session cookie over an insecure channel.  Older, EOL versions may also be affected.
