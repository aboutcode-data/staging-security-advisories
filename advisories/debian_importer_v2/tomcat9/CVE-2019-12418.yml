  - CVE-2019-12418
summary: When Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.28, 8.5.0 to 8.5.47, 7.0.0 and 7.0.97 is configured
  with the JMX Remote Lifecycle Listener, a local attacker without access to the Tomcat process
  or configuration files is able to manipulate the RMI registry to perform a man-in-the-middle
  attack to capture user names and passwords used to access the JMX interface. The attacker
  can then use these credentials to access the JMX interface and gain complete control over
  the Tomcat instance.
