aliases:
  - CVE-2017-5647
summary: A bug in the handling of the pipelined requests in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M18,
  8.5.0 to 8.5.12, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.42, 7.0.0 to 7.0.76, and 6.0.0 to 6.0.52, when send file
  was used, results in the pipelined request being lost when send file processing of the previous
  request completed. This could result in responses appearing to be sent for the wrong request.
  For example, a user agent that sent requests A, B and C could see the correct response for
  request A, the response for request C for request B and no response for request C.
