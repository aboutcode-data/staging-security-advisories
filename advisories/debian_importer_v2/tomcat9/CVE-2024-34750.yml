  - CVE-2024-34750
summary: 'Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability
  in Apache Tomcat. When processing an HTTP/2 stream, Tomcat did not handle some cases of excessive
  HTTP headers correctly. This led to a miscounting of active HTTP/2 streams which in turn led
  to the use of an incorrect infinite timeout which allowed connections to remain open which
  should have been closed.  This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M20,
  from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.24, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.89.  The following versions were
  EOL at the time the CVE was created but are  known to be affected: 8.5.0 though 8.5.100. Other
  EOL versions may also be affected.   Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M21,
  10.1.25 or 9.0.90, which fixes the issue.'
