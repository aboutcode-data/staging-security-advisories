  - CVE-2017-5648
summary: While investigating bug 60718, it was noticed that some calls to application listeners
  in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M17, 8.5.0 to 8.5.11, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.41, and 7.0.0 to
  7.0.75 did not use the appropriate facade object. When running an untrusted application under
  a SecurityManager, it was therefore possible for that untrusted application to retain a reference
  to the request or response object and thereby access and/or modify information associated
  with another web application.
