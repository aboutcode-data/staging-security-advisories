  - CVE-2020-13943
summary: If an HTTP/2 client connecting to Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0-M7, 9.0.0.M1 to
  9.0.37 or 8.5.0 to 8.5.57 exceeded the agreed maximum number of concurrent streams for a connection
  (in violation of the HTTP/2 protocol), it was possible that a subsequent request made on that
  connection could contain HTTP headers - including HTTP/2 pseudo headers - from a previous
  request rather than the intended headers. This could lead to users seeing responses for unexpected
  resources.
