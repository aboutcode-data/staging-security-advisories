  - CVE-2022-42252
summary: If Apache Tomcat 8.5.0 to 8.5.82, 9.0.0-M1 to 9.0.67, 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.26 or 10.1.0-M1
  to 10.1.0 was configured to ignore invalid HTTP headers via setting rejectIllegalHeader to
  false (the default for 8.5.x only), Tomcat did not reject a request containing an invalid
  Content-Length header making a request smuggling attack possible if Tomcat was located behind
  a reverse proxy that also failed to reject the request with the invalid header.
