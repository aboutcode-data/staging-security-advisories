aliases:
  - CVE-2019-10072
summary: The fix for CVE-2019-0199 was incomplete and did not address HTTP/2 connection window
  exhaustion on write in Apache Tomcat versions 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.19 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.40 . By
  not sending WINDOW_UPDATE messages for the connection window (stream 0) clients were able
  to cause server-side threads to block eventually leading to thread exhaustion and a DoS.
