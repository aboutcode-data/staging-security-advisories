  - CVE-2019-0199
summary: The HTTP/2 implementation in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.14 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.37 accepted
  streams with excessive numbers of SETTINGS frames and also permitted clients to keep streams
  open without reading/writing request/response data. By keeping streams open for requests that
  utilised the Servlet API's blocking I/O, clients were able to cause server-side threads to
  block eventually leading to thread exhaustion and a DoS.
