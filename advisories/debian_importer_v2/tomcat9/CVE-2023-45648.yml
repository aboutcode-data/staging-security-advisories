  - CVE-2023-45648
summary: Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.Tomcat from 11.0.0-M1 through
  11.0.0-M11, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.13, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.81 and from 8.5.0 through
  8.5.93 did not correctly parse HTTP trailer headers. A specially  crafted, invalid trailer
  header could cause Tomcat to treat a single  request as multiple requests leading to the possibility
  of request  smuggling when behind a reverse proxy.  Older, EOL versions may also be affected.   Users
  are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M12 onwards, 10.1.14 onwards, 9.0.81 onwards
  or 8.5.94 onwards, which fix the issue.
