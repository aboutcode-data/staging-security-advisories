summary: When serving resources from a network location using the NTFS file system, Apache Tomcat
  versions 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0-M9, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.39, 8.5.0 to 8.5.59 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.106
  were susceptible to JSP source code disclosure in some configurations. The root cause was
  the unexpected behaviour of the JRE API File.getCanonicalPath() which in turn was caused by
  the inconsistent behaviour of the Windows API (FindFirstFileW) in some circumstances.
