aliases:
  - CVE-2017-5650
summary: In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M18 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.12, the handling of an HTTP/2
  GOAWAY frame for a connection did not close streams associated with that connection that were
  currently waiting for a WINDOW_UPDATE before allowing the application to write more data.
  These waiting streams each consumed a thread. A malicious client could therefore construct
  a series of HTTP/2 requests that would consume all available processing threads.
