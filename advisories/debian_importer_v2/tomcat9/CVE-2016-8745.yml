  - CVE-2016-8745
summary: A bug in the error handling of the send file code for the NIO HTTP connector in Apache
  Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M13, 8.5.0 to 8.5.8, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.39, 7.0.0 to 7.0.73 and 6.0.16
  to 6.0.48 resulted in the current Processor object being added to the Processor cache multiple
  times. This in turn meant that the same Processor could be used for concurrent requests. Sharing
  a Processor can result in information leakage between requests including, not not limited
  to, session ID and the response body. The bug was first noticed in 8.5.x onwards where it
  appears the refactoring of the Connector code for 8.5.x onwards made it more likely that the
  bug was observed. Initially it was thought that the 8.5.x refactoring introduced the bug but
  further investigation has shown that the bug is present in all currently supported Tomcat
  versions.
