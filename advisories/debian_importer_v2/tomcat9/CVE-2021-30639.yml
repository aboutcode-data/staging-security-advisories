  - CVE-2021-30639
summary: A vulnerability in Apache Tomcat allows an attacker to remotely trigger a denial of
  service. An error introduced as part of a change to improve error handling during non-blocking
  I/O meant that the error flag associated with the Request object was not reset between requests.
  This meant that once a non-blocking I/O error occurred, all future requests handled by that
  request object would fail. Users were able to trigger non-blocking I/O errors, e.g. by dropping
  a connection, thereby creating the possibility of triggering a DoS. Applications that do not
  use non-blocking I/O are not exposed to this vulnerability. This issue affects Apache Tomcat
  10.0.3 to 10.0.4; 9.0.44; 8.5.64.
