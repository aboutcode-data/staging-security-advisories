  - CVE-2019-17563
summary: When using FORM authentication with Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.29, 8.5.0 to 8.5.49
  and 7.0.0 to 7.0.98 there was a narrow window where an attacker could perform a session fixation
  attack. The window was considered too narrow for an exploit to be practical but, erring on
  the side of caution, this issue has been treated as a security vulnerability.
