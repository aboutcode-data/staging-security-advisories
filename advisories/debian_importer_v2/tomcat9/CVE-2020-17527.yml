  - CVE-2020-17527
summary: While investigating bug 64830 it was discovered that Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0-M9,
  9.0.0-M1 to 9.0.39 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.59 could re-use an HTTP request header value from the
  previous stream received on an HTTP/2 connection for the request associated with the subsequent
  stream. While this would most likely lead to an error and the closure of the HTTP/2 connection,
  it is possible that information could leak between requests.
