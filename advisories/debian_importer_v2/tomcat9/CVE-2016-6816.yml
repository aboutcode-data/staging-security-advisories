aliases:
  - CVE-2016-6816
summary: The code in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M11, 8.5.0 to 8.5.6, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.38,
  7.0.0 to 7.0.72, and 6.0.0 to 6.0.47 that parsed the HTTP request line permitted invalid characters.
  This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy that also permitted the invalid characters
  but with a different interpretation, to inject data into the HTTP response. By manipulating
  the HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack and/or obtain
  sensitive information from requests other then their own.
