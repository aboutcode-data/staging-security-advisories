  - CVE-2022-25762
summary: If a web application sends a WebSocket message concurrently with the WebSocket connection
  closing when running on Apache Tomcat 8.5.0 to 8.5.75 or Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.20,
  it is possible that the application will continue to use the socket after it has been closed.
  The error handling triggered in this case could cause the a pooled object to be placed in
  the pool twice. This could result in subsequent connections using the same object concurrently
  which could result in data being returned to the wrong use and/or other errors.
