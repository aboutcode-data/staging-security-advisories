  - CVE-2018-1304
summary: The URL pattern of "" (the empty string) which exactly maps to the context root was
  not correctly handled in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.4, 8.5.0 to 8.5.27, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.49
  and 7.0.0 to 7.0.84 when used as part of a security constraint definition. This caused the
  constraint to be ignored. It was, therefore, possible for unauthorised users to gain access
  to web application resources that should have been protected. Only security constraints with
  a URL pattern of the empty string were affected.
