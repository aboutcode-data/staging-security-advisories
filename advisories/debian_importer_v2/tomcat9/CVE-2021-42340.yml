summary: The fix for bug 63362 present in Apache Tomcat 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.0-M5, 10.0.0-M1 to
  10.0.11, 9.0.40 to 9.0.53 and 8.5.60 to 8.5.71 introduced a memory leak. The object introduced
  to collect metrics for HTTP upgrade connections was not released for WebSocket connections
  once the connection was closed. This created a memory leak that, over time, could lead to
  a denial of service via an OutOfMemoryError.
