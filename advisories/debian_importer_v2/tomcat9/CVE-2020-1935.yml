  - CVE-2020-1935
summary: In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99 the HTTP header
  parsing code used an approach to end-of-line parsing that allowed some invalid HTTP headers
  to be parsed as valid. This led to a possibility of HTTP Request Smuggling if Tomcat was located
  behind a reverse proxy that incorrectly handled the invalid Transfer-Encoding header in a
  particular manner. Such a reverse proxy is considered unlikely.
