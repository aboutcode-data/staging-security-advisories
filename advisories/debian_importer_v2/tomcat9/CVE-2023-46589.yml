  - CVE-2023-46589
summary: Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.Tomcat from 11.0.0-M1 through
  11.0.0-M10, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.15, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.82 and from 8.5.0 through
  8.5.95 did not correctly parse HTTP trailer headers. A trailer header that exceeded the header
  size limit could cause Tomcat to treat a single  request as multiple requests leading to the
  possibility of request  smuggling when behind a reverse proxy.   Older, EOL versions may also
  be affected.   Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M11 onwards, 10.1.16 onwards,
  9.0.83 onwards or 8.5.96 onwards, which fix the issue.
