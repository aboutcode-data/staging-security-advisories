  - CVE-2021-25329
summary: The fix for CVE-2020-9484 was incomplete. When using Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0,
  9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.41, 8.5.0 to 8.5.61 or 7.0.0. to 7.0.107 with a configuration edge case that
  was highly unlikely to be used, the Tomcat instance was still vulnerable to CVE-2020-9494.
  Note that both the previously published prerequisites for CVE-2020-9484 and the previously
  published mitigations for CVE-2020-9484 also apply to this issue.
