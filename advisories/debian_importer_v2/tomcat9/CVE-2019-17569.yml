aliases:
  - CVE-2019-17569
summary: The refactoring present in Apache Tomcat 9.0.28 to 9.0.30, 8.5.48 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.98
  to 7.0.99 introduced a regression. The result of the regression was that invalid Transfer-Encoding
  headers were incorrectly processed leading to a possibility of HTTP Request Smuggling if Tomcat
  was located behind a reverse proxy that incorrectly handled the invalid Transfer-Encoding
  header in a particular manner. Such a reverse proxy is considered unlikely.
