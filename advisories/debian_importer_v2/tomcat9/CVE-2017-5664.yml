  - CVE-2017-5664
summary: 'The error page mechanism of the Java Servlet Specification requires that, when an
  error occurs and an error page is configured for the error that occurred, the original request
  and response are forwarded to the error page. This means that the request is presented to
  the error page with the original HTTP method. If the error page is a static file, expected
  behaviour is to serve content of the file as if processing a GET request, regardless of the
  actual HTTP method. The Default Servlet in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M20, 8.5.0 to 8.5.14,
  8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.43 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.77 did not do this. Depending on the original request
  this could lead to unexpected and undesirable results for static error pages including, if
  the DefaultServlet is configured to permit writes, the replacement or removal of the custom
  error page. Notes for other user provided error pages: (1) Unless explicitly coded otherwise,
  JSPs ignore the HTTP method. JSPs used as error pages must must ensure that they handle any
  error dispatch as a GET request, regardless of the actual method. (2) By default, the response
  generated by a Servlet does depend on the HTTP method. Custom Servlets used as error pages
  must ensure that they handle any error dispatch as a GET request, regardless of the actual
  method.'
