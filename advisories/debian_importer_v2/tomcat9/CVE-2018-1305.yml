  - CVE-2018-1305
summary: Security constraints defined by annotations of Servlets in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to
  9.0.4, 8.5.0 to 8.5.27, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.49 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.84 were only applied once a Servlet
  had been loaded. Because security constraints defined in this way apply to the URL pattern
  and any URLs below that point, it was possible - depending on the order Servlets were loaded
  - for some security constraints not to be applied. This could have exposed resources to users
  who were not authorised to access them.
