  - CVE-2020-15136
summary: In ectd before versions 3.4.10 and 3.3.23, gateway TLS authentication is only applied
  to endpoints detected in DNS SRV records. When starting a gateway, TLS authentication will
  only be attempted on endpoints identified in DNS SRV records for a given domain, which occurs
  in the discoverEndpoints function. No authentication is performed against endpoints provided
  in the --endpoints flag. This has been fixed in versions 3.4.10 and 3.3.23 with improved documentation
  and deprecation of the functionality.
