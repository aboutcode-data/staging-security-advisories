  - CVE-2023-32082
summary: etcd is a distributed key-value store for the data of a distributed system. Prior to
  versions 3.4.26 and 3.5.9, the LeaseTimeToLive API allows access to key names (not value)
  associated to a lease when `Keys` parameter is true, even a user doesn't have read permission
  to the keys. The impact is limited to a cluster which enables auth (RBAC). Versions 3.4.26
  and 3.5.9 fix this issue. There are no known workarounds.
