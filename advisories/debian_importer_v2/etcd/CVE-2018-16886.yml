aliases:
  - CVE-2018-16886
summary: etcd versions 3.2.x before 3.2.26 and 3.3.x before 3.3.11 are vulnerable to an improper
  authentication issue when role-based access control (RBAC) is used and client-cert-auth is
  enabled. If an etcd client server TLS certificate contains a Common Name (CN) which matches
  a valid RBAC username, a remote attacker may authenticate as that user with any valid (trusted)
  client certificate in a REST API request to the gRPC-gateway.
