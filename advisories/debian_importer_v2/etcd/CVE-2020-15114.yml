  - CVE-2020-15114
summary: In etcd before versions 3.3.23 and 3.4.10, the etcd gateway is a simple TCP proxy to
  allow for basic service discovery and access. However, it is possible to include the gateway
  address as an endpoint. This results in a denial of service, since the endpoint can become
  stuck in a loop of requesting itself until there are no more available file descriptors to
  accept connections on the gateway.
