aliases:
  - CVE-2020-15106
summary: In etcd before versions 3.3.23 and 3.4.10, a large slice causes panic in decodeRecord
  method. The size of a record is stored in the length field of a WAL file and no additional
  validation is done on this data. Therefore, it is possible to forge an extremely large frame
  size that can unintentionally panic at the expense of any RAFT participant trying to decode
  the WAL.
