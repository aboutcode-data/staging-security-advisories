  - CVE-2022-45136
summary: Apache Jena SDB 3.17.0 and earlier is vulnerable to a JDBC Deserialisation attack if
  the attacker is able to control the JDBC URL used or cause the underlying database server
  to return malicious data. The mySQL JDBC driver in particular is known to be vulnerable to
  this class of attack. As a result an application using Apache Jena SDB can be subject to RCE
  when connected to a malicious database server. Apache Jena SDB has been EOL since December
  2020 and users should migrate to alternative options e.g. Apache Jena TDB 2.
