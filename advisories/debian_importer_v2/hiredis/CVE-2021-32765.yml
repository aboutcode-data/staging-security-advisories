  - CVE-2021-32765
summary: Hiredis is a minimalistic C client library for the Redis database. In affected versions
  Hiredis is vulnurable to integer overflow if provided maliciously crafted or corrupted `RESP`
  `mult-bulk` protocol data. When parsing `multi-bulk` (array-like) replies, hiredis fails to
  check if `count * sizeof(redisReply*)` can be represented in `SIZE_MAX`. If it can not, and
  the `calloc()` call doesn't itself make this check, it would result in a short allocation
  and subsequent buffer overflow. Users of hiredis who are unable to update may set the [maxelements](https://github.com/redis/hiredis#reader-max-array-elements)
  context option to a value small enough that no overflow is possible.
