  - CVE-2023-29483
summary: 'eventlet before 0.35.2, as used in dnspython before 2.6.0, allows remote attackers
  to interfere with DNS name resolution by quickly sending an invalid packet from the expected
  IP address and source port, aka a "TuDoor" attack. In other words, dnspython does not have
  the preferred behavior in which the DNS name resolution algorithm would proceed, within the
  full time window, in order to wait for a valid packet. NOTE: dnspython 2.6.0 is unusable for
  a different reason that was addressed in 2.6.1.'
