summary: The DNS protocol, as implemented in (1) BIND 8 and 9 before 9.5.0-P1, 9.4.2-P1, and
  9.3.5-P1; (2) Microsoft DNS in Windows 2000 SP4, XP SP2 and SP3, and Server 2003 SP1 and SP2;
  and other implementations allow remote attackers to spoof DNS traffic via a birthday attack

  Socket Entropy Vulnerability" or "the Kaminsky bug."
