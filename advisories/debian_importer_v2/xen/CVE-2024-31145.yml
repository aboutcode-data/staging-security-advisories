  - CVE-2024-31145
summary: Certain PCI devices in a system might be assigned Reserved Memory Regions (specified
  via Reserved Memory Region Reporting, "RMRR") for Intel VT-d or Unity Mapping ranges for AMD-Vi.  These
  are typically used for platform tasks such as legacy USB emulation.  Since the precise purpose
  of these regions is unknown, once a device associated with such a region is active, the mappings
  of these regions need to remain continuouly accessible by the device.  In the logic establishing
  these mappings, error handling was flawed, resulting in such mappings to potentially remain
  in place when they should have been removed again.  Respective guests would then gain access
  to memory regions which they aren't supposed to have access to.
