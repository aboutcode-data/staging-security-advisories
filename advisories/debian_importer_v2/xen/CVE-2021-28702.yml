  - CVE-2021-28702
summary: PCI devices with RMRRs not deassigned correctly Certain PCI devices in a system might
  be assigned Reserved Memory Regions (specified via Reserved Memory Region Reporting, "RMRR").
  These are typically used for platform tasks such as legacy USB emulation. If such a device
  is passed through to a guest, then on guest shutdown the device is not properly deassigned.
  The IOMMU configuration for these devices which are not properly deassigned ends up pointing
  to a freed data structure, including the IO Pagetables. Subsequent DMA or interrupts from
  the device will have unpredictable behaviour, ranging from IOMMU faults to memory corruption.
