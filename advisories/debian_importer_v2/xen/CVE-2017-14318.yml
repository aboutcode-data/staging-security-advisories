summary: An issue was discovered in Xen 4.5.x through 4.9.x. The function `__gnttab_cache_flush`
  handles GNTTABOP_cache_flush grant table operations. It checks to see if the calling domain
  is the owner of the page that is to be operated on. If it is not, the owner's grant table
  is checked to see if a grant mapping to the calling domain exists for the page in question.
  However, the function does not check to see if the owning domain actually has a grant table
  or not. Some special domains, such as `DOMID_XEN`, `DOMID_IO` and `DOMID_COW` are created
  without grant tables. Hence, if __gnttab_cache_flush operates on a page owned by these special
  domains, it will attempt to dereference a NULL pointer in the domain struct.
