  - CVE-2022-23034
summary: A PV guest could DoS Xen while unmapping a grant To address XSA-380, reference counting
  was introduced for grant mappings for the case where a PV guest would have the IOMMU enabled.
  PV guests can request two forms of mappings. When both are in use for any individual mapping,
  unmapping of such a mapping can be requested in two steps. The reference count for such a
  mapping would then mistakenly be decremented twice. Underflow of the counters gets detected,
  resulting in the triggering of a hypervisor bug check.
