  - CVE-2019-18420
summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing x86 PV guest OS users to cause
  a denial of service via a VCPUOP_initialise hypercall. hypercall_create_continuation() is
  a variadic function which uses a printf-like format string to interpret its parameters. Error
  handling for a bad format character was done using BUG(), which crashes Xen. One path, via
  the VCPUOP_initialise hypercall, has a bad format character. The BUG() can be hit if VCPUOP_initialise
  executes for a sufficiently long period of time for a continuation to be created. Malicious
  guests may cause a hypervisor crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Xen versions
  4.6 and newer are vulnerable. Xen versions 4.5 and earlier are not vulnerable. Only x86 PV
  guests can exploit the vulnerability. HVM and PVH guests, and guests on ARM systems, cannot
  exploit the vulnerability.
