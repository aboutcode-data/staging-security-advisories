summary: grant table v2 status pages may remain accessible after de-allocation Guest get permitted
  access to certain Xen-owned pages of memory. The majority of such pages remain allocated /
  associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, get
  de-allocated when a guest switched (back) from v2 to v1. The freeing of such pages requires
  that the hypervisor know where in the guest these pages were mapped. The hypervisor tracks
  only one use within guest space, but racing requests from the guest to insert mappings of
  these pages may result in any of them to become mapped in multiple locations. Upon switching
  back from v2 to v1, the guest would then retain access to a page that was freed and perhaps
  re-used for other purposes.
