  - CVE-2020-29566
summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. When they require assistance from the
  device model, x86 HVM guests must be temporarily de-scheduled. The device model will signal
  Xen when it has completed its operation, via an event channel, so that the relevant vCPU is
  rescheduled. If the device model were to signal Xen without having actually completed the
  operation, the de-schedule / re-schedule cycle would repeat. If, in addition, Xen is resignalled
  very quickly, the re-schedule may occur before the de-schedule was fully complete, triggering
  a shortcut. This potentially repeating process uses ordinary recursive function calls, and
  thus could result in a stack overflow. A malicious or buggy stubdomain serving a HVM guest
  can cause Xen to crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) to the entire host. Only x86
  systems are affected. Arm systems are not affected. Only x86 stubdomains serving HVM guests
  can exploit the vulnerability.
