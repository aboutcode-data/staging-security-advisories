  - CVE-2020-25596
summary: 'An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. x86 PV guest kernels can experience
  denial of service via SYSENTER. The SYSENTER instruction leaves various state sanitization
  activities to software. One of Xen''s sanitization paths injects a #GP fault, and incorrectly
  delivers it twice to the guest. This causes the guest kernel to observe a kernel-privilege
  #GP fault (typically fatal) rather than a user-privilege #GP fault (usually converted into
  SIGSEGV/etc.). Malicious or buggy userspace can crash the guest kernel, resulting in a VM
  Denial of Service. All versions of Xen from 3.2 onwards are vulnerable. Only x86 systems are
  vulnerable. ARM platforms are not vulnerable. Only x86 systems that support the SYSENTER instruction
  in 64bit mode are vulnerable. This is believed to be Intel, Centaur, and Shanghai CPUs. AMD
  and Hygon CPUs are not believed to be vulnerable. Only x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability.
  x86 PVH / HVM guests cannot exploit the vulnerability.'
