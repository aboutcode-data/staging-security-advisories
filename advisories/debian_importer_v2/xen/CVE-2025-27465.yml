  - CVE-2025-27465
summary: Certain instructions need intercepting and emulating by Xen.  In some cases Xen emulates
  the instruction by replaying it, using an executable stub.  Some instructions may raise an
  exception, which is supposed to be handled gracefully.  Certain replayed instructions have
  additional logic to set up and recover the changes to the arithmetic flags.  For replayed
  instructions where the flags recovery logic is used, the metadata for exception handling was
  incorrect, preventing Xen from handling the the exception gracefully, treating it as fatal
  instead.
