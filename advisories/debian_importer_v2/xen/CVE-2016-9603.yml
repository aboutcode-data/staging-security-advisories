  - CVE-2016-9603
summary: A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in QEMU's Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA emulator's VNC
  display driver support before 2.9; the issue could occur when a VNC client attempted to update
  its display after a VGA operation is performed by a guest. A privileged user/process inside
  a guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process or, potentially, execute arbitrary code
  on the host with privileges of the QEMU process.
