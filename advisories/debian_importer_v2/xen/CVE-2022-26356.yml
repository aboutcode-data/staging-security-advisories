summary: Racy interactions between dirty vram tracking and paging log dirty hypercalls Activation
  of log dirty mode done by XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram (was named HVMOP_track_dirty_vram before
  Xen 4.9) is racy with ongoing log dirty hypercalls. A suitably timed call to XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram
  can enable log dirty while another CPU is still in the process of tearing down the structures
  related to a previously enabled log dirty mode (XEN_DOMCTL_SHADOW_OP_OFF). This is due to
  lack of mutually exclusive locking between both operations and can lead to entries being added
  in already freed slots, resulting in a memory leak.
