  - CVE-2021-28706
summary: guests may exceed their designated memory limit When a guest is permitted to have close
  to 16TiB of memory, it may be able to issue hypercalls to increase its memory allocation beyond
  the administrator established limit. This is a result of a calculation done with 32-bit precision,
  which may overflow. It would then only be the overflowed (and hence small) number which gets
  compared against the established upper bound.
