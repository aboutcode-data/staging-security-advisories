aliases:
  - CVE-2024-31146
summary: When multiple devices share resources and one of them is to be passed through to a
  guest, security of the entire system and of respective guests individually cannot really be
  guaranteed without knowing internals of any of the involved guests.  Therefore such a configuration
  cannot really be security-supported, yet making that explicit was so far missing.  Resources
  the sharing of which is known to be problematic include, but are not limited to - - PCI Base
  Address Registers (BARs) of multiple devices mapping to the   same page (4k on x86), - - INTx
  lines.
