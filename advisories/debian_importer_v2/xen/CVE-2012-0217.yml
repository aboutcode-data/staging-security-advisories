summary: 'The x86-64 kernel system-call functionality in Xen 4.1.2 and earlier, as used in Citrix
  XenServer 6.0.2 and earlier and other products; Oracle Solaris 11 and earlier; illumos before
  r13724; Joyent SmartOS before 20120614T184600Z; FreeBSD before 9.0-RELEASE-p3; NetBSD 6.0
  Beta and earlier; Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 and R2 SP1 and Windows 7 Gold and SP1;
  and possibly other operating systems, when running on an Intel processor, incorrectly uses
  the sysret path in cases where a certain address is not a canonical address, which allows
  local users to gain privileges via a crafted application.  NOTE: because this issue is due
  to incorrect use of the Intel specification, it should have been split into separate identifiers;
  however, there was some value in preserving the original mapping of the multi-codebase coordinated-disclosure
  effort to a single identifier.'
