aliases:
  - CVE-2013-2076
summary: 'Xen 4.0.x, 4.1.x, and 4.2.x, when running on AMD64 processors, only save/restore the
  FOP, FIP, and FDP x87 registers in FXSAVE/FXRSTOR when an exception is pending, which allows
  one domain to determine portions of the state of floating point instructions of other domains,
  which can be leveraged to obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys, a similar
  vulnerability to CVE-2006-1056.  NOTE: this is the documented behavior of AMD64 processors,
  but it is inconsistent with Intel processors in a security-relevant fashion that was not addressed
  by the kernels.'
