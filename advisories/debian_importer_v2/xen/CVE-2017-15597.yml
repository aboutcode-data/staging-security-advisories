  - CVE-2017-15597
summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.9.x. Grant copying code made an implication
  that any grant pin would be accompanied by a suitable page reference. Other portions of code,
  however, did not match up with that assumption. When such a grant copy operation is being
  done on a grant of a dying domain, the assumption turns out wrong. A malicious guest administrator
  can cause hypervisor memory corruption, most likely resulting in host crash and a Denial of
  Service. Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be ruled out.
