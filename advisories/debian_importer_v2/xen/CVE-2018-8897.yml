  - CVE-2018-8897
summary: 'A statement in the System Programming Guide of the Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures
  Software Developer''s Manual (SDM) was mishandled in the development of some or all operating-system
  kernels, resulting in unexpected behavior for #DB exceptions that are deferred by MOV SS or
  POP SS, as demonstrated by (for example) privilege escalation in Windows, macOS, some Xen
  configurations, or FreeBSD, or a Linux kernel crash. The MOV to SS and POP SS instructions
  inhibit interrupts (including NMIs), data breakpoints, and single step trap exceptions until
  the instruction boundary following the next instruction (SDM Vol. 3A; section 6.8.3). (The
  inhibited data breakpoints are those on memory accessed by the MOV to SS or POP to SS instruction
  itself.) Note that debug exceptions are not inhibited by the interrupt enable (EFLAGS.IF)
  system flag (SDM Vol. 3A; section 2.3). If the instruction following the MOV to SS or POP
  to SS instruction is an instruction like SYSCALL, SYSENTER, INT 3, etc. that transfers control
  to the operating system at CPL < 3, the debug exception is delivered after the transfer to
  CPL < 3 is complete. OS kernels may not expect this order of events and may therefore experience
  unexpected behavior when it occurs.'
