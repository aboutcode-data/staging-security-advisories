  - CVE-2020-29571
summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. A bounds check common to most operation
  time functions specific to FIFO event channels depends on the CPU observing consistent state.
  While the producer side uses appropriately ordered writes, the consumer side isn't protected
  against re-ordered reads, and may hence end up de-referencing a NULL pointer. Malicious or
  buggy guest kernels can mount a Denial of Service (DoS) attack affecting the entire system.
  Only Arm systems may be vulnerable. Whether a system is vulnerable depends on the specific
  CPU. x86 systems are not vulnerable.
