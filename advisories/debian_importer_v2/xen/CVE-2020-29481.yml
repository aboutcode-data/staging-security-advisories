  - CVE-2020-29481
summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Access rights of Xenstore nodes are
  per domid. Unfortunately, existing granted access rights are not removed when a domain is
  being destroyed. This means that a new domain created with the same domid will inherit the
  access rights to Xenstore nodes from the previous domain(s) with the same domid. Because all
  Xenstore entries of a guest below /local/domain/<domid> are being deleted by Xen tools when
  a guest is destroyed, only Xenstore entries of other guests still running are affected. For
  example, a newly created guest domain might be able to read sensitive information that had
  belonged to a previously existing guest domain. Both Xenstore implementations (C and Ocaml)
  are vulnerable.
