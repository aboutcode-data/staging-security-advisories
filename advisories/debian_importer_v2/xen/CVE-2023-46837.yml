  - CVE-2023-46837
summary: Arm provides multiple helpers to clean & invalidate the cache for a given region.  This
  is, for instance, used when allocating guest memory to ensure any writes (such as the ones
  during scrubbing) have reached memory before handing over the page to a guest.  Unfortunately,
  the arithmetics in the helpers can overflow and would then result to skip the cache cleaning/invalidation.  Therefore
  there is no guarantee when all the writes will reach the memory.  This undefined behavior
  was meant to be addressed by XSA-437, but the approach was not sufficient.
