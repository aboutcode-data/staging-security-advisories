summary: 'Xenstore: Cooperating guests can create arbitrary numbers of nodes T[his CNA information
  record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond
  to which CVE.] Since the fix of XSA-322 any Xenstore node owned by a removed domain will be
  modified to be owned by Dom0. This will allow two malicious guests working together to create
  an arbitrary number of Xenstore nodes. This is possible by domain A letting domain B write
  into domain A''s local Xenstore tree. Domain B can then create many nodes and reboot. The
  nodes created by domain B will now be owned by Dom0. By repeating this process over and over
  again an arbitrary number of nodes can be created, as Dom0''s number of nodes isn''t limited
  by Xenstore quota.'
