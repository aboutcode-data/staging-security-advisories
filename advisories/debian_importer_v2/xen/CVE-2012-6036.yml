summary: 'The (1) memc_save_get_next_page, (2) tmemc_restore_put_page and (3) tmemc_restore_flush_page
  functions in the Transcendent Memory (TMEM) in Xen 4.0, 4.1, and 4.2 do not check for negative
  id pools, which allows local guest OS users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption
  and host crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.  NOTE: this issue
  was originally published as part of CVE-2012-3497, which was too general; CVE-2012-3497 has
  been SPLIT into this ID and others.'
