  - CVE-2018-12893
summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.10.x. One of the fixes in XSA-260 added some
  safety checks to help prevent Xen livelocking with debug exceptions. Unfortunately, due to
  an oversight, at least one of these safety checks can be triggered by a guest. A malicious
  PV guest can crash Xen, leading to a Denial of Service. All Xen systems which have applied
  the XSA-260 fix are vulnerable. Only x86 systems are vulnerable. ARM systems are not vulnerable.
  Only x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability. x86 HVM and PVH guests cannot exploit the
  vulnerability. An attacker needs to be able to control hardware debugging facilities to exploit
  the vulnerability, but such permissions are typically available to unprivileged users.
