  - CVE-2019-19581
summary: 'An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing 32-bit Arm guest OS users to
  cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds access) because certain bit iteration is mishandled.
  In a number of places bitmaps are being used by the hypervisor to track certain state. Iteration
  over all bits involves functions which may misbehave in certain corner cases: On 32-bit Arm
  accesses to bitmaps with bit a count which is a multiple of 32, an out of bounds access may
  occur. A malicious guest may cause a hypervisor crash or hang, resulting in a Denial of Service
  (DoS). All versions of Xen are vulnerable. 32-bit Arm systems are vulnerable. 64-bit Arm systems
  are not vulnerable.'
