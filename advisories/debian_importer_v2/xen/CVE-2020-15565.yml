  - CVE-2020-15565
summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing x86 Intel HVM guest OS users
  to cause a host OS denial of service or possibly gain privileges because of insufficient cache
  write-back under VT-d. When page tables are shared between IOMMU and CPU, changes to them
  require flushing of both TLBs. Furthermore, IOMMUs may be non-coherent, and hence prior to
  flushing IOMMU TLBs, a CPU cache also needs writing back to memory after changes were made.
  Such writing back of cached data was missing in particular when splitting large page mappings
  into smaller granularity ones. A malicious guest may be able to retain read/write DMA access
  to frames returned to Xen's free pool, and later reused for another purpose. Host crashes
  (leading to a Denial of Service) and privilege escalation cannot be ruled out. Xen versions
  from at least 3.2 onwards are affected. Only x86 Intel systems are affected. x86 AMD as well
  as Arm systems are not affected. Only x86 HVM guests using hardware assisted paging (HAP),
  having a passed through PCI device assigned, and having page table sharing enabled can leverage
  the vulnerability. Note that page table sharing will be enabled (by default) only if Xen considers
  IOMMU and CPU large page size support compatible.
