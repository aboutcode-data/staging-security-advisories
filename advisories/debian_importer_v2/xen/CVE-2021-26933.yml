  - CVE-2021-26933
summary: An issue was discovered in Xen 4.9 through 4.14.x. On Arm, a guest is allowed to control
  whether memory accesses are bypassing the cache. This means that Xen needs to ensure that
  all writes (such as the ones during scrubbing) have reached the memory before handing over
  the page to a guest. Unfortunately, the operation to clean the cache is happening before checking
  if the page was scrubbed. Therefore there is no guarantee when all the writes will reach the
  memory.
