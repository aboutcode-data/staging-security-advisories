  - CVE-2025-58144
summary: '[This CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities
  correspond to which CVE.]  There are two issues related to the mapping of pages belonging
  to other domains: For one, an assertion is wrong there, where the case actually needs handling.  A
  NULL pointer de-reference could result on a release build.  This is CVE-2025-58144.  And then
  the P2M lock isn''t held until a page reference was actually obtained (or the attempt to do
  so has failed).  Otherwise the page can not only change type, but even ownership in between,
  thus allowing domain boundaries to be violated.  This is CVE-2025-58145.'
