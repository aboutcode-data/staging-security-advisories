  - CVE-2025-58150
summary: Shadow mode tracing code uses a set of per-CPU variables to avoid cumbersome parameter
  passing.  Some of these variables are written to with guest controlled data, of guest controllable
  size.  That size can be larger than the variable, and bounding of the writes was missing.
