summary: Unlike 32-bit PV guests, HVM guests may switch freely between 64-bit and other modes.  This
  in particular means that they may set registers used to pass 32-bit-mode hypercall arguments
  to values outside of the range 32-bit code would be able to set them to.  When processing
  of hypercalls takes a considerable amount of time, the hypervisor may choose to invoke a hypercall
  continuation.  Doing so involves putting (perhaps updated) hypercall arguments in respective
  registers.  For guests not running in 64-bit mode this further involves a certain amount of
  translation of the values.  Unfortunately internal sanity checking of these translated values
  assumes high halves of registers to always be clear when invoking a hypercall.  When this
  is found not to be the case, it triggers a consistency check in the hypervisor and causes
  a crash.
