  - CVE-2020-15564
summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing Arm guest OS users to cause
  a hypervisor crash because of a missing alignment check in VCPUOP_register_vcpu_info. The
  hypercall VCPUOP_register_vcpu_info is used by a guest to register a shared region with the
  hypervisor. The region will be mapped into Xen address space so it can be directly accessed.
  On Arm, the region is accessed with instructions that require a specific alignment. Unfortunately,
  there is no check that the address provided by the guest will be correctly aligned. As a result,
  a malicious guest could cause a hypervisor crash by passing a misaligned address. A malicious
  guest administrator may cause a hypervisor crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).
  All Xen versions are vulnerable. Only Arm systems are vulnerable. x86 systems are not affected.
