  - CVE-2020-25601
summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There is a lack of preemption in evtchn_reset()
  / evtchn_destroy(). In particular, the FIFO event channel model allows guests to have a large
  number of event channels active at a time. Closing all of these (when resetting all event
  channels or when cleaning up after the guest) may take extended periods of time. So far, there
  was no arrangement for preemption at suitable intervals, allowing a CPU to spend an almost
  unbounded amount of time in the processing of these operations. Malicious or buggy guest kernels
  can mount a Denial of Service (DoS) attack affecting the entire system. All Xen versions are
  vulnerable in principle. Whether versions 4.3 and older are vulnerable depends on underlying
  hardware characteristics.
