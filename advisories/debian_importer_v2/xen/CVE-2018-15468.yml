  - CVE-2018-15468
summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.11.x. The DEBUGCTL MSR contains several debugging
  features, some of which virtualise cleanly, but some do not. In particular, Branch Trace Store
  is not virtualised by the processor, and software has to be careful to configure it suitably
  not to lock up the core. As a result, it must only be available to fully trusted guests. Unfortunately,
  in the case that vPMU is disabled, all value checking was skipped, allowing the guest to choose
  any MSR_DEBUGCTL setting it likes. A malicious or buggy guest administrator (on Intel x86
  HVM or PVH) can lock up the entire host, causing a Denial of Service.
