  - CVE-2020-29482
summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. A guest may access xenstore paths via
  absolute paths containing a full pathname, or via a relative path, which implicitly includes
  /local/domain/$DOMID for their own domain id. Management tools must access paths in guests'
  namespaces, necessarily using absolute paths. oxenstored imposes a pathname limit that is
  applied solely to the relative or absolute path specified by the client. Therefore, a guest
  can create paths in its own namespace which are too long for management tools to access. Depending
  on the toolstack in use, a malicious guest administrator might cause some management tools
  and debugging operations to fail. For example, a guest administrator can cause "xenstore-ls
  -r" to fail. However, a guest administrator cannot prevent the host administrator from tearing
  down the domain. All systems using oxenstored are vulnerable. Building and using oxenstored
  is the default in the upstream Xen distribution, if the Ocaml compiler is available. Systems
  using C xenstored are not vulnerable.
