summary: An issue was discovered in Xen 4.14.x. There is a missing unlock in the XENMEM_acquire_resource
  error path. The RCU (Read, Copy, Update) mechanism is a synchronisation primitive. A buggy
  error path in the XENMEM_acquire_resource exits without releasing an RCU reference, which
  is conceptually similar to forgetting to unlock a spinlock. A buggy or malicious HVM stubdomain
  can cause an RCU reference to be leaked. This causes subsequent administration operations,
  (e.g., CPU offline) to livelock, resulting in a host Denial of Service. The buggy codepath
  has been present since Xen 4.12. Xen 4.14 and later are vulnerable to the DoS. The side effects
  are believed to be benign on Xen 4.12 and 4.13, but patches are provided nevertheless. The
  vulnerability can generally only be exploited by x86 HVM VMs, as these are generally the only
  type of VM that have a Qemu stubdomain. x86 PV and PVH domains, as well as ARM VMs, typically
  don't use a stubdomain. Only VMs using HVM stubdomains can exploit the vulnerability. VMs
  using PV stubdomains, or with emulators running in dom0, cannot exploit the vulnerability.
