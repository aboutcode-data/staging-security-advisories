  - CVE-2020-11739
summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing guest OS users to cause a denial
  of service or possibly gain privileges because of missing memory barriers in read-write unlock
  paths. The read-write unlock paths don't contain a memory barrier. On Arm, this means a processor
  is allowed to re-order the memory access with the preceding ones. In other words, the unlock
  may be seen by another processor before all the memory accesses within the "critical" section.
  As a consequence, it may be possible to have a writer executing a critical section at the
  same time as readers or another writer. In other words, many of the assumptions (e.g., a variable
  cannot be modified after a check) in the critical sections are not safe anymore. The read-write
  locks are used in hypercalls (such as grant-table ones), so a malicious guest could exploit
  the race. For instance, there is a small window where Xen can leak memory if XENMAPSPACE_grant_table
  is used concurrently. A malicious guest may be able to leak memory, or cause a hypervisor
  crash resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Information leak and privilege escalation cannot
  be excluded.
