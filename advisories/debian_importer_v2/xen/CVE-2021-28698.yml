summary: long running loops in grant table handling In order to properly monitor resource use,
  Xen maintains information on the grant mappings a domain may create to map grants offered
  by other domains. In the process of carrying out certain actions, Xen would iterate over all
  such entries, including ones which aren't in use anymore and some which may have been created
  but never used. If the number of entries for a given domain is large enough, this iterating
  of the entire table may tie up a CPU for too long, starving other domains or causing issues
  in the hypervisor itself. Note that a domain may map its own grants, i.e. there is no need
  for multiple domains to be involved here. A pair of "cooperating" guests may, however, cause
  the effects to be more severe.
