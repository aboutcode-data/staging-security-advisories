summary: 'In the context switch logic Xen attempts to skip an IBPB in the case of a vCPU returning
  to a CPU on which it was the previous vCPU to run. While safe for Xen''s isolation between
  vCPUs, this prevents the guest kernel correctly isolating between tasks.  Consider:   1) vCPU
  runs on CPU A, running task 1.  2) vCPU moves to CPU B, idle gets scheduled on A.  Xen skips
  IBPB.  3) On CPU B, guest kernel switches from task 1 to 2, issuing IBPB.  4) vCPU moves back
  to CPU A.  Xen skips IBPB again.  Now, task 2 is running on CPU A with task 1''s training
  still in the BTB.'
