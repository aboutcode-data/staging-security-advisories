  - CVE-2023-46839
summary: PCI devices can make use of a functionality called phantom functions, that when enabled
  allows the device to generate requests using the IDs of functions that are otherwise unpopulated.  This
  allows a device to extend the number of outstanding requests.  Such phantom functions need
  an IOMMU context setup, but failure to setup the context is not fatal when the device is assigned.  Not
  failing device assignment when such failure happens can lead to the primary device being assigned
  to a guest, while some of the phantom functions are assigned to a different domain.
