summary: Oxenstored 32->31 bit integer truncation issues Integers in Ocaml are 63 or 31 bits
  of signed precision. The Ocaml Xenbus library takes a C uint32_t out of the ring and casts
  it directly to an Ocaml integer. In 64-bit Ocaml builds this is fine, but in 32-bit builds,
  it truncates off the most significant bit, and then creates unsigned/signed confusion in the
  remainder. This in turn can feed a negative value into logic not expecting a negative value,
  resulting in unexpected exceptions being thrown. The unexpected exception is not handled suitably,
  creating a busy-loop trying (and failing) to take the bad packet out of the xenstore ring.
