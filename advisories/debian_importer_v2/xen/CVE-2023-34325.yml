  - CVE-2023-34325
summary: '[This CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities
  correspond to which CVE.]  libfsimage contains parsing code for several filesystems, most
  of them based on grub-legacy code.  libfsimage is used by pygrub to inspect guest disks.  Pygrub
  runs as the same user as the toolstack (root in a priviledged domain).  At least one issue
  has been reported to the Xen Security Team that allows an attacker to trigger a stack buffer
  overflow in libfsimage.  After further analisys the Xen Security Team is no longer confident
  in the suitability of libfsimage when run against guest controlled input with super user priviledges.  In
  order to not affect current deployments that rely on pygrub patches are provided in the resolution
  section of the advisory that allow running pygrub in deprivileged mode.  CVE-2023-4949 refers
  to the original issue in the upstream grub project ("An attacker with local access to a system
  (either through a disk or external drive) can present a modified XFS partition to grub-legacy
  in such a way to exploit a memory corruption in grub’s XFS file system implementation.")  CVE-2023-34325
  refers specifically to the vulnerabilities in Xen''s copy of libfsimage, which is decended
  from a very old version of grub.'
