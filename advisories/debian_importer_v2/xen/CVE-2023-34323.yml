  - CVE-2023-34323
summary: When a transaction is committed, C Xenstored will first check the quota is correct
  before attempting to commit any nodes.  It would be possible that accounting is temporarily
  negative if a node has been removed outside of the transaction.  Unfortunately, some versions
  of C Xenstored are assuming that the quota cannot be negative and are using assert() to confirm
  it.  This will lead to C Xenstored crash when tools are built without -DNDEBUG (this is the
  default).
