  - CVE-2020-11742
summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing guest OS users to cause a denial
  of service because of bad continuation handling in GNTTABOP_copy. Grant table operations are
  expected to return 0 for success, and a negative number for errors. The fix for CVE-2017-12135
  introduced a path through grant copy handling where success may be returned to the caller
  without any action taken. In particular, the status fields of individual operations are left
  uninitialised, and may result in errant behaviour in the caller of GNTTABOP_copy. A buggy
  or malicious guest can construct its grant table in such a way that, when a backend domain
  tries to copy a grant, it hits the incorrect exit path. This returns success to the caller
  without doing anything, which may cause crashes or other incorrect behaviour.
