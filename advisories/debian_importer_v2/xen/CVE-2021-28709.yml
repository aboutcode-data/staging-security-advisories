  - CVE-2021-28709
summary: issues with partially successful P2M updates on x86 T[his CNA information record relates
  to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
  x86 HVM and PVH guests may be started in populate-on-demand (PoD) mode, to provide a way for
  them to later easily have more memory assigned. Guests are permitted to control certain P2M
  aspects of individual pages via hypercalls. These hypercalls may act on ranges of pages specified
  via page orders (resulting in a power-of-2 number of pages). In some cases the hypervisor
  carries out the requests by splitting them into smaller chunks. Error handling in certain
  PoD cases has been insufficient in that in particular partial success of some operations was
  not properly accounted for. There are two code paths affected - page removal (CVE-2021-28705)
  and insertion of new pages (CVE-2021-28709). (We provide one patch which combines the fix
  to both issues.)
