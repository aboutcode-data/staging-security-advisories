  - CVE-2023-46836
summary: The fixes for XSA-422 (Branch Type Confusion) and XSA-434 (Speculative Return Stack
  Overflow) are not IRQ-safe.  It was believed that the mitigations always operated in contexts
  with IRQs disabled.  However, the original XSA-254 fix for Meltdown (XPTI) deliberately left
  interrupts enabled on two entry paths; one unconditionally, and one conditionally on whether
  XPTI was active.  As BTC/SRSO and Meltdown affect different CPU vendors, the mitigations are
  not active together by default.  Therefore, there is a race condition whereby a malicious
  PV guest can bypass BTC/SRSO protections and launch a BTC/SRSO attack against Xen.
