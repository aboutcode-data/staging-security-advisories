aliases:
  - CVE-2018-15470
summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.11.x. The logic in oxenstored for handling
  writes depended on the order of evaluation of expressions making up a tuple. As indicated
  in section 7.7.3 "Operations on data structures" of the OCaml manual, the order of evaluation
  of subexpressions is not specified. In practice, different implementations behave differently.
  Thus, oxenstored may not enforce the configured quota-maxentity. This allows a malicious or
  buggy guest to write as many xenstore entries as it wishes, causing unbounded memory usage
  in oxenstored. This can lead to a system-wide DoS.
