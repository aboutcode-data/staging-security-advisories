  - CVE-2020-25595
summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. The PCI passthrough code improperly
  uses register data. Code paths in Xen's MSI handling have been identified that act on unsanitized
  values read back from device hardware registers. While devices strictly compliant with PCI
  specifications shouldn't be able to affect these registers, experience shows that it's very
  common for devices to have out-of-spec "backdoor" operations that can affect the result of
  these reads. A not fully trusted guest may be able to crash Xen, leading to a Denial of Service
  (DoS) for the entire system. Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be excluded.
  All versions of Xen supporting PCI passthrough are affected. Only x86 systems are vulnerable.
  Arm systems are not vulnerable. Only guests with passed through PCI devices may be able to
  leverage the vulnerability. Only systems passing through devices with out-of-spec ("backdoor")
  functionality can cause issues. Experience shows that such out-of-spec functionality is common;
  unless you have reason to believe that your device does not have such functionality, it's
  better to assume that it does.
