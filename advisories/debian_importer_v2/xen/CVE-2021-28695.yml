  - CVE-2021-28695
summary: IOMMU page mapping issues on x86 T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs;
  the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Both AMD and Intel
  allow ACPI tables to specify regions of memory which should be left untranslated, which typically
  means these addresses should pass the translation phase unaltered. While these are typically
  device specific ACPI properties, they can also be specified to apply to a range of devices,
  or even all devices. On all systems with such regions Xen failed to prevent guests from undoing/replacing
  such mappings (CVE-2021-28694). On AMD systems, where a discontinuous range is specified by
  firmware, the supposedly-excluded middle range will also be identity-mapped (CVE-2021-28695).
  Further, on AMD systems, upon de-assigment of a physical device from a guest, the identity
  mappings would be left in place, allowing a guest continued access to ranges of memory which
  it shouldn't have access to anymore (CVE-2021-28696).
