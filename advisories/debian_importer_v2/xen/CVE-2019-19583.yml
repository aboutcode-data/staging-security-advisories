summary: 'An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing x86 HVM/PVH guest OS users
  to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) because VMX VMEntry checks mishandle a certain
  case. Please see XSA-260 for background on the MovSS shadow. Please see XSA-156 for background
  on the need for #DB interception. The VMX VMEntry checks do not like the exact combination
  of state which occurs when #DB in intercepted, Single Stepping is active, and blocked by STI/MovSS
  is active, despite this being a legitimate state to be in. The resulting VMEntry failure is
  fatal to the guest. HVM/PVH guest userspace code may be able to crash the guest, resulting
  in a guest Denial of Service. All versions of Xen are affected. Only systems supporting VMX
  hardware virtual extensions (Intel, Cyrix, or Zhaoxin CPUs) are affected. Arm and AMD systems
  are unaffected. Only HVM/PVH guests are affected. PV guests cannot leverage the vulnerability.'
