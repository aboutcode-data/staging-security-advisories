  - CVE-2020-11741
summary: 'An issue was discovered in xenoprof in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing guest OS users
  (with active profiling) to obtain sensitive information about other guests, cause a denial
  of service, or possibly gain privileges. For guests for which "active" profiling was enabled
  by the administrator, the xenoprof code uses the standard Xen shared ring structure. Unfortunately,
  this code did not treat the guest as a potential adversary: it trusts the guest not to modify
  buffer size information or modify head / tail pointers in unexpected ways. This can crash
  the host (DoS). Privilege escalation cannot be ruled out.'
