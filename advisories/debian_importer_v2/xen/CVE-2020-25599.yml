  - CVE-2020-25599
summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There are evtchn_reset() race conditions.
  Uses of EVTCHNOP_reset (potentially by a guest on itself) or XEN_DOMCTL_soft_reset (by itself
  covered by XSA-77) can lead to the violation of various internal assumptions. This may lead
  to out of bounds memory accesses or triggering of bug checks. In particular, x86 PV guests
  may be able to elevate their privilege to that of the host. Host and guest crashes are also
  possible, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). Information leaks cannot be ruled out. All
  Xen versions from 4.5 onwards are vulnerable. Xen versions 4.4 and earlier are not vulnerable.
