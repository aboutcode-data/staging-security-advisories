summary: Another race in XENMAPSPACE_grant_table handling Guests are permitted access to certain
  Xen-owned pages of memory. The majority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a
  guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, are de-allocated when
  a guest switches (back) from v2 to v1. Freeing such pages requires that the hypervisor enforce
  that no parallel request can result in the addition of a mapping of such a page to a guest.
  That enforcement was missing, allowing guests to retain access to pages that were freed and
  perhaps re-used for other purposes. Unfortunately, when XSA-379 was being prepared, this similar
  issue was not noticed.
