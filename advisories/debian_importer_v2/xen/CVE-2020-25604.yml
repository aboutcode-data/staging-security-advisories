  - CVE-2020-25604
summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There is a race condition when migrating
  timers between x86 HVM vCPUs. When migrating timers of x86 HVM guests between its vCPUs, the
  locking model used allows for a second vCPU of the same guest (also operating on the timers)
  to release a lock that it didn't acquire. The most likely effect of the issue is a hang or
  crash of the hypervisor, i.e., a Denial of Service (DoS). All versions of Xen are affected.
  Only x86 systems are vulnerable. Arm systems are not vulnerable. Only x86 HVM guests can leverage
  the vulnerability. x86 PV and PVH cannot leverage the vulnerability. Only guests with more
  than one vCPU can exploit the vulnerability.
