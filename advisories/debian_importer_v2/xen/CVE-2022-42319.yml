  - CVE-2022-42319
summary: 'Xenstore: Guests can cause Xenstore to not free temporary memory When working on a
  request of a guest, xenstored might need to allocate quite large amounts of memory temporarily.
  This memory is freed only after the request has been finished completely. A request is regarded
  to be finished only after the guest has read the response message of the request from the
  ring page. Thus a guest not reading the response can cause xenstored to not free the temporary
  memory. This can result in memory shortages causing Denial of Service (DoS) of xenstored.'
