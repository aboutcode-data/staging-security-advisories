summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing ARM guest OS users to cause
  a denial of service via a XENMEM_add_to_physmap hypercall. p2m->max_mapped_gfn is used by
  the functions p2m_resolve_translation_fault() and p2m_get_entry() to sanity check guest physical
  frame. The rest of the code in the two functions will assume that there is a valid root table
  and check that with BUG_ON(). The function p2m_get_root_pointer() will ignore the unused top
  bits of a guest physical frame. This means that the function p2m_set_entry() will alias the
  frame. However, p2m->max_mapped_gfn will be updated using the original frame. It would be
  possible to set p2m->max_mapped_gfn high enough to cover a frame that would lead p2m_get_root_pointer()
  to return NULL in p2m_get_entry() and p2m_resolve_translation_fault(). Additionally, the sanity
  check on p2m->max_mapped_gfn is off-by-one allowing "highest mapped + 1" to be considered
  valid. However, p2m_get_root_pointer() will return NULL. The problem could be triggered with
  a specially crafted hypercall XENMEM_add_to_physmap{, _batch} followed by an access to an
  address (via hypercall or direct access) that passes the sanity check but cause p2m_get_root_pointer()
  to return NULL. A malicious guest administrator may cause a hypervisor crash, resulting in
  a Denial of Service (DoS). Xen version 4.8 and newer are vulnerable. Only Arm systems are
  vulnerable. x86 systems are not affected.
