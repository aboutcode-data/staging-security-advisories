summary: inadequate grant-v2 status frames array bounds check The v2 grant table interface separates
  grant attributes from grant status. That is, when operating in this mode, a guest has two
  tables. As a result, guests also need to be able to retrieve the addresses that the new status
  tracking table can be accessed through. For 32-bit guests on x86, translation of requests
  has to occur because the interface structure layouts commonly differ between 32- and 64-bit.
  The translation of the request to obtain the frame numbers of the grant status table involves
  translating the resulting array of frame numbers. Since the space used to carry out the translation
  is limited, the translation layer tells the core function the capacity of the array within
  translation space. Unfortunately the core function then only enforces array bounds to be below
  8 times the specified value, and would write past the available space if enough frame numbers
  needed storing.
