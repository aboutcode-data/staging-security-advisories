summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There is mishandling of the constraint
  that once-valid event channels may not turn invalid. Logic in the handling of event channel
  operations in Xen assumes that an event channel, once valid, will not become invalid over
  the life time of a guest. However, operations like the resetting of all event channels may
  involve decreasing one of the bounds checked when determining validity. This may lead to bug
  checks triggering, crashing the host. An unprivileged guest may be able to crash Xen, leading
  to a Denial of Service (DoS) for the entire system. All Xen versions from 4.4 onwards are
  vulnerable. Xen versions 4.3 and earlier are not vulnerable. Only systems with untrusted guests
  permitted to create more than the default number of event channels are vulnerable. This number
  depends on the architecture and type of guest. For 32-bit x86 PV guests, this is 1023; for
  64-bit x86 PV guests, and for all ARM guests, this number is 4095. Systems where untrusted
  guests are limited to fewer than this number are not vulnerable. Note that xl and libxl limit
  max_event_channels to 1023 by default, so systems using exclusively xl, libvirt+libxl, or
  their own toolstack based on libxl, and not explicitly setting max_event_channels, are not
  vulnerable.
