  - CVE-2021-21330
summary: aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. In
  aiohttp before version 3.7.4 there is an open redirect vulnerability. A maliciously crafted
  link to an aiohttp-based web-server could redirect the browser to a different website. It
  is caused by a bug in the `aiohttp.web_middlewares.normalize_path_middleware` middleware.
  This security problem has been fixed in 3.7.4. Upgrade your dependency using pip as follows
  "pip install aiohttp >= 3.7.4". If upgrading is not an option for you, a workaround can be
  to avoid using `aiohttp.web_middlewares.normalize_path_middleware` in your applications.
