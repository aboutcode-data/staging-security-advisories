  - CVE-2023-37276
summary: aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. aiohttp
  v3.8.4 and earlier are bundled with llhttp v6.0.6. Vulnerable code is used by aiohttp for
  its HTTP request parser when available which is the default case when installing from a wheel.
  This vulnerability only affects users of aiohttp as an HTTP server (ie `aiohttp.Application`),
  you are not affected by this vulnerability if you are using aiohttp as an HTTP client library
  (ie `aiohttp.ClientSession`). Sending a crafted HTTP request will cause the server to misinterpret
  one of the HTTP header values leading to HTTP request smuggling. This issue has been addressed
  in version 3.8.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade can reinstall aiohttp
  using `AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS=1` as an environment variable to disable the llhttp HTTP request
  parser implementation. The pure Python implementation isn't vulnerable.
