  - CVE-2024-52303
summary: aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. In
  versions starting with 3.10.6 and prior to 3.10.11, a memory leak can occur when a request
  produces a MatchInfoError. This was caused by adding an entry to a cache on each request,
  due to the building of each MatchInfoError producing a unique cache entry. An attacker may
  be able to exhaust the memory resources of a server by sending a substantial number (100,000s
  to millions) of such requests. Those who use any middlewares with aiohttp.web should upgrade
  to version 3.10.11 to receive a patch.
