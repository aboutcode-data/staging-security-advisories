  - CVE-2023-47641
summary: aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. Affected
  versions of aiohttp have a security vulnerability regarding the inconsistent interpretation
  of the http protocol. HTTP/1.1 is a persistent protocol, if both Content-Length(CL) and Transfer-Encoding(TE)
  header values are present it can lead to incorrect interpretation of two entities that parse
  the HTTP and we can poison other sockets with this incorrect interpretation. A possible Proof-of-Concept
  (POC) would be a configuration with a reverse proxy(frontend) that accepts both CL and TE
  headers and aiohttp as backend. As aiohttp parses anything with chunked, we can pass a chunked123
  as TE, the frontend entity will ignore this header and will parse Content-Length. The impact
  of this vulnerability is that it is possible to bypass any proxy rule, poisoning sockets to
  other users like passing Authentication Headers, also if it is present an Open Redirect an
  attacker could combine it to redirect random users to another website and log the request.
  This vulnerability has been addressed in release 3.8.0 of aiohttp. Users are advised to upgrade.
  There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
