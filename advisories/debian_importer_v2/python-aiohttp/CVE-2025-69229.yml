  - CVE-2025-69229
summary: AIOHTTP is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. In
  versions 3.13.2 and below, handling of chunked messages can result in excessive blocking CPU
  usage when receiving a large number of chunks. If an application makes use of the request.read()
  method in an endpoint, it may be possible for an attacker to cause the server to spend a moderate
  amount of blocking CPU time (e.g. 1 second) while processing the request. This could potentially
  lead to DoS as the server would be unable to handle other requests during that time. This
  issue is fixed in version 3.13.3.
