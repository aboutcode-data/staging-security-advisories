aliases:
  - CVE-2006-4089
summary: Multiple buffer overflows in Andy Lo-A-Foe AlsaPlayer 0.99.76 and earlier allow remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash), or have other unknown impact,
  via (1) a long Location field sent by a web server, which triggers an overflow in the reconnect
  function in reader/http/http.c; (2) a long URL sent by a web server when AlsaPlayer is seeking
  a media file for the playlist, which triggers overflows in new_list_item and CbUpdated in
  interface/gtk/PlaylistWindow.cpp; and (3) a long response sent by a CDDB server, which triggers
  an overflow in cddb_lookup in input/ccda/cdda_engine.c.
