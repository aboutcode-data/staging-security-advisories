aliases:
  - CVE-2021-3468
summary: A flaw was found in avahi in versions 0.6 up to 0.8. The event used to signal the termination
  of the client connection on the avahi Unix socket is not correctly handled in the client_work
  function, allowing a local attacker to trigger an infinite loop. The highest threat from this
  vulnerability is to the availability of the avahi service, which becomes unresponsive after
  this flaw is triggered.
