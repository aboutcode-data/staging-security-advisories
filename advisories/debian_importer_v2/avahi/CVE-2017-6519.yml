aliases:
  - CVE-2017-6519
summary: 'avahi-daemon in Avahi through 0.6.32 and 0.7 inadvertently responds to IPv6 unicast
  queries with source addresses that are not on-link, which allows remote attackers to cause
  a denial of service (traffic amplification) and may cause information leakage by obtaining
  potentially sensitive  information from the responding device via port-5353 UDP packets.  NOTE:
  this may overlap CVE-2015-2809.'
