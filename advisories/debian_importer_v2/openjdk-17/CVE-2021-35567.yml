  typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets,
  that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the
  Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified
  Component, e.g., through a web service which supplies data to the APIs. CVSS 3.1 Base Score
