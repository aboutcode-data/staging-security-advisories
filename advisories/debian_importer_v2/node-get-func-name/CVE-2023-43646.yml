summary: 'get-func-name is a module to retrieve a function''s name securely and consistently
  both in NodeJS and the browser. Versions prior to 2.0.1 are subject to a regular expression
  denial of service (redos) vulnerability which may lead to a denial of service when parsing
  malicious input. This vulnerability can be exploited when there is an imbalance in parentheses,
  which results in excessive backtracking and subsequently increases the CPU load and processing
  time significantly. This vulnerability can be triggered using the following input: ''\t''.repeat(54773)
  + ''\t/function/i''. This issue has been addressed in commit `f934b228b` which has been included
  in releases from 2.0.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
  vulnerability.'
