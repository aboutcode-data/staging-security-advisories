aliases:
  - CVE-2017-3225
summary: Das U-Boot is a device bootloader that can read its configuration from an AES encrypted
  file. For devices utilizing this environment encryption mode, U-Boot's use of a zero initialization
  vector may allow attacks against the underlying cryptographic implementation and allow an
  attacker to decrypt the data. Das U-Boot's AES-CBC encryption feature uses a zero (0) initialization
  vector. This allows an attacker to perform dictionary attacks on encrypted data produced by
  Das U-Boot to learn information about the encrypted data.
