  - CVE-2025-41066
summary: Horde Groupware v5.2.22 has a user enumeration vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated
  attacker to determine the existence of valid accounts on the system. To exploit the vulnerability,
  an HTTP request must be sent to ‘/imp/attachment.php’ including the parameters ‘id’ and ‘u’.
  If the specified user exists, the server will return the download of an empty file; if it
  does not exist, no download will be initiated, which unequivocally reveals the validity of
  the user.
