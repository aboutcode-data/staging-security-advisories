aliases:
  - CVE-2021-29922
summary: library/std/src/net/parser.rs in Rust before 1.53.0 does not properly consider extraneous
  zero characters at the beginning of an IP address string, which (in some situations) allows
  attackers to bypass access control that is based on IP addresses, because of unexpected octal
  interpretation.
