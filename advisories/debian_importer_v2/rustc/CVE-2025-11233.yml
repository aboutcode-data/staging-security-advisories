  - CVE-2025-11233
summary: 'Starting from Rust 1.87.0 and before Rust 1.89.0, the tier 3 Cygwin target (`x86_64-pc-cygwin`)
  didn''t correctly handle path separators, causing the standard library''s Path API to ignore
  path components separated by backslashes. Due to this, programs compiled for Cygwin that validate
  paths could misbehave, potentially allowing path traversal attacks or malicious filesystem
  operations.     Rust 1.89.0 fixes the issue by handling both Win32 and Unix style paths in
  the standard library for the Cygwin target.    While we assess the severity of this vulnerability
  as "medium", please note that the tier 3 Cygwin compilation target is only available when
  building it from source: no pre-built binaries are distributed by the Rust project, and it
  cannot be installed through Rustup. Unless you manually compiled the `x86_64-pc-cygwin` target
  you are not affected by this vulnerability. Users of the tier 1 MinGW target (`x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`)
  are also explicitly not affected.'
