  - CVE-2019-12083
summary: The Rust Programming Language Standard Library 1.34.x before 1.34.2 contains a stabilized
  method which, if overridden, can violate Rust's safety guarantees and cause memory unsafety.
  If the `Error::type_id` method is overridden then any type can be safely cast to any other
  type, causing memory safety vulnerabilities in safe code (e.g., out-of-bounds write or read).
  Code that does not manually implement Error::type_id is unaffected.
