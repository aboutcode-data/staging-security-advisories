aliases:
  - CVE-2006-7094
summary: ftpd, as used by Gentoo and Debian Linux, sets the gid to the effective uid instead
  of the effective group id before executing /bin/ls, which allows remote authenticated users
  to list arbitrary directories with the privileges of gid 0 and possibly enable additional
  attack vectors.
