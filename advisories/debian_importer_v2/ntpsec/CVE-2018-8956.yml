aliases:
  - CVE-2018-8956
summary: ntpd in ntp 4.2.8p10, 4.2.8p11, 4.2.8p12 and 4.2.8p13 allow remote attackers to prevent
  a broadcast client from synchronizing its clock with a broadcast NTP server via soofed mode
  3 and mode 5 packets. The attacker must either be a part of the same broadcast network or
  control a slave in that broadcast network that can capture certain required packets on the
  attacker's behalf and send them to the attacker.
