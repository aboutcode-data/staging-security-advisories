  - CVE-2021-22212
summary: ntpkeygen can generate keys that ntpd fails to parse. NTPsec 1.2.0 allows ntpkeygen
  to generate keys with '#' characters. ntpd then either pads, shortens the key, or fails to
  load these keys entirely, depending on the key type and the placement of the '#'. This results
  in the administrator not being able to use the keys as expected or the keys are shorter than
  expected and easier to brute-force, possibly resulting in MITM attacks between ntp clients
  and ntp servers. For short AES128 keys, ntpd generates a warning that it is padding them.
