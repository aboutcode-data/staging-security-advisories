aliases:
  - CVE-2018-7184
summary: ntpd in ntp 4.2.8p4 before 4.2.8p11 drops bad packets before updating the "received"
  timestamp, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (disruption) by sending
  a packet with a zero-origin timestamp causing the association to reset and setting the contents
  of the packet as the most recent timestamp. This issue is a result of an incomplete fix for
  CVE-2015-7704.
