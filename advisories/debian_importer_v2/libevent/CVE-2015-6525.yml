  - CVE-2015-6525
summary: 'Multiple integer overflows in the evbuffer API in Libevent 2.0.x before 2.0.22 and
  2.1.x before 2.1.5-beta allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service or
  possibly have other unspecified impact via "insanely large inputs" to the (1) evbuffer_add,
  (2) evbuffer_prepend, (3) evbuffer_expand, (4) exbuffer_reserve_space, or (5) evbuffer_read
  function, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow or an infinite loop.  NOTE: this identifier
  was SPLIT from CVE-2014-6272 per ADT3 due to different affected versions.'
