  - CVE-2014-6272
summary: 'Multiple integer overflows in the evbuffer API in Libevent 1.4.x before 1.4.15, 2.0.x
  before 2.0.22, and 2.1.x before 2.1.5-beta allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial
  of service or possibly have other unspecified impact via "insanely large inputs" to the (1)
  evbuffer_add, (2) evbuffer_expand, or (3) bufferevent_write function, which triggers a heap-based
  buffer overflow or an infinite loop.  NOTE: this identifier has been SPLIT per ADT3 due to
  different affected versions. See CVE-2015-6525 for the functions that are only affected in
  2.0 and later.'
