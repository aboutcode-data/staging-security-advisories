  - CVE-2022-31197
summary: PostgreSQL JDBC Driver (PgJDBC for short) allows Java programs to connect to a PostgreSQL
  database using standard, database independent Java code. The PGJDBC implementation of the
  `java.sql.ResultRow.refreshRow()` method is not performing escaping of column names so a malicious
  column name that contains a statement terminator, e.g. `;`, could lead to SQL injection. This
  could lead to executing additional SQL commands as the application's JDBC user. User applications
  that do not invoke the `ResultSet.refreshRow()` method are not impacted. User application
  that do invoke that method are impacted if the underlying database that they are querying
  via their JDBC application may be under the control of an attacker. The attack requires the
  attacker to trick the user into executing SQL against a table name who's column names would
  contain the malicious SQL and subsequently invoke the `refreshRow()` method on the ResultSet.
  Note that the application's JDBC user and the schema owner need not be the same. A JDBC application
  that executes as a privileged user querying database schemas owned by potentially malicious
  less-privileged users would be vulnerable. In that situation it may be possible for the malicious
  user to craft a schema that causes the application to execute commands as the privileged user.
  Patched versions will be released as `42.2.26` and `42.4.1`. Users are advised to upgrade.
  There are no known workarounds for this issue.
