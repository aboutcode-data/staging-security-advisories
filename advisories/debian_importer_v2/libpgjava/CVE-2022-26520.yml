  - CVE-2022-26520
summary: 'In pgjdbc before 42.3.3, an attacker (who controls the jdbc URL or properties) can
  call java.util.logging.FileHandler to write to arbitrary files through the loggerFile and
  loggerLevel connection properties. An example situation is that an attacker could create an
  executable JSP file under a Tomcat web root. NOTE: the vendor''s position is that there is
  no pgjdbc vulnerability; instead, it is a vulnerability for any application to use the pgjdbc
  driver with untrusted connection properties'
