summary: 'Interaction error in the PostgreSQL JDBC driver before 8.2, when used with a PostgreSQL
  server with the "standard_conforming_strings" option enabled, such as the default configuration
  of PostgreSQL 9.1, does not properly escape unspecified JDBC statement parameters, which allows
  remote attackers to perform SQL injection attacks.  NOTE: as of 20120330, it was claimed that
  the upstream developer planned to dispute this issue, but an official dispute has not been
  posted as of 20121005.'
