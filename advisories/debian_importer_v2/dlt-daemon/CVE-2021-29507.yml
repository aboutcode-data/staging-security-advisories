summary: GENIVI Diagnostic Log and Trace (DLT) provides a log and trace interface. In versions
  of GENIVI DLT between 2.10.0 and 2.18.6, a configuration file containing the special characters
  could cause a vulnerable component to crash. All the applications which are using the configuration
  file could fail to generate their dlt logs in system. As of time of publication, no patch
  exists. As a workaround, one may check the integrity of information in configuration file
  manually.
