aliases:
  - CVE-2017-11171
summary: Bad reference counting in the context of accept_ice_connection() in gsm-xsmp-server.c
  in old versions of gnome-session up until version 2.29.92 allows a local attacker to establish
  ICE connections to gnome-session with invalid authentication data (an invalid magic cookie).
  Each failed authentication attempt will leak a file descriptor in gnome-session. When the
  maximum number of file descriptors is exhausted in the gnome-session process, it will enter
  an infinite loop trying to communicate without success, consuming 100% of the CPU. The graphical
  session associated with the gnome-session process will stop working correctly, because communication
  with gnome-session is no longer possible.
