aliases:
  - CVE-2020-26160
summary: jwt-go before 4.0.0-preview1 allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions
  in situations with []string{} for m["aud"] (which is allowed by the specification). Because
  the type assertion fails, "" is the value of aud. This is a security problem if the JWT token
  is presented to a service that lacks its own audience check.
