  - CVE-2006-0986
summary: 'WordPress 2.0.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information
  via a direct request to (1) default-filters.php, (2) template-loader.php, (3) rss-functions.php,
  (4) locale.php, (5) wp-db.php, and (6) kses.php in the wp-includes/ directory; and (7) edit-form-advanced.php,
  (8) admin-functions.php, (9) edit-link-form.php, (10) edit-page-form.php, (11) admin-footer.php,
  and (12) menu.php in the wp-admin directory; and possibly (13) list directory contents of
  the wp-includes directory.  NOTE: the vars.php, edit-form.php, wp-settings.php, and edit-form-comment.php
  vectors are already covered by CVE-2005-4463.  The menu-header.php vector is already covered
  by CVE-2005-2110.  Other vectors might be covered by CVE-2005-1688.  NOTE: if the typical
  installation of WordPress does not list any site-specific files to wp-includes, then vector
  [13] is not an exposure.'
