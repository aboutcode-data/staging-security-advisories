aliases:
  - CVE-2019-9787
summary: WordPress before 5.1.1 does not properly filter comment content, leading to Remote
  Code Execution by unauthenticated users in a default configuration. This occurs because CSRF
  protection is mishandled, and because Search Engine Optimization of A elements is performed
  incorrectly, leading to XSS. The XSS results in administrative access, which allows arbitrary
  changes to .php files. This is related to wp-admin/includes/ajax-actions.php and wp-includes/comment.php.
