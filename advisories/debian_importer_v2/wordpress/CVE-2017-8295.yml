aliases:
  - CVE-2017-8295
summary: 'WordPress through 4.7.4 relies on the Host HTTP header for a password-reset e-mail
  message, which makes it easier for remote attackers to reset arbitrary passwords by making
  a crafted wp-login.php?action=lostpassword request and then arranging for this message to
  bounce or be resent, leading to transmission of the reset key to a mailbox on an attacker-controlled
  SMTP server. This is related to problematic use of the SERVER_NAME variable in wp-includes/pluggable.php
  in conjunction with the PHP mail function. Exploitation is not achievable in all cases because
  it requires at least one of the following: (1) the attacker can prevent the victim from receiving
  any e-mail messages for an extended period of time (such as 5 days), (2) the victim''s e-mail
  system sends an autoresponse containing the original message, or (3) the victim manually composes
  a reply containing the original message.'
