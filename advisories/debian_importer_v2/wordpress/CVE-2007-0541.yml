aliases:
  - CVE-2007-0541
summary: WordPress allows remote attackers to determine the existence of arbitrary files, and
  possibly read portions of certain files, via pingback service calls with a source URI that
  corresponds to a local pathname, which triggers different fault codes for existing and non-existing
  files, and in certain configurations causes a brief file excerpt to be published as a blog
  comment.
