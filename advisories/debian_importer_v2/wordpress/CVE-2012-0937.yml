  - CVE-2012-0937
summary: 'wp-admin/setup-config.php in the installation component in WordPress 3.3.1 and earlier
  does not limit the number of MySQL queries sent to external MySQL database servers, which
  allows remote attackers to use WordPress as a proxy for brute-force attacks or denial of service
  attacks via the dbhost parameter, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-4898.  NOTE: the
  vendor disputes the significance of this issue because an incomplete WordPress installation
  might be present on the network for only a short time'
