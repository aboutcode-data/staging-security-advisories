  - CVE-2018-14028
summary: In WordPress 4.9.7, plugins uploaded via the admin area are not verified as being ZIP
  files. This allows for PHP files to be uploaded. Once a PHP file is uploaded, the plugin extraction
  fails, but the PHP file remains in a predictable wp-content/uploads location, allowing for
  an attacker to then execute the file. This represents a security risk in limited scenarios
  where an attacker (who does have the required capabilities for plugin uploads) cannot simply
  place arbitrary PHP code into a valid plugin ZIP file and upload that plugin, because a machine's
  wp-content/plugins directory permissions were set up to block all new plugins.
