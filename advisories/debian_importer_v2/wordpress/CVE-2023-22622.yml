aliases:
  - CVE-2023-22622
summary: WordPress through 6.1.1 depends on unpredictable client visits to cause wp-cron.php
  execution and the resulting security updates, and the source code describes "the scenario
  where a site may not receive enough visits to execute scheduled tasks in a timely manner,"
  but neither the installation guide nor the security guide mentions this default behavior,
  or alerts the user about security risks on installations with very few visits.
