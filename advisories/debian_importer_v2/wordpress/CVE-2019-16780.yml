aliases:
  - CVE-2019-16780
summary: WordPress users with lower privileges (like contributors) can inject JavaScript code
  in the block editor using a specific payload, which is executed within the dashboard. This
  can lead to XSS if an admin opens the post in the editor. Execution of this attack does require
  an authenticated user. This has been patched in WordPress 5.3.1, along with all the previous
  WordPress versions from 3.7 to 5.3 via a minor release. Automatic updates are enabled by default
  for minor releases and we strongly recommend that you keep them enabled.
