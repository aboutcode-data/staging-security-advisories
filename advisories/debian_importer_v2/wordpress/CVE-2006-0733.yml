summary: 'Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in WordPress 2.0.0 allows remote attackers
  to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via scriptable attributes such as (1) onfocus and (2)
  onblur in the "author''s website" field.  NOTE: followup comments to the researcher''s web
  log suggest that this issue is only exploitable by the same user who injects the XSS, so this
  might not be a vulnerability'
