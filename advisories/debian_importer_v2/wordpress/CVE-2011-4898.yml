  - CVE-2011-4898
summary: 'wp-admin/setup-config.php in the installation component in WordPress 3.3.1 and earlier
  generates different error messages for requests lacking a dbname parameter depending on whether
  the MySQL credentials are valid, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct brute-force
  attacks via a series of requests with different uname and pwd parameters.  NOTE: the vendor
  disputes the significance of this issue; also, it is unclear whether providing intentionally
  vague error messages during installation would be reasonable from a usability perspective'
