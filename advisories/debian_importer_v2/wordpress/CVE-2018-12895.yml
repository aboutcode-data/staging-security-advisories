aliases:
  - CVE-2018-12895
summary: WordPress through 4.9.6 allows Author users to execute arbitrary code by leveraging
  directory traversal in the wp-admin/post.php thumb parameter, which is passed to the PHP unlink
  function and can delete the wp-config.php file. This is related to missing filename validation
  in the wp-includes/post.php wp_delete_attachment function. The attacker must have capabilities
  for files and posts that are normally available only to the Author, Editor, and Administrator
  roles. The attack methodology is to delete wp-config.php and then launch a new installation
  process to increase the attacker's privileges.
