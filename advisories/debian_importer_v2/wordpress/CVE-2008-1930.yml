aliases:
  - CVE-2008-1930
summary: 'The cookie authentication method in WordPress 2.5 relies on a hash of a concatenated
  string containing USERNAME and EXPIRY_TIME, which allows remote attackers to forge cookies
  by registering a username that results in the same concatenated string, as demonstrated by
  registering usernames beginning with "admin" to obtain administrator privileges, aka a "cryptographic
  splicing" issue.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-6013.'
