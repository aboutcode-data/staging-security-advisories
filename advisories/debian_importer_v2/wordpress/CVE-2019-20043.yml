summary: In in wp-includes/rest-api/endpoints/class-wp-rest-posts-controller.php in WordPress
  3.7 to 5.3.0, authenticated users who do not have the rights to publish a post are able to
  mark posts as sticky or unsticky via the REST API. For example, the contributor role does
  not have such rights, but this allowed them to bypass that. This has been patched in WordPress
  5.3.1, along with all the previous WordPress versions from 3.7 to 5.3 via a minor release.
