  - CVE-2021-39201
summary: 'WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired
  with a MySQL or MariaDB database. ### Impact The issue allows an authenticated but low-privileged
  user (like contributor/author) to execute XSS in the editor. This bypasses the restrictions
  imposed on users who do not have the permission to post `unfiltered_html`. ### Patches This
  has been patched in WordPress 5.8, and will be pushed to older versions via minor releases
  (automatic updates). It''s strongly recommended that you keep auto-updates enabled to receive
  the fix. ### References https://wordpress.org/news/category/releases/ https://hackerone.com/reports/1142140
