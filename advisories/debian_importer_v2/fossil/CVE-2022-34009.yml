  - CVE-2022-34009
summary: Fossil 2.18 on Windows allows attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash)
  via an XSS payload in a ticket. This occurs because the ticket data is stored in a temporary
  file, and the product does not properly handle the absence of this file after Windows Defender
  has flagged it as malware.
