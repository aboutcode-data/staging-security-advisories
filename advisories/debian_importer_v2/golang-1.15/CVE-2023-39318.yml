summary: The html/template package does not properly handle HTML-like "" comment tokens, nor
  hashbang "#!" comment tokens, in <script> contexts. This may cause the template parser to
  improperly interpret the contents of <script> contexts, causing actions to be improperly escaped.
  This may be leveraged to perform an XSS attack.
