  - CVE-2023-24534
summary: HTTP and MIME header parsing can allocate large amounts of memory, even when parsing
  small inputs, potentially leading to a denial of service. Certain unusual patterns of input
  data can cause the common function used to parse HTTP and MIME headers to allocate substantially
  more memory than required to hold the parsed headers. An attacker can exploit this behavior
  to cause an HTTP server to allocate large amounts of memory from a small request, potentially
  leading to memory exhaustion and a denial of service. With fix, header parsing now correctly
  allocates only the memory required to hold parsed headers.
