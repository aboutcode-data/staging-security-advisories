summary: os.OpenFile(path, os.O_CREATE|O_EXCL) behaved differently on Unix and Windows systems
  when the target path was a dangling symlink. On Unix systems, OpenFile with O_CREATE and O_EXCL
  flags never follows symlinks. On Windows, when the target path was a symlink to a nonexistent
  location, OpenFile would create a file in that location. OpenFile now always returns an error
  when the O_CREATE and O_EXCL flags are both set and the target path is a symlink.
