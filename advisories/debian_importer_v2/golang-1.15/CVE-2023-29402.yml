summary: The go command may generate unexpected code at build time when using cgo. This may
  result in unexpected behavior when running a go program which uses cgo. This may occur when
  running an untrusted module which contains directories with newline characters in their names.
  Modules which are retrieved using the go command, i.e. via "go get", are not affected (modules
  retrieved using GOPATH-mode, i.e. GO111MODULE=off, may be affected).
