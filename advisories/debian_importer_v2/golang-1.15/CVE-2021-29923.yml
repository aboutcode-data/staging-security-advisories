summary: Go before 1.17 does not properly consider extraneous zero characters at the beginning
  of an IP address octet, which (in some situations) allows attackers to bypass access control
  that is based on IP addresses, because of unexpected octal interpretation. This affects net.ParseIP
  and net.ParseCIDR.
