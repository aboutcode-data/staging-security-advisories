summary: The go command may execute arbitrary code at build time when using cgo. This may occur
  when running "go get" on a malicious module, or when running any other command which builds
  untrusted code. This is can by triggered by linker flags, specified via a "#cgo LDFLAGS" directive.
  The arguments for a number of flags which are non-optional are incorrectly considered optional,
  allowing disallowed flags to be smuggled through the LDFLAGS sanitization. This affects usage
  of both the gc and gccgo compilers.
