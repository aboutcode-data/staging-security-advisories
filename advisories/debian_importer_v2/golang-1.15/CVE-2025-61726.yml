summary: The net/url package does not set a limit on the number of query parameters in a query.
  While the maximum size of query parameters in URLs is generally limited by the maximum request
  header size, the net/http.Request.ParseForm method can parse large URL-encoded forms. Parsing
  a large form containing many unique query parameters can cause excessive memory consumption.
