  - CVE-2022-41724
summary: Large handshake records may cause panics in crypto/tls. Both clients and servers may
  send large TLS handshake records which cause servers and clients, respectively, to panic when
  attempting to construct responses. This affects all TLS 1.3 clients, TLS 1.2 clients which
  explicitly enable session resumption (by setting Config.ClientSessionCache to a non-nil value),
  and TLS 1.3 servers which request client certificates (by setting Config.ClientAuth >= RequestClientCert).
