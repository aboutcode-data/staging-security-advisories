  - CVE-2022-41716
summary: Due to unsanitized NUL values, attackers may be able to maliciously set environment
  variables on Windows. In syscall.StartProcess and os/exec.Cmd, invalid environment variable
  values containing NUL values are not properly checked for. A malicious environment variable
  value can exploit this behavior to set a value for a different environment variable. For example,
  the environment variable string "A=B\x00C=D" sets the variables "A=B" and "C=D".
