summary: A malicious HTTP sender can use chunk extensions to cause a receiver reading from a
  request or response body to read many more bytes from the network than are in the body. A
  malicious HTTP client can further exploit this to cause a server to automatically read a large
  amount of data (up to about 1GiB) when a handler fails to read the entire body of a request.
  Chunk extensions are a little-used HTTP feature which permit including additional metadata
  in a request or response body sent using the chunked encoding. The net/http chunked encoding
  reader discards this metadata. A sender can exploit this by inserting a large metadata segment
  with each byte transferred. The chunk reader now produces an error if the ratio of real body
  to encoded bytes grows too small.
