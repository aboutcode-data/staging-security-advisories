  - CVE-2018-17191
summary: Apache NetBeans (incubating) 9.0 NetBeans Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) interpretation
  is vulnerable for remote command execution (RCE). Using the nashorn script engine the environment
  of the javascript execution for the Proxy Auto-Configuration leaks privileged objects, that
  can be used to circumvent the execution limits. If a different script engine was used, no
  execution limits were in place. Both vectors allow remote code execution.
