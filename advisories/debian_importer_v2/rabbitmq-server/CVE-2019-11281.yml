  - CVE-2019-11281
summary: Pivotal RabbitMQ, versions prior to v3.7.18, and RabbitMQ for PCF, versions 1.15.x
  prior to 1.15.13, versions 1.16.x prior to 1.16.6, and versions 1.17.x prior to 1.17.3, contain
  two components, the virtual host limits page, and the federation management UI, which do not
  properly sanitize user input. A remote authenticated malicious user with administrative access
  could craft a cross site scripting attack that would gain access to virtual hosts and policy
  management information.
