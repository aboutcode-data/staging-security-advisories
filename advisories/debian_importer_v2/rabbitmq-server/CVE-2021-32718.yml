  - CVE-2021-32718
summary: RabbitMQ is a multi-protocol messaging broker. In rabbitmq-server prior to version
  3.8.17, a new user being added via management UI could lead to the user's bane being rendered
  in a confirmation message without proper `<script>` tag sanitization, potentially allowing
  for JavaScript code execution in the context of the page. In order for this to occur, the
  user must be signed in and have elevated permissions (other user management). The vulnerability
  is patched in RabbitMQ 3.8.17. As a workaround, disable `rabbitmq_management` plugin and use
  CLI tools for management operations and Prometheus and Grafana for metrics and monitoring.
