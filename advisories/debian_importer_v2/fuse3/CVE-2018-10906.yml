  - CVE-2018-10906
summary: In fuse before versions 2.9.8 and 3.x before 3.2.5, fusermount is vulnerable to a restriction
  bypass when SELinux is active. This allows non-root users to mount a FUSE file system with
  the 'allow_other' mount option regardless of whether 'user_allow_other' is set in the fuse
  configuration. An attacker may use this flaw to mount a FUSE file system, accessible by other
  users, and trick them into accessing files on that file system, possibly causing Denial of
  Service or other unspecified effects.
