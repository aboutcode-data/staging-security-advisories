  - CVE-2021-29625
summary: Adminer is open-source database management software. A cross-site scripting vulnerability
  in Adminer versions 4.6.1 to 4.8.0 affects users of MySQL, MariaDB, PgSQL and SQLite. XSS
  is in most cases prevented by strict CSP in all modern browsers. The only exception is when
  Adminer is using a `pdo_` extension to communicate with the database (it is used if the native
  extensions are not enabled). In browsers without CSP, Adminer versions 4.6.1 to 4.8.0 are
  affected. The vulnerability is patched in version 4.8.1. As workarounds, one can use a browser
  supporting strict CSP or enable the native PHP extensions (e.g. `mysqli`) or disable displaying
  PHP errors (`display_errors`).
