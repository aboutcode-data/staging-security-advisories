  - CVE-2021-3603
summary: PHPMailer 6.4.1 and earlier contain a vulnerability that can result in untrusted code
  being called (if such code is injected into the host project's scope by other means). If the
  $patternselect parameter to validateAddress() is set to 'php' (the default, defined by PHPMailer::$validator),
  and the global namespace contains a function called php, it will be called in preference to
  the built-in validator of the same name. Mitigated in PHPMailer 6.5.0 by denying the use of
  simple strings as validator function names.
