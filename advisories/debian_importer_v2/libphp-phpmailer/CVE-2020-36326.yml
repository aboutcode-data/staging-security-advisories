  - CVE-2020-36326
summary: 'PHPMailer 6.1.8 through 6.4.0 allows object injection through Phar Deserialization
  via addAttachment with a UNC pathname. NOTE: this is similar to CVE-2018-19296, but arose
  because 6.1.8 fixed a functionality problem in which UNC pathnames were always considered
  unreadable by PHPMailer, even in safe contexts. As an unintended side effect, this fix eliminated
  the code that blocked addAttachment exploitation.'
