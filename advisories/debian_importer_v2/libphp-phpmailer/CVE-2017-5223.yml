summary: An issue was discovered in PHPMailer before 5.2.22. PHPMailer's msgHTML method applies
  transformations to an HTML document to make it usable as an email message body. One of the
  transformations is to convert relative image URLs into attachments using a script-provided
  base directory. If no base directory is provided, it resolves to /, meaning that relative
  image URLs get treated as absolute local file paths and added as attachments. To form a remote
  vulnerability, the msgHTML method must be called, passed an unfiltered, user-supplied HTML
  document, and must not set a base directory.
