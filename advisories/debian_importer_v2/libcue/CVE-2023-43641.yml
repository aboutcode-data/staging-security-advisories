  - CVE-2023-43641
summary: libcue provides an API for parsing and extracting data from CUE sheets. Versions 2.2.1
  and prior are vulnerable to out-of-bounds array access. A user of the GNOME desktop environment
  can be exploited by downloading a cue sheet from a malicious webpage. Because the file is
  saved to `~/Downloads`, it is then automatically scanned by tracker-miners. And because it
  has a .cue filename extension, tracker-miners use libcue to parse the file. The file exploits
  the vulnerability in libcue to gain code execution. This issue is patched in version 2.3.0.
