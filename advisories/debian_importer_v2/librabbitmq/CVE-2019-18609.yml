aliases:
  - CVE-2019-18609
summary: An issue was discovered in amqp_handle_input in amqp_connection.c in rabbitmq-c 0.9.0.
  There is an integer overflow that leads to heap memory corruption in the handling of CONNECTION_STATE_HEADER.
  A rogue server could return a malicious frame header that leads to a smaller target_size value
  than needed. This condition is then carried on to a memcpy function that copies too much data
  into a heap buffer.
