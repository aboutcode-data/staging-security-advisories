aliases:
  - CVE-2010-2252
summary: GNU Wget 1.12 and earlier uses a server-provided filename instead of the original URL
  to determine the destination filename of a download, which allows remote servers to create
  or overwrite arbitrary files via a 3xx redirect to a URL with a .wgetrc filename followed
  by a 3xx redirect to a URL with a crafted filename, and possibly execute arbitrary code as
  a consequence of writing to a dotfile in a home directory.
