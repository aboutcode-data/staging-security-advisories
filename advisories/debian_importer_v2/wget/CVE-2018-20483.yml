aliases:
  - CVE-2018-20483
summary: set_file_metadata in xattr.c in GNU Wget before 1.20.1 stores a file's origin URL in
  the user.xdg.origin.url metadata attribute of the extended attributes of the downloaded file,
  which allows local users to obtain sensitive information (e.g., credentials contained in the
  URL) by reading this attribute, as demonstrated by getfattr. This also applies to Referer
  information in the user.xdg.referrer.url metadata attribute. According to 2016-07-22 in the
  Wget ChangeLog, user.xdg.origin.url was partially based on the behavior of fwrite_xattr in
  tool_xattr.c in curl.
