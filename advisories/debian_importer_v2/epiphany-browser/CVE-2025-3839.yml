aliases:
  - CVE-2025-3839
summary: A flaw was found in Epiphany, a tool that allows websites to open external URL handler
  applications with minimal user interaction. This design can be misused to exploit vulnerabilities
  within those handlers, making them appear remotely exploitable. The browser fails to properly
  warn or gate this action, resulting in potential code execution on the client device via trusted
  UI behavior.
