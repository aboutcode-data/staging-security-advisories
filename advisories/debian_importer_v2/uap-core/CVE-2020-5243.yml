  - CVE-2020-5243
summary: uap-core before 0.7.3 is vulnerable to a denial of service attack when processing crafted
  User-Agent strings. Some regexes are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (REDoS)
  due to overlapping capture groups. This allows remote attackers to overload a server by setting
  the User-Agent header in an HTTP(S) request to maliciously crafted long strings. This has
  been patched in uap-core 0.7.3.
