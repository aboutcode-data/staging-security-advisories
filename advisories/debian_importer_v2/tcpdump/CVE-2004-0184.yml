  - CVE-2004-0184
summary: Integer underflow in the isakmp_id_print for TCPDUMP 3.8.1 and earlier allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via an ISAKMP packet with an Identification
  payload with a length that becomes less than 8 during byte order conversion, which causes
  an out-of-bounds read, as demonstrated by the Striker ISAKMP Protocol Test Suite.
