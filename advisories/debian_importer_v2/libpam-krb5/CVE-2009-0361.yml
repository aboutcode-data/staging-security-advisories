summary: Russ Allbery pam-krb5 before 3.13, as used by libpam-heimdal, su in Solaris 10, and
  other software, does not properly handle calls to pam_setcred when running setuid, which allows
  local users to overwrite and change the ownership of arbitrary files by setting the KRB5CCNAME
  environment variable, and then launching a setuid application that performs certain pam_setcred
  operations.
