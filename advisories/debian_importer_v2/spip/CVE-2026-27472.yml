summary: SPIP before 4.4.9 allows Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via syndicated sites
  in the private area. When editing a syndicated site, the application does not verify that
  the syndication URL is a valid remote URL, allowing an authenticated attacker to make the
  server issue requests to arbitrary internal or external destinations. This vulnerability is
  not mitigated by the SPIP security screen.
