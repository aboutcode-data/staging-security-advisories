summary: SPIP before 4.4.9 allows Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the private area, complementing
  an incomplete fix from SPIP 4.4.8. The echappe_anti_xss() function was not systematically
  applied to input, form, button, and anchor (a) HTML tags, allowing an attacker to inject malicious
  scripts through these elements. This vulnerability is not mitigated by the SPIP security screen.
