aliases:
  - CVE-2026-27475
summary: SPIP before 4.4.9 allows Insecure Deserialization in the public area through the table_valeur
  filter and the DATA iterator, which accept serialized data. An attacker who can place malicious
  serialized content (a pre-condition requiring prior access or another vulnerability) can trigger
  arbitrary object instantiation and potentially achieve code execution. The use of serialized
  data in these components has been deprecated and will be removed in SPIP 5. This vulnerability
  is not mitigated by the SPIP security screen.
