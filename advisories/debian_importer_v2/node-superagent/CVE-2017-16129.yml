  - CVE-2017-16129
summary: The HTTP client module superagent is vulnerable to ZIP bomb attacks. In a ZIP bomb
  attack, the HTTP server replies with a compressed response that becomes several magnitudes
  larger once uncompressed. If a client does not take special care when processing such responses,
  it may result in excessive CPU and/or memory consumption. An attacker might exploit such a
  weakness for a DoS attack. To exploit this the attacker must control the location (URL) that
  superagent makes a request to.
