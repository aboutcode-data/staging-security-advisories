summary: 'The web-based admin console in H2 Database Engine before 2.2.220 can be started via
  the CLI with the argument -webAdminPassword, which allows the user to specify the password
  in cleartext for the web admin console. Consequently, a local user (or an attacker that has
  obtained local access through some means) would be able to discover the password by listing
  processes and their arguments. NOTE: the vendor states "This is not a vulnerability of H2
  Console ... Passwords should never be passed on the command line and every qualified DBA or
  system administrator is expected to know that." Nonetheless, the issue was fixed in 2.2.220.'
