  - CVE-2023-45133
summary: 'Babel is a compiler for writingJavaScript. In `@babel/traverse` prior to versions
  7.23.2 and 8.0.0-alpha.4 and all versions of `babel-traverse`, using Babel to compile code
  that was specifically crafted by an attacker can lead to arbitrary code execution during compilation,
  when using plugins that rely on the `path.evaluate()`or `path.evaluateTruthy()` internal Babel
  methods. Known affected plugins are `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`; `@babel/preset-env`
  when using its `useBuiltIns` option; and any "polyfill provider" plugin that depends on `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider`,
  such as `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims`,
  `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator`. No other plugins under the `@babel/` namespace are impacted,
  but third-party plugins might be. Users that only compile trusted code are not impacted. The
  vulnerability has been fixed in `@babel/traverse@7.23.2` and `@babel/traverse@8.0.0-alpha.4`.
  Those who cannot upgrade `@babel/traverse` and are using one of the affected packages mentioned
  above should upgrade them to their latest version to avoid triggering the vulnerable code
  path in affected `@babel/traverse` versions: `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime` v7.23.2, `@babel/preset-env`
  v7.23.2, `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider` v0.4.3, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2`
  v0.4.6, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3` v0.8.5, `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims` v0.10.0,
  `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator` v0.5.3.'
