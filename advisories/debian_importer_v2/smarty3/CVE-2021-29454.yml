  - CVE-2021-29454
summary: Smarty is a template engine for PHP, facilitating the separation of presentation (HTML/CSS)
  from application logic. Prior to versions 3.1.42 and 4.0.2, template authors could run arbitrary
  PHP code by crafting a malicious math string. If a math string was passed through as user
  provided data to the math function, external users could run arbitrary PHP code by crafting
  a malicious math string. Users should upgrade to version 3.1.42 or 4.0.2 to receive a patch.
