  - CVE-2020-24661
summary: GNOME Geary before 3.36.3 mishandles pinned TLS certificate verification for IMAP and
  SMTP services using invalid TLS certificates (e.g., self-signed certificates) when the client
  system is not configured to use a system-provided PKCS#11 store. This allows a meddler in
  the middle to present a different invalid certificate to intercept incoming and outgoing mail.
