  - CVE-2021-31800
summary: Multiple path traversal vulnerabilities exist in smbserver.py in Impacket through 0.9.22.
  An attacker that connects to a running smbserver instance can list and write to arbitrary
  files via ../ directory traversal. This could potentially be abused to achieve arbitrary code
  execution by replacing /etc/shadow or an SSH authorized key.
