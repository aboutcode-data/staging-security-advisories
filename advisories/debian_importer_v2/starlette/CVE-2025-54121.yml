  - CVE-2025-54121
summary: Starlette is a lightweight ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) framework/toolkit,
  designed for building async web services in Python. In versions 0.47.1 and below, when parsing
  a multi-part form with large files (greater than the default max spool size) starlette will
  block the main thread to roll the file over to disk. This blocks the event thread which means
  the application can't accept new connections. The UploadFile code has a minor bug where instead
  of just checking for self._in_memory, the logic should also check if the additional bytes
  will cause a rollover. The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.47.2.
