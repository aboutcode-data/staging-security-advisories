  - CVE-2024-47874
summary: Starlette is an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) framework/toolkit. Prior
  to version 0.40.0, Starlette treats `multipart/form-data` parts without a `filename` as text
  form fields and buffers those in byte strings with no size limit. This allows an attacker
  to upload arbitrary large form fields and cause Starlette to both slow down significantly
  due to excessive memory allocations and copy operations, and also consume more and more memory
  until the server starts swapping and grinds to a halt, or the OS terminates the server process
  with an OOM error. Uploading multiple such requests in parallel may be enough to render a
  service practically unusable, even if reasonable request size limits are enforced by a reverse
  proxy in front of Starlette. This Denial of service (DoS) vulnerability affects all applications
  built with Starlette (or FastAPI) accepting form requests. Verison 0.40.0 fixes this issue.
