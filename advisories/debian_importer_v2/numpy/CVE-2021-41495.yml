  - CVE-2021-41495
summary: 'Null Pointer Dereference vulnerability exists in numpy.sort in NumPy &lt and 1.19
  in the PyArray_DescrNew function due to missing return-value validation, which allows attackers
  to conduct DoS attacks by repetitively creating sort arrays. NOTE: While correct that validation
  is missing, an error can only occur due to an exhaustion of memory. If the user can exhaust
  memory, they are already privileged. Further, it should be practically impossible to construct
  an attack which can target the memory exhaustion to occur at exactly this place'
