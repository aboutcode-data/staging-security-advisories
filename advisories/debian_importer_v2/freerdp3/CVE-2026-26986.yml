  - CVE-2026-26986
summary: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. Prior to version 3.23.0,
  `rail_window_free` dereferences a freed `xfAppWindow` pointer during `HashTable_Free` cleanup
  because `xf_rail_window_common` calls `free(appWindow)` on title allocation failure without
  first removing the entry from the `railWindows` hash table, leaving a dangling pointer that
  is freed again on disconnect. Version 3.23.0 fixes the vulnerability.
