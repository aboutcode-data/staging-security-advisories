summary: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. Versions on the 2.x
  branch prior to to 2.11.8 and on the 3.x branch prior to 3.23.0 have an out-of-bounds read
  vulnerability in the FreeRDP client's RDPGFX channel that allows a malicious RDP server to
  read uninitialized heap memory by sending a crafted WIRE_TO_SURFACE_2 PDU with a `bitmapDataLength`
  value larger than the actual data in the packet. This can lead to information disclosure or
  client crashes when a user connects to a malicious server. Versions 2.11.8 and 3.23.0 fix
  the issue.
