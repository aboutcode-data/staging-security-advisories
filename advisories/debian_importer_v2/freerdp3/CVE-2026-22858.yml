  - CVE-2026-22858
summary: 'FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. Prior to 3.20.1,
  global-buffer-overflow was observed in FreeRDP''s Base64 decoding path. The root cause appears
  to be implementation-defined char signedness: on Arm/AArch64 builds, plain char is treated
  as unsigned, so the guard c <= 0 can be optimized into a simple c != 0 check. As a result,
  non-ASCII bytes (e.g., 0x80-0xFF) may bypass the intended range restriction and be used as
  an index into a global lookup table, causing out-of-bounds access. This vulnerability is fixed
  in 3.20.1.'
