summary: An issue was discovered in allauth-django before 65.13.0. Both Okta and NetIQ were
  using preferred_username as the identifier for third-party provider accounts. That value may
  be mutable and should therefore be avoided for authorization decisions. The providers are
  now using sub instead.
