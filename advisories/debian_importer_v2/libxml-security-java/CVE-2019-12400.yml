  - CVE-2019-12400
summary: In version 2.0.3 Apache Santuario XML Security for Java, a caching mechanism was introduced
  to speed up creating new XML documents using a static pool of DocumentBuilders. However, if
  some untrusted code can register a malicious implementation with the thread context class
  loader first, then this implementation might be cached and re-used by Apache Santuario - XML
  Security for Java, leading to potential security flaws when validating signed documents, etc.
  The vulnerability affects Apache Santuario - XML Security for Java 2.0.x releases from 2.0.3
  and all 2.1.x releases before 2.1.4.
