  - CVE-2012-6153
summary: 'http/conn/ssl/AbstractVerifier.java in Apache Commons HttpClient before 4.2.3 does
  not properly verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject''s Common
  Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle
  attackers to spoof SSL servers via a certificate with a subject that specifies a common name
  in a field that is not the CN field.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix
  for CVE-2012-5783.'
