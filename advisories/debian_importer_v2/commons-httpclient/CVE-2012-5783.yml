summary: Apache Commons HttpClient 3.x, as used in Amazon Flexible Payments Service (FPS) merchant
  Java SDK and other products, does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name
  in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which
  allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.
