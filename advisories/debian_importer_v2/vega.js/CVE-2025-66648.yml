  - CVE-2025-66648
summary: vega-functions provides function implementations for the Vega expression language.
  Prior to version 6.1.1, for sites that allow users to supply untrusted user input, malicious
  use of an internal function (not part of the public API) could be used to run unintentional
  javascript (XSS). This issue is fixed in vega-functions `6.1.1`. There is no workaround besides
  upgrading. Using `vega.expressionInterpreter` as described in CSP safe mode does not prevent
  this issue.
