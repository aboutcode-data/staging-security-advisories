summary: Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing
  interactive visualization designs. In Vega prior to version 5.32.0, corresponding to vega-functions
  prior to version 5.17.0, users running Vega/Vega-lite JSON definitions could run unexpected
  JavaScript code when drawing graphs, unless the library was used with the `vega-interpreter`.
  Vega version 5.32.0 and vega-functions version 5.17.0 fix the issue. As a workaround, use
  `vega` with expression interpreter.
