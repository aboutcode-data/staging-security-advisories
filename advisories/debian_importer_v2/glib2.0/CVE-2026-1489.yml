  - CVE-2026-1489
summary: A flaw was found in GLib. An integer overflow vulnerability in its Unicode case conversion
  implementation can lead to memory corruption. By processing specially crafted and extremely
  large Unicode strings, an attacker could trigger an undersized memory allocation, resulting
  in out-of-bounds writes. This could cause applications utilizing GLib for string conversion
  to crash or become unstable.
