  - CVE-2021-28153
summary: An issue was discovered in GNOME GLib before 2.66.8. When g_file_replace() is used
  with G_FILE_CREATE_REPLACE_DESTINATION to replace a path that is a dangling symlink, it incorrectly
  also creates the target of the symlink as an empty file, which could conceivably have security
  relevance if the symlink is attacker-controlled. (If the path is a symlink to a file that
  already exists, then the contents of that file correctly remain unchanged.)
