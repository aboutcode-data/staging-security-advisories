  - CVE-2025-13601
summary: A heap-based buffer overflow problem was found in glib through an incorrect calculation
  of buffer size in the g_escape_uri_string() function. If the string to escape contains a very
  large number of unacceptable characters (which would need escaping), the calculation of the
  length of the escaped string could overflow, leading to a potential write off the end of the
  newly allocated string.
