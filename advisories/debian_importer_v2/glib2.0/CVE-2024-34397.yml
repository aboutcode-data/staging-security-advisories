  - CVE-2024-34397
summary: An issue was discovered in GNOME GLib before 2.78.5, and 2.79.x and 2.80.x before 2.80.1.
  When a GDBus-based client subscribes to signals from a trusted system service such as NetworkManager
  on a shared computer, other users of the same computer can send spoofed D-Bus signals that
  the GDBus-based client will wrongly interpret as having been sent by the trusted system service.
  This could lead to the GDBus-based client behaving incorrectly, with an application-dependent
  impact.
