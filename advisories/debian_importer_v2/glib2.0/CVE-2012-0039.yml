  - CVE-2012-0039
summary: 'GLib 2.31.8 and earlier, when the g_str_hash function is used, computes hash values
  without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent
  attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application
  that maintains a hash table. NOTE: this issue may be disputed by the vendor; the existence
  of the g_str_hash function is not a vulnerability in the library, because callers of g_hash_table_new
  and g_hash_table_new_full can specify an arbitrary hash function that is appropriate for the
  application.'
