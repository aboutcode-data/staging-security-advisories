  - CVE-2020-6750
summary: 'GSocketClient in GNOME GLib through 2.62.4 may occasionally connect directly to a
  target address instead of connecting via a proxy server when configured to do so, because
  the proxy_addr field is mishandled. This bug is timing-dependent and may occur only sporadically
  depending on network delays. The greatest security relevance is in use cases where a proxy
  is used to help with privacy/anonymity, even though there is no technical barrier to a direct
  connection. NOTE: versions before 2.60 are unaffected.'
