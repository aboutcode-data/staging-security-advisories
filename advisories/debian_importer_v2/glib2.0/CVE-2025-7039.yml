aliases:
  - CVE-2025-7039
summary: A flaw was found in glib. An integer overflow during temporary file creation leads
  to an out-of-bounds memory access, allowing an attacker to potentially perform path traversal
  or access private temporary file content by creating symbolic links. This vulnerability allows
  a local attacker to manipulate file paths and access unauthorized data. The core issue stems
  from insufficient validation of file path lengths during temporary file operations.
