  - CVE-2022-42889
summary: 'Apache Commons Text performs variable interpolation, allowing properties to be dynamically
  evaluated and expanded. The standard format for interpolation is "${prefix:name}", where "prefix"
  is used to locate an instance of org.apache.commons.text.lookup.StringLookup that performs
  the interpolation. Starting with version 1.5 and continuing through 1.9, the set of default
  Lookup instances included interpolators that could result in arbitrary code execution or contact
  with remote servers. These lookups are: - "script" - execute expressions using the JVM script
  execution engine (javax.script) - "dns" - resolve dns records - "url" - load values from urls,
  including from remote servers Applications using the interpolation defaults in the affected
  versions may be vulnerable to remote code execution or unintentional contact with remote servers
  if untrusted configuration values are used. Users are recommended to upgrade to Apache Commons
  Text 1.10.0, which disables the problematic interpolators by default.'
