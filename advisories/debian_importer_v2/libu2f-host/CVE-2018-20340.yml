summary: Yubico libu2f-host 1.1.6 contains unchecked buffers in devs.c, which could enable a
  malicious token to exploit a buffer overflow. An attacker could use this to attempt to execute
  malicious code using a crafted USB device masquerading as a security token on a computer where
  the affected library is currently in use. It is not possible to perform this attack with a
  genuine YubiKey.
