aliases:
  - CVE-2019-7443
summary: KDE KAuth before 5.55 allows the passing of parameters with arbitrary types to helpers
  running as root over DBus via DBusHelperProxy.cpp. Certain types can cause crashes, and trigger
  the decoding of arbitrary images with dynamically loaded plugins. In other words, KAuth unintentionally
  causes this plugin code to run as root, which increases the severity of any possible exploitation
  of a plugin vulnerability.
