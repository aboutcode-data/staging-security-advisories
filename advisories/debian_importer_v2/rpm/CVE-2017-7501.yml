summary: It was found that versions of rpm before 4.13.0.2 use temporary files with predictable
  names when installing an RPM. An attacker with ability to write in a directory where files
  will be installed could create symbolic links to an arbitrary location and modify content,
  and possibly permissions to arbitrary files, which could be used for denial of service or
  possibly privilege escalation.
