summary: It was found that rpm did not properly handle RPM installations when a destination
  path was a symbolic link to a directory, possibly changing ownership and permissions of an
  arbitrary directory, and RPM files being placed in an arbitrary destination. An attacker,
  with write access to a directory in which a subdirectory will be installed, could redirect
  that directory to an arbitrary location and gain root privilege.
