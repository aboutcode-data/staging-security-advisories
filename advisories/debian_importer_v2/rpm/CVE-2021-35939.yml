summary: 'It was found that the fix for CVE-2017-7500 and CVE-2017-7501 was incomplete: the
  check was only implemented for the parent directory of the file to be created. A local unprivileged
  user who owns another ancestor directory could potentially use this flaw to gain root privileges.
  The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well
  as system availability.'
