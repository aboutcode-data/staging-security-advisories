  - CVE-2011-3378
summary: RPM 4.4.x through 4.9.x, probably before 4.9.1.2, allows remote attackers to cause
  a denial of service (memory corruption) and possibly execute arbitrary code via an rpm package
  with crafted headers and offsets that are not properly handled when a package is queried or
  installed, related to (1) the regionSwab function, (2) the headerLoad function, and (3) multiple
  functions in rpmio/rpmpgp.c.
