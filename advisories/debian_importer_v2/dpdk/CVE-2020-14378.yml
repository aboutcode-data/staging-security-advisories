  - CVE-2020-14378
summary: An integer underflow in dpdk versions before 18.11.10 and before 19.11.5 in the `move_desc`
  function can lead to large amounts of CPU cycles being eaten up in a long running loop. An
  attacker could cause `move_desc` to get stuck in a 4,294,967,295-count iteration loop. Depending
  on how `vhost_crypto` is being used this could prevent other VMs or network tasks from being
  serviced by the busy DPDK lcore for an extended period.
