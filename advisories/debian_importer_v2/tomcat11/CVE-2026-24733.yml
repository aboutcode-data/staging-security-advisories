summary: 'Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.   Tomcat did not limit HTTP/0.9
  requests to the GET method. If a security  constraint was configured to allow HEAD requests
  to a URI but deny GET  requests, the user could bypass that constraint on GET requests by  sending
  a (specification invalid) HEAD request using HTTP/0.9.   This issue affects Apache Tomcat:
  from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.14, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.49, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.112.   Older,
  EOL versions are also affected.  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.15 or later,
  10.1.50 or later or 9.0.113 or later, which fixes the issue.'
