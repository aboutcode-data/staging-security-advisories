  - CVE-2025-61795
summary: 'Improper Resource Shutdown or Release vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.  If an error
  occurred (including exceeding limits) during the processing of a multipart upload, temporary
  copies of the uploaded parts written to disc were not cleaned up immediately but left for
  the garbage collection process to delete. Depending on JVM settings, application memory usage
  and application load, it was possible that space for the temporary copies of uploaded parts
  would be filled faster than GC cleared it, leading to a DoS.    This issue affects Apache
  Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.11, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.46, from 9.0.0.M1 through
  9.0.109.  The following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are  known to
  be affected: 8.5.0 though 8.5.100. Other, older, EOL versions may also be affected. Users
  are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.12 or later, 10.1.47 or later or 9.0.110 or later
  which fixes the issue.'
