  - CVE-2025-55754
summary: 'Improper Neutralization of Escape, Meta, or Control Sequences vulnerability in Apache
  Tomcat.  Tomcat did not escape ANSI escape sequences in log messages. If Tomcat was running
  in a console on a Windows operating system, and the console supported ANSI escape sequences,
  it was possible for an attacker to use a specially crafted URL to inject ANSI escape sequences
  to manipulate the console and the clipboard and attempt to trick an administrator into running
  an attacker controlled command. While no attack vector was found, it may have been possible
  to mount this attack on other operating systems.    This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from
  11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.10, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.44, from 9.0.40 through 9.0.108.  The
  following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are  known to be affected:
  8.5.60 though 8.5.100. Other, older, EOL versions may also be affected. Users are recommended
  to upgrade to version 11.0.11 or later, 10.1.45 or later or 9.0.109 or later, which fix the
  issue.'
