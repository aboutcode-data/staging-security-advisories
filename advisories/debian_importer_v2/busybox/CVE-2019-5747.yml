  - CVE-2019-5747
summary: 'An issue was discovered in BusyBox through 1.30.0. An out of bounds read in udhcp
  components (consumed by the DHCP client, server, and/or relay) might allow a remote attacker
  to leak sensitive information from the stack by sending a crafted DHCP message. This is related
  to assurance of a 4-byte length when decoding DHCP_SUBNET. NOTE: this issue exists because
  of an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-20679.'
