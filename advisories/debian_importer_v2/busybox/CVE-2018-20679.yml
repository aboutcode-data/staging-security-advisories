  - CVE-2018-20679
summary: An issue was discovered in BusyBox before 1.30.0. An out of bounds read in udhcp components
  (consumed by the DHCP server, client, and relay) allows a remote attacker to leak sensitive
  information from the stack by sending a crafted DHCP message. This is related to verification
  in udhcp_get_option() in networking/udhcp/common.c that 4-byte options are indeed 4 bytes.
