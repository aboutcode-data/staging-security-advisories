aliases:
  - CVE-2022-1271
summary: An arbitrary file write vulnerability was found in GNU gzip's zgrep utility. When zgrep
  is applied on the attacker's chosen file name (for example, a crafted file name), this can
  overwrite an attacker's content to an arbitrary attacker-selected file. This flaw occurs due
  to insufficient validation when processing filenames with two or more newlines where selected
  content and the target file names are embedded in crafted multi-line file names. This flaw
  allows a remote, low privileged attacker to force zgrep to write arbitrary files on the system.
