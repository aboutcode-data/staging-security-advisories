  - CVE-2022-35861
summary: pyenv 1.2.24 through 2.3.2 allows local users to gain privileges via a .python-version
  file in the current working directory. An attacker can craft a Python version string in .python-version
  to execute shims under their control. (Shims are executables that pass a command along to
  a specific version of pyenv. The version string is used to construct the path to the command,
  and there is no validation of whether the version specified is a valid version. Thus, relative
  path traversal can occur.)
