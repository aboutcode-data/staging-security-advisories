  - CVE-2025-23217
summary: mitmproxy is a interactive TLS-capable intercepting HTTP proxy for penetration testers
  and software developers and mitmweb is a web-based interface for mitmproxy. In mitmweb 11.1.1
  and below, a malicious client can use mitmweb's proxy server (bound to `*:8080` by default)
  to access mitmweb's internal API (bound to `127.0.0.1:8081` by default). In other words, while
  the cannot access the API directly, they can access the API through the proxy. An attacker
  may be able to escalate this SSRF-style access to remote code execution. The mitmproxy and
  mitmdump tools are unaffected. Only mitmweb is affected. This vulnerability has been fixed
  in mitmproxy 11.1.2 and above. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
  for this vulnerability.
