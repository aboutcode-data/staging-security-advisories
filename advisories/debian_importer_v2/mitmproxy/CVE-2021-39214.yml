  - CVE-2021-39214
summary: mitmproxy is an interactive, SSL/TLS-capable intercepting proxy. In mitmproxy 7.0.2
  and below, a malicious client or server is able to perform HTTP request smuggling attacks
  through mitmproxy. This means that a malicious client/server could smuggle a request/response
  through mitmproxy as part of another request/response's HTTP message body. While a smuggled
  request is still captured as part of another request's body, it does not appear in the request
  list and does not go through the usual mitmproxy event hooks, where users may have implemented
  custom access control checks or input sanitization. Unless one uses mitmproxy to protect an
  HTTP/1 service, no action is required. The vulnerability has been fixed in mitmproxy 7.0.3
  and above.
