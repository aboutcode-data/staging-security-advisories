  - CVE-2022-29221
summary: Smarty is a template engine for PHP, facilitating the separation of presentation (HTML/CSS)
  from application logic. Prior to versions 3.1.45 and 4.1.1, template authors could inject
  php code by choosing a malicious {block} name or {include} file name. Sites that cannot fully
  trust template authors should upgrade to versions 3.1.45 or 4.1.1 to receive a patch for this
  issue. There are currently no known workarounds.
