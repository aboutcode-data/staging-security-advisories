aliases:
  - CVE-2010-2251
summary: The get1 command, as used by lftpget, in LFTP before 4.0.6 does not properly validate
  a server-provided filename before determining the destination filename of a download, which
  allows remote servers to create or overwrite arbitrary files via a Content-Disposition header
  that suggests a crafted filename, and possibly execute arbitrary code as a consequence of
  writing to a dotfile in a home directory.
