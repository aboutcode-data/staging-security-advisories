  - CVE-2018-10916
summary: It has been discovered that lftp up to and including version 4.8.3 does not properly
  sanitize remote file names, leading to a loss of integrity on the local system when reverse
  mirroring is used. A remote attacker may trick a user to use reverse mirroring on an attacker
  controlled FTP server, resulting in the removal of all files in the current working directory
  of the victim's system.
