  - CVE-2007-2348
summary: 'mirror --script in lftp before 3.5.9 does not properly quote shell metacharacters,
  which might allow remote user-assisted attackers to execute shell commands via a malicious
  script.  NOTE: it is not clear whether this issue crosses security boundaries, since the script
  already supports commands such as "get" which could overwrite executable files.'
