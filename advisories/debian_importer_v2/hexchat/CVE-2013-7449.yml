aliases:
  - CVE-2013-7449
summary: The ssl_do_connect function in common/server.c in HexChat before 2.10.2, XChat, and
  XChat-GNOME does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the X.509 certificate,
  which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.
