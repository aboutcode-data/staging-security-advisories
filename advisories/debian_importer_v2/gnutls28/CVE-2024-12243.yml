aliases:
  - CVE-2024-12243
summary: A flaw was found in GnuTLS, which relies on libtasn1 for ASN.1 data processing. Due
  to an inefficient algorithm in libtasn1, decoding certain DER-encoded certificate data can
  take excessive time, leading to increased resource consumption. This flaw allows a remote
  attacker to send a specially crafted certificate, causing GnuTLS to become unresponsive or
  slow, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
