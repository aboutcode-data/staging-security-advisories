  - CVE-2023-0361
summary: A timing side-channel in the handling of RSA ClientKeyExchange messages was discovered
  in GnuTLS. This side-channel can be sufficient to recover the key encrypted in the RSA ciphertext
  across a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption the
  attacker would need to send a large amount of specially crafted messages to the vulnerable
  server. By recovering the secret from the ClientKeyExchange message, the attacker would be
  able to decrypt the application data exchanged over that connection.
