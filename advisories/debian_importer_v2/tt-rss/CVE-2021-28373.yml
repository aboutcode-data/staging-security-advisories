summary: 'The auth_internal plugin in Tiny Tiny RSS (aka tt-rss) before 2021-03-12 allows an
  attacker to log in via the OTP code without a valid password. NOTE: this issue only affected
  the git master branch for a short time. However, all end users are explicitly directed to
  use the git master branch in production. Semantic version numbers such as 21.03 appear to
  exist, but are automatically generated from the year and month. They are not releases.'
