aliases:
  - CVE-2009-4642
summary: gnome-screensaver 2.26.1 relies on the gnome-session D-Bus interface to determine session
  idle time, even when an Xfce desktop such as Xubuntu or Mythbuntu is used, which allows physically
  proximate attackers to access an unattended workstation on which screen locking had been intended.
