  - CVE-2013-1050
summary: The default configuration in gnome-screensaver 3.5.4 through 3.6.0 sets the AutostartCondition
  line to fallback mode in the .desktop file, which prevents the program from starting automatically
  after login and allows physically proximate attackers to bypass screen locking and access
  an unattended workstation.
