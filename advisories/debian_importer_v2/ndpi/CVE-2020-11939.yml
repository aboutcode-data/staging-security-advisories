aliases:
  - CVE-2020-11939
summary: In nDPI through 3.2 Stable, the SSH protocol dissector has multiple KEXINIT integer
  overflows that result in a controlled remote heap overflow in concat_hash_string in ssh.c.
  Due to the granular nature of the overflow primitive and the ability to control both the contents
  and layout of the nDPI library's heap memory through remote input, this vulnerability may
  be abused to achieve full Remote Code Execution against any network inspection stack that
  is linked against nDPI and uses it to perform network traffic analysis.
