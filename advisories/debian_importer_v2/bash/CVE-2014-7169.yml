  - CVE-2014-7169
summary: 'GNU Bash through 4.3 bash43-025 processes trailing strings after certain malformed
  function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers
  to write to files or possibly have unknown other impact via a crafted environment, as demonstrated
  by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules
  in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations
  in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution.  NOTE:
  this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271.'
