  - CVE-2014-6277
summary: 'GNU Bash through 4.3 bash43-026 does not properly parse function definitions in the
  values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or
  cause a denial of service (uninitialized memory access, and untrusted-pointer read and write
  operations) via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand
  feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts
  executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment
  occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because
  of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169.'
