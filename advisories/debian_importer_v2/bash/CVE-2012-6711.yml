aliases:
  - CVE-2012-6711
summary: A heap-based buffer overflow exists in GNU Bash before 4.3 when wide characters, not
  supported by the current locale set in the LC_CTYPE environment variable, are printed through
  the echo built-in function. A local attacker, who can provide data to print through the "echo
  -e" built-in function, may use this flaw to crash a script or execute code with the privileges
  of the bash process. This occurs because ansicstr() in lib/sh/strtrans.c mishandles u32cconv().
