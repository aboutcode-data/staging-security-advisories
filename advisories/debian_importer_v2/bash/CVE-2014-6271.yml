aliases:
  - CVE-2014-6271
summary: 'GNU Bash through 4.3 processes trailing strings after function definitions in the
  values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
  a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH
  sshd, the mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified
  DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege
  boundary from Bash execution, aka "ShellShock."  NOTE: the original fix for this issue was
  incorrect; CVE-2014-7169 has been assigned to cover the vulnerability that is still present
  after the incorrect fix.'
