  - CVE-2025-14936
summary: NSF Unidata NetCDF-C Attribute Name Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution
  Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected
  installations of NSF Unidata NetCDF-C. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability
  in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw
  exists within the parsing of attribute names. The issue results from the lack of proper validation
  of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer.
  An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current
  user. Was ZDI-CAN-27269.
