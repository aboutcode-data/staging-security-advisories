summary: NSF Unidata NetCDF-C NC Variable Integer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.
  This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations
  of NSF Unidata NetCDF-C. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that
  the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists
  within the parsing of NC variables. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of
  user-supplied data, which can result in an integer overflow before allocating a buffer. An
