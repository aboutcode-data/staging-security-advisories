aliases:
  - CVE-2024-1892
summary: A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the XMLFeedSpider
  class of the scrapy/scrapy project, specifically in the parsing of XML content. By crafting
  malicious XML content that exploits inefficient regular expression complexity used in the
  parsing process, an attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability
  allows for the system to hang and consume significant resources, potentially rendering services
  that utilize Scrapy for XML processing unresponsive.
