  - CVE-2024-3574
summary: In scrapy version 2.10.1, an issue was identified where the Authorization header, containing
  credentials for server authentication, is leaked to a third-party site during a cross-domain
  redirect. This vulnerability arises from the failure to remove the Authorization header when
  redirecting across domains. The exposure of the Authorization header to unauthorized actors
  could potentially allow for account hijacking.
