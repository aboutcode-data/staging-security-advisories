  - CVE-2021-41125
summary: Scrapy is a high-level web crawling and scraping framework for Python. If you use `HttpAuthMiddleware`
  (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for HTTP authentication, all requests
  will expose your credentials to the request target. This includes requests generated by Scrapy
  components, such as `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting
  is set to `True`, or as requests reached through redirects. Upgrade to Scrapy 2.5.1 and use
  the new `http_auth_domain` spider attribute to control which domains are allowed to receive
  the configured HTTP authentication credentials. If you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version,
  and upgrading to Scrapy 2.5.1 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.1 instead. If
  you cannot upgrade, set your HTTP authentication credentials on a per-request basis, using
  for example the `w3lib.http.basic_auth_header` function to convert your credentials into a
  value that you can assign to the `Authorization` header of your request, instead of defining
  your credentials globally using `HttpAuthMiddleware`.
