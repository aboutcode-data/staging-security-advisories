aliases:
  - CVE-2017-14158
summary: Scrapy 1.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption)
  via large files because arbitrarily many files are read into memory, which is especially problematic
  if the files are then individually written in a separate thread to a slow storage resource,
  as demonstrated by interaction between dataReceived (in core/downloader/handlers/http11.py)
  and S3FilesStore.
