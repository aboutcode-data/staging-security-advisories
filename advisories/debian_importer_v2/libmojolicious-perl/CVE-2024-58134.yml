  - CVE-2024-58134
summary: Mojolicious versions from 0.999922 for Perl uses a hard coded string, or the application's
  class name, as an HMAC session cookie secret by default.  These predictable default secrets
  can be exploited by an attacker to forge session cookies.  An attacker who knows or guesses
  the secret could compute valid HMAC signatures for the session cookie, allowing them to tamper
  with or hijack another user’s session.
