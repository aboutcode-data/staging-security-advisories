  - CVE-2024-58135
summary: Mojolicious versions from 7.28 for Perl will generate weak HMAC session cookie secrets
  via "mojo generate app" by default  When creating a default app skeleton with the "mojo generate
  app" tool, a weak secret is written to the application's configuration file using the insecure
  rand() function, and used for authenticating and protecting the integrity of the application's
  sessions. This may allow an attacker to brute force the application's session keys.
