  - CVE-2016-10727
summary: camel/providers/imapx/camel-imapx-server.c in the IMAPx component in GNOME evolution-data-server
  before 3.21.2 proceeds with cleartext data containing a password if the client wishes to use
  STARTTLS but the server will not use STARTTLS, which makes it easier for remote attackers
  to obtain sensitive information by sniffing the network. The server code was intended to report
  an error and not proceed, but the code was written incorrectly.
