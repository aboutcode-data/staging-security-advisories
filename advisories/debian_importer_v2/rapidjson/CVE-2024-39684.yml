  - CVE-2024-39684
summary: Tencent RapidJSON is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to an integer overflow
  in the `GenericReader::ParseNumber()` function of `include/rapidjson/reader.h` when parsing
  JSON text from a stream. An attacker needs to send the victim a crafted file which needs to
  be opened; this triggers the integer overflow vulnerability (when the file is parsed), leading
  to elevation of privilege.
