summary: The (1) dist or (2) distcheck rules in GNU Automake 1.11.1, 1.10.3, and release branches
  branch-1-4 through branch-1-9, when producing a distribution tarball for a package that uses
  Automake, assign insecure permissions (777) to directories in the build tree, which introduces
  a race condition that allows local users to modify the contents of package files, introduce
  Trojan horse programs, or conduct other attacks before the build is complete.
