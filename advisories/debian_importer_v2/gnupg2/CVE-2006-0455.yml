aliases:
  - CVE-2006-0455
summary: 'gpgv in GnuPG before 1.4.2.1, when using unattended signature verification, returns
  a 0 exit code in certain cases even when the detached signature file does not carry a signature,
  which could cause programs that use gpgv to assume that the signature verification has succeeded.  Note:
  this also occurs when running the equivalent command "gpg --verify".'
