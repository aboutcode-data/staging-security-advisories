  - CVE-2026-24881
summary: In GnuPG before 2.5.17, a crafted CMS (S/MIME) EnvelopedData message carrying an oversized
  wrapped session key can cause a stack-based buffer overflow in gpg-agent during PKDECRYPT--kem=CMS
  handling. This can easily be leveraged for denial of service; however, there is also memory
  corruption that could lead to remote code execution.
