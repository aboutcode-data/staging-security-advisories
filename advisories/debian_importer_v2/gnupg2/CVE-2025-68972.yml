  - CVE-2025-68972
summary: In GnuPG through 2.4.8, if a signed message has \f at the end of a plaintext line,
  an adversary can construct a modified message that places additional text after the signed
  material, such that signature verification of the modified message succeeds (although an "invalid
  armor" message is printed during verification). This is related to use of \f as a marker to
  denote truncation of a long plaintext line.
