aliases:
  - CVE-2006-0049
summary: gpg in GnuPG before 1.4.2.2 does not properly verify non-detached signatures, which
  allows attackers to inject unsigned data via a data packet that is not associated with a control
  packet, which causes the check for concatenated signatures to report that the signature is
  valid, a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-0455.
