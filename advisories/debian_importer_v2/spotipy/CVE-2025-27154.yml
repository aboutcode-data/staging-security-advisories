  - CVE-2025-27154
summary: Spotipy is a lightweight Python library for the Spotify Web API. The `CacheHandler`
  class creates a cache file to store the auth token. Prior to version 2.25.1, the file created
  has `rw-r--r--` (644) permissions by default, when it could be locked down to `rw-------`
  (600) permissions. This leads to overly broad exposure of the spotify auth token. If this
  token can be read by an attacker (another user on the machine, or a process running as another
  user), it can be used to perform administrative actions on the Spotify account, depending
  on the scope granted to the token. Version 2.25.1 tightens the cache file permissions.
