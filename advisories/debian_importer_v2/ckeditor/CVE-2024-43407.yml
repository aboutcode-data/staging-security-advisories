  - CVE-2024-43407
summary: CKEditor4 is an open source what-you-see-is-what-you-get HTML editor. A potential vulnerability
  has been discovered in CKEditor 4 Code Snippet GeSHi plugin. The vulnerability allowed a reflected
  XSS attack by exploiting a flaw in the GeSHi syntax highlighter library hosted by the victim.
  The GeSHi library was included as a vendor dependency in CKEditor 4 source files. In a specific
  scenario, an attacker could craft a malicious script that could be executed by sending a request
  to the GeSHi library hosted on a PHP web server. The GeSHi library is no longer actively maintained.
  Due to the lack of ongoing support and updates, potential security vulnerabilities have been
  identified with its continued use. To mitigate these risks and enhance the overall security
  of the CKEditor 4, we have decided to completely remove the GeSHi library as a dependency.
  This change aims to maintain a secure environment and reduce the risk of any security incidents
  related to outdated or unsupported software. The fix is be available in version 4.25.0-lts.
