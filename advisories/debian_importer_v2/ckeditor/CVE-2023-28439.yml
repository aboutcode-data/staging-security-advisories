summary: 'CKEditor4 is an open source what-you-see-is-what-you-get HTML editor. A cross-site
  scripting vulnerability has been discovered affecting Iframe Dialog and Media Embed packages.
  The vulnerability may trigger a JavaScript code after fulfilling special conditions: using
  one of the affected packages on a web page with missing proper Content Security Policy configuration;
  initializing the editor on an element and using an element other than `<textarea>` as a base;
  and destroying the editor instance. This vulnerability might affect a small percentage of
  integrators that depend on dynamic editor initialization/destroy mechanism.  A fix is available
  in CKEditor4 version 4.21.0. In some rare cases, a security fix may be considered a breaking
  change. Starting from version 4.21.0, the Iframe Dialog plugin applies the `sandbox` attribute
  by default, which restricts JavaScript code execution in the iframe element. To change this
  behavior, configure the `config.iframe_attributes` option. Also starting from version 4.21.0,
  the Media Embed plugin regenerates the entire content of the embed widget by default. To change
  this behavior, configure the `config.embed_keepOriginalContent` option. Those who choose to
  enable either of the more permissive options or who cannot upgrade to a patched version should
  properly configure Content Security Policy to avoid any potential security issues that may
  arise from embedding iframe elements on their web page.'
