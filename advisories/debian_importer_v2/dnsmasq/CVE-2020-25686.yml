aliases:
  - CVE-2020-25686
summary: A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. When receiving a query, dnsmasq does
  not check for an existing pending request for the same name and forwards a new request. By
  default, a maximum of 150 pending queries can be sent to upstream servers, so there can be
  at most 150 queries for the same name. This flaw allows an off-path attacker on the network
  to substantially reduce the number of attempts that it would have to perform to forge a reply
  and have it accepted by dnsmasq. This issue is mentioned in the "Birthday Attacks" section
  of RFC5452. If chained with CVE-2020-25684, the attack complexity of a successful attack is
  reduced. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.
