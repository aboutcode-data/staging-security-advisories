aliases:
  - CVE-2020-14312
summary: A flaw was found in the default configuration of dnsmasq, as shipped with Fedora versions
  prior to 31 and in all versions Red Hat Enterprise Linux, where it listens on any interface
  and accepts queries from addresses outside of its local subnet. In particular, the option
  `local-service` is not enabled. Running dnsmasq in this manner may inadvertently make it an
  open resolver accessible from any address on the internet. This flaw allows an attacker to
  conduct a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against other systems.
