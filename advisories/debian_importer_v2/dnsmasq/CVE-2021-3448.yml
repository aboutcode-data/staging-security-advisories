aliases:
  - CVE-2021-3448
summary: A flaw was found in dnsmasq in versions before 2.85. When configured to use a specific
  server for a given network interface, dnsmasq uses a fixed port while forwarding queries.
  An attacker on the network, able to find the outgoing port used by dnsmasq, only needs to
  guess the random transmission ID to forge a reply and get it accepted by dnsmasq. This flaw
  makes a DNS Cache Poisoning attack much easier. The highest threat from this vulnerability
  is to data integrity.
