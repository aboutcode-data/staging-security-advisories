  - CVE-2020-25687
summary: A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered
  in dnsmasq when DNSSEC is enabled and before it validates the received DNS entries. This flaw
  allows a remote attacker, who can create valid DNS replies, to cause an overflow in a heap-allocated
  memory. This flaw is caused by the lack of length checks in rfc1035.c:extract_name(), which
  could be abused to make the code execute memcpy() with a negative size in sort_rrset() and
  cause a crash in dnsmasq, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability
  is to system availability.
