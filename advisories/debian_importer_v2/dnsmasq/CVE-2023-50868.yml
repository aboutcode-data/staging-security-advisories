  - CVE-2023-50868
summary: The Closest Encloser Proof aspect of the DNS protocol (in RFC 5155 when RFC 9276 guidance
  is skipped) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption for SHA-1
  computations) via DNSSEC responses in a random subdomain attack, aka the "NSEC3" issue. The
  RFC 5155 specification implies that an algorithm must perform thousands of iterations of a
  hash function in certain situations.
