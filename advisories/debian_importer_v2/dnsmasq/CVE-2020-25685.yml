aliases:
  - CVE-2020-25685
summary: A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. When getting a reply from a forwarded
  query, dnsmasq checks in forward.c:reply_query(), which is the forwarded query that matches
  the reply, by only using a weak hash of the query name. Due to the weak hash (CRC32 when dnsmasq
  is compiled without DNSSEC, SHA-1 when it is) this flaw allows an off-path attacker to find
  several different domains all having the same hash, substantially reducing the number of attempts
  they would have to perform to forge a reply and get it accepted by dnsmasq. This is in contrast
  with RFC5452, which specifies that the query name is one of the attributes of a query that
  must be used to match a reply. This flaw could be abused to perform a DNS Cache Poisoning
  attack. If chained with CVE-2020-25684 the attack complexity of a successful attack is reduced.
  The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.
