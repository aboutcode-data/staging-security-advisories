summary: 'Buffer overflow in XBoard 4.2.7 and earlier might allow local users to execute arbitrary
  code via a long -icshost command line argument. NOTE: since the program is not setuid and
  not normally called from remote programs, there may not be a typical attack vector for the
  issue that crosses privilege boundaries.  Therefore this may not be a vulnerability.'
