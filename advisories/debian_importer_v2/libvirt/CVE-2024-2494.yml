aliases:
  - CVE-2024-2494
summary: A flaw was found in the RPC library APIs of libvirt. The RPC server deserialization
  code allocates memory for arrays before the non-negative length check is performed by the
  C API entry points. Passing a negative length to the g_new0 function results in a crash due
  to the negative length being treated as a huge positive number. This flaw allows a local,
  unprivileged user to perform a denial of service attack by causing the libvirt daemon to crash.
