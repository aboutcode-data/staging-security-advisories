aliases:
  - CVE-2020-25637
summary: A double free memory issue was found to occur in the libvirt API, in versions before
  6.8.0, responsible for requesting information about network interfaces of a running QEMU domain.
  This flaw affects the polkit access control driver. Specifically, clients connecting to the
  read-write socket with limited ACL permissions could use this flaw to crash the libvirt daemon,
  resulting in a denial of service, or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.
  The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well
  as system availability.
