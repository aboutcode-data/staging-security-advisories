aliases:
  - CVE-2021-3667
summary: An improper locking issue was found in the virStoragePoolLookupByTargetPath API of
  libvirt. It occurs in the storagePoolLookupByTargetPath function where a locked virStoragePoolObj
  object is not properly released on ACL permission failure. Clients connecting to the read-write
  socket with limited ACL permissions could use this flaw to acquire the lock and prevent other
  users from accessing storage pool/volume APIs, resulting in a denial of service condition.
  The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.
