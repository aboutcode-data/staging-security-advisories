aliases:
  - CVE-2021-3975
summary: A use-after-free flaw was found in libvirt. The qemuMonitorUnregister() function in
  qemuProcessHandleMonitorEOF is called using multiple threads without being adequately protected
  by a monitor lock. This flaw could be triggered by the virConnectGetAllDomainStats API when
  the guest is shutting down. An unprivileged client with a read-only connection could use this
  flaw to perform a denial of service attack by causing the libvirt daemon to crash.
