  - CVE-2020-10701
summary: A missing authorization flaw was found in the libvirt API responsible for changing
  the QEMU agent response timeout. This flaw allows read-only connections to adjust the time
  that libvirt waits for the QEMU guest agent to respond to agent commands. Depending on the
  timeout value that is set, this flaw can make guest agent commands fail because the agent
  cannot respond in time. Unprivileged users with a read-only connection could abuse this flaw
  to set the response timeout for all guest agent messages to zero, potentially leading to a
  denial of service. This flaw affects libvirt versions before 6.2.0.
