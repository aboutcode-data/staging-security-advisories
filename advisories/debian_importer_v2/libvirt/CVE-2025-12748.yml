  - CVE-2025-12748
summary: A flaw was discovered in libvirt in the XML file processing. More specifically, the
  parsing of user provided XML files was performed before the ACL checks. A malicious user with
  limited permissions could exploit this flaw by submitting a specially crafted XML file, causing
  libvirt to allocate too much memory on the host. The excessive memory consumption could lead
  to a libvirt process crash on the host, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
