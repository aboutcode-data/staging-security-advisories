aliases:
  - CVE-2020-10703
summary: A NULL pointer dereference was found in the libvirt API responsible introduced in upstream
  version 3.10.0, and fixed in libvirt 6.0.0, for fetching a storage pool based on its target
  path. In more detail, this flaw affects storage pools created without a target path such as
  network-based pools like gluster and RBD. Unprivileged users with a read-only connection could
  abuse this flaw to crash the libvirt daemon, resulting in a potential denial of service.
