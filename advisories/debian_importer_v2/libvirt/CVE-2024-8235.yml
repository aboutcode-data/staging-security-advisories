aliases:
  - CVE-2024-8235
summary: A flaw was found in libvirt. A refactor of the code fetching the list of interfaces
  for multiple APIs introduced a corner case on platforms where allocating 0 bytes of memory
  results in a NULL pointer. This corner case would lead to a NULL-pointer dereference and subsequent
  crash of virtinterfaced. This issue could allow clients connecting to the read-only socket
  to crash the virtinterfaced daemon.
