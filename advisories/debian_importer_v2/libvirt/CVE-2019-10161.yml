  - CVE-2019-10161
summary: It was discovered that libvirtd before versions 4.10.1 and 5.4.1 would permit read-only
  clients to use the virDomainSaveImageGetXMLDesc() API, specifying an arbitrary path which
  would be accessed with the permissions of the libvirtd process. An attacker with access to
  the libvirtd socket could use this to probe the existence of arbitrary files, cause denial
  of service or cause libvirtd to execute arbitrary programs.
