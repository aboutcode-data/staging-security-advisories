  - CVE-2021-3559
summary: A flaw was found in libvirt in the virConnectListAllNodeDevices API in versions before
  7.0.0. It only affects hosts with a PCI device and driver that supports mediated devices (e.g.,
  GRID driver). This flaw could be used by an unprivileged client with a read-only connection
  to crash the libvirt daemon by executing the 'nodedev-list' virsh command. The highest threat
  from this vulnerability is to system availability.
