  - CVE-2020-14339
summary: A flaw was found in libvirt, where it leaked a file descriptor for `/dev/mapper/control`
  into the QEMU process. This file descriptor allows for privileged operations to happen against
  the device-mapper on the host. This flaw allows a malicious guest user or process to perform
  operations outside of their standard permissions, potentially causing serious damage to the
  host operating system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity,
  as well as system availability.
