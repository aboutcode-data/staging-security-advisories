  - CVE-2019-10166
summary: It was discovered that libvirtd, versions 4.x.x before 4.10.1 and 5.x.x before 5.4.1,
  would permit readonly clients to use the virDomainManagedSaveDefineXML() API, which would
  permit them to modify managed save state files. If a managed save had already been created
  by a privileged user, a local attacker could modify this file such that libvirtd would execute
  an arbitrary program when the domain was resumed.
