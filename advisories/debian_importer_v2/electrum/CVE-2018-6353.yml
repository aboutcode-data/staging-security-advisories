aliases:
  - CVE-2018-6353
summary: The Python console in Electrum through 2.9.4 and 3.x through 3.0.5 supports arbitrary
  Python code without considering (1) social-engineering attacks in which a user pastes code
  that they do not understand and (2) code pasted by a physically proximate attacker at an unattended
  workstation, which makes it easier for attackers to steal Bitcoin via hook code that runs
  at a later time when the wallet password has been entered, a different vulnerability than
  CVE-2018-1000022.
