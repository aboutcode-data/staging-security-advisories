aliases:
  - CVE-2006-1173
summary: Sendmail before 8.13.7 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via deeply
  nested, malformed multipart MIME messages that exhaust the stack during the recursive mime8to7
  function for performing 8-bit to 7-bit conversion, which prevents Sendmail from delivering
  queued messages and might lead to disk consumption by core dump files.
