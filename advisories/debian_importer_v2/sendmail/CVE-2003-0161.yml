aliases:
  - CVE-2003-0161
summary: The prescan() function in the address parser (parseaddr.c) in Sendmail before 8.12.9
  does not properly handle certain conversions from char and int types, which can cause a length
  check to be disabled when Sendmail misinterprets an input value as a special "NOCHAR" control
  value, allowing attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code
  via a buffer overflow attack using messages, a different vulnerability than CVE-2002-1337.
