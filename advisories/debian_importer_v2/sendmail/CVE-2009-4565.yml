aliases:
  - CVE-2009-4565
summary: sendmail before 8.14.4 does not properly handle a '\0' character in a Common Name (CN)
  field of an X.509 certificate, which (1) allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary
  SSL-based SMTP servers via a crafted server certificate issued by a legitimate Certification
  Authority, and (2) allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a crafted
  client certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority, a related issue to CVE-2009-2408.
