  - CVE-2006-4434
summary: 'Use-after-free vulnerability in Sendmail before 8.13.8 allows remote attackers to
  cause a denial of service (crash) via a long "header line", which causes a previously freed
  variable to be referenced. NOTE: the original developer has disputed the severity of this
  issue, saying "The only denial of service that is possible here is to fill up the disk with
  core dumps if the OS actually generates different core dumps (which is unlikely)... the bug
  is in the shutdown code (finis()) which leads directly to exit(3), i.e., the process would
  terminate anyway, no mail delivery or receiption is affected."'
