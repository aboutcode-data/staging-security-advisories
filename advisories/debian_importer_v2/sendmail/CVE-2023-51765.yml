  - CVE-2023-51765
summary: sendmail through 8.17.2 allows SMTP smuggling in certain configurations. Remote attackers
  can use a published exploitation technique to inject e-mail messages with a spoofed MAIL FROM
  address, allowing bypass of an SPF protection mechanism. This occurs because sendmail supports
  <LF>.<CR><LF> but some other popular e-mail servers do not. This is resolved in 8.18 and later
  versions with 'o' in srv_features.
