  - CVE-2023-50387
summary: Certain DNSSEC aspects of the DNS protocol (in RFC 4033, 4034, 4035, 6840, and related
  RFCs) allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via one or more
  DNSSEC responses, aka the "KeyTrap" issue. One of the concerns is that, when there is a zone
  with many DNSKEY and RRSIG records, the protocol specification implies that an algorithm must
  evaluate all combinations of DNSKEY and RRSIG records.
