aliases:
  - CVE-2017-2295
summary: Versions of Puppet prior to 4.10.1 will deserialize data off the wire (from the agent
  to the server, in this case) with a attacker-specified format. This could be used to force
  YAML deserialization in an unsafe manner, which would lead to remote code execution. This
  change constrains the format of data on the wire to PSON or safely decoded YAML.
