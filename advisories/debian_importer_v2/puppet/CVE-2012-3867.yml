aliases:
  - CVE-2012-3867
summary: lib/puppet/ssl/certificate_authority.rb in Puppet before 2.6.17 and 2.7.x before 2.7.18,
  and Puppet Enterprise before 2.5.2, does not properly restrict the characters in the Common
  Name field of a Certificate Signing Request (CSR), which makes it easier for user-assisted
  remote attackers to trick administrators into signing a crafted agent certificate via ANSI
  control sequences.
