summary: Puppet 2.6.x before 2.6.12 and 2.7.x before 2.7.6, and Puppet Enterprise (PE) Users
  1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 before 1.2.4, when signing an agent certificate, adds the Puppet master's
  certdnsnames values to the X.509 Subject Alternative Name field of the certificate, which
  allows remote attackers to spoof a Puppet master via a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack against
  an agent that uses an alternate DNS name for the master, aka "AltNames Vulnerability."
