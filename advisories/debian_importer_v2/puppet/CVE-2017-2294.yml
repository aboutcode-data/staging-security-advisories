  - CVE-2017-2294
summary: Versions of Puppet Enterprise prior to 2016.4.5 or 2017.2.1 failed to mark MCollective
  server private keys as sensitive (a feature added in Puppet 4.6), so key values could be logged
  and stored in PuppetDB. These releases use the sensitive data type to ensure this won't happen
  anymore.
