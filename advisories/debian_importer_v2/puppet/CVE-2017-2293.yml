summary: Versions of Puppet Enterprise prior to 2016.4.5 or 2017.2.1 shipped with an MCollective
  configuration that allowed the package plugin to install or remove arbitrary packages on all
  managed agents. This release adds default configuration to not allow these actions. Customers
  who rely on this functionality can change this policy.
