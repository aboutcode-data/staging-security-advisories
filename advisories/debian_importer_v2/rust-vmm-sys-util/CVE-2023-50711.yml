summary: vmm-sys-util is a collection of modules that provides helpers and utilities used by
  multiple rust-vmm components. Starting in version 0.5.0 and prior to version 0.12.0, an issue
  in the `FamStructWrapper::deserialize` implementation provided by the crate for `vmm_sys_util::fam::FamStructWrapper`
  can lead to out of bounds memory accesses. The deserialization does not check that the length
  stored in the header matches the flexible array length. Mismatch in the lengths might allow
  out of bounds memory access through Rust-safe methods. The issue was corrected in version
  0.12.0 by inserting a check that verifies the lengths of compared flexible arrays are equal
  for any deserialized header and aborting deserialization otherwise. Moreover, the API was
  changed so that header length can only be modified through Rust-unsafe code. This ensures
  that users cannot trigger out-of-bounds memory access from Rust-safe code.
