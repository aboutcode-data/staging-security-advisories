  - CVE-2021-4120
summary: snapd 2.54.2 fails to perform sufficient validation of snap content interface and layout
  paths, resulting in the ability for snaps to inject arbitrary AppArmor policy rules via malformed
  content interface and layout declarations and hence escape strict snap confinement. Fixed
  in snapd versions 2.54.3+18.04, 2.54.3+20.04 and 2.54.3+21.10.1
