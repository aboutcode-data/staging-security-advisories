  - CVE-2020-11934
summary: It was discovered that snapctl user-open allowed altering the $XDG_DATA_DIRS environment
  variable when calling the system xdg-open. OpenURL() in usersession/userd/launcher.go would
  alter $XDG_DATA_DIRS to append a path to a directory controlled by the calling snap. A malicious
  snap could exploit this to bypass intended access restrictions to control how the host system
  xdg-open script opens the URL and, for example, execute a script shipped with the snap without
  confinement. This issue did not affect Ubuntu Core systems. Fixed in snapd versions 2.45.1ubuntu0.2,
  2.45.1+18.04.2 and 2.45.1+20.04.2.
