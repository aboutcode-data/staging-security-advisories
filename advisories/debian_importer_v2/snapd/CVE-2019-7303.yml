summary: 'A vulnerability in the seccomp filters of Canonical snapd before version 2.37.4 allows
  a strict mode snap to insert characters into a terminal on a 64-bit host. The seccomp rules
  were generated to match 64-bit ioctl(2) commands on a 64-bit platform; however, the Linux
  kernel only uses the lower 32 bits to determine which ioctl(2) commands to run. This issue
  affects: Canonical snapd versions prior to 2.37.4.'
