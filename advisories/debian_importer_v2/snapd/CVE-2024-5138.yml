aliases:
  - CVE-2024-5138
summary: The snapctl component within snapd allows a confined snap to interact with the snapd
  daemon to take certain privileged actions on behalf of the snap. It was found that snapctl
  did not properly parse command-line arguments, allowing an unprivileged user to trigger an
  authorised action on behalf of the snap that would normally require administrator privileges
  to perform. This could possibly allow an unprivileged user to perform a denial of service
  or similar.
