  - CVE-2021-44731
summary: A race condition existed in the snapd 2.54.2 snap-confine binary when preparing a private
  mount namespace for a snap. This could allow a local attacker to gain root privileges by bind-mounting
  their own contents inside the snap's private mount namespace and causing snap-confine to execute
  arbitrary code and hence gain privilege escalation. Fixed in snapd versions 2.54.3+18.04,
  2.54.3+20.04 and 2.54.3+21.10.1
