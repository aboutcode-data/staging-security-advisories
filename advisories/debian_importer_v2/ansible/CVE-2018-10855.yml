  - CVE-2018-10855
summary: Ansible 2.5 prior to 2.5.5, and 2.4 prior to 2.4.5, do not honor the no_log task flag
  for failed tasks. When the no_log flag has been used to protect sensitive data passed to a
  task from being logged, and that task does not run successfully, Ansible will expose sensitive
  data in log files and on the terminal of the user running Ansible.
