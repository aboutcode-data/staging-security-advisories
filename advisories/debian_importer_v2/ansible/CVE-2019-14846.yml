  - CVE-2019-14846
summary: In Ansible, all Ansible Engine versions up to ansible-engine 2.8.5, ansible-engine
  2.7.13, ansible-engine 2.6.19, were logging at the DEBUG level which lead to a disclosure
  of credentials if a plugin used a library that logged credentials at the DEBUG level. This
  flaw does not affect Ansible modules, as those are executed in a separate process.
