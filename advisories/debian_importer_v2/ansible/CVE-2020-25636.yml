  - CVE-2020-25636
summary: A flaw was found in Ansible Base when using the aws_ssm connection plugin as there
  is no namespace separation for file transfers. Files are written directly to the root bucket,
  making possible to have collisions when running multiple ansible processes. This issue affects
  mainly the service availability.
