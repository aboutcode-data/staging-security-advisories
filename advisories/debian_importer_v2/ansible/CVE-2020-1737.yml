aliases:
  - CVE-2020-1737
summary: A flaw was found in Ansible 2.7.17 and prior, 2.8.9 and prior, and 2.9.6 and prior
  when using the Extract-Zip function from the win_unzip module as the extracted file(s) are
  not checked if they belong to the destination folder. An attacker could take advantage of
  this flaw by crafting an archive anywhere in the file system, using a path traversal. This
  issue is fixed in 2.10.
