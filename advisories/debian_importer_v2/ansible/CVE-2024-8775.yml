aliases:
  - CVE-2024-8775
summary: 'A flaw was found in Ansible, where sensitive information stored in Ansible Vault files
  can be exposed in plaintext during the execution of a playbook. This occurs when using tasks
  such as include_vars to load vaulted variables without setting the no_log: true parameter,
  resulting in sensitive data being printed in the playbook output or logs. This can lead to
  the unintentional disclosure of secrets like passwords or API keys, compromising security
  and potentially allowing unauthorized access or actions.'
