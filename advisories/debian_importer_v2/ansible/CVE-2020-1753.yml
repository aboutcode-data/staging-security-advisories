aliases:
  - CVE-2020-1753
summary: A security flaw was found in Ansible Engine, all Ansible 2.7.x versions prior to 2.7.17,
  all Ansible 2.8.x versions prior to 2.8.11 and all Ansible 2.9.x versions prior to 2.9.7,
  when managing kubernetes using the k8s module. Sensitive parameters such as passwords and
  tokens are passed to kubectl from the command line, not using an environment variable or an
  input configuration file. This will disclose passwords and tokens from process list and no_log
  directive from debug module would not have any effect making these secrets being disclosed
  on stdout and log files.
