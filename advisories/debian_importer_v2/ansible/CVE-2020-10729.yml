  - CVE-2020-10729
summary: A flaw was found in the use of insufficiently random values in Ansible. Two random
  password lookups of the same length generate the equal value as the template caching action
  for the same file since no re-evaluation happens. The highest threat from this vulnerability
  would be that all passwords are exposed at once for the file. This flaw affects Ansible Engine
  versions before 2.9.6.
