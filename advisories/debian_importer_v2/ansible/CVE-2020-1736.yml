  - CVE-2020-1736
summary: A flaw was found in Ansible Engine when a file is moved using atomic_move primitive
  as the file mode cannot be specified. This sets the destination files world-readable if the
  destination file does not exist and if the file exists, the file could be changed to have
  less restrictive permissions before the move. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive
  data. All versions in 2.7.x, 2.8.x and 2.9.x branches are believed to be vulnerable.
