  - CVE-2020-10684
summary: A flaw was found in Ansible Engine, all versions 2.7.x, 2.8.x and 2.9.x prior to 2.7.17,
  2.8.9 and 2.9.6 respectively, when using ansible_facts as a subkey of itself and promoting
  it to a variable when inject is enabled, overwriting the ansible_facts after the clean. An
  attacker could take advantage of this by altering the ansible_facts, such as ansible_hosts,
  users and any other key data which would lead into privilege escalation or code injection.
