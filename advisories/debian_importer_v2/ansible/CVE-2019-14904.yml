  - CVE-2019-14904
summary: A flaw was found in the solaris_zone module from the Ansible Community modules. When
  setting the name for the zone on the Solaris host, the zone name is checked by listing the
  process with the 'ps' bare command on the remote machine. An attacker could take advantage
  of this flaw by crafting the name of the zone and executing arbitrary commands in the remote
  host. Ansible Engine 2.7.15, 2.8.7, and 2.9.2 as well as previous versions are affected.
