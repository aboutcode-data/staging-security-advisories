  - CVE-2020-14365
summary: A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine, in ansible-engine 2.8.x before 2.8.15 and ansible-engine
  2.9.x before 2.9.13, when installing packages using the dnf module. GPG signatures are ignored
  during installation even when disable_gpg_check is set to False, which is the default behavior.
  This flaw leads to malicious packages being installed on the system and arbitrary code executed
  via package installation scripts. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to integrity
  and system availability.
