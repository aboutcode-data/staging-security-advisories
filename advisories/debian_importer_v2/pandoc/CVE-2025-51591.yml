  - CVE-2025-51591
summary: 'A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in JGM Pandoc v3.6.4 allows attackers to gain
  access to and compromise the whole infrastructure via injecting a crafted iframe. Note: Some
  users have stated that Pandoc by default can retrieve and parse untrusted HTML content which
  can enable SSRF vulnerabilities. Using the ‘--sandbox’ option or ‘pandoc-server’ can mitigate
  such vulnerabilities. Using pandoc with an external ‘--pdf-engine’ can also enable SSRF vulnerabilities,
  such as CVE-2022-35583 in wkhtmltopdf.'
