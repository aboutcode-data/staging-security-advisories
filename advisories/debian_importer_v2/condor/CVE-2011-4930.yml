  - CVE-2011-4930
summary: Multiple format string vulnerabilities in Condor 7.2.0 through 7.6.4, and possibly
  certain 7.7.x versions, as used in Red Hat MRG Grid and possibly other products, allow local
  users to cause a denial of service (condor_schedd daemon and failure to launch jobs) and possibly
  execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in (1) the reason for a hold for a job
  that uses an XML user log, (2) the filename of a file to be transferred, and possibly other
  unspecified vectors.
