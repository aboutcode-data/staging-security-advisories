  - CVE-2019-9853
summary: 'LibreOffice documents can contain macros. The execution of those macros is controlled
  by the document security settings, typically execution of macros are blocked by default. A
  URL decoding flaw existed in how the urls to the macros within the document were processed
  and categorized, resulting in the possibility to construct a document where macro execution
  bypassed the security settings. The documents were correctly detected as containing macros,
  and prompted the user to their existence within the documents, but macros within the document
  were subsequently not controlled by the security settings allowing arbitrary macro execution
  This issue affects: LibreOffice 6.2 series versions prior to 6.2.7; LibreOffice 6.3 series
  versions prior to 6.3.1.'
