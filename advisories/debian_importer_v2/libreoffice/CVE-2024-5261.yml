summary: Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice "LibreOfficeKit" mode
  disables TLS certification verification  LibreOfficeKit can be used for accessing LibreOffice
  functionality  through C/C++. Typically this is used by third party components to reuse  LibreOffice
  as a library to convert, view or otherwise interact with  documents.  LibreOffice internally
  makes use of "curl" to fetch remote resources such as images hosted on webservers.  In  affected
  versions of LibreOffice, when used in LibreOfficeKit mode  only, then curl's TLS certification
  verification was disabled  (CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER of false)  In the fixed versions curl operates
  in LibreOfficeKit mode the same as in standard mode with CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER of true.  This
  issue affects LibreOffice before version 24.2.4.
