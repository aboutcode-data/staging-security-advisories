aliases:
  - CVE-2019-9852
summary: 'LibreOffice has a feature where documents can specify that pre-installed macros can
  be executed on various script events such as mouse-over, document-open etc. Access is intended
  to be restricted to scripts under the share/Scripts/python, user/Scripts/python sub-directories
  of the LibreOffice install. Protection was added, to address CVE-2018-16858, to avoid a directory
  traversal attack where scripts in arbitrary locations on the file system could be executed.
  However this new protection could be bypassed by a URL encoding attack. In the fixed versions,
  the parsed url describing the script location is correctly encoded before further processing.
  This issue affects: Document Foundation LibreOffice versions prior to 6.2.6.'
