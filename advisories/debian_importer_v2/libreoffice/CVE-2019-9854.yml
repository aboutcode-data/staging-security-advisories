aliases:
  - CVE-2019-9854
summary: 'LibreOffice has a feature where documents can specify that pre-installed macros can
  be executed on various script events such as mouse-over, document-open etc. Access is intended
  to be restricted to scripts under the share/Scripts/python, user/Scripts/python sub-directories
  of the LibreOffice install. Protection was added, to address CVE-2019-9852, to avoid a directory
  traversal attack where scripts in arbitrary locations on the file system could be executed
  by employing a URL encoding attack to defeat the path verification step. However this protection
  could be bypassed by taking advantage of a flaw in how LibreOffice assembled the final script
  URL location directly from components of the passed in path as opposed to solely from the
  sanitized output of the path verification step. This issue affects: Document Foundation LibreOffice
  6.2 versions prior to 6.2.7; 6.3 versions prior to 6.3.1.'
