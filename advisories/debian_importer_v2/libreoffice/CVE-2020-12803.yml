  - CVE-2020-12803
summary: 'ODF documents can contain forms to be filled out by the user. Similar to HTML forms,
  the contained form data can be submitted to a URI, for example, to an external web server.
  To create submittable forms, ODF implements the XForms W3C standard, which allows data to
  be submitted without the need for macros or other active scripting Prior to version 6.4.4
  LibreOffice allowed forms to be submitted to any URI, including file: URIs, enabling form
  submissions to overwrite local files. User-interaction is required to submit the form, but
  to avoid the possibility of malicious documents engineered to maximize the possibility of
  inadvertent user submission this feature has now been limited to http[s] URIs, removing the
  possibility to overwrite local files. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice
  versions prior to 6.4.4.'
