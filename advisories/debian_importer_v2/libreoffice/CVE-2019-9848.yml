  - CVE-2019-9848
summary: 'LibreOffice has a feature where documents can specify that pre-installed scripts can
  be executed on various document events such as mouse-over, etc. LibreOffice is typically also
  bundled with LibreLogo, a programmable turtle vector graphics script, which can be manipulated
  into executing arbitrary python commands. By using the document event feature to trigger LibreLogo
  to execute python contained within a document a malicious document could be constructed which
  would execute arbitrary python commands silently without warning. In the fixed versions, LibreLogo
  cannot be called from a document event handler. This issue affects: Document Foundation LibreOffice
  versions prior to 6.2.5.'
