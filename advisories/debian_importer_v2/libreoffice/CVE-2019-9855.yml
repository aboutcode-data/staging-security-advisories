aliases:
  - CVE-2019-9855
summary: 'LibreOffice is typically bundled with LibreLogo, a programmable turtle vector graphics
  script, which can execute arbitrary python commands contained with the document it is launched
  from. LibreOffice also has a feature where documents can specify that pre-installed scripts
  can be executed on various document script events such as mouse-over, etc. Protection was
  added to block calling LibreLogo from script event handers. However a Windows 8.3 path equivalence
  handling flaw left LibreOffice vulnerable under Windows that a document could trigger executing
  LibreLogo via a Windows filename pseudonym. This issue affects: Document Foundation LibreOffice
  6.2 versions prior to 6.2.7; 6.3 versions prior to 6.3.1.'
