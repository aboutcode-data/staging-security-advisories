  - CVE-2017-3157
summary: By exploiting the way Apache OpenOffice before 4.1.4 renders embedded objects, an attacker
  could craft a document that allows reading in a file from the user's filesystem. Information
  could be retrieved by the attacker by, e.g., using hidden sections to store the information,
  tricking the user into saving the document and convincing the user to send the document back
  to the attacker. The vulnerability is mitigated by the need for the attacker to know the precise
  file path in the target system, and the need to trick the user into saving the document and
  sending it back.
