aliases:
  - CVE-2019-9851
summary: 'LibreOffice is typically bundled with LibreLogo, a programmable turtle vector graphics
  script, which can execute arbitrary python commands contained with the document it is launched
  from. Protection was added, to address CVE-2019-9848, to block calling LibreLogo from document
  event script handers, e.g. mouse over. However LibreOffice also has a separate feature where
  documents can specify that pre-installed scripts can be executed on various global script
  events such as document-open, etc. In the fixed versions, global script event handlers are
  validated equivalently to document script event handlers. This issue affects: Document Foundation
  LibreOffice versions prior to 6.2.6.'
