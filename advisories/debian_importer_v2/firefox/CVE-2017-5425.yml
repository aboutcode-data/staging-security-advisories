summary: 'The Gecko Media Plugin sandbox allows access to local files that match specific regular
  expressions. On OS OX, this matching allows access to some data in subdirectories of "/private/var"
  that could expose personal or temporary data. This has been updated to not allow access to
  "/private/var" and its subdirectories. Note: this issue only affects OS X. Other operating
  systems are not affected. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 52 and Thunderbird < 52.'
