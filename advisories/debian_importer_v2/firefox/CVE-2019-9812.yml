aliases:
  - CVE-2019-9812
summary: Given a compromised sandboxed content process due to a separate vulnerability, it is
  possible to escape that sandbox by loading accounts.firefox.com in that process and forcing
  a log-in to a malicious Firefox Sync account. Preference settings that disable the sandbox
  are then synchronized to the local machine and the compromised browser would restart without
  the sandbox if a crash is triggered. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 60.9, Firefox
  ESR < 68.1, and Firefox < 69.
