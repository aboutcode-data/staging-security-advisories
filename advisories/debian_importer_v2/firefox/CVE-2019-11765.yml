aliases:
  - CVE-2019-11765
summary: A compromised content process could send a message to the parent process that would
  cause the 'Click to Play' permission prompt to be shown. However, due to lack of validation
  from the parent process, if the user accepted the permission request an attacker-controlled
  permission would be granted rather than the 'Click to Play' permission. This vulnerability
  affects Firefox < 70.
