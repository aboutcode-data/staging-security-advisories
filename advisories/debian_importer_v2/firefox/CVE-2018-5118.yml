aliases:
  - CVE-2018-5118
summary: The screenshot images displayed in the Activity Stream page displayed when a new tab
  is opened is created from the meta tags of websites. An issue was discovered where the page
  could attempt to create these images through "file:" URLs from the local file system. This
  loading is blocked by the sandbox but could expose local data if combined with another attack
  that escapes sandbox protections. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 58.
