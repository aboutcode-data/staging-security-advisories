aliases:
  - CVE-2021-23985
summary: If an attacker is able to alter specific about:config values (for example malware running
  on the user's computer), the Devtools remote debugging feature could have been enabled in
  a way that was unnoticable to the user. This would have allowed a remote attacker (able to
  make a direct network connection to the victim) to monitor the user's browsing activity and
  (plaintext) network traffic. This was addressed by providing a visual cue when Devtools has
  an open network socket. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 87.
