  - CVE-2022-31747
summary: Mozilla developers Andrew McCreight, Nicolas B. Pierron, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team
  reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 100 and Firefox ESR 91.9. Some of these bugs
  showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these
  could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird <
  91.10, Firefox < 101, and Firefox ESR < 91.10.
