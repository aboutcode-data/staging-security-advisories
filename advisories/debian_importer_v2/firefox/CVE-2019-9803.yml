summary: The Upgrade-Insecure-Requests (UIR) specification states that if UIR is enabled through
  Content Security Policy (CSP), navigation to a same-origin URL must be upgraded to HTTPS.
  Firefox will incorrectly navigate to an HTTP URL rather than perform the security upgrade
  requested by the CSP in some circumstances, allowing for potential man-in-the-middle attacks
  on the linked resources. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 66.
