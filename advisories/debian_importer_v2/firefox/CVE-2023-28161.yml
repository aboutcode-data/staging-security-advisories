summary: 'If temporary "one-time" permissions, such as the ability to use the Camera, were granted
  to a document loaded using a file: URL, that permission persisted in that tab for all other
  documents loaded from a file: URL. This is potentially dangerous if the local files came from
  different sources, such as in a download directory. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 111.'
