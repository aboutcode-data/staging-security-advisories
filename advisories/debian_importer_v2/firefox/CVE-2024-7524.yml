  - CVE-2024-7524
summary: Firefox adds web-compatibility shims in place of some tracking scripts blocked by Enhanced
  Tracking Protection.  On a site protected by Content Security Policy in "strict-dynamic" mode,
  an attacker able to inject an HTML element could have used a DOM Clobbering attack on some
  of the shims and achieved XSS, bypassing the CSP strict-dynamic protection. This vulnerability
  affects Firefox < 129, Firefox ESR < 115.14, and Firefox ESR < 128.1.
