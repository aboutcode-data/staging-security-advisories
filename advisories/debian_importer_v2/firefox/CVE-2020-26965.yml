  - CVE-2020-26965
summary: Some websites have a feature "Show Password" where clicking a button will change a
  password field into a textbook field, revealing the typed password. If, when using a software
  keyboard that remembers user input, a user typed their password and used that feature, the
  type of the password field was changed, resulting in a keyboard layout change and the possibility
  for the software keyboard to remember the typed password. This vulnerability affects Firefox
  < 83, Firefox ESR < 78.5, and Thunderbird < 78.5.
