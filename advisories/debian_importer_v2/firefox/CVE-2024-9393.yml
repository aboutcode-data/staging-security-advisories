summary: An attacker could, via a specially crafted multipart response, execute arbitrary JavaScript
  under the `resource://pdf.js` origin.  This could allow them to access cross-origin PDF content.
  This access is limited to "same site" documents by the Site Isolation feature on desktop clients,
  but full cross-origin access is possible on Android versions. This vulnerability affects Firefox
  < 131, Firefox ESR < 128.3, Firefox ESR < 115.16, Thunderbird < 128.3, and Thunderbird < 131.
