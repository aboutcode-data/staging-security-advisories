  - CVE-2006-4567
summary: Mozilla Firefox before 1.5.0.7 and Thunderbird before 1.5.0.7 makes it easy for users
  to accept self-signed certificates for the auto-update mechanism, which might allow remote
  user-assisted attackers to use DNS spoofing to trick users into visiting a malicious site
  and accepting a malicious certificate for the Mozilla update site, which can then be used
  to install arbitrary code on the next update.
