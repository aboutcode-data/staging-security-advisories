aliases:
  - CVE-2018-5163
summary: If a malicious attacker has used another vulnerability to gain full control over a
  content process, they may be able to replace the alternate data resources stored in the JavaScript
  Start-up Bytecode Cache (JSBC) for other JavaScript code. If the parent process then runs
  this replaced code, the executed script would be run with the parent process' privileges,
  escaping the sandbox on content processes. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 60.
