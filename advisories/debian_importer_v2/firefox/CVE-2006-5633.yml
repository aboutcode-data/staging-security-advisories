  - CVE-2006-5633
summary: 'Firefox 1.5.0.7 and 2.0, and Seamonkey 1.1b, allows remote attackers to cause a denial
  of service (crash) by creating a range object using createRange, calling selectNode on a DocType
  node (DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE), then calling createContextualFragment on the range, which triggers
  a null dereference.  NOTE: the original Bugtraq post mentioned that code execution was possible,
  but followup analysis has shown that it is only a null dereference.'
