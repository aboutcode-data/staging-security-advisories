summary: The IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler can leak an internal JS_OPTIMIZED_OUT magic
  value to the running script during a bailout. This magic value can then be used by JavaScript
  to achieve memory corruption, which results in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability
  affects Thunderbird < 60.6, Firefox ESR < 60.6, and Firefox < 66.
