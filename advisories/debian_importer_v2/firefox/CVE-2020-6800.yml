  - CVE-2020-6800
summary: Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox
  72 and Firefox ESR 68.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume
  that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. In
  general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because
  scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like
  contexts. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.5, Firefox < 73, and Firefox < ESR68.5.
