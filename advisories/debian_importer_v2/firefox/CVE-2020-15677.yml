summary: By exploiting an Open Redirect vulnerability on a website, an attacker could have spoofed
  the site displayed in the download file dialog to show the original site (the one suffering
  from the open redirect) rather than the site the file was actually downloaded from. This vulnerability
  affects Firefox < 81, Thunderbird < 78.3, and Firefox ESR < 78.3.
