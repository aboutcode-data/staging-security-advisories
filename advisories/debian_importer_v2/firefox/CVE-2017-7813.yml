summary: Inside the JavaScript parser, a cast of an integer to a narrower type can result in
  data read from outside the buffer being parsed. This usually results in a non-exploitable
  crash, but can leak a limited amount of information from memory if it matches JavaScript identifier
  syntax. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 56.
