summary: crossbeam-deque is a package of work-stealing deques for building task schedulers when
  programming in Rust. In versions prior to 0.7.4 and 0.8.0, the result of the race condition
  is that one or more tasks in the worker queue can be popped twice instead of other tasks that
  are forgotten and never popped. If tasks are allocated on the heap, this can cause double
  free and a memory leak. If not, this still can cause a logical bug. Crates using `Stealer::steal`,
  `Stealer::steal_batch`, or `Stealer::steal_batch_and_pop` are affected by this issue. This
  has been fixed in crossbeam-deque 0.8.1 and 0.7.4.
