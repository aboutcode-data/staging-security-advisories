summary: Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox
  68, Firefox ESR 68, and Firefox 60.8. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption
  and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
  code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 69, Thunderbird < 68.1, Thunderbird < 60.9, Firefox
  ESR < 60.9, and Firefox ESR < 68.1.
