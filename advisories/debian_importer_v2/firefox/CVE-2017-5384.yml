summary: Proxy Auto-Config (PAC) files can specify a JavaScript function called for all URL
  requests with the full URL path which exposes more information than would be sent to the proxy
  itself in the case of HTTPS. Normally the Proxy Auto-Config file is specified by the user
  or machine owner and presumed to be non-malicious, but if a user has enabled Web Proxy Auto
  Detect (WPAD) this file can be served remotely. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 51.
