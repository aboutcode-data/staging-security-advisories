  - CVE-2023-34415
summary: 'When choosing a site-isolated process for a document loaded from a data: URL that
  was the result of a redirect, Firefox would load that document in the same process as the
  site that issued the redirect. This bypassed the site-isolation protections against Spectre-like
  attacks on sites that host an "open redirect". Firefox no longer follows HTTP redirects to
  data: URLs. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 114.'
