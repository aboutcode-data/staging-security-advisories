summary: 'If Firefox is installed to a user-writable directory, the Mozilla Maintenance Service
  would execute updater.exe from the install location with system privileges. Although the Mozilla
  Maintenance Service does ensure that updater.exe is signed by Mozilla, the version could have
  been rolled back to a previous version which would have allowed exploitation of an older bug
  and arbitrary code execution with System Privileges. *Note: This issue only affected Windows
  operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox
  < 80, Thunderbird < 78.2, Thunderbird < 68.12, Firefox ESR < 68.12, and Firefox ESR < 78.2.'
