  - CVE-2018-18505
summary: An earlier fix for an Inter-process Communication (IPC) vulnerability, CVE-2011-3079,
  added authentication to communication between IPC endpoints and server parents during IPC
  process creation. This authentication is insufficient for channels created after the IPC process
  is started, leading to the authentication not being correctly applied to later channels. This
  could allow for a sandbox escape through IPC channels due to lack of message validation in
  the listener process. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 60.5, Firefox ESR < 60.5, and
  Firefox < 65.
