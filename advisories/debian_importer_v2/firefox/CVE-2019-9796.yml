  - CVE-2019-9796
summary: A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when the SMIL animation controller incorrectly
  registers with the refresh driver twice when only a single registration is expected. When
  a registration is later freed with the removal of the animation controller element, the refresh
  driver incorrectly leaves a dangling pointer to the driver's observer array. This vulnerability
  affects Thunderbird < 60.6, Firefox ESR < 60.6, and Firefox < 66.
