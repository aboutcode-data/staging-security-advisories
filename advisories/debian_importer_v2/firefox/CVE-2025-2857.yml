summary: Following the recent Chrome sandbox escape (CVE-2025-2783), various Firefox developers
  identified a similar pattern in our IPC code. A compromised child process could cause the
  parent process to return an unintentionally powerful handle, leading to a sandbox escape.  The
  original vulnerability was being exploited in the wild.  *This only affects Firefox on Windows.
  Other operating systems are unaffected.* This vulnerability affects Firefox < 136.0.4, Firefox
  ESR < 128.8.1, and Firefox ESR < 115.21.1.
