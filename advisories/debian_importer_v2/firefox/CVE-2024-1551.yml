summary: Set-Cookie response headers were being incorrectly honored in multipart HTTP responses.

  the response body, they could inject Set-Cookie response headers that would have been honored
  by the browser. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123, Firefox ESR < 115.8, and Thunderbird
  < 115.8.
