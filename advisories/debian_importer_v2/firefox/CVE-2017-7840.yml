  - CVE-2017-7840
summary: JavaScript can be injected into an exported bookmarks file by placing JavaScript code
  into user-supplied tags in saved bookmarks. If the resulting exported HTML file is later opened
  in a browser this JavaScript will be executed. This could be used in social engineering and
  self-cross-site-scripting (self-XSS) attacks if users were convinced to add malicious tags
  to bookmarks, export them, and then open the resulting file. This vulnerability affects Firefox
  < 57.
