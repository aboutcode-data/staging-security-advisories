aliases:
  - CVE-2018-5174
summary: 'In the Windows 10 April 2018 Update, Windows Defender SmartScreen honors the "SEE_MASK_FLAG_NO_UI"
  flag associated with downloaded files and will not show any UI. Files that are unknown and
  potentially dangerous will be allowed to run because SmartScreen will not prompt the user
  for a decision, and if the user is offline all files will be allowed to be opened because
  Windows won''t prompt the user to ask what to do. Firefox incorrectly sets this flag when
  downloading files, leading to less secure behavior from SmartScreen. Note: this issue only
  affects Windows 10 users running the April 2018 update or later. It does not affect other
  Windows users or other operating systems. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.8, Thunderbird
  ESR < 52.8, Firefox < 60, and Firefox ESR < 52.8.'
