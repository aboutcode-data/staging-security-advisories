summary: If a specific sequence of actions is performed when opening a new tab, the triggering
  principal associated with the new tab may have been incorrect. The triggering principal is
  used to calculate many values, including the `Referer` and `Sec-*` headers, meaning there
  is the potential for incorrect security checks within the browser in addition to incorrect
  or misleading information sent to remote websites. *This bug only affects Firefox for Android.
  Other versions of Firefox are unaffected.* This vulnerability affects Firefox < 127.
