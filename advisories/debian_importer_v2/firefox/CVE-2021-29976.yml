summary: Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in code shared between Firefox
  and Thunderbird. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that
  with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability
  affects Thunderbird < 78.12, Firefox ESR < 78.12, and Firefox < 90.
