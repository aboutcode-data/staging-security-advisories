  - CVE-2024-11696
summary: The application failed to account for exceptions thrown by the `loadManifestFromFile`
  method during add-on signature verification. This flaw, triggered by an invalid or unsupported
  extension manifest, could have caused runtime errors that disrupted the signature validation
  process. As a result, the enforcement of signature validation for unrelated add-ons may have
  been bypassed.  Signature validation in this context is used to ensure that third-party applications
  on the user's computer have not tampered with the user's extensions, limiting the impact of
  this issue. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 133, Firefox ESR < 128.5, Thunderbird < 133,
  and Thunderbird < 128.5.
