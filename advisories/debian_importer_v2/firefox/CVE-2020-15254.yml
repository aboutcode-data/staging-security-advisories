  - CVE-2020-15254
summary: Crossbeam is a set of tools for concurrent programming. In crossbeam-channel before
  version 0.4.4, the bounded channel incorrectly assumes that `Vec::from_iter` has allocated
  capacity that same as the number of iterator elements. `Vec::from_iter` does not actually
  guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the `bounded` channel reconstructs
  `Vec` from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumes described above. This is unsound
  and causing deallocation with the incorrect capacity when `Vec::from_iter` has allocated different
  sizes with the number of iterator elements. This has been fixed in crossbeam-channel 0.4.4.
