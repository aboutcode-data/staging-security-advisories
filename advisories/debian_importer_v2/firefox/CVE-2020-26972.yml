  - CVE-2020-26972
summary: The lifecycle of IPC Actors allows managed actors to outlive their manager actors;
  and the former must ensure that they are not attempting to use a dead actor they have a reference
  to. Such a check was omitted in WebGL, resulting in a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable
  crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 84.
