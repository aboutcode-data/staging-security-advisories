aliases:
  - CVE-2024-11705
summary: '`NSC_DeriveKey` inadvertently assumed that the `phKey` parameter is always non-NULL.
  When it was passed as NULL, a segmentation fault (SEGV) occurred, leading to crashes. This
  behavior conflicted with the PKCS#11 v3.0 specification, which allows `phKey` to be NULL for
  certain mechanisms. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 133 and Thunderbird < 133.'
