aliases:
  - CVE-2018-5131
summary: Under certain circumstances the "fetch()" API can return transient local copies of
  resources that were sent with a "no-store" or "no-cache" cache header instead of downloading
  a copy from the network as it should. This can result in previously stored, locally cached
  data of a website being accessible to users if they share a common profile while browsing.
  This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 52.7 and Firefox < 59.
