summary: The JSON Viewer displays clickable hyperlinks for strings that are parseable as URLs,
  including "javascript:" links. If a JSON file contains malicious JavaScript script embedded
  as "javascript:" links, users may be tricked into clicking and running this code in the context
  of the JSON Viewer. This can allow for the theft of cookies and authorization tokens which
  are accessible to that context. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 60.
