  - CVE-2019-17022
summary: When pasting a &lt;style&gt; tag from the clipboard into a rich text editor, the CSS
  sanitizer does not escape &lt; and &gt; characters. Because the resulting string is pasted
  directly into the text node of the element this does not result in a direct injection into
  the webpage; however, if a webpage subsequently copies the node's innerHTML, assigning it
  to another innerHTML, this would result in an XSS vulnerability. Two WYSIWYG editors were
  identified with this behavior, more may exist. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 68.4
  and Firefox < 72.
