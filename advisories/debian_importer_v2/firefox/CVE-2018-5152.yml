aliases:
  - CVE-2018-5152
summary: WebExtensions with the appropriate permissions can attach content scripts to Mozilla
  sites such as accounts.firefox.com and listen to network traffic to the site through the "webRequest"
  API. For example, this allows for the interception of username and an encrypted password during
  login to Firefox Accounts. This issue does not expose synchronization traffic directly and
  is limited to the process of user login to the website and the data displayed to the user
  once logged in. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 60.
