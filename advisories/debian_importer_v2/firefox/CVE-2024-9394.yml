summary: An attacker could, via a specially crafted multipart response, execute arbitrary JavaScript
  under the `resource://devtools` origin.  This could allow them to access cross-origin JSON
  content. This access is limited to "same site" documents by the Site Isolation feature on
  desktop clients, but full cross-origin access is possible on Android versions. This vulnerability
  affects Firefox < 131, Firefox ESR < 128.3, Firefox ESR < 115.16, Thunderbird < 128.3, and
  Thunderbird < 131.
