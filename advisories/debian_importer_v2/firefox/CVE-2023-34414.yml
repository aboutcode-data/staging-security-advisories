  - CVE-2023-34414
summary: The error page for sites with invalid TLS certificates was missing the activation-delay
  Firefox uses to protect prompts and permission dialogs from attacks that exploit human response
  time delays. If a malicious page elicited user clicks in precise locations immediately before
  navigating to a site with a certificate error and made the renderer extremely busy at the
  same time, it could create a gap between when the error page was loaded and when the display
  actually refreshed. With the right timing the elicited clicks could land in that gap and  activate
  the button that overrides the certificate error for that site. This vulnerability affects
  Firefox ESR < 102.12, Firefox < 114, and Thunderbird < 102.12.
