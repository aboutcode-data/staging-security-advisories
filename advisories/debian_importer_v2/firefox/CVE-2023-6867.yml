summary: The timing of a button click causing a popup to disappear was approximately the same
  length as the anti-clickjacking delay on permission prompts. It was possible to use this fact
  to surprise users by luring them to click where the permission grant button would be about
  to appear. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6 and Firefox < 121.
