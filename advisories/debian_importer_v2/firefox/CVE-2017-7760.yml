summary: 'The Mozilla Windows updater modifies some files to be updated by reading the original
  file and applying changes to it. The location of the original file can be altered by a malicious
  user by passing a special path to the callback parameter through the Mozilla Maintenance Service,
  allowing the manipulation of files in the installation directory and privilege escalation
  by manipulating the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged access. Note: This attack
  requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.
  This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 52.2 and Firefox < 54.'
