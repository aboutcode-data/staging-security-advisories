summary: Firefox used to cache the last filename used for printing a file. When generating a
  filename for printing, Firefox usually suggests the web page title. The caching and suggestion
  techniques combined may have lead to the title of a website visited during private browsing
  mode being stored on disk. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.
