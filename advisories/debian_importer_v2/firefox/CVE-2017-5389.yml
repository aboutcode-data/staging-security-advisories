summary: WebExtensions could use the "mozAddonManager" API by modifying the CSP headers on sites
  with the appropriate permissions and then using host requests to redirect script loads to
  a malicious site. This allows a malicious extension to then install additional extensions
  without explicit user permission. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 51.
