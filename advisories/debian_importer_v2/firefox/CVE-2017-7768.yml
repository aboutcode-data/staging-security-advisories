summary: 'The Mozilla Maintenance Service can be invoked by an unprivileged user to read 32

  a status file provided by the Mozilla Windows Updater. The Mozilla Maintenance Service executes
  with privileged access, bypassing system protections against unprivileged users. Note: This
  attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are
  not affected. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 52.2 and Firefox < 54.'
