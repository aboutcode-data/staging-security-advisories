summary: Mozilla developers Bryce Seager van Dyk and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported potential
  vulnerabilities present in Firefox 101. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption
  and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary
  code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 102.
