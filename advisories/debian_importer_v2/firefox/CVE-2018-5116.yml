summary: WebExtensions with the "ActiveTab" permission are able to access frames hosted within
  the active tab even if the frames are cross-origin. Malicious extensions can inject frames
  from arbitrary origins into the loaded page and then interact with them, bypassing same-origin
  user expectations with this permission. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 58.
