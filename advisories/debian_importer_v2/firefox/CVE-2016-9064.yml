summary: Add-on updates failed to verify that the add-on ID inside the signed package matched
  the ID of the add-on being updated. An attacker who could perform a man-in-the-middle attack
  on the user's connection to the update server and defeat the certificate pinning protection
  could provide a malicious signed add-on instead of a valid update. This vulnerability affects
  Firefox ESR < 45.5 and Firefox < 50.
