aliases:
  - CVE-2021-23986
summary: A malicious extension with the 'search' permission could have installed a new search
  engine whose favicon referenced a cross-origin URL. The response to this cross-origin request
  could have been read by the extension, allowing a same-origin policy bypass by the extension,
  which should not have cross-origin permissions. This cross-origin request was made without
  cookies, so the sensitive information disclosed by the violation was limited to local-network
  resources or resources that perform IP-based authentication. This vulnerability affects Firefox
  < 87.
