summary: When Private Browsing mode is used, it is possible for a web worker to write persistent
  data to IndexedDB and fingerprint a user uniquely. IndexedDB should not be available in Private
  Browsing mode and this stored data will persist across multiple private browsing mode sessions
  because it is not cleared when exiting. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 52.5.2 and
  Firefox < 57.0.1.
