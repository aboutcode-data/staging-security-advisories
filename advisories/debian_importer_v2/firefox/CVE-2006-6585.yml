summary: 'The Extensions manager in Mozilla Firefox 2.0 does not properly populate the list
  of local extensions, which allows attackers to construct an extension that hides itself by
  finding its name in the list and then calling RemoveElement, as demonstrated by the FFsniFF
  extension.  NOTE: it was later reported that 3.0 is also affected.'
