summary: 'Mozilla Firefox 1.5, Netscape 8.0.4 and 7.2, and K-Meleon before 0.9.12 allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption and delayed application startup) via
  a web site with a large title, which is recorded in history.dat but not processed efficiently
  during startup.  NOTE: despite initial reports, the Mozilla vendor does not believe that this
  issue can be used to trigger a crash or buffer overflow in Firefox.  Also, it has been independently
  reported that Netscape 8.1 does not have this issue.'
