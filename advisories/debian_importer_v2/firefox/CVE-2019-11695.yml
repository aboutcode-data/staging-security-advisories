summary: A custom cursor defined by scripting on a site can position itself over the addressbar
  to spoof the actual cursor when it should not be allowed outside of the primary web content
  area. This could be used by a malicious site to trick users into clicking on permission prompts,
  doorhanger notifications, or other buttons inadvertently if the location is spoofed over the
  user interface. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 67.
