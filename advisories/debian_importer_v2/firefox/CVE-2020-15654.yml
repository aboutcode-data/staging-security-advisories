summary: When in an endless loop, a website specifying a custom cursor using CSS could make
  it look like the user is interacting with the user interface, when they are not. This could
  lead to a perceived broken state, especially when interactions with existing browser dialogs
  and warnings do not work. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.1, Firefox < 79, and
  Thunderbird < 78.1.
