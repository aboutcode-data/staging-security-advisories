summary: The content security policy (CSP) "sandbox" directive did not create a unique origin
  for the document, causing it to behave as if the "allow-same-origin" keyword were always specified.
  This could allow a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack to be launched from unsafe content. This
  vulnerability affects Firefox < 56, Firefox ESR < 52.4, and Thunderbird < 52.4.
