  - CVE-2004-2657
summary: 'Mozilla Firefox 1.5.0.1, and possibly other versions, preserves some records of user
  activity even after uninstalling, which allows local users who share a Windows profile to
  view the records after a new installation of Firefox, as reported for the list of Passwords
  Never Saved web sites.  NOTE: The vendor has disputed this issue, stating that "The uninstaller
  is primarily there to uninstall the application. It is not there to uninstall user data. For
  the moment I will stick by my module-owner decision.'
