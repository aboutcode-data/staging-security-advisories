summary: SVG's <code>&lt;use&gt;</code> element could have been used to load unexpected content
  that could have executed script in certain circumstances. While the specification seems to
  allow this, other browsers do not, and web developers relied on this property for script security
  so gecko's implementation was aligned with theirs. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 99.
