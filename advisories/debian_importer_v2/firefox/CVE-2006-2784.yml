  - CVE-2006-2784
summary: 'The PLUGINSPAGE functionality in Mozilla Firefox before 1.5.0.4 allows remote user-assisted
  attackers to execute privileged code by tricking a user into installing missing plugins and
  selecting the "Manual Install" button, then using nested javascript: URLs.  NOTE: the manual
  install button is used for downloading software from a remote web site, so this issue would
  not cross privilege boundaries if the user progresses to the point of installing malicious
  software from the attacker-controlled site.'
