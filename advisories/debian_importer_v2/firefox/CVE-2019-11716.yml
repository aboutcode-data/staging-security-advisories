  - CVE-2019-11716
summary: Until explicitly accessed by script, window.globalThis is not enumerable and, as a
  result, is not visible to code such as Object.getOwnPropertyNames(window). Sites that deploy
  a sandboxing that depends on enumerating and freezing access to the window object may miss
  this, allowing their sandboxes to be bypassed. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 68.
