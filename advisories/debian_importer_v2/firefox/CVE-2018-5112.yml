summary: Development Tools panels of an extension are required to load URLs for the panels as
  relative URLs from the extension manifest file but this requirement was not enforced in all
  instances. This could allow the development tools panel for the extension to load a URL that
  it should not be able to access, including potentially privileged pages. This vulnerability
  affects Firefox < 58.
