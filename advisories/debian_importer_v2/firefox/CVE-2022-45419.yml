  - CVE-2022-45419
summary: If the user added a security exception for an invalid TLS certificate, opened an ongoing
  TLS connection with a server that used that certificate, and then deleted the exception, Firefox
  would have kept the connection alive, making it seem like the certificate was still trusted.
  This vulnerability affects Firefox < 107.
