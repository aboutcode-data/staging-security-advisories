summary: The printing process can bypass local access protections to read files available through
  symlinks, bypassing local file restrictions. The printing process requires files in a specific
  format so arbitrary data cannot be read but it is possible that some local file information
  could be exposed. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 58.
