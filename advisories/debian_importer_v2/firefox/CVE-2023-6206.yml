summary: The black fade animation when exiting fullscreen is roughly the length of the anti-clickjacking
  delay on permission prompts. It was possible to use this fact to surprise users by luring
  them to click where the permission grant button would be about to appear. This vulnerability
  affects Firefox < 120, Firefox ESR < 115.5.0, and Thunderbird < 115.5.
