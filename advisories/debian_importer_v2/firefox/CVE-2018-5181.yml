aliases:
  - CVE-2018-5181
summary: If a URL using the "file:" protocol is dragged and dropped onto an open tab that is
  running in a different child process the tab will open a local file corresponding to the dropped
  URL, contrary to policy. One way to make the target tab open more reliably in a separate process
  is to open it with the "noopener" keyword. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 60.
