  - CVE-2005-4685
summary: Firefox and Mozilla can associate a cookie with multiple domains when the DNS resolver
  has a non-root domain in its search list, which allows remote attackers to trick a user into
  accepting a cookie for a hostname formed via search-list expansion of the hostname entered
  by the user, or steal a cookie for an expanded hostname, as demonstrated by an attacker who
  operates an ap1.com Internet web site to steal cookies associated with an ap1.com.example.com
  intranet web site.
