  - CVE-2006-4253
summary: 'Concurrency vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox 1.5.0.6 and earlier allows remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via multiple Javascript
  timed events that load a deeply nested XML file, followed by redirecting the browser to another
  page, which leads to a concurrency failure that causes structures to be freed incorrectly,
  as demonstrated by (1) ffoxdie and (2) ffoxdie3.  NOTE: it has been reported that Netscape
  8.1 and K-Meleon 1.0.1 are also affected by ffoxdie.  Mozilla confirmed to CVE that ffoxdie
  and ffoxdie3 trigger the same underlying vulnerability.  NOTE: it was later reported that
  Firefox 2.0 RC2 and 1.5.0.7 are also affected.'
