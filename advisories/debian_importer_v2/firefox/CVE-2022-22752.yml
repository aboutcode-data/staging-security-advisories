summary: Mozilla developers Christian Holler and Jason Kratzer reported memory safety bugs present
  in Firefox 95. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that
  with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability
  affects Firefox < 96.
