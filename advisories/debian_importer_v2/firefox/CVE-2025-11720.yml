summary: The Firefox and Firefox Focus UI for the Android custom tab feature only showed the
  "site" that was loaded, not the full hostname. User supplied content hosted on a subdomain
  of a site could have been used to fool a user into thinking it was content from a different
  subdomain of that site. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 144.
