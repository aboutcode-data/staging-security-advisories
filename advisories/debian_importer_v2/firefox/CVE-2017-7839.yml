summary: Control characters prepended before "javascript:" URLs pasted in the addressbar can
  cause the leading characters to be ignored and the pasted JavaScript to be executed instead
  of being blocked. This could be used in social engineering and self-cross-site-scripting (self-XSS)
  attacks where users are convinced to copy and paste text into the addressbar. This vulnerability
  affects Firefox < 57.
