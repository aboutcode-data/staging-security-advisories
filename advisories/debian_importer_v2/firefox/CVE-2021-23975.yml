summary: The developer page about:memory has a Measure function for exploring what object types
  the browser has allocated and their sizes. When this function was invoked we incorrectly called
  the sizeof function, instead of using the API method that checks for invalid pointers. This
  vulnerability affects Firefox < 86.
