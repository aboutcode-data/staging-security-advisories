summary: Mozilla developers and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present
  in Firefox 108 and Firefox ESR 102.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption
  and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary
  code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 109, Firefox ESR < 102.7, and Thunderbird < 102.7.
