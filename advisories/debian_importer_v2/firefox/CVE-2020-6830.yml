aliases:
  - CVE-2020-6830
summary: For native-to-JS bridging, the app requires a unique token to be passed that ensures
  non-app code can't call the bridging functions. That token was being used for JS-to-native
  also, but it isn't needed in this case, and its usage was also leaking this token. This vulnerability
  affects Firefox for iOS < 25.
