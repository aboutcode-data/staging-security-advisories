summary: Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird before 1.5.0.4 allow remote attackers to cause a denial
  of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via (1) nested <option> tags in a select
  tag, (2) a DOMNodeRemoved mutation event, (3) "Content-implemented tree views," (4) BoxObjects,
  (5) the XBL implementation, (6) an iframe that attempts to remove itself, which leads to memory
  corruption.
