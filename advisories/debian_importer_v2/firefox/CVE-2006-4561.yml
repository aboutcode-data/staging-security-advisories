  - CVE-2006-4561
summary: Mozilla Firefox 1.5.0.6 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in
  the context of the browser's session with an arbitrary intranet web server, by hosting script
  on an Internet web server that can be made inaccessible by the attacker and that has a domain
  name under the attacker's control, which can force the browser to drop DNS pinning and perform
  a new DNS query for the domain name after the script is already running.
