  - CVE-2018-12364
summary: NPAPI plugins, such as Adobe Flash, can send non-simple cross-origin requests, bypassing
  CORS by making a same-origin POST that does a 307 redirect to the target site. This allows
  for a malicious site to engage in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. This vulnerability
  affects Thunderbird < 60, Thunderbird < 52.9, Firefox ESR < 60.1, Firefox ESR < 52.9, and
  Firefox < 61.
