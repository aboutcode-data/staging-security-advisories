aliases:
  - CVE-2018-5143
summary: URLs using "javascript:" have the protocol removed when pasted into the addressbar
  to protect users from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, but if a tab character is embedded
  in the "javascript:" URL the protocol is not removed and the script will execute. This could
  allow users to be socially engineered to run an XSS attack against themselves. This vulnerability
  affects Firefox < 59.
