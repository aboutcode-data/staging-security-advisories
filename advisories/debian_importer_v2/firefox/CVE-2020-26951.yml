summary: A parsing and event loading mismatch in Firefox's SVG code could have allowed load
  events to fire, even after sanitization. An attacker already capable of exploiting an XSS
  vulnerability in privileged internal pages could have used this attack to bypass our built-in
  sanitizer. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR < 78.5, and Thunderbird <
  78.5.
