aliases:
  - CVE-2017-7764
summary: Characters from the "Canadian Syllabics" unicode block can be mixed with characters
  from other unicode blocks in the addressbar instead of being rendered as their raw "punycode"
  form, allowing for domain name spoofing attacks through character confusion. The current Unicode
  standard allows characters from "Aspirational Use Scripts" such as Canadian Syllabics to be
  mixed with Latin characters in the "moderately restrictive" IDN profile. We have changed Firefox
  behavior to match the upcoming Unicode version 10.0 which removes this category and treats
  them as "Limited Use Scripts.". This vulnerability affects Firefox < 54, Firefox ESR < 52.2,
  and Thunderbird < 52.2.
