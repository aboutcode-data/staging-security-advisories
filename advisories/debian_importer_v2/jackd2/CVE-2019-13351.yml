  - CVE-2019-13351
summary: posix/JackSocket.cpp in libjack in JACK2 1.9.1 through 1.9.12 (as distributed with
  alsa-plugins 1.1.7 and later) has a "double file descriptor close" issue during a failed connection
  attempt when jackd2 is not running. Exploitation success depends on multithreaded timing of
  that double close, which can result in unintended information disclosure, crashes, or file
  corruption due to having the wrong file associated with the file descriptor.
