summary: NSF Unidata NetCDF-C Time Unit Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.
  This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations
  of NSF Unidata NetCDF-C. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that
  the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists
  within the parsing of time units. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of
  the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer.
  An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current
  user. Was ZDI-CAN-27273.
