aliases:
  - CVE-2023-22947
summary: 'Insecure folder permissions in the Windows installation path of Shibboleth Service
  Provider (SP) before 3.4.1 allow an unprivileged local attacker to escalate privileges to
  SYSTEM via DLL planting in the service executable''s folder. This occurs because the installation
  goes under C:\opt (rather than C:\Program Files) by default. NOTE: the vendor disputes the
  significance of this report, stating that "We consider the ACLs a best effort thing" and "it
  was a documentation mistake."'
