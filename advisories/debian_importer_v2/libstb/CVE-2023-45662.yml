  - CVE-2023-45662
summary: stb_image is a single file MIT licensed library for processing images. When `stbi_set_flip_vertically_on_load`
  is set to `TRUE` and `req_comp` is set to a number that doesn’t match the real number of components
  per pixel, the library attempts to flip the image vertically. A crafted image file can trigger
  `memcpy` out-of-bounds read because `bytes_per_pixel` used to calculate `bytes_per_row` doesn’t
  match the real image array dimensions.
