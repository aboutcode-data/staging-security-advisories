  - CVE-2023-45664
summary: stb_image is a single file MIT licensed library for processing images. A crafted image
  file can trigger `stbi__load_gif_main_outofmem` attempt to double-free the out variable. This
  happens in `stbi__load_gif_main` because when the `layers * stride` value is zero the behavior
  is implementation defined, but common that realloc frees the old memory and returns null pointer.
  Since it attempts to double-free the memory a few lines below the first “free”, the issue
  can be potentially exploited only in a multi-threaded environment. In the worst case this
  may lead to code execution.
