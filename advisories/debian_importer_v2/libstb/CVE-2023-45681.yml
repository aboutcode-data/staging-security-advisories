  - CVE-2023-45681
summary: stb_vorbis is a single file MIT licensed library for processing ogg vorbis files. A
  crafted file may trigger memory write past an allocated heap buffer in `start_decoder`. The
  root cause is a potential integer overflow in `sizeof(char*) * (f->comment_list_length)` which
  may make `setup_malloc` allocate less memory than required. Since there is another integer
  overflow an attacker may overflow it too to force `setup_malloc` to return 0 and make the
  exploit more reliable. This issue may lead to code execution.
