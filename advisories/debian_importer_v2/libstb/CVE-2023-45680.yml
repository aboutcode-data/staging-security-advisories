  - CVE-2023-45680
summary: stb_vorbis is a single file MIT licensed library for processing ogg vorbis files. A
  crafted file may trigger memory allocation failure in `start_decoder`. In that case the function
  returns early, the `f->comment_list` is set to `NULL`, but `f->comment_list_length` is not
  reset. Later in `vorbis_deinit` it tries to dereference the `NULL` pointer. This issue may
  lead to denial of service.
