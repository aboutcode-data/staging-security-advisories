summary: stb_vorbis is a single file MIT licensed library for processing ogg vorbis files. A
  crafted file may trigger out of bounds write in `f->vendor[len] = (char)'\0';`. The root cause
  is that if `len` read in `start_decoder` is a negative number and `setup_malloc` successfully
  allocates memory in that case, but memory write is done with a negative index `len`. Similarly
  if len is INT_MAX the integer overflow len+1 happens in `f->vendor = (char*)setup_malloc(f,
  sizeof(char) * (len+1));` and `f->comment_list[i] = (char*)setup_malloc(f, sizeof(char) *
  (len+1));`. This issue may lead to code execution.
