  - CVE-2023-45666
summary: stb_image is a single file MIT licensed library for processing images.  It may look
  like `stbi__load_gif_main` doesn’t give guarantees about the content of output value `*delays`
  upon failure. Although it sets `*delays` to zero at the beginning, it doesn’t do it in case
  the image is not recognized as GIF and a call to `stbi__load_gif_main_outofmem` only frees
  possibly allocated memory in `*delays` without resetting it to zero. Thus it would be fair
  to say the caller of `stbi__load_gif_main` is responsible to free the allocated memory in
  `*delays` only if `stbi__load_gif_main` returns a non null value. However at the same time
  the function may return null value, but fail to free the memory in `*delays` if internally
  `stbi__convert_format` is called and fails. Thus the issue may lead to a memory leak if the
  caller chooses to free `delays` only when `stbi__load_gif_main` didn’t fail or to a double-free
  if the `delays` is always freed
