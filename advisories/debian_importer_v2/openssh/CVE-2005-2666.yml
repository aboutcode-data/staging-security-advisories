  - CVE-2005-2666
summary: SSH, as implemented in OpenSSH before 4.0 and possibly other implementations, stores
  hostnames, IP addresses, and keys in plaintext in the known_hosts file, which makes it easier
  for an attacker that has compromised an SSH user's account to generate a list of additional
  targets that are more likely to have the same password or key.
