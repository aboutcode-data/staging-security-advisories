aliases:
  - CVE-2015-5600
summary: The kbdint_next_device function in auth2-chall.c in sshd in OpenSSH through 6.9 does
  not properly restrict the processing of keyboard-interactive devices within a single connection,
  which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct brute-force attacks or cause a denial
  of service (CPU consumption) via a long and duplicative list in the ssh -oKbdInteractiveDevices
  option, as demonstrated by a modified client that provides a different password for each pam
  element on this list.
