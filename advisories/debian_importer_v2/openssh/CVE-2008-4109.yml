  - CVE-2008-4109
summary: 'A certain Debian patch for OpenSSH before 4.3p2-9etch3 on etch; before 4.6p1-1 on
  sid and lenny; and on other distributions such as SUSE uses functions that are not async-signal-safe
  in the signal handler for login timeouts, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
  of service (connection slot exhaustion) via multiple login attempts. NOTE: this issue exists
  because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2006-5051.'
