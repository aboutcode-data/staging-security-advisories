aliases:
  - CVE-2025-26466
summary: A flaw was found in the OpenSSH package. For each ping packet the SSH server receives,
  a pong packet is allocated in a memory buffer and stored in a queue of packages. It is only
  freed when the server/client key exchange has finished. A malicious client may keep sending
  such packages, leading to an uncontrolled increase in memory consumption on the server side.
  Consequently, the server may become unavailable, resulting in a denial of service attack.
