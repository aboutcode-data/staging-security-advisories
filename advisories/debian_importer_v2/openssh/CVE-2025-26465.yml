aliases:
  - CVE-2025-26465
summary: A vulnerability was found in OpenSSH when the VerifyHostKeyDNS option is enabled. A
  machine-in-the-middle attack can be performed by a malicious machine impersonating a legit
  server. This issue occurs due to how OpenSSH mishandles error codes in specific conditions
  when verifying the host key. For an attack to be considered successful, the attacker needs
  to manage to exhaust the client's memory resource first, turning the attack complexity high.
