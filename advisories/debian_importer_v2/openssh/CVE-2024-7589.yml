  - CVE-2024-7589
summary: A signal handler in sshd(8) may call a logging function that is not async-signal-safe.  The
  signal handler is invoked when a client does not authenticate within the LoginGraceTime seconds
  (120 by default).  This signal handler executes in the context of the sshd(8)'s privileged
  code, which is not sandboxed and runs with full root privileges.  This issue is another instance
  of the problem in CVE-2024-6387 addressed by FreeBSD-SA-24:04.openssh.  The faulty code in
  this case is from the integration of blacklistd in OpenSSH in FreeBSD.  As a result of calling
  functions that are not async-signal-safe in the privileged sshd(8) context, a race condition
  exists that a determined attacker may be able to exploit to allow an unauthenticated remote
  code execution as root.
