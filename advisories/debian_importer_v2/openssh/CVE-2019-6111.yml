  - CVE-2019-6111
summary: An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to the scp implementation being derived
  from 1983 rcp, the server chooses which files/directories are sent to the client. However,
  the scp client only performs cursory validation of the object name returned (only directory
  traversal attacks are prevented). A malicious scp server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can
  overwrite arbitrary files in the scp client target directory. If recursive operation (-r)
  is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as well (for example, to overwrite
  the .ssh/authorized_keys file).
