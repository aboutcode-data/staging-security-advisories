aliases:
  - CVE-2004-2760
summary: 'sshd in OpenSSH 3.5p1, when PermitRootLogin is disabled, immediately closes the TCP
  connection after a root login attempt with the correct password, but leaves the connection
  open after an attempt with an incorrect password, which makes it easier for remote attackers
  to guess the password by observing the connection state, a different vulnerability than CVE-2003-0190.  NOTE:
  it could be argued that in most environments, this does not cross privilege boundaries without
  requiring leverage of a separate vulnerability.'
