  - CVE-2024-6409
summary: A race condition vulnerability was discovered in how signals are handled by OpenSSH's
  server (sshd). If a remote attacker does not authenticate within a set time period, then sshd's
  SIGALRM handler is called asynchronously. However, this signal handler calls various functions
  that are not async-signal-safe, for example, syslog(). As a consequence of a successful attack,
  in the worst case scenario, an attacker may be able to perform a remote code execution (RCE)
  as an unprivileged user running the sshd server.
