  - CVE-2020-12062
summary: 'The scp client in OpenSSH 8.2 incorrectly sends duplicate responses to the server
  upon a utimes system call failure, which allows a malicious unprivileged user on the remote
  server to overwrite arbitrary files in the client''s download directory by creating a crafted
  subdirectory anywhere on the remote server. The victim must use the command scp -rp to download
  a file hierarchy containing, anywhere inside, this crafted subdirectory. NOTE: the vendor
  points out that "this attack can achieve no more than a hostile peer is already able to achieve
  within the scp protocol" and "utimes does not fail under normal circumstances.'
