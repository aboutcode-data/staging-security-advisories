summary: 'OpenSSH through 8.7 allows remote attackers, who have a suspicion that a certain combination
  of username and public key is known to an SSH server, to test whether this suspicion is correct.
  This occurs because a challenge is sent only when that combination could be valid for a login
  session. NOTE: the vendor does not recognize user enumeration as a vulnerability for this
  product'
