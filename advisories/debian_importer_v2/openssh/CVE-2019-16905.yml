  - CVE-2019-16905
summary: 'OpenSSH 7.7 through 7.9 and 8.x before 8.1, when compiled with an experimental key
  type, has a pre-authentication integer overflow if a client or server is configured to use
  a crafted XMSS key. This leads to memory corruption and local code execution because of an
  error in the XMSS key parsing algorithm. NOTE: the XMSS implementation is considered experimental
  in all released OpenSSH versions, and there is no supported way to enable it when building
  portable OpenSSH.'
