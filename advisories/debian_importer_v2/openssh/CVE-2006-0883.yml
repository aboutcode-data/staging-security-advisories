  - CVE-2006-0883
summary: OpenSSH on FreeBSD 5.3 and 5.4, when used with OpenPAM, does not properly handle when
  a forked child process terminates during PAM authentication, which allows remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service (client connection refusal) by connecting multiple times to the
  SSH server, waiting for the password prompt, then disconnecting.
