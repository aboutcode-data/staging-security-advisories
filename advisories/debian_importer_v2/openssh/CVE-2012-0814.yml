  - CVE-2012-0814
summary: 'The auth_parse_options function in auth-options.c in sshd in OpenSSH before 5.7 provides
  debug messages containing authorized_keys command options, which allows remote authenticated
  users to obtain potentially sensitive information by reading these messages, as demonstrated
  by the shared user account required by Gitolite.  NOTE: this can cross privilege boundaries
  because a user account may intentionally have no shell or filesystem access, and therefore
  may have no supported way to read an authorized_keys file in its own home directory.'
