summary: 'The client side in OpenSSH 5.7 through 8.4 has an Observable Discrepancy leading to
  an information leak in the algorithm negotiation. This allows man-in-the-middle attackers
  to target initial connection attempts (where no host key for the server has been cached by
  the client). NOTE: some reports state that 8.5 and 8.6 are also affected.'
