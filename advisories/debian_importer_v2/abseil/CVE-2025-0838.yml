summary: There exists a heap buffer overflow vulnerable in Abseil-cpp. The sized constructors,
  reserve(), and rehash() methods of absl::{flat,node}hash{set,map} did not impose an upper
  bound on their size argument. As a result, it was possible for a caller to pass a very large
  size that would cause an integer overflow when computing the size of the container's backing
  store, and a subsequent out-of-bounds memory write. Subsequent accesses to the container might
  also access out-of-bounds memory. We recommend upgrading past commit 5a0e2cb5e3958dd90bb8569a2766622cb74d90c1
