  - CVE-2017-17847
summary: An issue was discovered in Enigmail before 1.9.9. Signature spoofing is possible because
  the UI does not properly distinguish between an attachment signature, and a signature that
  applies to the entire containing message, aka TBE-01-021. This is demonstrated by an e-mail
  message with an attachment that is a signed e-mail message in message/rfc822 format.
