aliases:
  - CVE-2007-1264
summary: Enigmail 0.94.2 and earlier does not properly use the --status-fd argument when invoking
  GnuPG, which prevents Enigmail from visually distinguishing between signed and unsigned portions
  of OpenPGP messages with multiple components, which allows remote attackers to forge the contents
  of a message without detection.
