summary: 'An issue was discovered in Enigmail before 1.9.9. In a variant of CVE-2017-17847,
  signature spoofing is possible for multipart/related messages because a signed message part
  can be referenced with a cid: URI but not actually displayed. In other words, the entire containing
  message appears to be signed, but the recipient does not see any of the signed text.'
