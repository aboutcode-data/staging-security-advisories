  - CVE-2020-15250
summary: 'In JUnit4 from version 4.7 and before 4.13.1, the test rule TemporaryFolder contains
  a local information disclosure vulnerability. On Unix like systems, the system''s temporary
  directory is shared between all users on that system. Because of this, when files and directories
  are written into this directory they are, by default, readable by other users on that same
  system. This vulnerability does not allow other users to overwrite the contents of these directories
  or files. This is purely an information disclosure vulnerability. This vulnerability impacts
  you if the JUnit tests write sensitive information, like API keys or passwords, into the temporary
  folder, and the JUnit tests execute in an environment where the OS has other untrusted users.
  Because certain JDK file system APIs were only added in JDK 1.7, this this fix is dependent
  upon the version of the JDK you are using. For Java 1.7 and higher users: this vulnerability
  is fixed in 4.13.1. For Java 1.6 and lower users: no patch is available, you must use the
  workaround below. If you are unable to patch, or are stuck running on Java 1.6, specifying
  the `java.io.tmpdir` system environment variable to a directory that is exclusively owned
  by the executing user will fix this vulnerability. For more information, including an example
  of vulnerable code, see the referenced GitHub Security Advisory.'
