  - CVE-2023-24998
summary: Apache Commons FileUpload before 1.5 does not limit the number of request parts to
  be processed resulting in the possibility of an attacker triggering a DoS with a malicious
  upload or series of uploads.     Note that, like all of the file upload limits, the           new
  configuration option (FileUploadBase#setFileCountMax) is not           enabled by default
  and must be explicitly configured.
