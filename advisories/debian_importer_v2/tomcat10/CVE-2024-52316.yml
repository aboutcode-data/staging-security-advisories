  - CVE-2024-52316
summary: 'Unchecked Error Condition vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. If Tomcat is configured
  to use a custom Jakarta Authentication (formerly JASPIC) ServerAuthContext component which
  may throw an exception during the authentication process without explicitly setting an HTTP
  status to indicate failure, the authentication may not fail, allowing the user to bypass the
  authentication process. There are no known Jakarta Authentication components that behave in
  this way.  This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M26, from 10.1.0-M1
  through 10.1.30, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.95.  The following versions were EOL at the time
  the CVE was created but are  known to be affected: 8.5.0 though 8.5.100. Other EOL versions
  may also be affected.   Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0, 10.1.31 or 9.0.96,
  which fix the issue.'
