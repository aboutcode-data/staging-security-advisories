  - CVE-2023-42794
summary: Incomplete Cleanup vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.  The internal fork of Commons FileUpload
  packaged with Apache Tomcat 9.0.70 through 9.0.80 and 8.5.85 through 8.5.93 included an unreleased,  in
  progress refactoring that exposed a potential denial of service on  Windows if a web application
  opened a stream for an uploaded file but  failed to close the stream. The file would never
  be deleted from disk  creating the possibility of an eventual denial of service due to the  disk
  being full.  Other, EOL versions may also be affected.   Users are recommended to upgrade
  to version 9.0.81 onwards or 8.5.94 onwards, which fixes the issue.
