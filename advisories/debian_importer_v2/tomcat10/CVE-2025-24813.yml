summary: 'Path Equivalence: ''file.Name'' (Internal Dot) leading to Remote Code Execution and/or
  Information disclosure and/or malicious content added to uploaded files via write enabled Default
  Servlet in Apache Tomcat.  This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.2,
  from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.34, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.98. The following versions were
  EOL at the time the CVE was created but are  known to be affected: 8.5.0 though 8.5.100. Other,
  older, EOL versions  may also be affected.   If all of the following were true, a malicious
  user was able to view       security sensitive files and/or inject content into those files:
  - writes enabled for the default servlet (disabled by default) - support for partial PUT (enabled
  by default) - a target URL for security sensitive uploads that was a sub-directory of a target
  URL for public uploads - attacker knowledge of the names of security sensitive files being uploaded
  - the security sensitive files also being uploaded via partial PUT  If all of the following
  were true, a malicious user was able to       perform remote code execution: - writes enabled
  for the default servlet (disabled by default) - support for partial PUT (enabled by default)
  - application was using Tomcat''s file based session persistence with the default storage
  location - application included a library that may be leveraged in a deserialization attack  Users
  are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.3, 10.1.35 or 9.0.99, which fixes the issue.'
