  - CVE-2025-49125
summary: 'Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. 
  When using PreResources or PostResources mounted other than at the root of the web application,
  it was possible to access those resources via an unexpected path. That path was likely not
  to be protected by the same security constraints as the expected path, allowing those security
  constraints to be bypassed.  This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.7,
  from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.41, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.105. The following versions were
  EOL at the time the CVE was created but are  known to be affected: 8.5.0 through 8.5.100.
  Other, older, EOL versions  may also be affected.   Users are recommended to upgrade to version
  11.0.8, 10.1.42 or 9.0.106, which fix the issue.'
