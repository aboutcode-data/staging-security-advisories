  - CVE-2017-17518
summary: 'swt/motif/browser.c in White_dune (aka whitedune) 0.30.10 does not validate strings
  before launching the program specified by the BROWSER environment variable, which might allow
  remote attackers to conduct argument-injection attacks via a crafted URL. NOTE: This issue
  is being disputed as not being a vulnerability because “the current version of white_dune
  (1.369 at https://wdune.ourproject.org/) do not use a "BROWSER environment variable". Instead,
  the "browser" variable is read from the $HOME/.dunerc file (or from the M$Windows registry).
  It is configurable in the "options" menu. The default is chosen in the ./configure script,
  which tests various programs, first tested is "xdg-open".'
