  - CVE-2024-45409
summary: The Ruby SAML library is for implementing the client side of a SAML authorization.
  Ruby-SAML in <= 12.2 and 1.13.0 <= 1.16.0 does not properly verify the signature of the SAML
  Response. An unauthenticated attacker with access to any signed saml document (by the IdP)
  can thus forge a SAML Response/Assertion with arbitrary contents. This would allow the attacker
  to log in as arbitrary user within the vulnerable system. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.17.0
  and 1.12.3.
