  - CVE-2025-25292
summary: ruby-saml provides security assertion markup language (SAML) single sign-on (SSO) for
  Ruby. An authentication bypass vulnerability was found in ruby-saml prior to versions 1.12.4
  and 1.18.0 due to a parser differential. ReXML and Nokogiri parse XML differently, the parsers
  can generate entirely different document structures from the same XML input. That allows an
  attacker to be able to execute a Signature Wrapping attack. This issue may lead to authentication
  bypass. Versions 1.12.4 and 1.18.0 contain a patch for the issue.
