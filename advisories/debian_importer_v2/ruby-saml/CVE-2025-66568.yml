  - CVE-2025-66568
summary: The ruby-saml library implements the client side of an SAML authorization. Versions
  up to and including 1.12.4, are vulnerable to authentication bypass through the libxml2 canonicalization
  process used by Nokogiri for document transformation, which allows an attacker to execute
  a Signature Wrapping attack. When libxml2’s canonicalization is invoked on an invalid XML
  input, it may return an empty string rather than a canonicalized node. ruby-saml then proceeds
  to compute the DigestValue over this empty string, treating it as if canonicalization succeeded.
  This issue is fixed in version 1.18.0.
