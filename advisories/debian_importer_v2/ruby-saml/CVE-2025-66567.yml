  - CVE-2025-66567
summary: The ruby-saml library is for implementing the client side of a SAML authorization.
  ruby-saml versions up to and including 1.12.4 contain an authentication bypass vulnerability
  due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2025-25292. ReXML and Nokogiri parse XML differently, generating
  entirely different document structures from the same input. This allows an attacker to execute
  a Signature Wrapping attack. This issue is fixed in version 1.18.0.
