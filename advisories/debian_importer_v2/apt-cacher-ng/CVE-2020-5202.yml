  - CVE-2020-5202
summary: apt-cacher-ng through 3.3 allows local users to obtain sensitive information by hijacking
  the hardcoded TCP port. The /usr/lib/apt-cacher-ng/acngtool program attempts to connect to
  apt-cacher-ng via TCP on localhost port 3142, even if the explicit SocketPath=/var/run/apt-cacher-ng/socket
  command-line option is passed. The cron job /etc/cron.daily/apt-cacher-ng (which is active
  by default) attempts this periodically. Because 3142 is an unprivileged port, any local user
  can try to bind to this port and will receive requests from acngtool. There can be sensitive
  data in these requests, e.g., if AdminAuth is enabled in /etc/apt-cacher-ng/security.conf.
  This sensitive data can leak to unprivileged local users that manage to bind to this port
  before the apt-cacher-ng daemon can.
