  - CVE-2025-69421
summary: 'Issue summary: Processing a malformed PKCS#12 file can trigger a NULL pointer dereference
  in the PKCS12_item_decrypt_d2i_ex() function.  Impact summary: A NULL pointer dereference
  can trigger a crash which leads to Denial of Service for an application processing PKCS#12
  files.  The PKCS12_item_decrypt_d2i_ex() function does not check whether the oct parameter
  is NULL before dereferencing it. When called from PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata() with a malformed
  PKCS#12 file, this parameter can be NULL, causing a crash. The vulnerability is limited to
  Denial of Service and cannot be escalated to achieve code execution or memory disclosure.  Exploiting
  this issue requires an attacker to provide a malformed PKCS#12 file to an application that
  processes it. For that reason the issue was assessed as Low severity according to our Security
  Policy.  The FIPS modules in 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue, as
  the PKCS#12 implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary.  OpenSSL 3.6, 3.5,
  3.4, 3.3, 3.0, 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are vulnerable to this issue.'
