summary: 'Issue summary: The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM platform
  contains a bug that could cause it to read past the input buffer, leading to a crash.  Impact
  summary: Applications that use the AES-XTS algorithm on the 64 bit ARM platform can crash
  in rare circumstances. The AES-XTS algorithm is usually used for disk encryption.  The AES-XTS
  cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM platform will read past the end of the ciphertext
  buffer if the ciphertext size is 4 mod 5 in 16 byte blocks, e.g. 144 bytes or 1024 bytes.
  If the memory after the ciphertext buffer is unmapped, this will trigger a crash which results
  in a denial of service.  If an attacker can control the size and location of the ciphertext
  buffer being decrypted by an application using AES-XTS on 64 bit ARM, the application is affected.
  This is fairly unlikely making this issue a Low severity one.'
