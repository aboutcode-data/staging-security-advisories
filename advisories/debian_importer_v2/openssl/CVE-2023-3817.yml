summary: 'Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow.  Impact
  summary: Applications that use the functions DH_check(), DH_check_ex() or EVP_PKEY_param_check()
  to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters
  that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial
  of Service.  The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. After fixing
  CVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger an overly
  long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value, if present, cannot be larger
  than the modulus p parameter, thus it is unnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger
  than p.  An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from
  an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.  The function DH_check()
  is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those
  other functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex()
  and EVP_PKEY_param_check().  Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command
  line applications when using the "-check" option.  The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not
  affected by this issue.  The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.'
