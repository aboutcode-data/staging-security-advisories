summary: 'Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow.  Impact
  summary: Applications that use the functions DH_check(), DH_check_ex() or EVP_PKEY_param_check()
  to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters
  that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial
  of Service.  The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. One of those
  checks confirms that the modulus (''p'' parameter) is not too large. Trying to use a very
  large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which is over 10,000 bits
  in length.  However the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or parameters
  that have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value even if it has
  already been found to be too large.  An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key
  or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial of Service
  attack.  The function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.
  An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected. The other functions
  affected by this are DH_check_ex() and EVP_PKEY_param_check().  Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL
  dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications when using the ''-check'' option.  The OpenSSL
  SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers
  are not affected by this issue.'
