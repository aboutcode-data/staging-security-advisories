summary: OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can find a configuration
  file as well as certificates used for verification in TLS. This directory is most commonly
  referred to as OPENSSLDIR, and is configurable with the --prefix / --openssldir configuration
  options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1, the mingw configuration targets assume that
  resulting programs and libraries are installed in a Unix-like environment and the default
  prefix for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR should be '/usr/local'. However,
  mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such, find themselves looking at sub-directories
  of 'C:/usr/local', which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users to modify OpenSSL's
  default configuration, insert CA certificates, modify (or even replace) existing engine modules,
  etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, '/usr/local/ssl' is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on all Unix and
  Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the diverse
  Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own --prefix. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1,
  1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments
  this has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this
  time. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k).
  Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s).
