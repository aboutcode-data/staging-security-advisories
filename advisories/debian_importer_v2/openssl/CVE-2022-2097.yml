  - CVE-2022-2097
summary: AES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms using the AES-NI assembly optimised implementation
  will not encrypt the entirety of the data under some circumstances. This could reveal sixteen
  bytes of data that was preexisting in the memory that wasn't written. In the special case
  of "in place" encryption, sixteen bytes of the plaintext would be revealed. Since OpenSSL
  does not support OCB based cipher suites for TLS and DTLS, they are both unaffected. Fixed
  in OpenSSL 3.0.5 (Affected 3.0.0-3.0.4). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1q (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1p).
