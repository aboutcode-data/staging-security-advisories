summary: 'The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that
  can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing
  certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic
  curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the
  infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since
  certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process
  that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service
  attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can
  contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients
  consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers
  taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification
  requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also
  any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter
  values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not
  parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger
  the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate
  will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate
  to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL
  versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the
  15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected
  1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc).'
