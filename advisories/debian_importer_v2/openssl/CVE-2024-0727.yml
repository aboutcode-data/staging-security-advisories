summary: 'Issue summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead OpenSSL to
  crash leading to a potential Denial of Service attack  Impact summary: Applications loading
  files in the PKCS12 format from untrusted sources might terminate abruptly.  A file in PKCS12
  format can contain certificates and keys and may come from an untrusted source. The PKCS12
  specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but OpenSSL does not correctly check for this
  case. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an
  application processes PKCS12 files from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that
  application will be vulnerable to this issue.  OpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are:
  PKCS12_parse(), PKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes()
  and PKCS12_newpass().  We have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7(). However
  since this function is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant.  The
  FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.'
