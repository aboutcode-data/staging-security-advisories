  - CVE-2019-1549
summary: OpenSSL 1.1.1 introduced a rewritten random number generator (RNG). This was intended
  to include protection in the event of a fork() system call in order to ensure that the parent
  and child processes did not share the same RNG state. However this protection was not being
  used in the default case. A partial mitigation for this issue is that the output from a high
  precision timer is mixed into the RNG state so the likelihood of a parent and child process
  sharing state is significantly reduced. If an application already calls OPENSSL_init_crypto()
  explicitly using OPENSSL_INIT_ATFORK then this problem does not occur at all. Fixed in OpenSSL
  1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c).
