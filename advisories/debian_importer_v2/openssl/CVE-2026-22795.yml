summary: 'Issue summary: An invalid or NULL pointer dereference can happen in an application
  processing a malformed PKCS#12 file.  Impact summary: An application processing a malformed
  PKCS#12 file can be caused to dereference an invalid or NULL pointer on memory read, resulting
  in a Denial of Service.  A type confusion vulnerability exists in PKCS#12 parsing code where
  an ASN1_TYPE union member is accessed without first validating the type, causing an invalid
  pointer read.  The location is constrained to a 1-byte address space, meaning any attempted
  pointer manipulation can only target addresses between 0x00 and 0xFF. This range corresponds
  to the zero page, which is unmapped on most modern operating systems and will reliably result
  in a crash, leading only to a Denial of Service. Exploiting this issue also requires a user
  or application to process a maliciously crafted PKCS#12 file. It is uncommon to accept untrusted
  PKCS#12 files in applications as they are usually used to store private keys which are trusted
  by definition. For these reasons, the issue was assessed as Low severity.  The FIPS modules
  in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue, as the PKCS12 implementation is outside
  the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary.  OpenSSL 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.0 and 1.1.1 are vulnerable
  to this issue.  OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not affected by this issue.'
