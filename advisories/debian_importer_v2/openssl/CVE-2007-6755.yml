aliases:
  - CVE-2007-6755
summary: 'The NIST SP 800-90A default statement of the Dual Elliptic Curve Deterministic Random
  Bit Generation (Dual_EC_DRBG) algorithm contains point Q constants with a possible relationship
  to certain "skeleton key" values, which might allow context-dependent attackers to defeat
  cryptographic protection mechanisms by leveraging knowledge of those values.  NOTE: this is
  a preliminary CVE for Dual_EC_DRBG; future research may provide additional details about point
  Q and associated attacks, and could potentially lead to a RECAST or REJECT of this CVE.'
