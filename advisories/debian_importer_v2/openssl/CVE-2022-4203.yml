aliases:
  - CVE-2022-4203
summary: A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically
  in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification
  and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to
  continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer.  The
  read buffer overrun might result in a crash which could lead to a denial of service attack.
  In theory it could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private
  keys, or sensitive plaintext) although we are not aware of any working exploit leading to
  memory contents disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory.  In a TLS client, this
  can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered
  if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects.
