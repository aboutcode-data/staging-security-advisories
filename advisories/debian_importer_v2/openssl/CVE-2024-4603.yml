summary: 'Issue summary: Checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters may be very slow.  Impact
  summary: Applications that use the functions EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check()
  to check a DSA public key or DSA parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters
  that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial
  of Service.  The functions EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() perform various
  checks on DSA parameters. Some of those computations take a long time if the modulus (`p`
  parameter) is too large.  Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not
  allow using public keys with a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length for signature verification.
  However the key and parameter check functions do not limit the modulus size when performing
  the checks.  An application that calls EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() and
  supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial
  of Service attack.  These functions are not called by OpenSSL itself on untrusted DSA keys
  so only applications that directly call these functions may be vulnerable.  Also vulnerable
  are the OpenSSL pkey and pkeyparam command line applications when using the `-check` option.  The
  OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.  The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS
  providers are affected by this issue.'
