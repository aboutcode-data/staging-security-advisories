summary: 'Issue summary: Writing large, newline-free data into a BIO chain using the line-buffering
  filter where the next BIO performs short writes can trigger a heap-based out-of-bounds write.  Impact
  summary: This out-of-bounds write can cause memory corruption which typically results in a
  crash, leading to Denial of Service for an application.  The line-buffering BIO filter (BIO_f_linebuffer)
  is not used by default in TLS/SSL data paths. In OpenSSL command-line applications, it is
  typically only pushed onto stdout/stderr on VMS systems. Third-party applications that explicitly
  use this filter with a BIO chain that can short-write and that write large, newline-free data
  influenced by an attacker would be affected. However, the circumstances where this could happen
  are unlikely to be under attacker control, and BIO_f_linebuffer is unlikely to be handling
  non-curated data controlled by an attacker. For that reason the issue was assessed as Low
  severity.  The FIPS modules in 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue,
  as the BIO implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary.  OpenSSL 3.6, 3.5,
  3.4, 3.3, 3.0, 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are vulnerable to this issue.'
