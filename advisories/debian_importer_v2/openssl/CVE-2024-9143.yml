summary: 'Issue summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted explicit
  values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads or writes.  Impact
  summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash or even a possibility
  of a remote code execution, however, in all the protocols involving Elliptic Curve Cryptography
  that we''re aware of, either only "named curves" are supported, or, if explicit curve parameters
  are supported, they specify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2^m)) curves that can''t represent
  problematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable application is
  low.  In particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509 certificates, so problematic
  inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509 certificates.  Any problematic use-cases
  would have to be using an "exotic" curve encoding.  The affected APIs include: EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m(),
  EC_GROUP_new_from_params(), and various supporting BN_GF2m_*() functions.  Applications working
  with "exotic" explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters, that make it possible to represent
  invalid field polynomials with a zero constant term, via the above or similar APIs, may terminate
  abruptly as a result of reading or writing outside of array bounds.  Remote code execution
  cannot easily be ruled out.  The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by
  this issue.'
