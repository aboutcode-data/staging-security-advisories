  - CVE-2016-2842
summary: The doapr_outch function in crypto/bio/b_print.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1s and
  1.0.2 before 1.0.2g does not verify that a certain memory allocation succeeds, which allows
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write or memory consumption)
  or possibly have unspecified other impact via a long string, as demonstrated by a large amount
  of ASN.1 data, a different vulnerability than CVE-2016-0799.
