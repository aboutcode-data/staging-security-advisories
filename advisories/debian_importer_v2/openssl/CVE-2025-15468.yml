summary: 'Issue summary: If an application using the SSL_CIPHER_find() function in a QUIC protocol
  client or server receives an unknown cipher suite from the peer, a NULL dereference occurs.  Impact
  summary: A NULL pointer dereference leads to abnormal termination of the running process causing
  Denial of Service.  Some applications call SSL_CIPHER_find() from the client_hello_cb callback
  on the cipher ID received from the peer. If this is done with an SSL object implementing the
  QUIC protocol, NULL pointer dereference will happen if the examined cipher ID is unknown or
  unsupported.  As it is not very common to call this function in applications using the QUIC  protocol
  and the worst outcome is Denial of Service, the issue was assessed as Low severity.  The vulnerable
  code was introduced in the 3.2 version with the addition of the QUIC protocol support.  The
  FIPS modules in 3.6, 3.5, 3.4 and 3.3 are not affected by this issue, as the QUIC implementation
  is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary.  OpenSSL 3.6, 3.5, 3.4 and 3.3 are vulnerable
  to this issue.  OpenSSL 3.0, 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are not affected by this issue.'
