  - CVE-2009-0789
summary: OpenSSL before 0.9.8k on WIN64 and certain other platforms does not properly handle
  a malformed ASN.1 structure, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid
  memory access and application crash) by placing this structure in the public key of a certificate,
  as demonstrated by an RSA public key.
