summary: 'Issue summary: A TLS 1.3 connection using certificate compression can be forced to
  allocate a large buffer before decompression without checking against the configured certificate
  size limit.  Impact summary: An attacker can cause per-connection memory allocations of up
  to approximately 22 MiB and extra CPU work, potentially leading to service degradation or
  resource exhaustion (Denial of Service).  In affected configurations, the peer-supplied uncompressed
  certificate length from a CompressedCertificate message is used to grow a heap buffer prior
  to decompression. This length is not bounded by the max_cert_list setting, which otherwise
  constrains certificate message sizes. An attacker can exploit this to cause large per-connection
  allocations followed by handshake failure. No memory corruption or information disclosure
  occurs.  This issue only affects builds where TLS 1.3 certificate compression is compiled
  in (i.e., not OPENSSL_NO_COMP_ALG) and at least one compression algorithm (brotli, zlib, or
  zstd) is available, and where the compression extension is negotiated. Both clients receiving
  a server CompressedCertificate and servers in mutual TLS scenarios receiving a client CompressedCertificate
  are affected. Servers that do not request client certificates are not vulnerable to client-initiated
  attacks.  Users can mitigate this issue by setting SSL_OP_NO_RX_CERTIFICATE_COMPRESSION to
  disable receiving compressed certificates.  The FIPS modules in 3.6, 3.5, 3.4 and 3.3 are
  not affected by this issue, as the TLS implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary.  OpenSSL
  3.6, 3.5, 3.4 and 3.3 are vulnerable to this issue.  OpenSSL 3.0, 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are not
  affected by this issue.'
