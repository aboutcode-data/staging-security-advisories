summary: There is a carry propagating bug in the x86_64 Montgomery squaring procedure in OpenSSL
  before 1.0.2m and 1.1.0 before 1.1.0g. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that
  attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform
  and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very
  difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may
  be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be very significant
  and likely only accessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would additionally
  need online access to an unpatched system using the target private key in a scenario with
  persistent DH parameters and a private key that is shared between multiple clients. This only
  affects processors that support the BMI1, BMI2 and ADX extensions like Intel Broadwell (5th
  generation) and later or AMD Ryzen.
