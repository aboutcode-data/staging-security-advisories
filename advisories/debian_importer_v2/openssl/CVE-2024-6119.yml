summary: 'Issue summary: Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g., TLS clients
  checking server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory address resulting in abnormal
  termination of the application process.  Impact summary: Abnormal termination of an application
  can a cause a denial of service.  Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g., TLS
  clients checking server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory address when comparing
  the expected name with an `otherName` subject alternative name of an X.509 certificate. This
  may result in an exception that terminates the application program.  Note that basic certificate
  chain validation (signatures, dates, ...) is not affected, the denial of service can occur
  only when the application also specifies an expected DNS name, Email address or IP address.  TLS
  servers rarely solicit client certificates, and even when they do, they generally don''t perform
  a name check against a reference identifier (expected identity), but rather extract the presented
  identity after checking the certificate chain.  So TLS servers are generally not affected
  and the severity of the issue is Moderate.  The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are
  not affected by this issue.'
