summary: An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation ClientHello
  message from a client. If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello omits the signature_algorithms
  extension (where it was present in the initial ClientHello), but includes a signature_algorithms_cert
  extension then a NULL pointer dereference will result, leading to a crash and a denial of
  service attack. A server is only vulnerable if it has TLSv1.2 and renegotiation enabled (which
  is the default configuration). OpenSSL TLS clients are not impacted by this issue. All OpenSSL
  1.1.1 versions are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL
  1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1k (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1j).
