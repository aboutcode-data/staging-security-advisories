summary: 'Issue summary: The AES-SIV cipher implementation contains a bug that causes it to
  ignore empty associated data entries which are unauthenticated as a consequence.  Impact summary:
  Applications that use the AES-SIV algorithm and want to authenticate empty data entries as
  associated data can be misled by removing, adding or reordering such empty entries as these
  are ignored by the OpenSSL implementation. We are currently unaware of any such applications.  The
  AES-SIV algorithm allows for authentication of multiple associated data entries along with
  the encryption. To authenticate empty data the application has to call EVP_EncryptUpdate()
  (or EVP_CipherUpdate()) with NULL pointer as the output buffer and 0 as the input buffer length.
  The AES-SIV implementation in OpenSSL just returns success for such a call instead of performing
  the associated data authentication operation. The empty data thus will not be authenticated.  As
  this issue does not affect non-empty associated data authentication and we expect it to be
  rare for an application to use empty associated data entries this is qualified as Low severity
  issue.'
