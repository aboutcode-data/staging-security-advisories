  - CVE-2017-3732
summary: 'There is a carry propagating bug in the x86_64 Montgomery squaring procedure in OpenSSL
  1.0.2 before 1.0.2k and 1.1.0 before 1.1.0d. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests
  that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform
  and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very
  difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may
  be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be very significant
  and likely only accessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would additionally
  need online access to an unpatched system using the target private key in a scenario with
  persistent DH parameters and a private key that is shared between multiple clients. For example
  this can occur by default in OpenSSL DHE based SSL/TLS ciphersuites. Note: This issue is very
  similar to CVE-2015-3193 but must be treated as a separate problem.'
