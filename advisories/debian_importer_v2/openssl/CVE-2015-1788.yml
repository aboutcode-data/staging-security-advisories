  - CVE-2015-1788
summary: The BN_GF2m_mod_inv function in crypto/bn/bn_gf2m.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8s, 1.0.0
  before 1.0.0e, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1n, and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2b does not properly handle ECParameters
  structures in which the curve is over a malformed binary polynomial field, which allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a session that uses an Elliptic
  Curve algorithm, as demonstrated by an attack against a server that supports client authentication.
