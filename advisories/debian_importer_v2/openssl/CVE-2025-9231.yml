summary: 'Issue summary: A timing side-channel which could potentially allow remote recovery
  of the private key exists in the SM2 algorithm implementation on 64 bit ARM platforms.  Impact
  summary: A timing side-channel in SM2 signature computations on 64 bit ARM platforms could
  allow recovering the private key by an attacker..  While remote key recovery over a network
  was not attempted by the reporter, timing measurements revealed a timing signal which may
  allow such an attack.  OpenSSL does not directly support certificates with SM2 keys in TLS,
  and so this CVE is not relevant in most TLS contexts.  However, given that it is possible
  to add support for such certificates via a custom provider, coupled with the fact that in
  such a custom provider context the private key may be recoverable via remote timing measurements,
  we consider this to be a Moderate severity issue.  The FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2,
  3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue, as SM2 is not an approved algorithm.'
