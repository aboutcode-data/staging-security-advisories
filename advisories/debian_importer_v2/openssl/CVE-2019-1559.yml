  - CVE-2019-1559
summary: If an application encounters a fatal protocol error and then calls SSL_shutdown() twice
  (once to send a close_notify, and once to receive one) then OpenSSL can respond differently
  to the calling application if a 0 byte record is received with invalid padding compared to
  if a 0 byte record is received with an invalid MAC. If the application then behaves differently
  based on that in a way that is detectable to the remote peer, then this amounts to a padding
  oracle that could be used to decrypt data. In order for this to be exploitable "non-stitched"
  ciphersuites must be in use. Stitched ciphersuites are optimised implementations of certain
  commonly used ciphersuites. Also the application must call SSL_shutdown() twice even if a
  protocol error has occurred (applications should not do this but some do anyway). Fixed in
  OpenSSL 1.0.2r (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2q).
