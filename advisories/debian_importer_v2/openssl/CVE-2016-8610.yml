  - CVE-2016-8610
summary: A denial of service flaw was found in OpenSSL 0.9.8, 1.0.1, 1.0.2 through 1.0.2h, and
  1.1.0 in the way the TLS/SSL protocol defined processing of ALERT packets during a connection
  handshake. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server consume an excessive
  amount of CPU and fail to accept connections from other clients.
