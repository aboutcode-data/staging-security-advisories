summary: 'Issue summary: A type confusion vulnerability exists in the TimeStamp Response verification
  code where an ASN1_TYPE union member is accessed without first validating the type, causing
  an invalid or NULL pointer dereference when processing a malformed TimeStamp Response file.  Impact
  summary: An application calling TS_RESP_verify_response() with a malformed TimeStamp Response
  can be caused to dereference an invalid or NULL pointer when reading, resulting in a Denial
  of Service.  The functions ossl_ess_get_signing_cert() and ossl_ess_get_signing_cert_v2()
  access the signing cert attribute value without validating its type. When the type is not
  V_ASN1_SEQUENCE, this results in accessing invalid memory through the ASN1_TYPE union, causing
  a crash.  Exploiting this vulnerability requires an attacker to provide a malformed TimeStamp
  Response to an application that verifies timestamp responses. The TimeStamp protocol (RFC
  3161) is not widely used and the impact of the exploit is just a Denial of Service. For these
  reasons the issue was assessed as Low severity.  The FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3 and 3.0
  are not affected by this issue, as the TimeStamp Response implementation is outside the OpenSSL
  FIPS module boundary.  OpenSSL 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.0 and 1.1.1 are vulnerable to this issue.  OpenSSL
  1.0.2 is not affected by this issue.'
