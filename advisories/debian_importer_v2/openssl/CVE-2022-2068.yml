  - CVE-2022-2068
summary: In addition to the c_rehash shell command injection identified in CVE-2022-1292, further
  circumstances where the c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to
  prevent command injection were found by code review. When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed it was
  not discovered that there are other places in the script where the file names of certificates
  being hashed were possibly passed to a command executed through the shell. This script is
  distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such
  operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the
  script. Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL
  rehash command line tool. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.4 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.0.3). Fixed
  in OpenSSL 1.1.1p (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1o). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zf (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2ze).
