  - CVE-2015-1791
summary: Race condition in the ssl3_get_new_session_ticket function in ssl/s3_clnt.c in OpenSSL
  before 0.9.8zg, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0s, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1n, and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2b, when used
  for a multi-threaded client, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (double
  free and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by providing a NewSessionTicket
  during an attempt to reuse a ticket that had been obtained earlier.
