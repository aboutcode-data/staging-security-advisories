summary: The X509_cmp_time function in crypto/x509/x509_vfy.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8zg, 1.0.0
  before 1.0.0s, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1n, and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2b allows remote attackers to cause
  a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted length field
  in ASN1_TIME data, as demonstrated by an attack against a server that supports client authentication
  with a custom verification callback.
