  - CVE-2017-3737
summary: OpenSSL 1.0.2 (starting from version 1.0.2b) introduced an "error state" mechanism.
  The intent was that if a fatal error occurred during a handshake then OpenSSL would move into
  the error state and would immediately fail if you attempted to continue the handshake. This
  works as designed for the explicit handshake functions (SSL_do_handshake(), SSL_accept() and
  SSL_connect()), however due to a bug it does not work correctly if SSL_read() or SSL_write()
  is called directly. In that scenario, if the handshake fails then a fatal error will be returned
  in the initial function call. If SSL_read()/SSL_write() is subsequently called by the application
  for the same SSL object then it will succeed and the data is passed without being decrypted/encrypted
  directly from the SSL/TLS record layer. In order to exploit this issue an application bug
  would have to be present that resulted in a call to SSL_read()/SSL_write() being issued after
  having already received a fatal error. OpenSSL version 1.0.2b-1.0.2m are affected. Fixed in
  OpenSSL 1.0.2n. OpenSSL 1.1.0 is not affected.
