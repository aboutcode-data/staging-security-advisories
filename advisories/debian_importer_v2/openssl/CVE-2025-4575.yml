summary: 'Issue summary: Use of -addreject option with the openssl x509 application adds a trusted
  use instead of a rejected use for a certificate.  Impact summary: If a user intends to make
  a trusted certificate rejected for a particular use it will be instead marked as trusted for
  that use.  A copy & paste error during minor refactoring of the code introduced this issue
  in the OpenSSL 3.5 version. If, for example, a trusted CA certificate should be trusted only
  for the purpose of authenticating TLS servers but not for CMS signature verification and the
  CMS signature verification is intended to be marked as rejected with the -addreject option,
  the resulting CA certificate will be trusted for CMS signature verification purpose instead.  Only
  users which use the trusted certificate format who use the openssl x509 command line application
  to add rejected uses are affected by this issue. The issues affecting only the command line
  application are considered to be Low severity.  The FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1
  and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.  OpenSSL 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1, 3.0, 1.1.1 and 1.0.2
  are also not affected by this issue.'
