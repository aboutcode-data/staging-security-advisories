  - CVE-2022-2274
summary: The OpenSSL 3.0.4 release introduced a serious bug in the RSA implementation for X86_64
  CPUs supporting the AVX512IFMA instructions. This issue makes the RSA implementation with
  2048 bit private keys incorrect on such machines and memory corruption will happen during
  the computation. As a consequence of the memory corruption an attacker may be able to trigger
  a remote code execution on the machine performing the computation. SSL/TLS servers or other
  servers using 2048 bit RSA private keys running on machines supporting AVX512IFMA instructions
  of the X86_64 architecture are affected by this issue.
