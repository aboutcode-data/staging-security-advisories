  - CVE-2019-1547
summary: Normally in OpenSSL EC groups always have a co-factor present and this is used in side
  channel resistant code paths. However, in some cases, it is possible to construct a group
  using explicit parameters (instead of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible
  that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters
  match a known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel
  resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation.
  In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability to time the creation
  of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in
  use by an application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is not vulnerable
  because explicit parameters are never used. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c).
  Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s).
