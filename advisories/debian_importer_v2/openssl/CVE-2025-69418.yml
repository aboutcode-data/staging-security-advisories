summary: 'Issue summary: When using the low-level OCB API directly with AES-NI or<br>other hardware-accelerated
  code paths, inputs whose length is not a multiple<br>of 16 bytes can leave the final partial
  block unencrypted and unauthenticated.<br><br>Impact summary: The trailing 1-15 bytes of a
  message may be exposed in<br>cleartext on encryption and are not covered by the authentication
  tag,<br>allowing an attacker to read or tamper with those bytes without detection.<br><br>The
  low-level OCB encrypt and decrypt routines in the hardware-accelerated<br>stream path process
  full 16-byte blocks but do not advance the input/output<br>pointers. The subsequent tail-handling
  code then operates on the original<br>base pointers, effectively reprocessing the beginning
  of the buffer while<br>leaving the actual trailing bytes unprocessed. The authentication checksum<br>also
  excludes the true tail bytes.<br><br>However, typical OpenSSL consumers using EVP are not
  affected because the<br>higher-level EVP and provider OCB implementations split inputs so
  that full<br>blocks and trailing partial blocks are processed in separate calls, avoiding<br>the
  problematic code path. Additionally, TLS does not use OCB ciphersuites.<br>The vulnerability
  only affects applications that call the low-level<br>CRYPTO_ocb128_encrypt() or CRYPTO_ocb128_decrypt()
  functions directly with<br>non-block-aligned lengths in a single call on hardware-accelerated
  builds.<br>For these reasons the issue was assessed as Low severity.<br><br>The FIPS modules
  in 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected<br>by this issue, as OCB mode is
  not a FIPS-approved algorithm.<br><br>OpenSSL 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.0 and 1.1.1 are vulnerable
  to this issue.<br><br>OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not affected by this issue.'
