summary: The c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command
  injection. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically
  executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the
  privileges of the script. Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be
  replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2).
  Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1o (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1n). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2ze (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zd).
