summary: The OPENSSL_LH_flush() function, which empties a hash table, contains a bug that breaks
  reuse of the memory occuppied by the removed hash table entries. This function is used when
  decoding certificates or keys. If a long lived process periodically decodes certificates or
  keys its memory usage will expand without bounds and the process might be terminated by the
  operating system causing a denial of service. Also traversing the empty hash table entries
  will take increasingly more time. Typically such long lived processes might be TLS clients
  or TLS servers configured to accept client certificate authentication. The function was added
  in the OpenSSL 3.0 version thus older releases are not affected by the issue. Fixed in OpenSSL
  3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2).
