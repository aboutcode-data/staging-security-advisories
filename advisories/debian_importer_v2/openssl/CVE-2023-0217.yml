aliases:
  - CVE-2023-0217
summary: An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an application tries to
  check a malformed DSA public key by the EVP_PKEY_public_check() function. This will most likely
  lead to an application crash. This function can be called on public keys supplied from untrusted
  sources which could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service attack.  The TLS implementation
  in OpenSSL does not call this function but applications might call the function if there are
  additional security requirements imposed by standards such as FIPS 140-3.
