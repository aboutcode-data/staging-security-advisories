summary: 'Issue summary: Some non-default TLS server configurations can cause unbounded memory
  growth when processing TLSv1.3 sessions  Impact summary: An attacker may exploit certain server
  configurations to trigger unbounded memory growth that would lead to a Denial of Service  This
  problem can occur in TLSv1.3 if the non-default SSL_OP_NO_TICKET option is being used (but
  not if early_data support is also configured and the default anti-replay protection is in
  use). In this case, under certain conditions, the session cache can get into an incorrect
  state and it will fail to flush properly as it fills. The session cache will continue to grow
  in an unbounded manner. A malicious client could deliberately create the scenario for this
  failure to force a Denial of Service. It may also happen by accident in normal operation.  This
  issue only affects TLS servers supporting TLSv1.3. It does not affect TLS clients.  The FIPS
  modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is also not affected
  by this issue.'
