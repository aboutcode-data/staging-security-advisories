  - CVE-2021-23840
summary: Calls to EVP_CipherUpdate, EVP_EncryptUpdate and EVP_DecryptUpdate may overflow the
  output length argument in some cases where the input length is close to the maximum permissable
  length for an integer on the platform. In such cases the return value from the function call
  will be 1 (indicating success), but the output length value will be negative. This could cause
  applications to behave incorrectly or crash. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected
  by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions
  1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no
  longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade
  to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i).
  Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2x).
