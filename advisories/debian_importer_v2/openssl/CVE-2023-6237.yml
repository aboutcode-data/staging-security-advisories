summary: 'Issue summary: Checking excessively long invalid RSA public keys may take a long time.  Impact
  summary: Applications that use the function EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check RSA public keys
  may experience long delays. Where the key that is being checked has been obtained from an
  untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.  When function EVP_PKEY_public_check()
  is called on RSA public keys, a computation is done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is
  composite. For valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more large primes and this computation
  completes quickly. However, if n is an overly large prime, then this computation would take
  a long time.  An application that calls EVP_PKEY_public_check() and supplies an RSA key obtained
  from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.  The function
  EVP_PKEY_public_check() is not called from other OpenSSL functions however it is called from
  the OpenSSL pkey command line application. For that reason that application is also vulnerable
  if used with the ''-pubin'' and ''-check'' options on untrusted data.  The OpenSSL SSL/TLS
  implementation is not affected by this issue.  The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are
  affected by this issue.'
