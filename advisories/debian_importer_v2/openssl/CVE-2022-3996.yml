  - CVE-2022-3996
summary: 'If an X.509 certificate contains a malformed policy constraint and policy processing
  is enabled, then a write lock will be taken twice recursively.  On some operating systems
  (most widely: Windows) this results in a denial of service when the affected process hangs.  Policy
  processing being enabled on a publicly facing server is not considered to be a common setup.  Policy
  processing is enabled by passing the `-policy'' argument to the command line utilities or
  by calling the `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()'' function.  Update (31 March 2023): The
  description of the policy processing enablement was corrected based on CVE-2023-0466.'
