summary: 'Issue summary: An application trying to decrypt CMS messages encrypted using password
  based encryption can trigger an out-of-bounds read and write.  Impact summary: This out-of-bounds
  read may trigger a crash which leads to Denial of Service for an application. The out-of-bounds
  write can cause a memory corruption which can have various consequences including a Denial
  of Service or Execution of attacker-supplied code.  Although the consequences of a successful
  exploit of this vulnerability could be severe, the probability that the attacker would be
  able to perform it is low. Besides, password based (PWRI) encryption support in CMS messages
  is very rarely used. For that reason the issue was assessed as Moderate severity according
  to our Security Policy.  The FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected
  by this issue, as the CMS implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary.'
