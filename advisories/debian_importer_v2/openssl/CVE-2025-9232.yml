summary: 'Issue summary: An application using the OpenSSL HTTP client API functions may trigger
  an out-of-bounds read if the ''no_proxy'' environment variable is set and the host portion
  of the authority component of the HTTP URL is an IPv6 address.  Impact summary: An out-of-bounds
  read can trigger a crash which leads to Denial of Service for an application.  The OpenSSL
  HTTP client API functions can be used directly by applications but they are also used by the
  OCSP client functions and CMP (Certificate Management Protocol) client implementation in OpenSSL.
  However the URLs used by these implementations are unlikely to be controlled by an attacker.  In
  this vulnerable code the out of bounds read can only trigger a crash. Furthermore the vulnerability
  requires an attacker-controlled URL to be passed from an application to the OpenSSL function
  and the user has to have a ''no_proxy'' environment variable set. For the aforementioned reasons
  the issue was assessed as Low severity.  The vulnerable code was introduced in the following
  patch releases: 3.0.16, 3.1.8, 3.2.4, 3.3.3, 3.4.0 and 3.5.0.  The FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4,
  3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue, as the HTTP client implementation is
  outside the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary.'
