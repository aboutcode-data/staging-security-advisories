aliases:
  - CVE-2023-0464
summary: A security vulnerability has been identified in all supported versions  of OpenSSL
  related to the verification of X.509 certificate chains that include policy constraints.  Attackers
  may be able to exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious certificate chain that triggers
  exponential use of computational resources, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on
  affected systems.  Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing
  the `-policy' argument to the command line utilities or by calling the `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()'
  function.
