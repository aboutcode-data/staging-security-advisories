summary: 'Issue summary: Parsing CMS AuthEnvelopedData or EnvelopedData message with maliciously
  crafted AEAD parameters can trigger a stack buffer overflow.  Impact summary: A stack buffer
  overflow may lead to a crash, causing Denial of Service, or potentially remote code execution.  When
  parsing CMS (Auth)EnvelopedData structures that use AEAD ciphers such as AES-GCM, the IV (Initialization
  Vector) encoded in the ASN.1 parameters is copied into a fixed-size stack buffer without verifying
  that its length fits the destination. An attacker can supply a crafted CMS message with an
  oversized IV, causing a stack-based out-of-bounds write before any authentication or tag verification
  occurs.  Applications and services that parse untrusted CMS or PKCS#7 content using AEAD ciphers
  (e.g., S/MIME (Auth)EnvelopedData with AES-GCM) are vulnerable. Because the overflow occurs
  prior to authentication, no valid key material is required to trigger it. While exploitability
  to remote code execution depends on platform and toolchain mitigations, the stack-based write
  primitive represents a severe risk.  The FIPS modules in 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3 and 3.0 are not
  affected by this issue, as the CMS implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary.  OpenSSL
  3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.  OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are not
  affected by this issue.'
