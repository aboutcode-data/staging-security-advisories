summary: 'Issue summary: A type confusion vulnerability exists in the signature verification
  of signed PKCS#7 data where an ASN1_TYPE union member is accessed without first validating
  the type, causing an invalid or NULL pointer dereference when processing malformed PKCS#7
  data.  Impact summary: An application performing signature verification of PKCS#7 data or
  calling directly the PKCS7_digest_from_attributes() function can be caused to dereference
  an invalid or NULL pointer when reading, resulting in a Denial of Service.  The function PKCS7_digest_from_attributes()
  accesses the message digest attribute value without validating its type. When the type is
  not V_ASN1_OCTET_STRING, this results in accessing invalid memory through the ASN1_TYPE union,
  causing a crash.  Exploiting this vulnerability requires an attacker to provide a malformed
  signed PKCS#7 to an application that verifies it. The impact of the exploit is just a Denial
  of Service, the PKCS7 API is legacy and applications should be using the CMS API instead.
  For these reasons the issue was assessed as Low severity.  The FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3
  and 3.0 are not affected by this issue, as the PKCS#7 parsing implementation is outside the
  OpenSSL FIPS module boundary.  OpenSSL 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.0, 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are vulnerable
  to this issue.'
