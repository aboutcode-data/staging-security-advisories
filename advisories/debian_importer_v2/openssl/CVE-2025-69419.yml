summary: 'Issue summary: Calling PKCS12_get_friendlyname() function on a maliciously crafted
  PKCS#12 file with a BMPString (UTF-16BE) friendly name containing non-ASCII BMP code point
  can trigger a one byte write before the allocated buffer.  Impact summary: The out-of-bounds
  write can cause a memory corruption which can have various consequences including a Denial
  of Service.  The OPENSSL_uni2utf8() function performs a two-pass conversion of a PKCS#12 BMPString
  (UTF-16BE) to UTF-8. In the second pass, when emitting UTF-8 bytes, the helper function bmp_to_utf8()
  incorrectly forwards the remaining UTF-16 source byte count as the destination buffer capacity
  to UTF8_putc(). For BMP code points above U+07FF, UTF-8 requires three bytes, but the forwarded
  capacity can be just two bytes. UTF8_putc() then returns -1, and this negative value is added
  to the output length without validation, causing the length to become negative. The subsequent
  trailing NUL byte is then written at a negative offset, causing write outside of heap allocated
  buffer.  The vulnerability is reachable via the public PKCS12_get_friendlyname() API when
  parsing attacker-controlled PKCS#12 files. While PKCS12_parse() uses a different code path
  that avoids this issue, PKCS12_get_friendlyname() directly invokes the vulnerable function.
  Exploitation requires an attacker to provide a malicious PKCS#12 file to be parsed by the
  application and the attacker can just trigger a one zero byte write before the allocated buffer.
  For that reason the issue was assessed as Low severity according to our Security Policy.  The
  FIPS modules in 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue, as the PKCS#12
  implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary.  OpenSSL 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.0
  and 1.1.1 are vulnerable to this issue.  OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not affected by this issue.'
