summary: The function `OCSP_basic_verify` verifies the signer certificate on an OCSP response.
  In the case where the (non-default) flag OCSP_NOCHECKS is used then the response will be positive
  (meaning a successful verification) even in the case where the response signing certificate
  fails to verify. It is anticipated that most users of `OCSP_basic_verify` will not use the
  OCSP_NOCHECKS flag. In this case the `OCSP_basic_verify` function will return a negative value
  (indicating a fatal error) in the case of a certificate verification failure. The normal expected
  return value in this case would be 0. This issue also impacts the command line OpenSSL "ocsp"
  application. When verifying an ocsp response with the "-no_cert_checks" option the command
  line application will report that the verification is successful even though it has in fact
  failed. In this case the incorrect successful response will also be accompanied by error messages
  showing the failure and contradicting the apparently successful result. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3
  (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2).
