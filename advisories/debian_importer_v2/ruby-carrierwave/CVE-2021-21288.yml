summary: CarrierWave is an open-source RubyGem which provides a simple and flexible way to upload
  files from Ruby applications. In CarrierWave before versions 1.3.2 and 2.1.1 the download
  feature has an SSRF vulnerability, allowing attacks to provide DNS entries or IP addresses
  that are intended for internal use and gather information about the Intranet infrastructure
  of the platform. This is fixed in versions 1.3.2 and 2.1.1.
