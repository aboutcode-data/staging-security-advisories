summary: CarrierWave is a solution for file uploads for Rails, Sinatra and other Ruby web frameworks.
  CarrierWave has a Content-Type allowlist bypass vulnerability, possibly leading to XSS. The
  validation in `allowlisted_content_type?` determines Content-Type permissions by performing
  a partial match. If the `content_type` argument of `allowlisted_content_type?` is passed a
  value crafted by the attacker, Content-Types not included in the `content_type_allowlist`
  will be allowed. This issue has been patched in versions 2.2.5 and 3.0.5.
