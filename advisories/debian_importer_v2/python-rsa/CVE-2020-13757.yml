aliases:
  - CVE-2020-13757
summary: Python-RSA before 4.1 ignores leading '\0' bytes during decryption of ciphertext. This
  could conceivably have a security-relevant impact, e.g., by helping an attacker to infer that
  an application uses Python-RSA, or if the length of accepted ciphertext affects application
  behavior (such as by causing excessive memory allocation).
