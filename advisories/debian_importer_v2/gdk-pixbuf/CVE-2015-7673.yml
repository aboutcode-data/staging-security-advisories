  - CVE-2015-7673
summary: io-tga.c in gdk-pixbuf before 2.32.0 uses heap memory after its allocation failed,
  which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow and
  application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted Truevision TGA (TARGA)
  file.
