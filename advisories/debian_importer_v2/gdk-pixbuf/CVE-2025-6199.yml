aliases:
  - CVE-2025-6199
summary: A flaw was found in the GIF parser of GdkPixbuf’s LZW decoder. When an invalid symbol
  is encountered during decompression, the decoder sets the reported output size to the full
  buffer length rather than the actual number of written bytes. This logic error results in
  uninitialized sections of the buffer being included in the output, potentially leaking arbitrary
  memory contents in the processed image.
