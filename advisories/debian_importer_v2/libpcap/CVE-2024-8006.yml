  - CVE-2024-8006
summary: Remote packet capture support is disabled by default in libpcap.  When a user builds
  libpcap with remote packet capture support enabled, one of the functions that become available
  is pcap_findalldevs_ex().  One of the function arguments can be a filesystem path, which normally
  means a directory with input data files.  When the specified path cannot be used as a directory,
  the function receives NULL from opendir(), but does not check the return value and passes
  the NULL value to readdir(), which causes a NULL pointer derefence.
