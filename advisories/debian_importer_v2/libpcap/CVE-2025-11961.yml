  - CVE-2025-11961
summary: pcap_ether_aton() is an auxiliary function in libpcap, it takes a string argument and
  returns a fixed-size allocated buffer.  The string argument must be a well-formed MAC-48 address
  in one of the supported formats, but this requirement has been poorly documented.  If an application
  calls the function with an argument that deviates from the expected format, the function can
  read data beyond the end of the provided string and write data beyond the end of the allocated
  buffer.
