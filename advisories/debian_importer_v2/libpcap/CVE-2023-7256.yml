aliases:
  - CVE-2023-7256
summary: In affected libpcap versions during the setup of a remote packet capture the internal
  function sock_initaddress() calls getaddrinfo() and possibly freeaddrinfo(), but does not
  clearly indicate to the caller function whether freeaddrinfo() still remains to be called
  after the function returns.  This makes it possible in some scenarios that both the function
  and its caller call freeaddrinfo() for the same allocated memory block.  A similar problem
  was reported in Apple libpcap, to which Apple assigned CVE-2023-40400.
