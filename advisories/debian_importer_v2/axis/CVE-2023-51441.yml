summary: '** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache
  Axis allowed users with access to the admin service to perform possible SSRF This issue affects
  Apache Axis: through 1.3.  As Axis 1 has been EOL we recommend you migrate to a different
  SOAP engine, such as Apache Axis 2/Java. Alternatively you could use a build of Axis with
  the patch from  https://github.com/apache/axis-axis1-java/commit/685c309febc64aa393b2d64a05f90e7eb9f73e06  applied.
  The Apache Axis project does not expect to create an Axis 1.x release  fixing this problem,
  though contributors that would like to work towards  this are welcome.'
