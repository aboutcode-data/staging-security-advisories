  - CVE-2020-7746
summary: This affects the package chart.js before 2.9.4. The options parameter is not properly
  sanitized when it is processed. When the options are processed, the existing options (or the
  defaults options) are deeply merged with provided options. However, during this operation,
  the keys of the object being set are not checked, leading to a prototype pollution.
