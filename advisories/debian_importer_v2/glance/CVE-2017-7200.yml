aliases:
  - CVE-2017-7200
summary: An SSRF issue was discovered in OpenStack Glance before Newton. The 'copy_from' feature
  in the Image Service API v1 allowed an attacker to perform masked network port scans. With
  v1, it is possible to create images with a URL such as 'http://localhost:22'. This could then
  allow an attacker to enumerate internal network details while appearing masked, since the
  scan would appear to originate from the Glance Image service.
