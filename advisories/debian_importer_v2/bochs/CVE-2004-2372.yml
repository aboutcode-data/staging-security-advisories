  - CVE-2004-2372
summary: 'Buffer overflow in Bochs before 2.1.1, if installed setuid, allows local users to
  execute arbitrary code via a long HOME environment variable, which is used if the .bochsrc,
  bochsrc, and bochsrc.txt cannot be found in a known path.  NOTE: some external documents recommend
  that Bochs be installed setuid root, so this should be treated as a vulnerability.'
