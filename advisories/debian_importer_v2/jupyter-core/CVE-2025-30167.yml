  - CVE-2025-30167
summary: Jupyter Core is a package for the core common functionality of Jupyter projects. When
  using Jupyter Core prior to version 5.8.0 on Windows, the shared `%PROGRAMDATA%` directory
  is searched for configuration files (`SYSTEM_CONFIG_PATH` and `SYSTEM_JUPYTER_PATH`), which
  may allow users to create configuration files affecting other users. Only shared Windows systems
  with multiple users and unprotected `%PROGRAMDATA%` are affected. Users should upgrade to
  Jupyter Core version 5.8.0 or later to receive a patch. Some other mitigations are available.
  As administrator, modify the permissions on the `%PROGRAMDATA%` directory so it is not writable
  by unauthorized users; or as administrator, create the `%PROGRAMDATA%\jupyter` directory with
  appropriately restrictive permissions; or as user or administrator, set the `%PROGRAMDATA%`
  environment variable to a directory with appropriately restrictive permissions (e.g. controlled
  by administrators _or_ the current user).
