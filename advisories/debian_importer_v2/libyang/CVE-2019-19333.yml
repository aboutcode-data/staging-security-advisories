summary: In all versions of libyang before 1.0-r5, a stack-based buffer overflow was discovered
  in the way libyang parses YANG files with a leaf of type "bits". An application that uses
  libyang to parse untrusted YANG files may be vulnerable to this flaw, which would allow an
  attacker to cause a denial of service or possibly gain code execution.
