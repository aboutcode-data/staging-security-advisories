  - CVE-2025-58782
summary: 'Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability in Apache Jackrabbit Core and Apache
  Jackrabbit JCR Commons.  This issue affects Apache Jackrabbit Core: from 1.0.0 through 2.22.1;
  Apache Jackrabbit JCR Commons: from 1.0.0 through 2.22.1.  Deployments that accept JNDI URIs
  for JCR lookup from untrusted users allows them to inject malicious JNDI references, potentially
  leading to arbitrary code execution through deserialization of untrusted data. Users are recommended
  to upgrade to version 2.22.2. JCR lookup through JNDI has been disabled by default in 2.22.2.
  Users of this feature need to enable it explicitly and are adviced to review their use of
  JNDI URI for JCR lookup.'
