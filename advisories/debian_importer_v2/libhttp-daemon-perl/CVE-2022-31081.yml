  - CVE-2022-31081
summary: HTTP::Daemon is a simple http server class written in perl. Versions prior to 6.15
  are subject to a vulnerability which could potentially be exploited to gain privileged access
  to APIs or poison intermediate caches. It is uncertain how large the risks are, most Perl
  based applications are served on top of Nginx or Apache, not on the `HTTP::Daemon`. This library
  is commonly used for local development and tests. Users are advised to update to resolve this
  issue. Users unable to upgrade may add additional request handling logic as a mitigation.
  After calling `my $rqst = $conn->get_request()` one could inspect the returned `HTTP::Request`
  object. Querying the 'Content-Length' (`my $cl = $rqst->header('Content-Length')`) will show
  any abnormalities that should be dealt with by a `400` response. Expected strings of 'Content-Length'
  SHOULD consist of either a single non-negative integer, or, a comma separated repetition of
  that number. (that is `42` or `42, 42, 42`). Anything else MUST be rejected.
