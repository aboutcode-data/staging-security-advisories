aliases:
  - CVE-2020-15133
summary: In faye-websocket before version 0.11.0, there is a lack of certification validation
  in TLS handshakes. The `Faye::WebSocket::Client` class uses the `EM::Connection#start_tls`
  method in EventMachine to implement the TLS handshake whenever a `wss:` URL is used for the
  connection. This method does not implement certificate verification by default, meaning that
  it does not check that the server presents a valid and trusted TLS certificate for the expected
  hostname. That means that any `wss:` connection made using this library is vulnerable to a
  man-in-the-middle attack, since it does not confirm the identity of the server it is connected
  to. For further background information on this issue, please see the referenced GitHub Advisory.
  Upgrading `faye-websocket` to v0.11.0 is recommended.
