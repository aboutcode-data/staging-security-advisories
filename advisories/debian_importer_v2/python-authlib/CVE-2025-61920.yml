  - CVE-2025-61920
summary: Authlib is a Python library which builds OAuth and OpenID Connect servers. Prior to
  version 1.6.5, Authlib’s JOSE implementation accepts unbounded JWS/JWT header and signature
  segments. A remote attacker can craft a token whose base64url‑encoded header or signature
  spans hundreds of megabytes. During verification, Authlib decodes and parses the full input
  before it is rejected, driving CPU and memory consumption to hostile levels and enabling denial
  of service. Version 1.6.5 patches the issue. Some temporary workarounds are available. Enforce
  input size limits before handing tokens to Authlib and/or use application-level throttling
  to reduce amplification risk.
