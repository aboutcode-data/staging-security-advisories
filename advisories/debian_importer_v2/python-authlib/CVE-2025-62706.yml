  - CVE-2025-62706
summary: Authlib is a Python library which builds OAuth and OpenID Connect servers. Prior to
  version 1.6.5, Authlib’s JWE zip=DEF path performs unbounded DEFLATE decompression. A very
  small ciphertext can expand into tens or hundreds of megabytes on decrypt, allowing an attacker
  who can supply decryptable tokens to exhaust memory and CPU and cause denial of service. This
  issue has been patched in version 1.6.5. Workarounds for this issue involve rejecting or stripping
  zip=DEF for inbound JWEs at the application boundary, forking and add a bounded decompression
  guard via decompressobj().decompress(data, MAX_SIZE)) and returning an error when output exceeds
  a safe limit, or enforcing strict maximum token sizes and fail fast on oversized inputs; combine
  with rate limiting.
