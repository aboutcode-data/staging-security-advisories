  - CVE-2007-6061
summary: 'Audacity 1.3.2 creates a temporary directory with a predictable name without checking
  for previous existence of that directory, which allows local users to cause a denial of service
  (recording deadlock) by creating the directory before Audacity is run.  NOTE: this issue can
  be leveraged to delete arbitrary files or directories via a symlink attack.'
