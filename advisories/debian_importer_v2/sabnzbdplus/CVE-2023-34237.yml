  - CVE-2023-34237
summary: SABnzbd is an open source automated Usenet download tool. A design flaw was discovered
  in SABnzbd that could allow remote code execution. Manipulating the Parameters setting in
  the Notification Script functionality allows code execution with the privileges of the SABnzbd
  process. Exploiting the vulnerabilities requires access to the web interface. Remote exploitation
  is possible if users[exposed their setup to the internet or other untrusted networks without
  setting a username/password. By default SABnzbd is only accessible from `localhost`, with
  no authentication required for the web interface. This issue has been patched in commits `e3a722`
  and `422b4f` which have been included in the 4.0.2 release. Users are advised to upgrade.
  Users unable to upgrade should ensure that a username and password have been set if their
  instance is web accessible.
