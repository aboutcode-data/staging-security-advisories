  - CVE-2021-29488
summary: SABnzbd is an open source binary newsreader. A vulnerability was discovered in SABnzbd
  that could trick the `filesystem.renamer()` function into writing downloaded files outside
  the configured Download Folder via malicious PAR2 files. A patch was released as part of SABnzbd
  3.2.1RC1. As a workaround, limit downloads to NZBs without PAR2 files, deny write permissions
  to the SABnzbd process outside areas it must access to perform its job, or update to a fixed
  version.
