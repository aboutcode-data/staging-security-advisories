summary: On Windows a directory returned by tempfile.mkdtemp() would not always have permissions
  set to restrict reading and writing to the temporary directory by other users, instead usually
  inheriting the correct permissions from the default location. Alternate configurations or
  users without a profile directory may not have the intended permissions.  If you’re not using
  Windows or haven’t changed the temporary directory location then you aren’t affected by this
  vulnerability. On other platforms the returned directory is consistently readable and writable
  only by the current user.  This issue was caused by Python not supporting Unix permissions
  on Windows. The fix adds support for Unix “700” for the mkdir function on Windows which is
  used by mkdtemp() to ensure the newly created directory has the proper permissions.
