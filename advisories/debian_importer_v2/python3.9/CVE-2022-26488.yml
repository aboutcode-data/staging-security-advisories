  - CVE-2022-26488
summary: In Python before 3.10.3 on Windows, local users can gain privileges because the search
  path is inadequately secured. The installer may allow a local attacker to add user-writable
  directories to the system search path. To exploit, an administrator must have installed Python
  for all users and enabled PATH entries. A non-administrative user can trigger a repair that
  incorrectly adds user-writable paths into PATH, enabling search-path hijacking of other users
  and system services. This affects Python (CPython) through 3.7.12, 3.8.x through 3.8.12, 3.9.x
  through 3.9.10, and 3.10.x through 3.10.2.
