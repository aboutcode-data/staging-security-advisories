  - CVE-2025-4517
summary: Allows arbitrary filesystem writes outside the extraction directory during extraction
  with filter="data".   You are affected by this vulnerability if using the tarfile module to
  extract untrusted tar archives using TarFile.extractall() or TarFile.extract() using the filter= parameter
  with a value of "data" or "tar". See the tarfile  extraction filters documentation https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile-extraction-filter
   for more information.  Note that for Python 3.14 or later the default value of filter= changed
  from "no filtering" to `"data", so if you are relying on this new default behavior then your
  usage is also affected.  Note that none of these vulnerabilities significantly affect the
  installation of source distributions which are tar archives as source distributions already
  allow arbitrary code execution during the build process. However when evaluating source distributions
  it's important to avoid installing source distributions with suspicious links.
