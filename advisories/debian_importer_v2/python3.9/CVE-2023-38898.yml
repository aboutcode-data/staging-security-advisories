  - CVE-2023-38898
summary: 'An issue in Python cpython v.3.7 allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information
  via the _asyncio._swap_current_task component. NOTE: this is disputed by the vendor because
  (1) neither 3.7 nor any other release is affected (it is a bug in some 3.12 pre-releases);
  (2) there are no common scenarios in which an adversary can call _asyncio._swap_current_task
  but does not already have the ability to call arbitrary functions; and (3) there are no common
  scenarios in which sensitive information, which is not already accessible to an adversary,
  becomes accessible through this bug.'
