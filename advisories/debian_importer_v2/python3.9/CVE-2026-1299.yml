  - CVE-2026-1299
summary: The  email module, specifically the "BytesGenerator" class, didn’t properly quote newlines
  for email headers when  serializing an email message allowing for header injection when an
  email  is serialized. This is only applicable if using "LiteralHeader" writing headers that
  don't respect email folding rules, the new behavior will reject the incorrectly folded headers
  in "BytesGenerator".
