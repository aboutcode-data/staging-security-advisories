  - CVE-2022-45061
summary: An issue was discovered in Python before 3.11.1. An unnecessary quadratic algorithm
  exists in one path when processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a
  crafted, unreasonably long name being presented to the decoder could lead to a CPU denial
  of service. Hostnames are often supplied by remote servers that could be controlled by a malicious
  actor; in such a scenario, they could trigger excessive CPU consumption on the client attempting
  to make use of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname. For example, the attack payload could
  be placed in the Location header of an HTTP response with status code 302. A fix is planned
  in 3.11.1, 3.10.9, 3.9.16, 3.8.16, and 3.7.16.
