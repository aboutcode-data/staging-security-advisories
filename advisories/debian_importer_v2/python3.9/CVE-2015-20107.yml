  - CVE-2015-20107
summary: In Python (aka CPython) up to 3.10.8, the mailcap module does not add escape characters
  into commands discovered in the system mailcap file. This may allow attackers to inject shell
  commands into applications that call mailcap.findmatch with untrusted input (if they lack
  validation of user-provided filenames or arguments). The fix is also back-ported to 3.7, 3.8,
  3.9
