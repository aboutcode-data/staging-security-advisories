  - CVE-2016-6581
summary: A HTTP/2 implementation built using any version of the Python HPACK library between
  v1.0.0 and v2.2.0 could be targeted for a denial of service attack, specifically a so-called
  "HPACK Bomb" attack. This attack occurs when an attacker inserts a header field that is exactly
  the size of the HPACK dynamic header table into the dynamic header table. The attacker can
  then send a header block that is simply repeated requests to expand that field in the dynamic
  table. This can lead to a gigantic compression ratio of 4,096 or better, meaning that 16kB
  of data can decompress to 64MB of data on the target machine.
