aliases:
  - CVE-2013-6393
summary: The yaml_parser_scan_tag_uri function in scanner.c in LibYAML before 0.1.5 performs
  an incorrect cast, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application
  crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted tags in a YAML document, which triggers
  a heap-based buffer overflow.
