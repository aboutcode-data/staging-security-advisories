  - CVE-2024-3094
summary: "Malicious code was discovered in the upstream tarballs of xz, starting with version\
  \ 5.6.0. \r Through a series of complex obfuscations, the liblzma build process extracts a\
  \ prebuilt object file from a disguised test file existing in the source code, which is then\
  \ used to modify specific functions in the liblzma code. This results in a modified liblzma\
  \ library that can be used by any software linked against this library, intercepting and modifying\
  \ the data interaction with this library."
