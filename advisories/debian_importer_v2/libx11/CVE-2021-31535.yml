  - CVE-2021-31535
summary: LookupCol.c in X.Org X through X11R7.7 and libX11 before 1.7.1 might allow remote attackers
  to execute arbitrary code. The libX11 XLookupColor request (intended for server-side color
  lookup) contains a flaw allowing a client to send color-name requests with a name longer than
  the maximum size allowed by the protocol (and also longer than the maximum packet size for
  normal-sized packets). The user-controlled data exceeding the maximum size is then interpreted
  by the server as additional X protocol requests and executed, e.g., to disable X server authorization
  completely. For example, if the victim encounters malicious terminal control sequences for
  color codes, then the attacker may be able to take full control of the running graphical session.
