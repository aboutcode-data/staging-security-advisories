aliases:
  - CVE-2019-7283
summary: An issue was discovered in rcp in NetKit through 0.17. For an rcp operation, the server
  chooses which files/directories are sent to the client. However, the rcp client only performs
  cursory validation of the object name returned. A malicious rsh server (or Man-in-The-Middle
  attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in a directory on the rcp client machine. This is
  similar to CVE-2019-6111.
