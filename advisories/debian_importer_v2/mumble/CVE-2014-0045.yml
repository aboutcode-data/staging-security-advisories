  - CVE-2014-0045
summary: The needSamples method in AudioOutputSpeech.cpp in the client in Mumble 1.2.4 and the
  1.2.3 pre-release snapshots, Mumble for iOS 1.1 through 1.2.2, and MumbleKit before commit
  fd190328a9b24d37382b269a5674b0c0c7a7e36d does not check the return value of the opus_decode_float
  function, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly
  execute arbitrary code via a crafted Opus voice packet, which triggers an error in opus_decode_float,
  a conversion of a negative integer to an unsigned integer, and a heap-based buffer over-read
  and over-write.
