  - CVE-2025-46336
summary: Rack::Session is a session management implementation for Rack. In versions starting
  from 2.0.0 to before 2.1.1, when using the Rack::Session::Pool middleware, and provided the
  attacker can acquire a session cookie (already a major issue), the session may be restored
  if the attacker can trigger a long running request (within that same session) adjacent to
  the user logging out, in order to retain illicit access even after a user has attempted to
  logout. This issue has been patched in version 2.1.1.
