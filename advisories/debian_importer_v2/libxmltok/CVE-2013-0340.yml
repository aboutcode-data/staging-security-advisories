aliases:
  - CVE-2013-0340
summary: 'expat before version 2.4.0 does not properly handle entities expansion unless an application
  developer uses the XML_SetEntityDeclHandler function, which allows remote attackers to cause
  a denial of service (resource consumption), send HTTP requests to intranet servers, or read
  arbitrary files via a crafted XML document, aka an XML External Entity (XXE) issue.  NOTE:
  it could be argued that because expat already provides the ability to disable external entity
  expansion, the responsibility for resolving this issue lies with application developers; according
  to this argument, this entry should be REJECTed, and each affected application would need
  its own CVE.'
