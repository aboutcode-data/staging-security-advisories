summary: The XML parser (xmlparse.c) in expat before 2.1.0 computes hash values without restricting
  the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers
  to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via an XML file with many identifiers with
  the same value.
