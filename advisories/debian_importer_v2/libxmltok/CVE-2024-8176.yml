  - CVE-2024-8176
summary: A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the libexpat library due to the way it handles
  recursive entity expansion in XML documents. When parsing an XML document with deeply nested
  entity references, libexpat can be forced to recurse indefinitely, exhausting the stack space
  and causing a crash. This issue could lead to denial of service (DoS) or, in some cases, exploitable
  memory corruption, depending on the environment and library usage.
