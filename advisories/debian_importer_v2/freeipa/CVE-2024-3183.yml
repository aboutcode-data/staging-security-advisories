summary: "A vulnerability was found in FreeIPA in a way when a Kerberos TGS-REQ is encrypted\
  \ using the client’s session key. This key is different for each new session, which protects\
  \ it from brute force attacks. However, the ticket it contains is encrypted using the target\
  \ principal key directly. For user principals, this key is a hash of a public per-principal\
  \ randomly-generated salt and the user’s password.\r \r If a principal is compromised it means\
  \ the attacker would be able to retrieve tickets encrypted to any principal, all of them being\
  \ encrypted by their own key directly. By taking these tickets and salts offline, the attacker\
  \ could run brute force attacks to find character strings able to decrypt tickets when combined\
  \ to a principal salt (i.e. find the principal’s password)."
