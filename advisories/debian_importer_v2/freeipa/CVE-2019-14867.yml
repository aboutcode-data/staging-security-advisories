  - CVE-2019-14867
summary: A flaw was found in IPA, all 4.6.x versions before 4.6.7, all 4.7.x versions before
  4.7.4 and all 4.8.x versions before 4.8.3, in the way the internal function ber_scanf() was
  used in some components of the IPA server, which parsed kerberos key data. An unauthenticated
  attacker who could trigger parsing of the krb principal key could cause the IPA server to
  crash or in some conditions, cause arbitrary code to be executed on the server hosting the
  IPA server.
