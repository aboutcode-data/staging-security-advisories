  - CVE-2017-12169
summary: 'It was found that FreeIPA 4.2.0 and later could disclose password hashes to users
  having the ''System: Read Stage Users'' permission. A remote, authenticated attacker could
  potentially use this flaw to disclose the password hashes belonging to Stage Users. This security
  issue does not result in disclosure of password hashes belonging to active standard users.
  NOTE: some developers feel that this report is a suggestion for a design change to Stage User
  activation, not a statement of a vulnerability.'
