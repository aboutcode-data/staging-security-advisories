  - CVE-2025-4404
summary: A privilege escalation from host to domain vulnerability was found in the FreeIPA project.
  The FreeIPA package fails to validate the uniqueness of the `krbCanonicalName` for the admin
  account by default, allowing users to create services with the same canonical name as the
  REALM admin. When a successful attack happens, the user can retrieve a Kerberos ticket in
  the name of this service, containing the admin@REALM credential. This flaw allows an attacker
  to perform administrative tasks over the REALM, leading to access to sensitive data and sensitive
  data exfiltration.
