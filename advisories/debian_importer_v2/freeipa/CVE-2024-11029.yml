  - CVE-2024-11029
summary: A flaw was found in the FreeIPA API audit, where it sends the whole FreeIPA command
  line to journalctl. As a consequence, during the FreeIPA installation process, it inadvertently
  leaks the administrative user credentials, including the administrator password, to the journal
  database. In the worst-case scenario, where the journal log is centralized, users with access
  to it can have improper access to the FreeIPA administrator credentials.
