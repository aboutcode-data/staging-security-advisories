aliases:
  - CVE-2023-5455
summary: A Cross-site request forgery vulnerability exists in ipa/session/login_password in
  all supported versions of IPA. This flaw allows an attacker to trick the user into submitting
  a request that could perform actions as the user, resulting in a loss of confidentiality and
  system integrity. During community penetration testing it was found that for certain HTTP
  end-points FreeIPA does not ensure CSRF protection. Due to implementation details one cannot
  use this flaw for reflection of a cookie representing already logged-in user. An attacker
  would always have to go through a new authentication attempt.
