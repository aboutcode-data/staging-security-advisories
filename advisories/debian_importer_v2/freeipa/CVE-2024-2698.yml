  - CVE-2024-2698
summary: "A vulnerability was found in FreeIPA in how the initial implementation of MS-SFU by\
  \ MIT Kerberos was missing a condition for granting the \"forwardable\" flag on S4U2Self tickets.\
  \ Fixing this mistake required adding a special case for the check_allowed_to_delegate() function:\
  \ If the target service argument is NULL, then it means the KDC is probing for general constrained\
  \ delegation rules and not checking a specific S4U2Proxy request.\r \r In FreeIPA 4.11.0,\
  \ the behavior of ipadb_match_acl() was modified to match the changes from upstream MIT Kerberos\
  \ 1.20. However, a mistake resulting in this mechanism applies in cases where the target service\
  \ argument is set AND where it is unset. This results in S4U2Proxy requests being accepted\
  \ regardless of whether or not there is a matching service delegation rule."
