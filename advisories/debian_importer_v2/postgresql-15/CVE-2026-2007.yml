summary: Heap buffer overflow in PostgreSQL pg_trgm allows a database user to achieve unknown
  impacts via a crafted input string.  The attacker has limited control over the byte patterns
  to be written, but we have not ruled out the viability of attacks that lead to privilege escalation.  PostgreSQL
  18.1 and 18.0 are affected.
