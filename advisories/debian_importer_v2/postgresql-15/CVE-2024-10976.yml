  - CVE-2024-10976
summary: Incomplete tracking in PostgreSQL of tables with row security allows a reused query
  to view or change different rows from those intended.  CVE-2023-2455 and CVE-2016-2193 fixed
  most interaction between row security and user ID changes.  They missed cases where a subquery,
  WITH query, security invoker view, or SQL-language function references a table with a row-level
  security policy.  This has the same consequences as the two earlier CVEs.  That is to say,
  it leads to potentially incorrect policies being applied in cases where role-specific policies
  are used and a given query is planned under one role and then executed under other roles.  This
  scenario can happen under security definer functions or when a common user and query is planned
  initially and then re-used across multiple SET ROLEs.  Applying an incorrect policy may permit
  a user to complete otherwise-forbidden reads and modifications.  This affects only databases
  that have used CREATE POLICY to define a row security policy.  An attacker must tailor an
  attack to a particular application's pattern of query plan reuse, user ID changes, and role-specific
  row security policies.  Versions before PostgreSQL 17.1, 16.5, 15.9, 14.14, 13.17, and 12.21
  are affected.
