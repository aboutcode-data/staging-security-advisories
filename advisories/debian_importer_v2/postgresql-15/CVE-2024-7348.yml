  - CVE-2024-7348
summary: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in pg_dump in PostgreSQL allows an
  object creator to execute arbitrary SQL functions as the user running pg_dump, which is often
  a superuser. The attack involves replacing another relation type with a view or foreign table.
  The attack requires waiting for pg_dump to start, but winning the race condition is trivial
  if the attacker retains an open transaction. Versions before PostgreSQL 16.4, 15.8, 14.13,
  13.16, and 12.20 are affected.
