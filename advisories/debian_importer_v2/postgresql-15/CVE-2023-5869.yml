aliases:
  - CVE-2023-5869
summary: A flaw was found in PostgreSQL that allows authenticated database users to execute
  arbitrary code through missing overflow checks during SQL array value modification. This issue
  exists due to an integer overflow during array modification where a remote user can trigger
  the overflow by providing specially crafted data. This enables the execution of arbitrary
  code on the target system, allowing users to write arbitrary bytes to memory and extensively
  read the server's memory.
