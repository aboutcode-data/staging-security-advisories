summary: Missing authorization in PostgreSQL built-in views pg_stats_ext and pg_stats_ext_exprs
  allows an unprivileged database user to read most common values and other statistics from
  CREATE STATISTICS commands of other users. The most common values may reveal column values
  the eavesdropper could not otherwise read or results of functions they cannot execute. Installing
  an unaffected version only fixes fresh PostgreSQL installations, namely those that are created
  with the initdb utility after installing that version. Current PostgreSQL installations will
  remain vulnerable until they follow the instructions in the release notes. Within major versions
  14-16, minor versions before PostgreSQL 16.3, 15.7, and 14.12 are affected. Versions before
  PostgreSQL 14 are unaffected.
