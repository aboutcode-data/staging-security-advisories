  - CVE-2017-10804
summary: In Odoo 8.0, Odoo Community Edition 9.0 and 10.0, and Odoo Enterprise Edition 9.0 and
  10.0, remote attackers can bypass authentication under certain circumstances because parameters
  containing 0x00 characters are truncated before reaching the database layer. This occurs because
  Psycopg 2.x before 2.6.3 is used.
