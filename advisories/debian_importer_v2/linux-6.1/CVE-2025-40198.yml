summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: avoid potential
  buffer over-read in parse_apply_sb_mount_options()  Unlike other strings in the ext4 superblock,
  we rely on tune2fs to make sure s_mount_opts is NUL terminated.  Harden parse_apply_sb_mount_options()
  by treating s_mount_opts as a potential __nonstring.'
