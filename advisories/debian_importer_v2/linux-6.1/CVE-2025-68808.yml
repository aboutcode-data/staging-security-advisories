  - CVE-2025-68808
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: vidtv:
  initialize local pointers upon transfer of memory ownership  vidtv_channel_si_init() creates
  a temporary list (program, service, event) and ownership of the memory itself is transferred
  to the PAT/SDT/EIT tables through vidtv_psi_pat_program_assign(), vidtv_psi_sdt_service_assign(),
  vidtv_psi_eit_event_assign().  The problem here is that the local pointer where the memory
  ownership transfer was completed is not initialized to NULL. This causes the vidtv_psi_pmt_create_sec_for_each_pat_entry()
  function to fail, and in the flow that jumps to free_eit, the memory that was freed by vidtv_psi_*_table_destroy()
  can be accessed again by vidtv_psi_*_event_destroy() due to the uninitialized local pointer,
  so it is freed once again.  Therefore, to prevent use-after-free and double-free vulnerability,
  local pointers must be initialized to NULL when transferring memory ownership.'
