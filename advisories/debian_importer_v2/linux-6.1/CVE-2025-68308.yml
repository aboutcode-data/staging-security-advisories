summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: kvaser_usb:
  leaf: Fix potential infinite loop in command parsers  The `kvaser_usb_leaf_wait_cmd()` and
  `kvaser_usb_leaf_read_bulk_callback` functions contain logic to zero-length commands. These
  commands are used to align data to the USB endpoint''s wMaxPacketSize boundary.  The driver
  attempts to skip these placeholders by aligning the buffer position `pos` to the next packet
  boundary using `round_up()` function.  However, if zero-length command is found exactly on
  a packet boundary (i.e., `pos` is a multiple of wMaxPacketSize, including 0), `round_up` function
  will return the unchanged value of `pos`. This prevents `pos` to be increased, causing an
  infinite loop in the parsing logic.  This patch fixes this in the function by using `pos +
  1` instead. This ensures that even if `pos` is on a boundary, the calculation is based on
  `pos + 1`, forcing `round_up()` to always return the next aligned boundary.'
