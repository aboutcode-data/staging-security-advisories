summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iio: accel: fxls8962af:
  Fix use after free in fxls8962af_fifo_flush  fxls8962af_fifo_flush() uses indio_dev->active_scan_mask
  (with iio_for_each_active_channel()) without making sure the indio_dev stays in buffer mode.
  There is a race if indio_dev exits buffer mode in the middle of the interrupt that flushes
  the fifo. Fix this by calling synchronize_irq() to ensure that no interrupt is currently running
  when disabling buffer mode.  Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address
