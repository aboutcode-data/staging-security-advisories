summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/cxgb4: Added
  NULL check for lookup_atid  The lookup_atid() function can return NULL if the ATID is invalid
  or does not exist in the identifier table, which could lead to dereferencing a null pointer
  without a check in the `act_establish()` and `act_open_rpl()` functions. Add a NULL check
  to prevent null pointer dereferencing.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org)
  with SVACE.'
