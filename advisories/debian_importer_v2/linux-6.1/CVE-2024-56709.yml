  - CVE-2024-56709
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring: check
  if iowq is killed before queuing  task work can be executed after the task has gone through
  io_uring termination, whether it''s the final task_work run or the fallback path. In this
  case, task work will find ->io_wq being already killed and null''ed, which is a problem if
  it then tries to forward the request to io_queue_iowq(). Make io_queue_iowq() fail requests
  in this case.  Note that it also checks PF_KTHREAD, because the user can first close a DEFER_TASKRUN
  ring and shortly after kill the task, in which case ->iowq check would race.'
