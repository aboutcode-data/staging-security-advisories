summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  posix-cpu-timers:
  fix race between handle_posix_cpu_timers() and posix_cpu_timer_del()  If an exiting non-autoreaping
  task has already passed exit_notify() and calls handle_posix_cpu_timers() from IRQ, it can
  be reaped by its parent or debugger right after unlock_task_sighand().  If a concurrent posix_cpu_timer_del()
  runs at that moment, it won''t be able to detect timer->it.cpu.firing != 0: cpu_timer_task_rcu()
  and/or lock_task_sighand() will fail.  Add the tsk->exit_state check into run_posix_cpu_timers()
  to fix this.  This fix is not needed if CONFIG_POSIX_CPU_TIMERS_TASK_WORK=y, because exit_task_work()
  is called before exit_notify(). But the check still makes sense, task_work_add(&tsk->posix_cputimers_work.work)
  will fail anyway in this case.'
