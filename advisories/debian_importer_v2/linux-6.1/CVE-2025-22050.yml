  - CVE-2025-22050
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usbnet:fix NPE
  during rx_complete  Missing usbnet_going_away Check in Critical Path. The usb_submit_urb function
  lacks a usbnet_going_away validation, whereas __usbnet_queue_skb includes this check.  This
  inconsistency creates a race condition where: A URB request may succeed, but the corresponding
  SKB data fails to be queued.  Subsequent processes: (e.g., rx_complete → defer_bh → __skb_unlink(skb,
  list)) attempt to access skb->next, triggering a NULL pointer dereference (Kernel Panic).'
