summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: dlink: handle
  copy_thresh allocation failure  The driver did not handle failure of `netdev_alloc_skb_ip_align()`.
  If the allocation failed, dereferencing `skb->protocol` could lead to a NULL pointer dereference.  This
  patch tries to allocate `skb`. If the allocation fails, it falls back to the normal path.  Tested-on:
  D-Link DGE-550T Rev-A3'
