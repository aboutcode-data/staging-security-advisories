  - CVE-2025-68191
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  udp_tunnel: use
  netdev_warn() instead of netdev_WARN()  netdev_WARN() uses WARN/WARN_ON to print a backtrace
  along with file and line information. In this case, udp_tunnel_nic_register() returning an
  error is just a failed operation, not a kernel bug.  udp_tunnel_nic_register() can fail due
  to a memory allocation failure (kzalloc() or udp_tunnel_nic_alloc()). This is a normal runtime
  error and not a kernel bug.  Replace netdev_WARN() with netdev_warn() accordingly.'
