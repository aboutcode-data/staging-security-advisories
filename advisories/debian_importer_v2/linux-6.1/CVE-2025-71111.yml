summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  hwmon: (w83791d)
  Convert macros to functions to avoid TOCTOU  The macro FAN_FROM_REG evaluates its arguments
  multiple times. When used in lockless contexts involving shared driver data, this leads to
  Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race conditions, potentially causing divide-by-zero
  errors.  Convert the macro to a static function. This guarantees that arguments are evaluated
  only once (pass-by-value), preventing the race conditions.  Additionally, in store_fan_div,
  move the calculation of the minimum limit inside the update lock. This ensures that the read-modify-write
  sequence operates on consistent data.  Adhere to the principle of minimal changes by only
  converting macros that evaluate arguments multiple times and are used in lockless contexts.'
