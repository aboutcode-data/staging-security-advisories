summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  futex: Don''t
  leak robust_list pointer on exec race  sys_get_robust_list() and compat_get_robust_list()
  use ptrace_may_access() to check if the calling task is allowed to access another task''s
  robust_list pointer. This check is racy against a concurrent exec() in the target process.  During
  exec(), a task may transition from a non-privileged binary to a privileged one (e.g., setuid
  binary) and its credentials/memory mappings may change. If get_robust_list() performs ptrace_may_access()
  before this transition, it may erroneously allow access to sensitive information after the
  target becomes privileged.  A racy access allows an attacker to exploit a window during which
  ptrace_may_access() passes before a target process transitions to a privileged state via exec().  For
  example, consider a non-privileged task T that is about to execute a setuid-root binary. An
  attacker task A calls get_robust_list(T) while T is still unprivileged. Since ptrace_may_access()
  checks permissions based on current credentials, it succeeds. However, if T begins exec immediately
  afterwards, it becomes privileged and may change its memory mappings. Because get_robust_list()
  proceeds to access T->robust_list without synchronizing with exec() it may read user-space
  pointers from a now-privileged process.  This violates the intended post-exec access restrictions
  and could expose sensitive memory addresses or be used as a primitive in a larger exploit
  chain. Consequently, the race can lead to unauthorized disclosure of information across privilege
  boundaries and poses a potential security risk.  Take a read lock on signal->exec_update_lock
  prior to invoking ptrace_may_access() and accessing the robust_list/compat_robust_list. This
  ensures that the target task''s exec state remains stable during the check, allowing for consistent
  and synchronized validation of credentials.'
