summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powerpc/eeh:
  Make EEH driver device hotplug safe  Multiple race conditions existed between the PCIe hotplug
  driver and the EEH driver, leading to a variety of kernel oopses of the same general nature:  <pcie
  device unplug> <eeh driver trigger> <hotplug removal trigger> <pcie tree reconfiguration>
  <eeh recovery next step> <oops in EEH driver bus iteration loop>  A second class of oops is
  also seen when the underlying bus disappears during device recovery.  Refactor the EEH module
  to be PCI rescan and remove safe.  Also clean up a few minor formatting / readability issues.'
