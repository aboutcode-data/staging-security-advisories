summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mptcp: plug races
  between subflow fail and subflow creation  We have races similar to the one addressed by the
  previous patch between subflow failing and additional subflow creation. They are just harder
  to trigger.  The solution is similar. Use a separate flag to track the condition ''socket
  state prevent any additional subflow creation'' protected by the fallback lock.  The socket
  fallback makes such flag true, and also receiving or sending an MP_FAIL option.  The field
  ''allow_infinite_fallback'' is now always touched under the relevant lock, we can drop the
  ONCE annotation on write.'
