summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/damon/reclaim:
  avoid divide-by-zero in damon_reclaim_apply_parameters()  When creating a new scheme of DAMON_RECLAIM,
  the calculation of ''min_age_region'' uses ''aggr_interval'' as the divisor, which may lead
  to division-by-zero errors.  Fix it by directly returning -EINVAL when such a case occurs.'
