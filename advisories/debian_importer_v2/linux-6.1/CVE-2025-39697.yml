summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  NFS: Fix a race
  when updating an existing write  After nfs_lock_and_join_requests() tests for whether the
  request is still attached to the mapping, nothing prevents a call to nfs_inode_remove_request()
  from succeeding until we actually lock the page group. The reason is that whoever called nfs_inode_remove_request()
  doesn''t necessarily have a lock on the page group head.  So in order to avoid races, let''s
  take the page group lock earlier in nfs_lock_and_join_requests(), and hold it across the removal
  of the request in nfs_inode_remove_request().'
