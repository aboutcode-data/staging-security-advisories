summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PM / devfreq:
  Check governor before using governor->name  Commit 96ffcdf239de ("PM / devfreq: Remove redundant
  governor_name from struct devfreq") removes governor_name and uses governor->name to replace
  it. But devfreq->governor may be NULL and directly using devfreq->governor->name may cause
  null pointer exception. Move the check of governor to before using governor->name.'
