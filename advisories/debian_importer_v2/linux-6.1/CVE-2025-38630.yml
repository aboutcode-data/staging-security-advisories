summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fbdev: imxfb:
  Check fb_add_videomode to prevent null-ptr-deref  fb_add_videomode() can fail with -ENOMEM
  when its internal kmalloc() cannot allocate a struct fb_modelist.  If that happens, the modelist
  stays empty but the driver continues to register.  Add a check for its return value to prevent
  poteintial null-ptr-deref, which is similar to the commit 17186f1f90d3 ("fbdev: Fix do_register_framebuffer
  to prevent null-ptr-deref in fb_videomode_to_var").'
