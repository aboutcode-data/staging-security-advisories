summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: qla1280:
  Fix kernel oops when debug level > 2  A null dereference or oops exception will eventually
  occur when qla1280.c driver is compiled with DEBUG_QLA1280 enabled and ql_debug_level > 2.  I
  think its clear from the code that the intention here is sg_dma_len(s) not length of sg_next(s)
  when printing the debug info.'
