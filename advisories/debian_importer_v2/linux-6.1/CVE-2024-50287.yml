summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: v4l2-tpg:
  prevent the risk of a division by zero  As reported by Coverity, the logic at tpg_precalculate_line()
  blindly rescales the buffer even when scaled_witdh is equal to zero. If this ever happens,
  this will cause a division by zero.  Instead, add a WARN_ON_ONCE() to trigger such cases and
  return without doing any precalculation.'
