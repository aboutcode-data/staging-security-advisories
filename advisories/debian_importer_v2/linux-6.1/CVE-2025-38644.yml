summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: mac80211:
  reject TDLS operations when station is not associated  syzbot triggered a WARN in ieee80211_tdls_oper()
  by sending NL80211_TDLS_ENABLE_LINK immediately after NL80211_CMD_CONNECT, before association
  completed and without prior TDLS setup.  This left internal state like sdata->u.mgd.tdls_peer
  uninitialized, leading to a WARN_ON() in code paths that assumed it was valid.  Reject the
  operation early if not in station mode or not associated.'
