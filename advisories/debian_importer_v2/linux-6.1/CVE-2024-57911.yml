summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iio: dummy: iio_simply_dummy_buffer:
  fix information leak in triggered buffer  The ''data'' array is allocated via kmalloc() and
  it is used to push data to user space from a triggered buffer, but it does not set values
  for inactive channels, as it only uses iio_for_each_active_channel() to assign new values.  Use
  kzalloc for the memory allocation to avoid pushing uninitialized information to userspace.'
