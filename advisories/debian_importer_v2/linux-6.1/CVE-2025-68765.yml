summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mt76: mt7615:
  Fix memory leak in mt7615_mcu_wtbl_sta_add()  In mt7615_mcu_wtbl_sta_add(), an skb sskb is
  allocated. If the subsequent call to mt76_connac_mcu_alloc_wtbl_req() fails, the function
  returns an error without freeing sskb, leading to a memory leak.  Fix this by calling dev_kfree_skb()
  on sskb in the error handling path to ensure it is properly released.'
