  - CVE-2024-47739
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  padata: use integer
  wrap around to prevent deadlock on seq_nr overflow  When submitting more than 2^32 padata
  objects to padata_do_serial, the current sorting implementation incorrectly sorts padata objects
  with overflowed seq_nr, causing them to be placed before existing objects in the reorder list.
  This leads to a deadlock in the serialization process as padata_find_next cannot match padata->seq_nr
  and pd->processed because the padata instance with overflowed seq_nr will be selected next.  To
  fix this, we use an unsigned integer wrap around to correctly sort padata objects in scenarios
  with integer overflow.'
