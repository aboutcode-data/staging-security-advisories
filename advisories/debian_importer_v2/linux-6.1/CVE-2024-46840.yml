summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: clean
  up our handling of refs == 0 in snapshot delete  In reada we BUG_ON(refs == 0), which could
  be unkind since we aren''t holding a lock on the extent leaf and thus could get a transient
  incorrect answer.  In walk_down_proc we also BUG_ON(refs == 0), which could happen if we have
  extent tree corruption.  Change that to return -EUCLEAN.  In do_walk_down() we catch this
  case and handle it correctly, however we return -EIO, which -EUCLEAN is a more appropriate
  error code. Finally in walk_up_proc we have the same BUG_ON(refs == 0), so convert that to
  proper error handling.  Also adjust the error message so we can actually do something with
  the information.'
