summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  staging: rtl8723bs:
  fix stack buffer overflow in OnAssocReq IE parsing  The Supported Rates IE length from an
  incoming Association Request frame was used directly as the memcpy() length when copying into
  a fixed-size 16-byte stack buffer (supportRate). A malicious station can advertise an IE length
  larger than 16 bytes, causing a stack buffer overflow.  Clamp ie_len to the buffer size before
  copying the Supported Rates IE, and correct the bounds check when merging Extended Supported
  Rates to prevent a second potential overflow.  This prevents kernel stack corruption triggered
  by malformed association requests.'
