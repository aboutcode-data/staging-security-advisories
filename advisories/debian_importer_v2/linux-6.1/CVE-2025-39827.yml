  - CVE-2025-39827
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: rose: include
  node references in rose_neigh refcount  Current implementation maintains two separate reference
  counting mechanisms: the ''count'' field in struct rose_neigh tracks references from rose_node
  structures, while the ''use'' field (now refcount_t) tracks references from rose_sock.  This
  patch merges these two reference counting systems using ''use'' field for proper reference
  management. Specifically, this patch adds incrementing and decrementing of rose_neigh->use
  when rose_neigh->count is incremented or decremented.  This patch also modifies rose_rt_free(),
  rose_rt_device_down() and rose_clear_route() to properly release references to rose_neigh
  objects before freeing a rose_node through rose_remove_node().  These changes ensure rose_neigh
  structures are properly freed only when all references, including those from rose_node structures,
  are released. As a result, this resolves a slab-use-after-free issue reported by Syzbot.'
