summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: tuner:
  xc5000: Fix use-after-free in xc5000_release  The original code uses cancel_delayed_work()
  in xc5000_release(), which does not guarantee that the delayed work item timer_sleep has fully
  completed if it was already running. This leads to use-after-free scenarios where xc5000_release()
  may free the xc5000_priv while timer_sleep is still active and attempts to dereference the
  xc5000_priv.  A typical race condition is illustrated below:  CPU 0 (release thread)                 |
  CPU 1 (delayed work callback) xc5000_release()                       | xc5000_do_timer_sleep()   cancel_delayed_work()                |   hybrid_tuner_release_state(priv)     |     kfree(priv)                        |                                        |   priv
  = container_of() // UAF  Replace cancel_delayed_work() with cancel_delayed_work_sync() to
  ensure that the timer_sleep is properly canceled before the xc5000_priv memory is deallocated.  A
  deadlock concern was considered: xc5000_release() is called in a process context and is not
  holding any locks that the timer_sleep work item might also need. Therefore, the use of the
  _sync() variant is safe here.  This bug was initially identified through static analysis.  [hverkuil:
