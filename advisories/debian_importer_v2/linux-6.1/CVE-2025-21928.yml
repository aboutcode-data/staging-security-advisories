summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: intel-ish-hid:
  Fix use-after-free issue in ishtp_hid_remove()  The system can experience a random crash a
  few minutes after the driver is removed. This issue occurs due to improper handling of memory
  freeing in the ishtp_hid_remove() function.  The function currently frees the `driver_data`
  directly within the loop that destroys the HID devices, which can lead to accessing freed
  memory. Specifically, `hid_destroy_device()` uses `driver_data` when it calls `hid_ishtp_set_feature()`
  to power off the sensor, so freeing `driver_data` beforehand can result in accessing invalid
  memory.  This patch resolves the issue by storing the `driver_data` in a temporary variable
  before calling `hid_destroy_device()`, and then freeing the `driver_data` after the device
  is destroyed.'
