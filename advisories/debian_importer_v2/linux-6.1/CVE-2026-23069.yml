summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vsock/virtio:
  fix potential underflow in virtio_transport_get_credit()  The credit calculation in virtio_transport_get_credit()
  uses unsigned arithmetic:    ret = vvs->peer_buf_alloc - (vvs->tx_cnt - vvs->peer_fwd_cnt);  If
  the peer shrinks its advertised buffer (peer_buf_alloc) while bytes are in flight, the subtraction
  can underflow and produce a large positive value, potentially allowing more data to be queued
  than the peer can handle.  Reuse virtio_transport_has_space() which already handles this case
  and add a comment to make it clear why we are doing that.  [Stefano: use virtio_transport_has_space()
  instead of duplicating the code] [Stefano: tweak the commit message]'
