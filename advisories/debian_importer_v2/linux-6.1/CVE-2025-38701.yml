summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: do not
  BUG when INLINE_DATA_FL lacks system.data xattr  A syzbot fuzzed image triggered a BUG_ON
  in ext4_update_inline_data() when an inode had the INLINE_DATA_FL flag set but was missing
  the system.data extended attribute.  Since this can happen due to a maiciouly fuzzed file
  system, we shouldn''t BUG, but rather, report it as a corrupted file system.  Add similar
  replacements of BUG_ON with EXT4_ERROR_INODE() ii ext4_create_inline_data() and ext4_inline_data_truncate().'
