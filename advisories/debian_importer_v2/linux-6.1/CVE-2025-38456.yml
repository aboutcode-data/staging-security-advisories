summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ipmi:msghandler:
  Fix potential memory corruption in ipmi_create_user()  The "intf" list iterator is an invalid
  pointer if the correct "intf->intf_num" is not found.  Calling atomic_dec(&intf->nr_users)
  on and invalid pointer will lead to memory corruption.  We don''t really need to call atomic_dec()
  if we haven''t called atomic_add_return() so update the if (intf->in_shutdown) path as well.'
