summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  batman-adv: fix
  OOB read/write in network-coding decode  batadv_nc_skb_decode_packet() trusts coded_len and
  checks only against skb->len. XOR starts at sizeof(struct batadv_unicast_packet), reducing
  payload headroom, and the source skb length is not verified, allowing an out-of-bounds read
  and a small out-of-bounds write.  Validate that coded_len fits within the payload area of
  both destination and source sk_buffs before XORing.'
