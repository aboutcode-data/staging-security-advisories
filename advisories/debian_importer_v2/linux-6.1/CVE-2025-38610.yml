summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powercap: dtpm_cpu:
  Fix NULL pointer dereference in get_pd_power_uw()  The get_pd_power_uw() function can crash
  with a NULL pointer dereference when em_cpu_get() returns NULL. This occurs when a CPU becomes
  impossible during runtime, causing get_cpu_device() to return NULL, which propagates through
  em_cpu_get() and leads to a crash when em_span_cpus() dereferences the NULL pointer.  Add
  a NULL check after em_cpu_get() and return 0 if unavailable, matching the existing fallback
  behavior in __dtpm_cpu_setup().  [ rjw: Drop an excess empty code line ]'
