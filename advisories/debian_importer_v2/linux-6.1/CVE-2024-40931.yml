summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mptcp: ensure
  snd_una is properly initialized on connect  This is strictly related to commit fb7a0d334894
  ("mptcp: ensure snd_nxt is properly initialized on connect"). It turns out that syzkaller
  can trigger the retransmit after fallback and before processing any other incoming packet
  - so that snd_una is still left uninitialized.  Address the issue explicitly initializing
  snd_una together with snd_nxt and write_seq.'
