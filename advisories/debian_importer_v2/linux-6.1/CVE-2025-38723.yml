summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  LoongArch: BPF:\
  \ Fix jump offset calculation in tailcall  The extra pass of bpf_int_jit_compile() skips JIT\
  \ context initialization which essentially skips offset calculation leaving out_offset = -1,\
  \ so the jmp_offset in emit_bpf_tail_call is calculated by  \"#define jmp_offset (out_offset\
  \ - (cur_offset))\"  is a negative number, which is wrong. The final generated assembly are\
  \ as follow.  54:\tbgeu        \t$a2, $t1, -8\t    # 0x0000004c 58:\taddi.d      \t$a6, $s5,\
