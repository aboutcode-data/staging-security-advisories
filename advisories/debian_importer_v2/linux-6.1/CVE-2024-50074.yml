summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  parport: Proper
  fix for array out-of-bounds access  The recent fix for array out-of-bounds accesses replaced
  sprintf() calls blindly with snprintf().  However, since snprintf() returns the would-be-printed
  size, not the actually output size, the length calculation can still go over the given limit.  Use
  scnprintf() instead of snprintf(), which returns the actually output letters, for addressing
  the potential out-of-bounds access properly.'
