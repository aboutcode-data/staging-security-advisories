summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: dvb-usb:
  dtv5100: fix out-of-bounds in dtv5100_i2c_msg()  rlen value is a user-controlled value, but
  dtv5100_i2c_msg() does not check the size of the rlen value. Therefore, if it is set to a
  value larger than sizeof(st->data), an out-of-bounds vuln occurs for st->data.  Therefore,
  we need to add proper range checking to prevent this vuln.'
