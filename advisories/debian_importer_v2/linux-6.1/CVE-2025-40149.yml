summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tls: Use __sk_dst_get()
  and dst_dev_rcu() in get_netdev_for_sock().  get_netdev_for_sock() is called during setsockopt(),
  so not under RCU.  Using sk_dst_get(sk)->dev could trigger UAF.  Let''s use __sk_dst_get()
  and dst_dev_rcu().  Note that the only ->ndo_sk_get_lower_dev() user is bond_sk_get_lower_dev(),
  which uses RCU.'
