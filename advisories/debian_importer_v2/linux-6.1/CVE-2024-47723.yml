  - CVE-2024-47723
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  jfs: fix out-of-bounds
  in dbNextAG() and diAlloc()  In dbNextAG() , there is no check for the case where bmp->db_numag
  is greater or same than MAXAG due to a polluted image, which causes an out-of-bounds. Therefore,
  a bounds check should be added in dbMount().  And in dbNextAG(), a check for the case where
  agpref is greater than bmp->db_numag should be added, so an out-of-bounds exception should
  be prevented.  Additionally, a check for the case where agno is greater or same than MAXAG
  should be added in diAlloc() to prevent out-of-bounds.'
