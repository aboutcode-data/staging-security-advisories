summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  SUNRPC: svcauth_gss:
  avoid NULL deref on zero length gss_token in gss_read_proxy_verf  A zero length gss_token
  results in pages == 0 and in_token->pages[0] is NULL. The code unconditionally evaluates page_address(in_token->pages[0])
  for the initial memcpy, which can dereference NULL even when the copy length is 0. Guard the
  first memcpy so it only runs when length > 0.'
