summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  s390/dasd: fix
  error checks in dasd_copy_pair_store()  dasd_add_busid() can return an error via ERR_PTR()
  if an allocation fails. However, two callsites in dasd_copy_pair_store() do not check the
  result, potentially resulting in a NULL pointer dereference. Fix this by checking the result
  with IS_ERR() and returning the error up the stack.'
