summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nvme-multipath:
  fix lockdep WARN due to partition scan work  Blktests test cases nvme/014, 057 and 058 fail
  occasionally due to a lockdep WARN. As reported in the Closes tag URL, the WARN indicates
  that a deadlock can happen due to the dependency among disk->open_mutex, kblockd workqueue
  completion and partition_scan_work completion.  To avoid the lockdep WARN and the potential
  deadlock, cut the dependency by running the partition_scan_work not by kblockd workqueue but
  by nvme_wq.'
