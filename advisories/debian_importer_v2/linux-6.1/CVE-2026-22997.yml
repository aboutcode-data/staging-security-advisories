summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: can: j1939:
  j1939_xtp_rx_rts_session_active(): deactivate session upon receiving the second rts  Since
  j1939_session_deactivate_activate_next() in j1939_tp_rxtimer() is called only when the timer
  is enabled, we need to call j1939_session_deactivate_activate_next() if we cancelled the timer.
  Otherwise, refcount for j1939_session leaks, which will later appear as  | unregister_netdevice:
  waiting for vcan0 to become free. Usage count = 2.  problem.'
