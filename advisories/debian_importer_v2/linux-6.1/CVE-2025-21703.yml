summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netem: Update
  sch->q.qlen before qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog()  qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() notifies parent
  qdisc only if child qdisc becomes empty, therefore we need to reduce the backlog of the child
  qdisc before calling it. Otherwise it would miss the opportunity to call cops->qlen_notify(),
  in the case of DRR, it resulted in UAF since DRR uses ->qlen_notify() to maintain its active
  list.'
