summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display:
  Assign normalized_pix_clk when color depth = 14  [WHY & HOW] A warning message "WARNING: CPU:
  4 PID: 459 at ... /dc_resource.c:3397 calculate_phy_pix_clks+0xef/0x100 [amdgpu]" occurs because
  the display_color_depth == COLOR_DEPTH_141414 is not handled. This is observed in Radeon RX
  6600 XT.  It is fixed by assigning pix_clk * (14 * 3) / 24 - same as the rests.  Also fixes
  the indentation in get_norm_pix_clk.  (cherry picked from commit 274a87eb389f58eddcbc5659ab0b180b37e92775)'
