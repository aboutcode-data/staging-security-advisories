summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PCI: brcmstb:
  Fix error path after a call to regulator_bulk_get()  If the regulator_bulk_get() returns an
  error and no regulators are created, we need to set their number to zero.  If we don''t do
  this and the PCIe link up fails, a call to the regulator_bulk_free() will result in a kernel
  panic.  While at it, print the error value, as we cannot return an error upwards as the kernel
  will WARN() on an error from add_bus().  [kwilczynski: commit log, use comma in the message
