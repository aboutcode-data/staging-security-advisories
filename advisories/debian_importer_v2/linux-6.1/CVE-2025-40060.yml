summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  coresight: trbe:
  Return NULL pointer for allocation failures  When the TRBE driver fails to allocate a buffer,
  it currently returns the error code "-ENOMEM". However, the caller etm_setup_aux() only checks
  for a NULL pointer, so it misses the error. As a result, the driver continues and eventually
  causes a kernel panic.  Fix this by returning a NULL pointer from arm_trbe_alloc_buffer()
  on allocation failures. This allows that the callers can properly handle the failure.'
