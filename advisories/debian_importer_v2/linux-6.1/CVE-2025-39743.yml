summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  jfs: truncate
  good inode pages when hard link is 0  The fileset value of the inode copy from the disk by
  the reproducer is AGGR_RESERVED_I. When executing evict, its hard link number is 0, so its
  inode pages are not truncated. This causes the bugon to be triggered when executing clear_inode()
  because nrpages is greater than 0.'
