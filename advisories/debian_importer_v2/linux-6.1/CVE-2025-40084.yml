summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ksmbd: transport_ipc:
  validate payload size before reading handle  handle_response() dereferences the payload as
  a 4-byte handle without verifying that the declared payload size is at least 4 bytes. A malformed
  or truncated message from ksmbd.mountd can lead to a 4-byte read past the declared payload
  size. Validate the size before dereferencing.  This is a minimal fix to guard the initial
  handle read.'
