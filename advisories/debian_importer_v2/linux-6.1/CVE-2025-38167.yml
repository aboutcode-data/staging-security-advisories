summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fs/ntfs3: handle
  hdr_first_de() return value  The hdr_first_de() function returns a pointer to a struct NTFS_DE.
  This pointer may be NULL. To handle the NULL error effectively, it is important to implement
  an error handler. This will help manage potential errors consistently.  Additionally, error
  handling for the return value already exists at other points where this function is called.  Found
  by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.'
