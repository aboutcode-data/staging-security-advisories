summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  macvlan: fix
  possible UAF in macvlan_forward_source()  Add RCU protection on (struct macvlan_source_entry)->vlan.  Whenever
  macvlan_hash_del_source() is called, we must clear entry->vlan pointer before RCU grace period
  starts.  This allows macvlan_forward_source() to skip over entries queued for freeing.  Note
  that macvlan_dev are already RCU protected, as they are embedded in a standard netdev (netdev_priv(ndev)).  https:
