  - CVE-2025-68724
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: asymmetric_keys
  - prevent overflow in asymmetric_key_generate_id  Use check_add_overflow() to guard against
  potential integer overflows when adding the binary blob lengths and the size of an asymmetric_key_id
  structure and return ERR_PTR(-EOVERFLOW) accordingly. This prevents a possible buffer overflow
  when copying data from potentially malicious X.509 certificate fields that can be arbitrarily
  large, such as ASN.1 INTEGER serial numbers, issuer names, etc.'
