summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Explicitly
  check accesses to bpf_sock_addr  Syzkaller found a kernel warning on the following sock_addr
  program:      0: r0 = 0     1: r2 = *(u32 *)(r1 +60)     2: exit  which triggers:      verifier
  bug: error during ctx access conversion (0)  This is happening because offset 60 in bpf_sock_addr
  corresponds to an implicit padding of 4 bytes, right after msg_src_ip4. Access to this padding
  isn''t rejected in sock_addr_is_valid_access and it thus later fails to convert the access.  This
  patch fixes it by explicitly checking the various fields of bpf_sock_addr in sock_addr_is_valid_access.  I
  checked the other ctx structures and is_valid_access functions and didn''t find any other
  similar cases. Other cases of (properly handled) padding are covered in new tests in a subsequent
  patch.'
