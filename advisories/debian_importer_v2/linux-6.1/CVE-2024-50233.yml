  - CVE-2024-50233
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  staging: iio:
  frequency: ad9832: fix division by zero in ad9832_calc_freqreg()  In the ad9832_write_frequency()
  function, clk_get_rate() might return 0. This can lead to a division by zero when calling
  ad9832_calc_freqreg(). The check if (fout > (clk_get_rate(st->mclk) / 2)) does not protect
  against the case when fout is 0. The ad9832_write_frequency() function is called from ad9832_write(),
  and fout is derived from a text buffer, which can contain any value.'
