summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iio: adc: at91:
  call input_free_device() on allocated iio_dev  Current implementation of at91_ts_register()
  calls input_free_deivce() on st->ts_input, however, the err label can be reached before the
  allocated iio_dev is stored to st->ts_input. Thus call input_free_device() on input instead
  of st->ts_input.'
