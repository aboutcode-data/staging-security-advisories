  - CVE-2025-38277
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mtd: nand: ecc-mxic:
  Fix use of uninitialized variable ret  If ctx->steps is zero, the loop processing ECC steps
  is skipped, and the variable ret remains uninitialized. It is later checked and returned,
  which leads to undefined behavior and may cause unpredictable results in user space or kernel
  crashes.  This scenario can be triggered in edge cases such as misconfigured geometry, ECC
  engine misuse, or if ctx->steps is not validated after initialization.  Initialize ret to
  zero before the loop to ensure correct and safe behavior regardless of the ctx->steps value.  Found
  by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.'
