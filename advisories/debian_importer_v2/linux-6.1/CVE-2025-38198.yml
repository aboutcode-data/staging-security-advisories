summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fbcon: Make sure
  modelist not set on unregistered console  It looks like attempting to write to the "store_modes"
  sysfs node will run afoul of unregistered consoles:  UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbcon.c:122:28

  things go wrong here. Instead, return NULL, as callers of fbcon_info_from_console() are trying
  to compare against existing "info" pointers, so error handling should kick in correctly.'
