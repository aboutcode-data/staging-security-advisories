summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  parisc: Do not
  reprogram affinitiy on ASP chip  The ASP chip is a very old variant of the GSP chip and is
  used e.g. in HP 730 workstations. When trying to reprogram the affinity it will crash with
  a HPMC as the relevant registers don''t seem to be at the usual location.  Let''s avoid the
  crash by checking the sversion. Also note, that reprogramming isn''t necessary either, as
  the HP730 is a just a single-CPU machine.'
