summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dmaengine: idxd:
  Fix double free in idxd_setup_wqs()  The clean up in idxd_setup_wqs() has had a couple bugs
  because the error handling is a bit subtle.  It''s simpler to just re-write it in a cleaner
  way.  The issues here are:  1) If "idxd->max_wqs" is <= 0 then we call put_device(conf_dev)
  when    "conf_dev" hasn''t been initialized. 2) If kzalloc_node() fails then again "conf_dev"
  is invalid.  It''s    either uninitialized or it points to the "conf_dev" from the    previous
  iteration so it leads to a double free.  It''s better to free partial loop iterations within
  the loop and then the unwinding at the end can handle whole loop iterations.  I also renamed
  the labels to describe what the goto does and not where the goto was located.'
