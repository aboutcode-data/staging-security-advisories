summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nouveau/dmem:
  Fix vulnerability in migrate_to_ram upon copy error  The `nouveau_dmem_copy_one` function
  ensures that the copy push command is sent to the device firmware but does not track whether
  it was executed successfully.  In the case of a copy error (e.g., firmware or hardware failure),
  the copy push command will be sent via the firmware channel, and `nouveau_dmem_copy_one` will
  likely report success, leading to the `migrate_to_ram` function returning a dirty HIGH_USER
  page to the user.  This can result in a security vulnerability, as a HIGH_USER page that may
  contain sensitive or corrupted data could be returned to the user.  To prevent this vulnerability,
  we allocate a zero page. Thus, in case of an error, a non-dirty (zero) page will be returned
  to the user.'
