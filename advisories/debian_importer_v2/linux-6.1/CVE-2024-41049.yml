summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  filelock: fix
  potential use-after-free in posix_lock_inode  Light Hsieh reported a KASAN UAF warning in
  trace_posix_lock_inode(). The request pointer had been changed earlier to point to a lock
  entry that was added to the inode''s list. However, before the tracepoint could fire, another
  task raced in and freed that lock.  Fix this by moving the tracepoint inside the spinlock,
  which should ensure that this doesn''t happen.'
