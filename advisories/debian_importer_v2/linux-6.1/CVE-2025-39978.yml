summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  octeontx2-pf:
  Fix potential use after free in otx2_tc_add_flow()  This code calls kfree_rcu(new_node, rcu)
  and then dereferences "new_node" and then dereferences it on the next line.  Two lines later,
  we take a mutex so I don''t think this is an RCU safe region.  Re-order it to do the dereferences
  before queuing up the free.'
