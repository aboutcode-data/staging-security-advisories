  - CVE-2025-68217
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Input: pegasus-notetaker
  - fix potential out-of-bounds access  In the pegasus_notetaker driver, the pegasus_probe()
  function allocates the URB transfer buffer using the wMaxPacketSize value from the endpoint
  descriptor. An attacker can use a malicious USB descriptor to force the allocation of a very
  small buffer.  Subsequently, if the device sends an interrupt packet with a specific pattern
  (e.g., where the first byte is 0x80 or 0x42), the pegasus_parse_packet() function parses the
  packet without checking the allocated buffer size. This leads to an out-of-bounds memory access.'
