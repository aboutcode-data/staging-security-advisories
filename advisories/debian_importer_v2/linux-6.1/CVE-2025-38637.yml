summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net_sched: skbprio:
  Remove overly strict queue assertions  In the current implementation, skbprio enqueue/dequeue
  contains an assertion that fails under certain conditions when SKBPRIO is used as a child
  qdisc under TBF with specific parameters. The failure occurs because TBF sometimes peeks at
  packets in the child qdisc without actually dequeuing them when tokens are unavailable.  This
  peek operation creates a discrepancy between the parent and child qdisc queue length counters.
  When TBF later receives a high-priority packet, SKBPRIO''s queue length may show a different
  value than what''s reflected in its internal priority queue tracking, triggering the assertion.  The
  fix removes this overly strict assertions in SKBPRIO, they are not necessary at all.'
