summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ep93xx: clock:
  Fix off by one in ep93xx_div_recalc_rate()  The psc->div[] array has psc->num_div elements.  These
  values come from when we call clk_hw_register_div().  It''s adc_divisors and ARRAY_SIZE(adc_divisors))
  and so on.  So this condition needs to be >= instead of > to prevent an out of bounds read.'
