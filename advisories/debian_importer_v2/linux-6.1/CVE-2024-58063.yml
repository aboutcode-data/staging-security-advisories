summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: rtlwifi:
  fix memory leaks and invalid access at probe error path  Deinitialize at reverse order when
  probe fails.  When init_sw_vars fails, rtl_deinit_core should not be called, specially now
  that it destroys the rtl_wq workqueue.  And call rtl_pci_deinit and deinit_sw_vars, otherwise,
  memory will be leaked.  Remove pci_set_drvdata call as it will already be cleaned up by the
  core driver code and could lead to memory leaks too. cf. commit 8d450935ae7f ("wireless: rtlwifi:
  remove unnecessary pci_set_drvdata()") and commit 3d86b93064c7 ("rtlwifi: Fix PCI probe error
  path orphaned memory").'
