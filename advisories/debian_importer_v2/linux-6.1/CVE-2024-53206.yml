summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tcp: Fix use-after-free
  of nreq in reqsk_timer_handler().  The cited commit replaced inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop_and_put()
  with __inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop() and reqsk_put() in reqsk_timer_handler().  Then, oreq should
  be passed to reqsk_put() instead of req; otherwise use-after-free of nreq could happen when
  reqsk is migrated but the retry attempt failed (e.g. due to timeout).  Let''s pass oreq to
  reqsk_put().'
