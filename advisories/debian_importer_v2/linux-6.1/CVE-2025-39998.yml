summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: target:
  target_core_configfs: Add length check to avoid buffer overflow  A buffer overflow arises
  from the usage of snprintf to write into the buffer "buf" in target_lu_gp_members_show function
  located in /drivers/target/target_core_configfs.c. This buffer is allocated with size LU_GROUP_NAME_BUF
  (256 bytes).  snprintf(...) formats multiple strings into buf with the HBA name (hba->hba_group.cg_item),
  a slash character, a devicename (dev-> dev_group.cg_item) and a newline character, the total
  formatted string length may exceed the buffer size of 256 bytes.  Since snprintf() returns
  the total number of bytes that would have been written (the length of %s/%sn ), this value
  may exceed the buffer length (256 bytes) passed to memcpy(), this will ultimately cause function
  memcpy reporting a buffer overflow error.  An additional check of the return value of snprintf()
  can avoid this buffer overflow.'
