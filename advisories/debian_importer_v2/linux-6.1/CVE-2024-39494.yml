summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ima: Fix use-after-free
  on a dentry''s dname.name  ->d_name.name can change on rename and the earlier value can be
  freed; there are conditions sufficient to stabilize it (->d_lock on dentry, ->d_lock on its
  parent, ->i_rwsem exclusive on the parent''s inode, rename_lock), but none of those are met
