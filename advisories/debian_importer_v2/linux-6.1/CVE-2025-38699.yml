  - CVE-2025-38699
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: bfa: Double-free
  fix  When the bfad_im_probe() function fails during initialization, the memory pointed to
  by bfad->im is freed without setting bfad->im to NULL.  Subsequently, during driver uninstallation,
  when the state machine enters the bfad_sm_stopping state and calls the bfad_im_probe_undo()
  function, it attempts to free the memory pointed to by bfad->im again, thereby triggering
  a double-free vulnerability.  Set bfad->im to NULL if probing fails.'
