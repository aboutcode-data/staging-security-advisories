  - CVE-2024-46745
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Input: uinput
  - reject requests with unreasonable number of slots   When exercising uinput interface syzkaller
  may try setting up device with a really large number of slots, which causes memory allocation
  failure in input_mt_init_slots(). While this allocation failure is handled properly and request
  is rejected, it results in syzkaller reports. Additionally, such request may put undue burden
  on the system which will try to free a lot of memory for a bogus request.  Fix it by limiting
  allowed number of slots to 100. This can easily be extended if we see devices that can track
  more than 100 contacts.'
