  - CVE-2024-49957
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ocfs2: fix null-ptr-deref
  when journal load failed.  During the mounting process, if journal_reset() fails because of
  too short journal, then lead to jbd2_journal_load() fails with NULL j_sb_buffer.  Subsequently,
  ocfs2_journal_shutdown() calls jbd2_journal_flush()->jbd2_cleanup_journal_tail()-> __jbd2_update_log_tail()->jbd2_journal_update_sb_log_tail()
  ->lock_buffer(journal->j_sb_buffer), resulting in a null-pointer dereference error.  To resolve
  this issue, we should check the JBD2_LOADED flag to ensure the journal was properly loaded.  Additionally,
  use journal instead of osb->journal directly to simplify the code.'
