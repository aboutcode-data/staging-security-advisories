summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iscsi_ibft: Fix
  UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds warning in ibft_attr_show_nic()  When performing an iSCSI boot using
  IPv6, iscsistart still reads the /sys/firmware/ibft/ethernetX/subnet-mask entry. Since the
  IPv6 prefix length is 64, this causes the shift exponent to become negative, triggering a
  UBSAN warning. As the concept of a subnet mask does not apply to IPv6, the value is set to
  ~0 to suppress the warning message.'
