summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tipc: fix memory
  leak in tipc_link_xmit  In case the backlog transmit queue for system-importance messages
  is overloaded, tipc_link_xmit() returns -ENOBUFS but the skb list is not purged. This leads
  to memory leak and failure when a skb is allocated.  This commit fixes this issue by purging
  the skb list before tipc_link_xmit() returns.'
