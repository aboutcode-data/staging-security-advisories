summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nvme-tcp: fix
  NULL pointer dereferences in nvmet_tcp_build_pdu_iovec  Commit efa56305908b ("nvmet-tcp: Fix
  a kernel panic when host sends an invalid H2C PDU length") added ttag bounds checking and
  data_offset validation in nvmet_tcp_handle_h2c_data_pdu(), but it did not validate whether
  the command''s data structures (cmd->req.sg and cmd->iov) have been properly initialized before
  processing H2C_DATA PDUs.  The nvmet_tcp_build_pdu_iovec() function dereferences these pointers
  without NULL checks. This can be triggered by sending H2C_DATA PDU immediately after the ICREQ/ICRESP
  handshake, before sending a CONNECT command or NVMe write command.  Attack vectors that trigger
  NULL pointer dereferences: 1. H2C_DATA PDU sent before CONNECT → both pointers NULL 2. H2C_DATA
  PDU for READ command → cmd->req.sg allocated, cmd->iov NULL 3. H2C_DATA PDU for uninitialized
  command slot → both pointers NULL  The fix validates both cmd->req.sg and cmd->iov before
  calling nvmet_tcp_build_pdu_iovec(). Both checks are required because: - Uninitialized commands:
  both NULL - READ commands: cmd->req.sg allocated, cmd->iov NULL - WRITE commands: both allocated'
