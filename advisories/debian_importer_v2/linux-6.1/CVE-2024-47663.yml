summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  staging: iio:
  frequency: ad9834: Validate frequency parameter value  In ad9834_write_frequency() clk_get_rate()
  can return 0. In such case ad9834_calc_freqreg() call will lead to division by zero. Checking
  ''if (fout > (clk_freq / 2))'' doesn''t protect in case of ''fout'' is 0. ad9834_write_frequency()
  is called from ad9834_write(), where fout is taken from text buffer, which can contain any
  value.  Modify parameters checking.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org)
  with SVACE.'
