summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  libceph: make
  free_choose_arg_map() resilient to partial allocation  free_choose_arg_map() may dereference
  a NULL pointer if its caller fails after a partial allocation.  For example, in decode_choose_args(),
  if allocation of arg_map->args fails, execution jumps to the fail label and free_choose_arg_map()
  is called. Since arg_map->size is updated to a non-zero value before memory allocation, free_choose_arg_map()
  will iterate over arg_map->args and dereference a NULL pointer.  To prevent this potential
  NULL pointer dereference and make free_choose_arg_map() more resilient, add checks for pointers
  before iterating.'
