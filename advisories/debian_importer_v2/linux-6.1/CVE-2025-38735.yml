summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gve: prevent
  ethtool ops after shutdown  A crash can occur if an ethtool operation is invoked after shutdown()
  is called.  shutdown() is invoked during system shutdown to stop DMA operations without performing
  expensive deallocations. It is discouraged to unregister the netdev in this path, so the device
  may still be visible to userspace and kernel helpers.  In gve, shutdown() tears down most
  internal data structures. If an ethtool operation is dispatched after shutdown(), it will
  dereference freed or NULL pointers, leading to a kernel panic. While graceful shutdown normally
  quiesces userspace before invoking the reboot syscall, forced shutdowns (as observed on GCP
  VMs) can still trigger this path.  Fix by calling netif_device_detach() in shutdown(). This
  marks the device as detached so the ethtool ioctl handler will skip dispatching operations
  to the driver.'
