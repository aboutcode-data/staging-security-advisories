summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: sched: act_connmark:
  initialize struct tc_ife to fix kernel leak  In tcf_connmark_dump(), the variable ''opt''
  was partially initialized using a designatied initializer. While the padding bytes are reamined
  uninitialized. nla_put() copies the entire structure into a netlink message, these uninitialized
  bytes leaked to userspace.  Initialize the structure with memset before assigning its fields
  to ensure all members and padding are cleared prior to beign copied.'
