  - CVE-2025-37851
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fbdev: omapfb:
  Add ''plane'' value check  Function dispc_ovl_setup is not intended to work with the value
  OMAP_DSS_WB of the enum parameter plane.  The value of this parameter is initialized in dss_init_overlays
  and in the current state of the code it cannot take this value so it''s not a real problem.  For
  the purposes of defensive coding it wouldn''t be superfluous to check the parameter value,
  because some functions down the call stack process this value correctly and some not.  For
  example, in dispc_ovl_setup_global_alpha it may lead to buffer overflow.  Add check for this
  value.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE static analysis tool.'
