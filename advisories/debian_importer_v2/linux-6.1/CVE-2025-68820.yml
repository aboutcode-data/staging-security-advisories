  - CVE-2025-68820
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: xattr:
  fix null pointer deref in ext4_raw_inode()  If ext4_get_inode_loc() fails (e.g. if it returns
  -EFSCORRUPTED), iloc.bh will remain set to NULL. Since ext4_xattr_inode_dec_ref_all() lacks
  error checking, this will lead to a null pointer dereference in ext4_raw_inode(), called right
  after ext4_get_inode_loc().  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.'
