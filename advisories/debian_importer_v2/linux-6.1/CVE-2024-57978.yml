summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: imx-jpeg:\
  \ Fix potential error pointer dereference in detach_pm()  The proble is on the first line:\
  \  \tif (jpeg->pd_dev[i] && !pm_runtime_suspended(jpeg->pd_dev[i]))  If jpeg->pd_dev[i] is\
  \ an error pointer, then passing it to pm_runtime_suspended() will lead to an Oops.  The other\
  \ conditions check for both error pointers and NULL, but it would be more clear to use the\
  \ IS_ERR_OR_NULL() check for that."
