summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  regulator: max20086:
  fix invalid memory access  max20086_parse_regulators_dt() calls of_regulator_match() using
  an array of struct of_regulator_match allocated on the stack for the matches argument.  of_regulator_match()
  calls devm_of_regulator_put_matches(), which calls devres_alloc() to allocate a struct devm_of_regulator_matches
  which will be de-allocated using devm_of_regulator_put_matches().  struct devm_of_regulator_matches
  is populated with the stack allocated matches array.  If the device fails to probe, devm_of_regulator_put_matches()
  will be called and will try to call of_node_put() on that stack pointer, generating the following
  dmesg entries:  max20086 6-0028: Failed to read DEVICE_ID reg: -121 kobject: ''\xc0$\xa5\x03''
  (000000002cebcb7a): is not initialized, yet kobject_put() is being called.  Followed by a
  stack trace matching the call flow described above.  Switch to allocating the matches array
  using devm_kcalloc() to avoid accessing the stack pointer long after it''s out of scope.  This
  also has the advantage of allowing multiple max20086 to probe without overriding the data
  stored inside the global of_regulator_match.'
