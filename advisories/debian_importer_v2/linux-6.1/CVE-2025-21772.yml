summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  partitions: mac:
  fix handling of bogus partition table  Fix several issues in partition probing:   - The bailout
  for a bad partoffset must use put_dev_sector(), since the    preceding read_part_sector()
  succeeded.  - If the partition table claims a silly sector size like 0xfff bytes    (which
  results in partition table entries straddling sector boundaries),    bail out instead of accessing
  out-of-bounds memory.  - We must not assume that the partition table contains proper NUL    termination
  - use strnlen() and strncmp() instead of strlen() and    strcmp().'
