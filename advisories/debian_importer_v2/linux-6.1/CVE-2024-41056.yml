summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  firmware: cs_dsp:
  Use strnlen() on name fields in V1 wmfw files  Use strnlen() instead of strlen() on the algorithm
  and coefficient name string arrays in V1 wmfw files.  In V1 wmfw files the name is a NUL-terminated
  string in a fixed-size array. cs_dsp should protect against overrunning the array if the NUL
  terminator is missing.'
