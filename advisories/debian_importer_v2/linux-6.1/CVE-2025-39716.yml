  - CVE-2025-39716
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  parisc: Revise
  __get_user() to probe user read access  Because of the way read access support is implemented,
  read access interruptions are only triggered at privilege levels 2 and 3. The kernel executes
  at privilege level 0, so __get_user() never triggers a read access interruption (code 26).
  Thus, it is currently possible for user code to access a read protected address via a system
  call.  Fix this by probing read access rights at privilege level 3 (PRIV_USER) and setting
  __gu_err to -EFAULT (-14) if access isn''t allowed.  Note the cmpiclr instruction does a 32-bit
  compare because COND macro doesn''t work inside asm.'
