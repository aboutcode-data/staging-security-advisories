summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sparc: fix accurate
  exception reporting in copy_{from_to}_user for UltraSPARC  The referenced commit introduced
  exception handlers on user-space memory references in copy_from_user and copy_to_user. These
  handlers return from the respective function and calculate the remaining bytes left to copy
  using the current register contents. This commit fixes a couple of bad calculations. This
  will fix the return value of copy_from_user and copy_to_user in the faulting case. The behaviour
  of memcpy stays unchanged.'
