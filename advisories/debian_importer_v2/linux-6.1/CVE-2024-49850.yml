  - CVE-2024-49850
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: correctly
  handle malformed BPF_CORE_TYPE_ID_LOCAL relos  In case of malformed relocation record of kind
  BPF_CORE_TYPE_ID_LOCAL referencing a non-existing BTF type, function bpf_core_calc_relo_insn
  would cause a null pointer deference.  Fix this by adding a proper check upper in call stack,
  as malformed relocation records could be passed from user space.  Simplest reproducer is a
  program:      r0 = 0     exit  With a single relocation record:      .insn_off = 0,          /*
  patch first instruction */     .type_id = 100500,      /* this type id does not exist */     .access_str_off
  = 6,    /* offset of string "0" */     .kind = BPF_CORE_TYPE_ID_LOCAL,  See the link for original
  reproducer or next commit for a test case.'
