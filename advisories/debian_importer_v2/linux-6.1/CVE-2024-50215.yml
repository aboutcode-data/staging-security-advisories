  - CVE-2024-50215
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nvmet-auth: assign
  dh_key to NULL after kfree_sensitive  ctrl->dh_key might be used across multiple calls to
  nvmet_setup_dhgroup() for the same controller. So it''s better to nullify it after release
  on error path in order to avoid double free later in nvmet_destroy_auth().  Found by Linux
  Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Svace.'
