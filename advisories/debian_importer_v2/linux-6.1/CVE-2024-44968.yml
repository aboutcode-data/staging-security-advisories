  - CVE-2024-44968
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tick/broadcast:
  Move per CPU pointer access into the atomic section  The recent fix for making the take over
  of the broadcast timer more reliable retrieves a per CPU pointer in preemptible context.  This
  went unnoticed as compilers hoist the access into the non-preemptible region where the pointer
  is actually used. But of course it''s valid that the compiler keeps it at the place where
  the code puts it which rightfully triggers:    BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible
  [00000000] code:        caller is hotplug_cpu__broadcast_tick_pull+0x1c/0xc0  Move it to the
  actual usage site which is in a non-preemptible region.'
