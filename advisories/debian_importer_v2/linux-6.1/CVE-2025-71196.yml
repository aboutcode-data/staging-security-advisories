summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  phy: stm32-usphyc:
  Fix off by one in probe()  The "index" variable is used as an index into the usbphyc->phys[]
  array which has usbphyc->nphys elements.  So if it is equal to usbphyc->nphys then it is one
  element out of bounds.  The "index" comes from the device tree so it''s data that we trust
  and it''s unlikely to be wrong, however it''s obviously still worth fixing the bug.  Change
  the > to >=.'
