summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  hwmon: (asus-ec-sensors)
  check sensor index in read_string()  Prevent a potential invalid memory access when the requested
  sensor is not found.  find_ec_sensor_index() may return a negative value (e.g. -ENOENT), but
  its result was used without checking, which could lead to undefined behavior when passed to
  get_sensor_info().  Add a proper check to return -EINVAL if sensor_index is negative.  Found
  by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.  [groeck: Return error code returned
  from find_ec_sensor_index]'
