  - CVE-2025-37995
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  module: ensure
  that kobject_put() is safe for module type kobjects  In ''lookup_or_create_module_kobject()'',
  an internal kobject is created using ''module_ktype''. So call to ''kobject_put()'' on error
  handling path causes an attempt to use an uninitialized completion pointer in ''module_kobject_release()''.
  In this scenario, we just want to release kobject without an extra synchronization required
  for a regular module unloading process, so adding an extra check whether ''complete()'' is
  actually required makes ''kobject_put()'' safe.'
