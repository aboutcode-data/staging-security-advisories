summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  acct: perform
  last write from workqueue  In [1] it was reported that the acct(2) system call can be used
  to trigger NULL deref in cases where it is set to write to a file that triggers an internal
  lookup. This can e.g., happen when pointing acc(2) to /sys/power/resume. At the point the
  where the write to this file happens the calling task has already exited and called exit_fs().
  A lookup will thus trigger a NULL-deref when accessing current->fs.  Reorganize the code so
  that the the final write happens from the workqueue but with the caller''s credentials. This
  preserves the (strange) permission model and has almost no regression risk.  This api should
  stop to exist though.'
