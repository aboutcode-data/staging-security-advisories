summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  hfs: fix slab-out-of-bounds
  in hfs_bnode_read()  This patch introduces is_bnode_offset_valid() method that checks the
  requested offset value. Also, it introduces check_and_correct_requested_length() method that
  checks and correct the requested length (if it is necessary). These methods are used in hfs_bnode_read(),
  hfs_bnode_write(), hfs_bnode_clear(), hfs_bnode_copy(), and hfs_bnode_move() with the goal
  to prevent the access out of allocated memory and triggering the crash.'
