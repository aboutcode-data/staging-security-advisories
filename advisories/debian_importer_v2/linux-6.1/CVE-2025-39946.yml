summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tls: make sure
  to abort the stream if headers are bogus  Normally we wait for the socket to buffer up the
  whole record before we service it. If the socket has a tiny buffer, however, we read out the
  data sooner, to prevent connection stalls. Make sure that we abort the connection when we
  find out late that the record is actually invalid. Retrying the parsing is fine in itself
  but since we copy some more data each time before we parse we can overflow the allocated skb
  space.  Constructing a scenario in which we''re under pressure without enough data in the
  socket to parse the length upfront is quite hard. syzbot figured out a way to do this by serving
  us the header in small OOB sends, and then filling in the recvbuf with a large normal send.  Make
  sure that tls_rx_msg_size() aborts strp, if we reach an invalid record there''s really no
  way to recover.'
