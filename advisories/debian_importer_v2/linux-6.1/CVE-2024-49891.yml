  - CVE-2024-49891
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: lpfc: Validate
  hdwq pointers before dereferencing in reset/errata paths  When the HBA is undergoing a reset
  or is handling an errata event, NULL ptr dereference crashes may occur in routines such as
  lpfc_sli_flush_io_rings(), lpfc_dev_loss_tmo_callbk(), or lpfc_abort_handler().  Add NULL
  ptr checks before dereferencing hdwq pointers that may have been freed due to operations colliding
  with a reset or errata event handler.'
