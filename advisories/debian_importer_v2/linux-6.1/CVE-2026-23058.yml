summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: ems_usb:
  ems_usb_read_bulk_callback(): fix URB memory leak  Fix similar memory leak as in commit 7352e1d5932a
  ("can: gs_usb: gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): fix URB memory leak").  In ems_usb_open(),
  the URBs for USB-in transfers are allocated, added to the dev->rx_submitted anchor and submitted.
  In the complete callback ems_usb_read_bulk_callback(), the URBs are processed and resubmitted.
  In ems_usb_close() the URBs are freed by calling usb_kill_anchored_urbs(&dev->rx_submitted).  However,
  this does not take into account that the USB framework unanchors the URB before the complete
  function is called. This means that once an in-URB has been completed, it is no longer anchored
  and is ultimately not released in ems_usb_close().  Fix the memory leak by anchoring the URB
  in the ems_usb_read_bulk_callback() to the dev->rx_submitted anchor.'
