summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ipv6: mcast:
  add RCU protection to mld_newpack()  mld_newpack() can be called without RTNL or RCU being
  held.  Note that we no longer can use sock_alloc_send_skb() because ipv6.igmp_sk uses GFP_KERNEL
  allocations which can sleep.  Instead use alloc_skb() and charge the net->ipv6.igmp_sk socket
  under RCU protection.'
