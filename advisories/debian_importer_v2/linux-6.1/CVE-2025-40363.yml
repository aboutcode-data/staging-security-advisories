summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: ipv6: fix
  field-spanning memcpy warning in AH output  Fix field-spanning memcpy warnings in ah6_output()
  and ah6_output_done() where extension headers are copied to/from IPv6 address fields, triggering
  fortify-string warnings about writes beyond the 16-byte address fields.    memcpy: detected
  field-spanning write (size 40) of single field "&top_iph->saddr" at net/ipv6/ah6.c:439 (size
  16)   WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 8838 at net/ipv6/ah6.c:439 ah6_output+0xe7e/0x14e0 net/ipv6/ah6.c:439  The
  warnings are false positives as the extension headers are intentionally placed after the IPv6
  header in memory. Fix by properly copying addresses and extension headers separately, and
  introduce helper functions to avoid code duplication.'
