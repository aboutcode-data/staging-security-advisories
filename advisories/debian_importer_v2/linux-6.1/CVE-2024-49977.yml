summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: stmmac:
  Fix zero-division error when disabling tc cbs  The commit b8c43360f6e4 ("net: stmmac: No need
  to calculate speed divider when offload is disabled") allows the "port_transmit_rate_kbps"
  to be set to a value of 0, which is then passed to the "div_s64" function when tc-cbs is disabled.
  This leads to a zero-division error.  When tc-cbs is disabled, the idleslope, sendslope, and
  credit values the credit values are not required to be configured. Therefore, adding a return
  statement after setting the txQ mode to DCB when tc-cbs is disabled would prevent a zero-division
  error.'
