  - CVE-2024-47748
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vhost_vdpa: assign
  irq bypass producer token correctly  We used to call irq_bypass_unregister_producer() in vhost_vdpa_setup_vq_irq()
  which is problematic as we don''t know if the token pointer is still valid or not.  Actually,
  we use the eventfd_ctx as the token so the life cycle of the token should be bound to the
  VHOST_SET_VRING_CALL instead of vhost_vdpa_setup_vq_irq() which could be called by set_status().  Fixing
  this by setting up irq bypass producer''s token when handling VHOST_SET_VRING_CALL and un-registering
  the producer before calling vhost_vring_ioctl() to prevent a possible use after free as eventfd
  could have been released in vhost_vring_ioctl(). And such registering and unregistering will
  only be done if DRIVER_OK is set.'
