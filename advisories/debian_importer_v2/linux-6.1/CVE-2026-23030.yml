summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  phy: rockchip:
  inno-usb2: Fix a double free bug in rockchip_usb2phy_probe()  The for_each_available_child_of_node()
  calls of_node_put() to release child_np in each success loop. After breaking from the loop
  with the child_np has been released, the code will jump to the put_child label and will call
  the of_node_put() again if the devm_request_threaded_irq() fails. These cause a double free
  bug.  Fix by returning directly to avoid the duplicate of_node_put().'
