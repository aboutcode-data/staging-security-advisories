summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KEYS: prevent
  NULL pointer dereference in find_asymmetric_key()  In find_asymmetric_key(), if all NULLs
  are passed in the id_{0,1,2} arguments, the kernel will first emit WARN but then have an oops
  because id_2 gets dereferenced anyway.  Add the missing id_2 check and move WARN_ON() to the
  final else branch to avoid duplicate NULL checks.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org)
  with Svace static analysis tool.'
