summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: pidff: Fix
  null pointer dereference in pidff_find_fields  This function triggered a null pointer dereference
  if used to search for a report that isn''t implemented on the device. This happened both for
  optional and required reports alike.  The same logic was applied to pidff_find_special_field
  and although pidff_init_fields should return an error earlier if one of the required reports
  is missing, future modifications could change this logic and resurface this possible null
  pointer dereference again.  LKML bug report: https://lore.kernel.org/all/CAL-gK7f5=R0nrrQdPtaZZr1fd-cdAMbDMuZ_NLA8vM0SX+nGSw@mail.gmail.com'
