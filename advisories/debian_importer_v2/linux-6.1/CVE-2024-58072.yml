summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: rtlwifi:
  remove unused check_buddy_priv  Commit 2461c7d60f9f ("rtlwifi: Update header file") introduced
  a global list of private data structures.  Later on, commit 26634c4b1868 ("rtlwifi Modify
  existing bits to match vendor version 2013.02.07") started adding the private data to that
  list at probe time and added a hook, check_buddy_priv to find the private data from a similar
  device.  However, that function was never used.  Besides, though there is a lock for that
  list, it is never used. And when the probe fails, the private data is never removed from the
  list. This would cause a second probe to access freed memory.  Remove the unused hook, structures
  and members, which will prevent the potential race condition on the list and its corruption
  during a second probe when probe fails.'
