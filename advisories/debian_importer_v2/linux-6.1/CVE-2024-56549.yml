summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cachefiles: Fix\
  \ NULL pointer dereference in object->file  At present, the object->file has the NULL pointer\
  \ dereference problem in ondemand-mode. The root cause is that the allocated fd and object->file\
  \ lifetime are inconsistent, and the user-space invocation to anon_fd uses object->file. Following\
  \ is the process that triggers the issue:  \t  [write fd]\t\t\t\t[umount] cachefiles_ondemand_fd_write_iter\
  \ \t\t\t\t       fscache_cookie_state_machine \t\t\t\t\t cachefiles_withdraw_cookie   if (!file)\
  \ return -ENOBUFS \t\t\t\t\t   cachefiles_clean_up_object \t\t\t\t\t     cachefiles_unmark_inode_in_use\
  \ \t\t\t\t\t     fput(object->file) \t\t\t\t\t     object->file = NULL   // file NULL pointer\
  \ dereference!   __cachefiles_write(..., file, ...)  Fix this issue by add an additional reference\
  \ count to the object->file before write/llseek, and decrement after it finished."
