  - CVE-2024-44947
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fuse: Initialize
  beyond-EOF page contents before setting uptodate  fuse_notify_store(), unlike fuse_do_readpage(),
  does not enable page zeroing (because it can be used to change partial page contents).  So
  fuse_notify_store() must be more careful to fully initialize page contents (including parts
  of the page that are beyond end-of-file) before marking the page uptodate.  The current code
  can leave beyond-EOF page contents uninitialized, which makes these uninitialized page contents
  visible to userspace via mmap().  This is an information leak, but only affects systems which
  do not enable init-on-alloc (via CONFIG_INIT_ON_ALLOC_DEFAULT_ON=y or the corresponding kernel
  command line parameter).'
