  - CVE-2025-39689
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ftrace: Also
  allocate and copy hash for reading of filter files  Currently the reader of set_ftrace_filter
  and set_ftrace_notrace just adds the pointer to the global tracer hash to its iterator. Unlike
  the writer that allocates a copy of the hash, the reader keeps the pointer to the filter hashes.
  This is problematic because this pointer is static across function calls that release the
  locks that can update the global tracer hashes. This can cause UAF and similar bugs.  Allocate
  and copy the hash for reading the filter files like it is done for the writers. This not only
  fixes UAF bugs, but also makes the code a bit simpler as it doesn''t have to differentiate
  when to free the iterator''s hash between writers and readers.'
