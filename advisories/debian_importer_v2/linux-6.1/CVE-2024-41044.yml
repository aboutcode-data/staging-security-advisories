summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ppp: reject claimed-as-LCP
  but actually malformed packets  Since ''ppp_async_encode()'' assumes valid LCP packets (with
  code from 1 to 7 inclusive), add ''ppp_check_packet()'' to ensure that LCP packet has an actual
  body beyond PPP_LCP header bytes, and reject claimed-as-LCP but actually malformed data otherwise.'
