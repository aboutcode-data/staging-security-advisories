  - CVE-2025-21826
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: nf_tables:
  reject mismatching sum of field_len with set key length  The field length description provides
  the length of each separated key field in the concatenation, each field gets rounded up to
  32-bits to calculate the pipapo rule width from pipapo_init(). The set key length provides
  the total size of the key aligned to 32-bits.  Register-based arithmetics still allows for
  combining mismatching set key length and field length description, eg. set key length 10 and
  field description [ 5, 4 ] leading to pipapo width of 12.'
