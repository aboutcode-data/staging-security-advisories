summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ila: block BH
  in ila_output()  As explained in commit 1378817486d6 ("tipc: block BH before using dst_cache"),
  net/core/dst_cache.c helpers need to be called with BH disabled.  ila_output() is called from
  lwtunnel_output() possibly from process context, and under rcu_read_lock().  We might be interrupted
  by a softirq, re-enter ila_output() and corrupt dst_cache data structures.  Fix the race by
  using local_bh_disable().'
