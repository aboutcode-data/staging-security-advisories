summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/mm: Check
  return value from memblock_phys_alloc_range()  At least with CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START=0x100000,
  if there is < 4 MiB of contiguous free memory available at this point, the kernel will crash
  and burn because memblock_phys_alloc_range() returns 0 on failure, which leads memblock_phys_free()
  to throw the first 4 MiB of physical memory to the wolves.  At a minimum it should fail gracefully
  with a meaningful diagnostic, but in fact everything seems to work fine without the weird
  reserve allocation.'
