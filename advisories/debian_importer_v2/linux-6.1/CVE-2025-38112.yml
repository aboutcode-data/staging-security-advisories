summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: Fix TOCTOU
  issue in sk_is_readable()  sk->sk_prot->sock_is_readable is a valid function pointer when
  sk resides in a sockmap. After the last sk_psock_put() (which usually happens when socket
  is removed from sockmap), sk->sk_prot gets restored and sk->sk_prot->sock_is_readable becomes
  NULL.  This makes sk_is_readable() racy, if the value of sk->sk_prot is reloaded after the
  initial check. Which in turn may lead to a null pointer dereference.  Ensure the function
  pointer does not turn NULL after the check.'
