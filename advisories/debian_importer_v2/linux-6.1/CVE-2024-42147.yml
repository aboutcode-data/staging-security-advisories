  - CVE-2024-42147
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: hisilicon/debugfs
  - Fix debugfs uninit process issue  During the zip probe process, the debugfs failure does
  not stop the probe. When debugfs initialization fails, jumping to the error branch will also
  release regs, in addition to its own rollback operation.  As a result, it may be released
  repeatedly during the regs uninit process. Therefore, the null check needs to be added to
  the regs uninit process.'
