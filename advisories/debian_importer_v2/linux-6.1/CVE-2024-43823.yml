summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PCI: keystone:
  Fix NULL pointer dereference in case of DT error in ks_pcie_setup_rc_app_regs()  If IORESOURCE_MEM
  is not provided in Device Tree due to any error, resource_list_first_type() will return NULL
  and pci_parse_request_of_pci_ranges() will just emit a warning.  This will cause a NULL pointer
  dereference. Fix this bug by adding NULL return check.  Found by Linux Verification Center
  (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.'
