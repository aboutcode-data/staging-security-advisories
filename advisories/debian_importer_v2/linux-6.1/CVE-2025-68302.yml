summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: sxgbe: fix
  potential NULL dereference in sxgbe_rx()  Currently, when skb is null, the driver prints an
  error and then dereferences skb on the next line.  To fix this, let''s add a ''break'' after
  the error message to switch to sxgbe_rx_refill(), which is similar to the approach taken by
  the other drivers in this particular case, e.g. calxeda with xgmac_rx().  Found during a code
  review.'
