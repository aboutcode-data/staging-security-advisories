  - CVE-2024-47757
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix potential
  oob read in nilfs_btree_check_delete()  The function nilfs_btree_check_delete(), which checks
  whether degeneration to direct mapping occurs before deleting a b-tree entry, causes memory
  access outside the block buffer when retrieving the maximum key if the root node has no entries.  This
  does not usually happen because b-tree mappings with 0 child nodes are never created by mkfs.nilfs2
  or nilfs2 itself.  However, it can happen if the b-tree root node read from a device is configured
  that way, so fix this potential issue by adding a check for that case.'
