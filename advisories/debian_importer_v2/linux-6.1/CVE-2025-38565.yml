summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  perf/core: Exit
  early on perf_mmap() fail  When perf_mmap() fails to allocate a buffer, it still invokes the
  event_mapped() callback of the related event. On X86 this might increase the perf_rdpmc_allowed
  reference counter. But nothing undoes this as perf_mmap_close() is never called in this case,
  which causes another reference count leak.  Return early on failure to prevent that.'
