summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dmaengine: qcom:
  gpi: Fix memory leak in gpi_peripheral_config()  Fix a memory leak in gpi_peripheral_config()
  where the original memory pointed to by gchan->config could be lost if krealloc() fails.  The
  issue occurs when: 1. gchan->config points to previously allocated memory 2. krealloc() fails
  and returns NULL 3. The function directly assigns NULL to gchan->config, losing the    reference
  to the original memory 4. The original memory becomes unreachable and cannot be freed  Fix
  this by using a temporary variable to hold the krealloc() result and only updating gchan->config
  when the allocation succeeds.  Found via static analysis and code review.'
