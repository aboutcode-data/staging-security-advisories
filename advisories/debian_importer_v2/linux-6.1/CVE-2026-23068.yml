summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  spi: spi-sprd-adi:
  Fix double free in probe error path  The driver currently uses spi_alloc_host() to allocate
  the controller but registers it using devm_spi_register_controller().  If devm_register_restart_handler()
  fails, the code jumps to the put_ctlr label and calls spi_controller_put(). However, since
  the controller was registered via a devm function, the device core will automatically call
  spi_controller_put() again when the probe fails. This results in a double-free of the spi_controller
  structure.  Fix this by switching to devm_spi_alloc_host() and removing the manual spi_controller_put()
  call.'
