summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  libceph: make
  decode_pool() more resilient against corrupted osdmaps  If the osdmap is (maliciously) corrupted
  such that the encoded length of ceph_pg_pool envelope is less than what is expected for a
  particular encoding version, out-of-bounds reads may ensue because the only bounds check that
  is there is based on that length value.  This patch adds explicit bounds checks for each field
  that is decoded or skipped.'
