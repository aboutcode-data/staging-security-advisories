  - CVE-2025-37972
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Input: mtk-pmic-keys
  - fix possible null pointer dereference  In mtk_pmic_keys_probe, the regs parameter is only
  set if the button is parsed in the device tree. However, on hardware where the button is left
  floating, that node will most likely be removed not to enable that input. In that case the
  code will try to dereference a null pointer.  Let''s use the regs struct instead as it is
  defined for all supported platforms. Note that it is ok setting the key reg even if that latter
  is disabled as the interrupt won''t be enabled anyway.'
