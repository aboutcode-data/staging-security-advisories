summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: bcsp:
  receive data only if registered  Currently, bcsp_recv() can be called even when the BCSP protocol
  has not been registered. This leads to a NULL pointer dereference, as shown in the following
  stack trace:      KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000108-0x000000000000010f]     RIP:
