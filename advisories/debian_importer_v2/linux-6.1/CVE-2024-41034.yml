summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix kernel
  bug on rename operation of broken directory  Syzbot reported that in rename directory operation
  on broken directory on nilfs2, __block_write_begin_int() called to prepare block write may
  fail BUG_ON check for access exceeding the folio/page size.  This is because nilfs_dotdot(),
  which gets parent directory reference entry ("..") of the directory to be moved or renamed,
  does not check consistency enough, and may return location exceeding folio/page size for broken
  directories.  Fix this issue by checking required directory entries ("." and "..") in the
  first chunk of the directory in nilfs_dotdot().'
