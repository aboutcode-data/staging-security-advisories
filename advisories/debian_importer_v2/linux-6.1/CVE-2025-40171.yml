summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nvmet-fc: move
  lsop put work to nvmet_fc_ls_req_op  It’s possible for more than one async command to be in
  flight from __nvmet_fc_send_ls_req. For each command, a tgtport reference is taken.  In the
  current code, only one put work item is queued at a time, which results in a leaked reference.  To
  fix this, move the work item to the nvmet_fc_ls_req_op struct, which already tracks all resources
  related to the command.'
