summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sch_htb: make
  htb_qlen_notify() idempotent  htb_qlen_notify() always deactivates the HTB class and in fact
  could trigger a warning if it is already deactivated. Therefore, it is not idempotent and
  not friendly to its callers, like fq_codel_dequeue().  Let''s make it idempotent to ease qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog()
  callers'' life.'
