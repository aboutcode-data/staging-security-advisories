summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: nf_tables:
  fully validate NFT_DATA_VALUE on store to data registers  register store validation for NFT_DATA_VALUE
  is conditional, however, the datatype is always either NFT_DATA_VALUE or NFT_DATA_VERDICT.
  This only requires a new helper function to infer the register type from the set datatype
  so this conditional check can be removed. Otherwise, pointer to chain object can be leaked
  through the registers.'
