summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: cdns3: Fix
  deadlock when using NCM gadget  The cdns3 driver has the same NCM deadlock as fixed in cdnsp
  by commit 58f2fcb3a845 ("usb: cdnsp: Fix deadlock issue during using NCM gadget").  Under
  PREEMPT_RT the deadlock can be readily triggered by heavy network traffic, for example using
  "iperf --bidir" over NCM ethernet link.  The deadlock occurs because the threaded interrupt
  handler gets preempted by a softirq, but both are protected by the same spinlock. Prevent
  deadlock by disabling softirq during threaded irq handler.'
