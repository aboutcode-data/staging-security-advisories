  - CVE-2025-21736
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix possible
  int overflows in nilfs_fiemap()  Since nilfs_bmap_lookup_contig() in nilfs_fiemap() calculates
  its result by being prepared to go through potentially maxblocks == INT_MAX blocks, the value
  in n may experience an overflow caused by left shift of blkbits.  While it is extremely unlikely
  to occur, play it safe and cast right hand expression to wider type to mitigate the issue.  Found
  by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with static analysis tool SVACE.'
