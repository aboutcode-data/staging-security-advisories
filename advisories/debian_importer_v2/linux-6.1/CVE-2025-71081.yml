summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: stm32:
  sai: fix OF node leak on probe  The reference taken to the sync provider OF node when probing
  the platform device is currently only dropped if the set_sync() callback fails during DAI
  probe.  Make sure to drop the reference on platform probe failures (e.g. probe deferral) and
  on driver unbind.  This also avoids a potential use-after-free in case the DAI is ever reprobed
  without first rebinding the platform driver.'
