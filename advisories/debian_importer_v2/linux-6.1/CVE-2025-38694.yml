summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: dvb-frontends:
  dib7090p: fix null-ptr-deref in dib7090p_rw_on_apb()  In dib7090p_rw_on_apb, msg is controlled
  by user. When msg[0].buf is null and msg[0].len is zero, former checks on msg[0].buf would
  be passed. If accessing msg[0].buf[2] without sanity check, null pointer deref would happen.
  We add check on msg[0].len to prevent crash. Similar issue occurs when access msg[1].buf[0]
  and msg[1].buf[1].  Similar commit: commit 0ed554fd769a ("media: dvb-usb: az6027: fix null-ptr-deref
  in az6027_i2c_xfer()")'
