summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i40e: Fix potential
  invalid access when MAC list is empty  list_first_entry() never returns NULL - if the list
  is empty, it still returns a pointer to an invalid object, leading to potential invalid memory
  access when dereferenced.  Fix this by using list_first_entry_or_null instead of list_first_entry.'
