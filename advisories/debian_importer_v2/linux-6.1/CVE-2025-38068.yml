summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: lzo -
  Fix compression buffer overrun  Unlike the decompression code, the compression code in LZO
  never checked for output overruns.  It instead assumes that the caller always provides enough
  buffer space, disregarding the buffer length provided by the caller.  Add a safe compression
  interface that checks for the end of buffer before each write.  Use the safe interface in
  crypto/lzo.'
