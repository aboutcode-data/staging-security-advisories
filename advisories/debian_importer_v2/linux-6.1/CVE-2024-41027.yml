summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Fix userfaultfd_api
  to return EINVAL as expected  Currently if we request a feature that is not set in the Kernel
  config we fail silently and return all the available features.  However, the man page indicates
  we should return an EINVAL.  We need to fix this issue since we can end up with a Kernel warning
  should a program request the feature UFFD_FEATURE_WP_UNPOPULATED on a kernel with the config
  not set with this feature.   [  200.812896] WARNING: CPU: 91 PID: 13634 at mm/memory.c:1660
