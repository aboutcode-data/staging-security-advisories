summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: aic94xx:
  fix use-after-free in device removal path  The asd_pci_remove() function fails to synchronize
  with pending tasklets before freeing the asd_ha structure, leading to a potential use-after-free
  vulnerability.  When a device removal is triggered (via hot-unplug or module unload), race
  condition can occur.  The fix adds tasklet_kill() before freeing the asd_ha structure, ensuring
  all scheduled tasklets complete before cleanup proceeds.'
