  - CVE-2024-46716
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dmaengine: altera-msgdma:
  properly free descriptor in msgdma_free_descriptor  Remove list_del call in msgdma_chan_desc_cleanup,
  this should be the role of msgdma_free_descriptor. In consequence replace list_add_tail with
  list_move_tail in msgdma_free_descriptor.  This fixes the path:    msgdma_free_chan_resources
  -> msgdma_free_descriptors ->    msgdma_free_desc_list -> msgdma_free_descriptor  which does
  not correctly free the descriptors as first nodes were not removed from the list.'
