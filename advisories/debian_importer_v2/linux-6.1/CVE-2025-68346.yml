summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: dice: fix
  buffer overflow in detect_stream_formats()  The function detect_stream_formats() reads the
  stream_count value directly from a FireWire device without validating it. This can lead to
  out-of-bounds writes when a malicious device provides a stream_count value greater than MAX_STREAMS.  Fix
  by applying the same validation to both TX and RX stream counts in detect_stream_formats().'
