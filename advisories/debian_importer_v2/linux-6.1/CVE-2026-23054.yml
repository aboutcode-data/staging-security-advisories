summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: hv_netvsc:
  reject RSS hash key programming without RX indirection table  RSS configuration requires a
  valid RX indirection table. When the device reports a single receive queue, rndis_filter_device_add()
  does not allocate an indirection table, accepting RSS hash key updates in this state leads
  to a hang.  Fix this by gating netvsc_set_rxfh() on ndc->rx_table_sz and return -EOPNOTSUPP
  when the table is absent. This aligns set_rxfh with the device capabilities and prevents incorrect
  behavior.'
