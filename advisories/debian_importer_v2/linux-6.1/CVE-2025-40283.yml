summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: btusb:
  reorder cleanup in btusb_disconnect to avoid UAF  There is a KASAN: slab-use-after-free read
  in btusb_disconnect(). Calling "usb_driver_release_interface(&btusb_driver, data->intf)" will
  free the btusb data associated with the interface. The same data is then used later in the
  function, hence the UAF.  Fix by moving the accesses to btusb data to before the data is free''d.'
