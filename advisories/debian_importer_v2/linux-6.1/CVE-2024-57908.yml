summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iio: imu: kmx61:
  fix information leak in triggered buffer  The ''buffer'' local array is used to push data
  to user space from a triggered buffer, but it does not set values for inactive channels, as
  it only uses iio_for_each_active_channel() to assign new values.  Initialize the array to
  zero before using it to avoid pushing uninitialized information to userspace.'
