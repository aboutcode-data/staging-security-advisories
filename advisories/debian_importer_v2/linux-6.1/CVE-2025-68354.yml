summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  regulator: core:
  Protect regulator_supply_alias_list with regulator_list_mutex  regulator_supply_alias_list
  was accessed without any locking in regulator_supply_alias(), regulator_register_supply_alias(),
  and regulator_unregister_supply_alias(). Concurrent registration, unregistration and lookups
  can race, leading to:  1 use-after-free if an alias entry is removed while being read, 2 duplicate
  entries when two threads register the same alias, 3 inconsistent alias mappings observed by
  consumers.  Protect all traversals, insertions and deletions on regulator_supply_alias_list
  with the existing regulator_list_mutex.'
