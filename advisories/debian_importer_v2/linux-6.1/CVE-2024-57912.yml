summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iio: pressure:
  zpa2326: fix information leak in triggered buffer  The ''sample'' local struct is used to
  push data to user space from a triggered buffer, but it has a hole between the temperature
  and the timestamp (u32 pressure, u16 temperature, GAP, u64 timestamp). This hole is never
  initialized.  Initialize the struct to zero before using it to avoid pushing uninitialized
  information to userspace.'
