summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Squashfs: fix\
  \ uninit-value in squashfs_get_parent  Syzkaller reports a \"KMSAN: uninit-value in squashfs_get_parent\"\
  \ bug.  This is caused by open_by_handle_at() being called with a file handle containing an\
  \ invalid parent inode number.  In particular the inode number is that of a symbolic link,\
  \ rather than a directory.  Squashfs_get_parent() gets called with that symbolic link inode,\
  \ and accesses the parent member field.  \tunsigned int parent_ino = squashfs_i(inode)->parent;\
  \  Because non-directory inodes in Squashfs do not have a parent value, this is uninitialised,\
  \ and this causes an uninitialised value access.  The fix is to initialise parent with the\
  \ invalid inode 0, which will cause an EINVAL error to be returned.  Regular inodes used to\
  \ share the parent field with the block_list_start field.  This is removed in this commit\
  \ to enable the parent field to contain the invalid inode number 0."
