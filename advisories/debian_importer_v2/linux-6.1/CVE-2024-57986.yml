summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: core: Fix\
  \ assumption that Resolution Multipliers must be in Logical Collections  A report in 2019\
  \ by the syzbot fuzzer was found to be connected to two errors in the HID core associated\
  \ with Resolution Multipliers.  One of the errors was fixed by commit ea427a222d8b (\"HID:\
  \ core: Fix deadloop in hid_apply_multiplier.\"), but the other has not been fixed.  This\
  \ error arises because hid_apply_multipler() assumes that every Resolution Multiplier control\
  \ is contained in a Logical Collection, i.e., there's no way the routine can ever set multiplier_collection\
  \ to NULL.  This is in spite of the fact that the function starts with a big comment saying:\
  \  \t * \"The Resolution Multiplier control must be contained in the same \t * Logical Collection\
  \ as the control(s) to which it is to be applied. \t   ... \t *  If no Logical Collection\
  \ is \t * defined, the Resolution Multiplier is associated with all \t * controls in the report.\"\
  \ \t * HID Usage Table, v1.12, Section 4.3.1, p30 \t * \t * Thus, search from the current\
  \ collection upwards until we find a \t * logical collection...  The comment and the code\
  \ overlook the possibility that none of the collections found may be a Logical Collection.\
  \  The fix is to set the multiplier_collection pointer to NULL if the collection found isn't\
  \ a Logical Collection."
