summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: gadget:
  configfs: Fix OOB read on empty string write  When writing an empty string to either ''qw_sign''
  or ''landingPage'' sysfs attributes, the store functions attempt to access page[l - 1] before
  validating that the length ''l'' is greater than zero.  This patch fixes the vulnerability
  by adding a check at the beginning of os_desc_qw_sign_store() and webusb_landingPage_store()
  to handle the zero-length input case gracefully by returning immediately.'
