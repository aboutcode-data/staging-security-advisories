summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  filemap: Fix
  bounds checking in filemap_read()  If the caller supplies an iocb->ki_pos value that is close
  to the filesystem upper limit, and an iterator with a count that causes us to overflow that
  limit, then filemap_read() enters an infinite loop.  This behaviour was discovered when testing
  xfstests generic/525 with the "localio" optimisation for loopback NFS mounts.'
