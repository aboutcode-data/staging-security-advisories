summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  kernel/sys.c:
  fix the racy usage of task_lock(tsk->group_leader) in sys_prlimit64() paths  The usage of
  task_lock(tsk->group_leader) in sys_prlimit64()->do_prlimit() path is very broken.  sys_prlimit64()
  does get_task_struct(tsk) but this only protects task_struct itself. If tsk != current and
  tsk is not a leader, this process can exit/exec and task_lock(tsk->group_leader) may use the
  already freed task_struct.  Another problem is that sys_prlimit64() can race with mt-exec
  which changes ->group_leader. In this case do_prlimit() may take the wrong lock, or (worse)
  ->group_leader may change between task_lock() and task_unlock().  Change sys_prlimit64() to
  take tasklist_lock when necessary. This is not nice, but I don''t see a better fix for -stable.'
