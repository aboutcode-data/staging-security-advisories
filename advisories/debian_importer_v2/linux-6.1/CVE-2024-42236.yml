summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: gadget:
  configfs: Prevent OOB read/write in usb_string_copy()  Userspace provided string ''s'' could
  trivially have the length zero. Left unchecked this will firstly result in an OOB read in
  the form `if (str[0 - 1] == ''\n'') followed closely by an OOB write in the form `str[0 -
  1] = ''\0''`.  There is already a validating check to catch strings that are too long. Let''s
  supply an additional check for invalid strings that are too short.'
