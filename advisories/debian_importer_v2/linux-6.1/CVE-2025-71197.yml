summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  w1: therm: Fix
  off-by-one buffer overflow in alarms_store  The sysfs buffer passed to alarms_store() is allocated
  with ''size + 1'' bytes and a NUL terminator is appended. However, the ''size'' argument does
  not account for this extra byte. The original code then allocated ''size'' bytes and used
  strcpy() to copy ''buf'', which always writes one byte past the allocated buffer since strcpy()
  copies until the NUL terminator at index ''size''.  Fix this by parsing the ''buf'' parameter
  directly using simple_strtoll() without allocating any intermediate memory or string copying.
  This removes the overflow while simplifying the code.'
