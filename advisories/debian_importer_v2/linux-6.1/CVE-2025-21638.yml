  - CVE-2025-21638
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sctp: sysctl:
  auth_enable: avoid using current->nsproxy  As mentioned in a previous commit of this series,
  using the ''net'' structure via ''current'' is not recommended for different reasons:  - Inconsistency:
  getting info from the reader''s/writer''s netns vs only   from the opener''s netns.  - current->nsproxy
  can be NULL in some cases, resulting in an ''Oops''   (null-ptr-deref), e.g. when the current
  task is exiting, as spotted by   syzbot [1] using acct(2).  The ''net'' structure can be obtained
  from the table->data using container_of().  Note that table->data could also be used directly,
  but that would increase the size of this fix, while ''sctp.ctl_sock'' still needs to be retrieved
  from ''net'' structure.'
