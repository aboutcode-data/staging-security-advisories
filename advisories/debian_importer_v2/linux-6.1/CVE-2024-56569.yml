summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ftrace: Fix regression
  with module command in stack_trace_filter  When executing the following command:      # echo
  "write*:mod:ext3" > /sys/kernel/tracing/stack_trace_filter  The current mod command causes
  a null pointer dereference. While commit 0f17976568b3f ("ftrace: Fix regression with module
  command in stack_trace_filter") has addressed part of the issue, it left a corner case unhandled,
  which still results in a kernel crash.'
