summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  virtio-net: fix
  received length check in big packets  Since commit 4959aebba8c0 ("virtio-net: use mtu size
  as buffer length for big packets"), when guest gso is off, the allocated size for big packets
  is not MAX_SKB_FRAGS * PAGE_SIZE anymore but depends on negotiated MTU. The number of allocated
  frags for big packets is stored in vi->big_packets_num_skbfrags.  Because the host announced
  buffer length can be malicious (e.g. the host vhost_net driver''s get_rx_bufs is modified
  to announce incorrect length), we need a check in virtio_net receive path. Currently, the
  check is not adapted to the new change which can lead to NULL page pointer dereference in
  the below while loop when receiving length that is larger than the allocated one.  This commit
  fixes the received length check corresponding to the new change.'
