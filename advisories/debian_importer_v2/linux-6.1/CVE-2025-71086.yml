summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: rose: fix
  invalid array index in rose_kill_by_device()  rose_kill_by_device() collects sockets into
  a local array[] and then iterates over them to disconnect sockets bound to a device being
  brought down.  The loop mistakenly indexes array[cnt] instead of array[i]. For cnt < ARRAY_SIZE(array),
  this reads an uninitialized entry; for cnt == ARRAY_SIZE(array), it is an out-of-bounds read.
  Either case can lead to an invalid socket pointer dereference and also leaks references taken
  via sock_hold().  Fix the index to use i.'
