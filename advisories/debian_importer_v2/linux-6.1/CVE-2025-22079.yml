summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ocfs2: validate
  l_tree_depth to avoid out-of-bounds access  The l_tree_depth field is 16-bit (__le16), but
  the actual maximum depth is limited to OCFS2_MAX_PATH_DEPTH.  Add a check to prevent out-of-bounds
  access if l_tree_depth has an invalid value, which may occur when reading from a corrupted
  mounted disk [1].'
