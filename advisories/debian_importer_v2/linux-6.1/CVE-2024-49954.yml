  - CVE-2024-49954
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  static_call:
  Replace pointless WARN_ON() in static_call_module_notify()  static_call_module_notify() triggers
  a WARN_ON(), when memory allocation fails in __static_call_add_module().  That''s not really
  justified, because the failure case must be correctly handled by the well known call chain
  and the error code is passed through to the initiating userspace application.  A memory allocation
  fail is not a fatal problem, but the WARN_ON() takes the machine out when panic_on_warn is
  set.  Replace it with a pr_warn().'
