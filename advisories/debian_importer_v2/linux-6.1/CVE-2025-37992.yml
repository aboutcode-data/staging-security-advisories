  - CVE-2025-37992
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net_sched: Flush
  gso_skb list too during ->change()  Previously, when reducing a qdisc''s limit via the ->change()
  operation, only the main skb queue was trimmed, potentially leaving packets in the gso_skb
  list. This could result in NULL pointer dereference when we only check sch->limit against
  sch->q.qlen.  This patch introduces a new helper, qdisc_dequeue_internal(), which ensures
  both the gso_skb list and the main queue are properly flushed when trimming excess packets.
  All relevant qdiscs (codel, fq, fq_codel, fq_pie, hhf, pie) are updated to use this helper
  in their ->change() routines.'
