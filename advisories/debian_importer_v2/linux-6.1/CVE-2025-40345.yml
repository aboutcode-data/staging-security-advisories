summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: storage:
  sddr55: Reject out-of-bound new_pba  Discovered by Atuin - Automated Vulnerability Discovery
  Engine.  new_pba comes from the status packet returned after each write. A bogus device could
  report values beyond the block count derived from info->capacity, letting the driver walk
  off the end of pba_to_lba[] and corrupt heap memory.  Reject PBAs that exceed the computed
  block count and fail the transfer so we avoid touching out-of-range mapping entries.'
