summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sysctl: always
  initialize i_uid/i_gid  Always initialize i_uid/i_gid inside the sysfs core so set_ownership()
  can safely skip setting them.  Commit 5ec27ec735ba ("fs/proc/proc_sysctl.c: fix the default
  values of i_uid/i_gid on /proc/sys inodes.") added defaults for i_uid/i_gid when set_ownership()
  was not implemented. It also missed adjusting net_ctl_set_ownership() to use the same default
  values in case the computation of a better value failed.'
