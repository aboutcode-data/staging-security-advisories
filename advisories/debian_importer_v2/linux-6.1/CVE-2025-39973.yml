summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i40e: add validation
  for ring_len param  The `ring_len` parameter provided by the virtual function (VF) is assigned
  directly to the hardware memory context (HMC) without any validation.  To address this, introduce
  an upper boundary check for both Tx and Rx queue lengths. The maximum number of descriptors
  supported by the hardware is 8k-32. Additionally, enforce alignment constraints: Tx rings
  must be a multiple of 8, and Rx rings must be a multiple of 32.'
