summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netlabel: Fix
  NULL pointer exception caused by CALIPSO on IPv4 sockets  When calling netlbl_conn_setattr(),
  addr->sa_family is used to determine the function behavior. If sk is an IPv4 socket, but the
  connect function is called with an IPv6 address, the function calipso_sock_setattr() is triggered.
  Inside this function, the following code is executed:  sk_fullsock(__sk) ? inet_sk(__sk)->pinet6
  : NULL;  Since sk is an IPv4 socket, pinet6 is NULL, leading to a null pointer dereference.  This
  patch fixes the issue by checking if inet6_sk(sk) returns a NULL pointer before accessing
  pinet6.'
