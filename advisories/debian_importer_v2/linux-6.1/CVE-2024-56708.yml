  - CVE-2024-56708
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  EDAC/igen6: Avoid
  segmentation fault on module unload  The segmentation fault happens because:  During modprobe:
  1. In igen6_probe(), igen6_pvt will be allocated with kzalloc() 2. In igen6_register_mci(),
  mci->pvt_info will point to    &igen6_pvt->imc[mc]  During rmmod: 1. In mci_release() in edac_mc.c,
  it will kfree(mci->pvt_info) 2. In igen6_remove(), it will kfree(igen6_pvt);  Fix this issue
  by setting mci->pvt_info to NULL to avoid the double kfree.'
