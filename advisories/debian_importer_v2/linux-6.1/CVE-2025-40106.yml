  - CVE-2025-40106
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  comedi: fix divide-by-zero
  in comedi_buf_munge()  The comedi_buf_munge() function performs a modulo operation `async->munge_chan
  %= async->cmd.chanlist_len` without first checking if chanlist_len is zero. If a user program
  submits a command with chanlist_len set to zero, this causes a divide-by-zero error when the
  device processes data in the interrupt handler path.  Add a check for zero chanlist_len at
  the beginning of the function, similar to the existing checks for !map and CMDF_RAWDATA flag.
  When chanlist_len is zero, update munge_count and return early, indicating the data was handled
  without munging.  This prevents potential kernel panics from malformed user commands.'
