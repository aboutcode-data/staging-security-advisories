summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net_sched: sch_sfq:
  fix a potential crash on gso_skb handling  SFQ has an assumption of always being able to queue
  at least one packet.  However, after the blamed commit, sch->q.len can be inflated by packets
  in sch->gso_skb, and an enqueue() on an empty SFQ qdisc can be followed by an immediate drop.  Fix
  sfq_drop() to properly clear q->tail in this situation.   ip netns add lb ip link add dev
