  - CVE-2025-68777
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Input: ti_am335x_tsc
  - fix off-by-one error in wire_order validation  The current validation ''wire_order[i] >
  ARRAY_SIZE(config_pins)'' allows wire_order[i] to equal ARRAY_SIZE(config_pins), which causes
  out-of-bounds access when used as index in ''config_pins[wire_order[i]]''.  Since config_pins
  has 4 elements (indices 0-3), the valid range for wire_order should be 0-3. Fix the off-by-one
  error by using >= instead of > in the validation check.'
