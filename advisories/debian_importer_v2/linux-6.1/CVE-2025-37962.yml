summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ksmbd: fix memory
  leak in parse_lease_state()  The previous patch that added bounds check for create lease context
  introduced a memory leak. When the bounds check fails, the function returns NULL without freeing
  the previously allocated lease_ctx_info structure.  This patch fixes the issue by adding kfree(lreq)
  before returning NULL in both boundary check cases.'
