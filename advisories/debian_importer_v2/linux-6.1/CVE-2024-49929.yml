summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: iwlwifi:
  mvm: avoid NULL pointer dereference  iwl_mvm_tx_skb_sta() and iwl_mvm_tx_mpdu() verify that
  the mvmvsta pointer is not NULL. It retrieves this pointer using iwl_mvm_sta_from_mac80211,
  which is dereferencing the ieee80211_sta pointer. If sta is NULL, iwl_mvm_sta_from_mac80211
  will dereference a NULL pointer. Fix this by checking the sta pointer before retrieving the
  mvmsta from it. If sta is not NULL, then mvmsta isn''t either.'
