summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: fec: remove
  .ndo_poll_controller to avoid deadlocks  There is a deadlock issue found in sungem driver,
  please refer to the commit ac0a230f719b ("eth: sungem: remove .ndo_poll_controller to avoid
  deadlocks"). The root cause of the issue is that netpoll is in atomic context and disable_irq()
  is called by .ndo_poll_controller interface of sungem driver, however, disable_irq() might
  sleep. After analyzing the implementation of fec_poll_controller(), the fec driver should
  have the same issue. Due to the fec driver uses NAPI for TX completions, the .ndo_poll_controller
  is unnecessary to be implemented in the fec driver, so fec_poll_controller() can be safely
  removed.'
