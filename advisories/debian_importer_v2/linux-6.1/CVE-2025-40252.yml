summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: qlogic/qede:
  fix potential out-of-bounds read in qede_tpa_cont() and qede_tpa_end()  The loops in ''qede_tpa_cont()''
  and ''qede_tpa_end()'', iterate over ''cqe->len_list[]'' using only a zero-length terminator
  as the stopping condition. If the terminator was missing or malformed, the loop could run
  past the end of the fixed-size array.  Add an explicit bound check using ARRAY_SIZE() in both
  loops to prevent a potential out-of-bounds access.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org)
  with SVACE.'
