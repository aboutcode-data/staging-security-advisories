summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amdgpu: Fix
  NULL pointer dereference in VRAM logic for APU devices  Previously, APU platforms (and other
  scenarios with uninitialized VRAM managers) triggered a NULL pointer dereference in `ttm_resource_manager_usage()`.
  The root cause is not that the `struct ttm_resource_manager *man` pointer itself is NULL,
  but that `man->bdev` (the backing device pointer within the manager) remains uninitialized
  (NULL) on APUs—since APUs lack dedicated VRAM and do not fully set up VRAM manager structures.
  When `ttm_resource_manager_usage()` attempts to acquire `man->bdev->lru_lock`, it dereferences
  the NULL `man->bdev`, leading to a kernel OOPS.  1. **amdgpu_cs.c**: Extend the existing bandwidth
  control check in    `amdgpu_cs_get_threshold_for_moves()` to include a check for    `ttm_resource_manager_used()`.
  If the manager is not used (uninitialized    `bdev`), return 0 for migration thresholds immediately—skipping
  VRAM-specific    logic that would trigger the NULL dereference.  2. **amdgpu_kms.c**: Update
  the `AMDGPU_INFO_VRAM_USAGE` ioctl and memory info    reporting to use a conditional: if the
  manager is used, return the real VRAM    usage; otherwise, return 0. This avoids accessing
  `man->bdev` when it is    NULL.  3. **amdgpu_virt.c**: Modify the vf2pf (virtual function
  to physical function)    data write path. Use `ttm_resource_manager_used()` to check validity:
  if the    manager is usable, calculate `fb_usage` from VRAM usage; otherwise, set    `fb_usage`
  to 0 (APUs have no discrete framebuffer to report).  This approach is more robust than APU-specific
  checks because it: - Works for all scenarios where the VRAM manager is uninitialized (not
  just APUs), - Aligns with TTM''s design by using its native helper function, - Preserves correct
  behavior for discrete GPUs (which have fully initialized   `man->bdev` and pass the `ttm_resource_manager_used()`
  check).  v4: use ttm_resource_manager_used(&adev->mman.vram_mgr.manager) instead of checking
  the adev->gmc.is_app_apu flag (Christian)'
