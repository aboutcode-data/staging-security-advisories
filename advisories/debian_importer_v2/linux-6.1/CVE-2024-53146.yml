summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  NFSD: Prevent
  a potential integer overflow  If the tag length is >= U32_MAX - 3 then the "length + 4" addition
  can result in an integer overflow. Address this by splitting the decoding into several steps
  so that decode_cb_compound4res() does not have to perform arithmetic on the unsafe length
  value.'
