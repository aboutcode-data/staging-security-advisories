summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ptp: Ensure info->enable
  callback is always set  The ioctl and sysfs handlers unconditionally call the ->enable callback.
  Not all drivers implement that callback, leading to NULL dereferences. Example of affected
  drivers: ptp_s390.c, ptp_vclock.c and ptp_mock.c.  Instead use a dummy callback if no better
  was specified by the driver.'
