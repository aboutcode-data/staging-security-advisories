  - CVE-2024-57798
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/dp_mst: Ensure
  mst_primary pointer is valid in drm_dp_mst_handle_up_req()  While receiving an MST up request
  message from one thread in drm_dp_mst_handle_up_req(), the MST topology could be removed from
  another thread via drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr_set_mst(false), freeing mst_primary and setting
  drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr::mst_primary to NULL. This could lead to a NULL deref/use-after-free
  of mst_primary in drm_dp_mst_handle_up_req().  Avoid the above by holding a reference for
  mst_primary in drm_dp_mst_handle_up_req() while it''s used.  v2: Fix kfreeing the request
  if getting an mst_primary reference fails.'
