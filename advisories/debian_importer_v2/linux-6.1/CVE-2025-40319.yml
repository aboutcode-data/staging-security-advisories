summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Sync pending
  IRQ work before freeing ring buffer  Fix a race where irq_work can be queued in bpf_ringbuf_commit()
  but the ring buffer is freed before the work executes. In the syzbot reproducer, a BPF program
  attached to sched_switch triggers bpf_ringbuf_commit(), queuing an irq_work. If the ring buffer
  is freed before this work executes, the irq_work thread may accesses freed memory. Calling
  `irq_work_sync(&rb->work)` ensures that all pending irq_work complete before freeing the buffer.'
