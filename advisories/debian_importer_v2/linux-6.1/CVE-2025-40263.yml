summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Input: cros_ec_keyb
  - fix an invalid memory access  If cros_ec_keyb_register_matrix() isn''t called (due to `buttons_switches_only`)
  in cros_ec_keyb_probe(), `ckdev->idev` remains NULL.  An invalid memory access is observed
  in cros_ec_keyb_process() when receiving an EC_MKBP_EVENT_KEY_MATRIX event in cros_ec_keyb_work()
  in such case.    Unable to handle kernel read from unreadable memory at virtual address 0000000000000028   ...   x3
  : 0000000000000000 x2 : 0000000000000000   x1 : 0000000000000000 x0 : 0000000000000000   Call
  trace:   input_event   cros_ec_keyb_work   blocking_notifier_call_chain   ec_irq_thread  It''s
  still unknown about why the kernel receives such malformed event, in any cases, the kernel
  shouldn''t access `ckdev->idev` and friends if the driver doesn''t intend to initialize them.'
