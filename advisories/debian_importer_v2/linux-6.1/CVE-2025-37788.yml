summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cxgb4: fix memory
  leak in cxgb4_init_ethtool_filters() error path  In the for loop used to allocate the loc_array
  and bmap for each port, a memory leak is possible when the allocation for loc_array succeeds,
  but the allocation for bmap fails. This is because when the control flow goes to the label
  free_eth_finfo, only the allocations starting from (i-1)th iteration are freed.  Fix that
  by freeing the loc_array in the bmap allocation error path.'
