  - CVE-2025-40062
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: hisilicon/qm
  - set NULL to qm->debug.qm_diff_regs  When the initialization of qm->debug.acc_diff_reg fails,
  the probe process does not exit. However, after qm->debug.qm_diff_regs is freed, it is not
  set to NULL. This can lead to a double free when the remove process attempts to free it again.
  Therefore, qm->debug.qm_diff_regs should be set to NULL after it is freed.'
