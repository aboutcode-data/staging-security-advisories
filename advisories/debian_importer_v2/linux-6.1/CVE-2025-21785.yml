summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  arm64: cacheinfo:
  Avoid out-of-bounds write to cacheinfo array  The loop that detects/populates cache information
  already has a bounds check on the array size but does not account for cache levels with separate
  data/instructions cache. Fix this by incrementing the index for any populated leaf (instead
  of any populated level).'
