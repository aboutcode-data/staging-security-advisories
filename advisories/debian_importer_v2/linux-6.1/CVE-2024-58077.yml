  - CVE-2024-58077
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: soc-pcm:
  don''t use soc_pcm_ret() on .prepare callback  commit 1f5664351410 ("ASoC: lower "no backend
  DAIs enabled for ... Port" log severity") ignores -EINVAL error message on common soc_pcm_ret().
  It is used from many functions, ignoring -EINVAL is over-kill.  The reason why -EINVAL was
  ignored was it really should only be used upon invalid parameters coming from userspace and
  in that case we don''t want to log an error since we do not want to give userspace a way to
  do a denial-of-service attack on the syslog / diskspace.  So don''t use soc_pcm_ret() on .prepare
  callback is better idea.'
