summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mmc: davinci:
  Don''t strip remove function when driver is builtin  Using __exit for the remove function
  results in the remove callback being discarded with CONFIG_MMC_DAVINCI=y. When such a device
  gets unbound (e.g. using sysfs or hotplug), the driver is just removed without the cleanup
  being performed. This results in resource leaks. Fix it by compiling in the remove callback
  unconditionally.  This also fixes a W=1 modpost warning:  WARNING: modpost: drivers/mmc/host/davinci_mmc:
  section mismatch in reference: davinci_mmcsd_driver+0x10 (section: .data) -> davinci_mmcsd_remove
  (section: .exit.text)'
