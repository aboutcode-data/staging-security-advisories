summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vsock/virtio:
  Validate length in packet header before skb_put()  When receiving a vsock packet in the guest,
  only the virtqueue buffer size is validated prior to virtio_vsock_skb_rx_put(). Unfortunately,
  virtio_vsock_skb_rx_put() uses the length from the packet header as the length argument to
  skb_put(), potentially resulting in SKB overflow if the host has gone wonky.  Validate the
  length as advertised by the packet header before calling virtio_vsock_skb_rx_put().'
