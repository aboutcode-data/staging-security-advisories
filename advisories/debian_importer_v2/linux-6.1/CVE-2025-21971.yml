  - CVE-2025-21971
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net_sched: Prevent
  creation of classes with TC_H_ROOT  The function qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() uses TC_H_ROOT
  as a termination condition when traversing up the qdisc tree to update parent backlog counters.
  However, if a class is created with classid TC_H_ROOT, the traversal terminates prematurely
  at this class instead of reaching the actual root qdisc, causing parent statistics to be incorrectly
  maintained. In case of DRR, this could lead to a crash as reported by Mingi Cho.  Prevent
  the creation of any Qdisc class with classid TC_H_ROOT (0xFFFFFFFF) across all qdisc types,
  as suggested by Jamal.'
