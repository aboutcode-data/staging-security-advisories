summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring/eventfd:
  ensure io_eventfd_signal() defers another RCU period  io_eventfd_do_signal() is invoked from
  an RCU callback, but when dropping the reference to the io_ev_fd, it calls io_eventfd_free()
  directly if the refcount drops to zero. This isn''t correct, as any potential freeing of the
  io_ev_fd should be deferred another RCU grace period.  Just call io_eventfd_put() rather than
  open-code the dec-and-test and free, which will correctly defer it another RCU grace period.'
