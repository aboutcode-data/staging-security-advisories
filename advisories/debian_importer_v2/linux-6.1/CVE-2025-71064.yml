summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: hns3: using
  the num_tqps in the vf driver to apply for resources  Currently, hdev->htqp is allocated using
  hdev->num_tqps, and kinfo->tqp is allocated using kinfo->num_tqps. However, kinfo->num_tqps
  is set to min(new_tqps, hdev->num_tqps);  Therefore, kinfo->num_tqps may be smaller than hdev->num_tqps,
  which causes some hdev->htqp[i] to remain uninitialized in hclgevf_knic_setup().  Thus, this
  patch allocates hdev->htqp and kinfo->tqp using hdev->num_tqps, ensuring that the lengths
  of hdev->htqp and kinfo->tqp are consistent and that all elements are properly initialized.'
