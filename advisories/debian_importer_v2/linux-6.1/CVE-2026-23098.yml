summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netrom: fix double-free
  in nr_route_frame()  In nr_route_frame(), old_skb is immediately freed without checking if
  nr_neigh->ax25 pointer is NULL. Therefore, if nr_neigh->ax25 is NULL, the caller function
  will free old_skb again, causing a double-free bug.  Therefore, to prevent this, we need to
  modify it to check whether nr_neigh->ax25 is NULL before freeing old_skb.'
