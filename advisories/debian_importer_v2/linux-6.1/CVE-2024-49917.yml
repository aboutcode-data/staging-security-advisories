summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display:
  Add NULL check for clk_mgr and clk_mgr->funcs in dcn30_init_hw  This commit addresses a potential
  null pointer dereference issue in the `dcn30_init_hw` function. The issue could occur when
  `dc->clk_mgr` or `dc->clk_mgr->funcs` is null.  The fix adds a check to ensure `dc->clk_mgr`
  and `dc->clk_mgr->funcs` is not null before accessing its functions. This prevents a potential
  null pointer dereference.  Reported by smatch: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/hwss/dcn30/dcn30_hwseq.c:789
  dcn30_init_hw() error: we previously assumed ''dc->clk_mgr'' could be null (see line 628)'
