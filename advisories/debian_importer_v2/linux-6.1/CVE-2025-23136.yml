summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  thermal: int340x:
  Add NULL check for adev  Not all devices have an ACPI companion fwnode, so adev might be NULL.
  This is similar to the commit cd2fd6eab480 ("platform/x86: int3472: Check for adev == NULL").  Add
  a check for adev not being set and return -ENODEV in that case to avoid a possible NULL pointer
  deref in int3402_thermal_probe().  Note, under the same directory, int3400_thermal_probe()
  has such a check.  [ rjw: Subject edit, added Fixes: ]'
