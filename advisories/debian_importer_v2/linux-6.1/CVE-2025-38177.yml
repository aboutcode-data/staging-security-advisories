  - CVE-2025-38177
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sch_hfsc: make
  hfsc_qlen_notify() idempotent  hfsc_qlen_notify() is not idempotent either and not friendly
  to its callers, like fq_codel_dequeue(). Let''s make it idempotent to ease qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog()
  callers'' life:  1. update_vf() decreases cl->cl_nactive, so we can check whether it is non-zero
  before calling it.  2. eltree_remove() always removes RB node cl->el_node, but we can use    RB_EMPTY_NODE()
  + RB_CLEAR_NODE() to make it safe.'
