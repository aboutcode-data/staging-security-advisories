summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  uacce: fix cdev
  handling in the cleanup path  When cdev_device_add fails, it internally releases the cdev
  memory, and if cdev_device_del is then executed, it will cause a hang error. To fix it, we
  check the return value of cdev_device_add() and clear uacce->cdev to avoid calling cdev_device_del
  in the uacce_remove.'
