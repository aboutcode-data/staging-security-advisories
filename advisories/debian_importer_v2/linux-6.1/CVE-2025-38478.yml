summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  comedi: Fix initialization
  of data for instructions that write to subdevice  Some Comedi subdevice instruction handlers
  are known to access instruction data elements beyond the first `insn->n` elements in some
  cases.  The `do_insn_ioctl()` and `do_insnlist_ioctl()` functions allocate at least `MIN_SAMPLES`
  (16) data elements to deal with this, but they do not initialize all of that.  For Comedi
  instruction codes that write to the subdevice, the first `insn->n` data elements are copied
  from user-space, but the remaining elements are left uninitialized.  That could be a problem
  if the subdevice instruction handler reads the uninitialized data.  Ensure that the first
  `MIN_SAMPLES` elements are initialized before calling these instruction handlers, filling
  the uncopied elements with 0.  For `do_insnlist_ioctl()`, the same data buffer elements are
  used for handling a list of instructions, so ensure the first `MIN_SAMPLES` elements are initialized
  for each instruction that writes to the subdevice.'
