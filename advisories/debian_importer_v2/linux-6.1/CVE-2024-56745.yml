  - CVE-2024-56745
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PCI: Fix reset_method_store()
  memory leak  In reset_method_store(), a string is allocated via kstrndup() and assigned to
  the local "options". options is then used in with strsep() to find spaces:    while ((name
  = strsep(&options, " ")) != NULL) {  If there are no remaining spaces, then options is set
  to NULL by strsep(), so the subsequent kfree(options) doesn''t free the memory allocated via
  kstrndup().  Fix by using a separate tmp_options to iterate with strsep() so options is preserved.'
