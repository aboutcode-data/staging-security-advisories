summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: brcm80211:
  fmac: Add error handling for brcmf_usb_dl_writeimage()  The function brcmf_usb_dl_writeimage()
  calls the function brcmf_usb_dl_cmd() but dose not check its return value. The ''state.state''
  and the ''state.bytes'' are uninitialized if the function brcmf_usb_dl_cmd() fails. It is
  dangerous to use uninitialized variables in the conditions.  Add error handling for brcmf_usb_dl_cmd()
  to jump to error handling path if the brcmf_usb_dl_cmd() fails and the ''state.state'' and
  the ''state.bytes'' are uninitialized.  Improve the error message to report more detailed
  error information.'
