summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ACPICA: Refuse
  to evaluate a method if arguments are missing  As reported in [1], a platform firmware update
  that increased the number of method parameters and forgot to update a least one of its callers,
  caused ACPICA to crash due to use-after-free.  Since this a result of a clear AML issue that
  arguably cannot be fixed up by the interpreter (it cannot produce missing data out of thin
  air), address it by making ACPICA refuse to evaluate a method if the caller attempts to pass
  fewer arguments than expected to it.'
