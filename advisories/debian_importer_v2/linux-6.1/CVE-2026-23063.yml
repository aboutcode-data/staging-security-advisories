  - CVE-2026-23063
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  uacce: ensure
  safe queue release with state management  Directly calling `put_queue` carries risks since
  it cannot guarantee that resources of `uacce_queue` have been fully released beforehand. So
  adding a `stop_queue` operation for the UACCE_CMD_PUT_Q command and leaving the `put_queue`
  operation to the final resource release ensures safety.  Queue states are defined as follows:
  - UACCE_Q_ZOMBIE: Initial state - UACCE_Q_INIT: After opening `uacce` - UACCE_Q_STARTED: After
  `start` is issued via `ioctl`  When executing `poweroff -f` in virt while accelerator are
  still working, `uacce_fops_release` and `uacce_remove` may execute concurrently. This can
  cause `uacce_put_queue` within `uacce_fops_release` to access a NULL `ops` pointer. Therefore,
  add state checks to prevent accessing freed pointers.'
