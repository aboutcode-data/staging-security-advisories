summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  firmware: cs_dsp:\
  \ Fix overflow checking of wmfw header  Fix the checking that firmware file buffer is large\
  \ enough for the wmfw header, to prevent overrunning the buffer.  The original code tested\
  \ that the firmware data buffer contained enough bytes for the sums of the size of the structs\
  \  \twmfw_header + wmfw_adsp1_sizes + wmfw_footer  But wmfw_adsp1_sizes is only used on ADSP1\
  \ firmware. For ADSP2 and Halo Core the equivalent struct is wmfw_adsp2_sizes, which is 4\
  \ bytes longer. So the length check didn't guarantee that there are enough bytes in the firmware\
  \ buffer for a header with wmfw_adsp2_sizes.  This patch splits the length check into three\
  \ separate parts. Each of the wmfw_header, wmfw_adsp?_sizes and wmfw_footer are checked separately\
  \ before they are used."
