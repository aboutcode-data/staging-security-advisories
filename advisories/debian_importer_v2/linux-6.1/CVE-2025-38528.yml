summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Reject %p%
  format string in bprintf-like helpers  static const char fmt[] = "%p%";     bpf_trace_printk(fmt,
  sizeof(fmt));  The above BPF program isn''t rejected and causes a kernel warning at runtime:      Please
  remove unsupported %\x00 in format string     WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 7244 at lib/vsprintf.c:2680
  format_decode+0x49c/0x5d0  This happens because bpf_bprintf_prepare skips over the second
  %, detected as punctuation, while processing %p. This patch fixes it by not skipping over
  punctuation. %\x00 is then processed in the next iteration and rejected.'
