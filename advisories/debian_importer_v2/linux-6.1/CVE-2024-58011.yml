  - CVE-2024-58011
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  platform/x86:
  int3472: Check for adev == NULL  Not all devices have an ACPI companion fwnode, so adev might
  be NULL. This can e.g. (theoretically) happen when a user manually binds one of the int3472
  drivers to another i2c/platform device through sysfs.  Add a check for adev not being set
  and return -ENODEV in that case to avoid a possible NULL pointer deref in skl_int3472_get_acpi_buffer().'
