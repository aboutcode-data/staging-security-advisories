summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  filelock: Remove
  locks reliably when fcntl/close race is detected  When fcntl_setlk() races with close(), it
  removes the created lock with do_lock_file_wait(). However, LSMs can allow the first do_lock_file_wait()
  that created the lock while denying the second do_lock_file_wait() that tries to remove the
  lock. Separately, posix_lock_file() could also fail to remove a lock due to GFP_KERNEL allocation
  failure (when splitting a range in the middle).  After the bug has been triggered, use-after-free
  reads will occur in lock_get_status() when userspace reads /proc/locks. This can likely be
  used to read arbitrary kernel memory, but can''t corrupt kernel memory.  Fix it by calling
  locks_remove_posix() instead, which is designed to reliably get rid of POSIX locks associated
  with the given file and files_struct and is also used by filp_flush().'
