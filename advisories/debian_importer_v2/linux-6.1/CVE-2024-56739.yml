summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rtc: check if
  __rtc_read_time was successful in rtc_timer_do_work()  If the __rtc_read_time call fails,,
  the struct rtc_time tm; may contain uninitialized data, or an illegal date/time read from
  the RTC hardware.  When calling rtc_tm_to_ktime later, the result may be a very large value
  (possibly KTIME_MAX). If there are periodic timers in rtc->timerqueue, they will continually
  expire, may causing kernel softlockup.'
