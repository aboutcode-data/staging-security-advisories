  - CVE-2025-68168
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  jfs: fix uninitialized
  waitqueue in transaction manager  The transaction manager initialization in txInit() was not
  properly initializing TxBlock[0].waitor waitqueue, causing a crash when txEnd(0) is called
  on read-only filesystems.  When a filesystem is mounted read-only, txBegin() returns tid=0
  to indicate no transaction. However, txEnd(0) still gets called and tries to access TxBlock[0].waitor
  via tid_to_tblock(0), but this waitqueue was never initialized because the initialization
  loop started at index 1 instead of 0.  This causes a ''non-static key'' lockdep warning and
  system crash:   INFO: trying to register non-static key in txEnd  Fix by ensuring all transaction
  blocks including TxBlock[0] have their waitqueues properly initialized during txInit().'
