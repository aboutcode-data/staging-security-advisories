summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cpufreq: scmi:
  Fix null-ptr-deref in scmi_cpufreq_get_rate()  cpufreq_cpu_get_raw() can return NULL when
  the target CPU is not present in the policy->cpus mask. scmi_cpufreq_get_rate() does not check
  for this case, which results in a NULL pointer dereference.  Add NULL check after cpufreq_cpu_get_raw()
  to prevent this issue.'
