summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: elx: libefc:
  Fix potential use after free in efc_nport_vport_del()  The kref_put() function will call nport->release
  if the refcount drops to zero.  The nport->release release function is _efc_nport_free() which
  frees "nport".  But then we dereference "nport" on the next line which is a use after free.  Re-order
  these lines to avoid the use after free.'
