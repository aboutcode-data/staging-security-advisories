summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/vmwgfx: Fix
  a null-ptr access in the cursor snooper  Check that the resource which is converted to a surface
  exists before trying to use the cursor snooper on it.  vmw_cmd_res_check allows explicit invalid
  (SVGA3D_INVALID_ID) identifiers because some svga commands accept SVGA3D_INVALID_ID to mean
  "no surface", unfortunately functions that accept the actual surfaces as objects might (and
  in case of the cursor snooper, do not) be able to handle null objects. Make sure that we validate
  not only the identifier (via the vmw_cmd_res_check) but also check that the actual resource
  exists before trying to do something with it.  Fixes unchecked null-ptr reference in the snooping
  code.'
