summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: streamzap:
  fix race between device disconnection and urb callback  Syzkaller has reported a general protection
  fault at function ir_raw_event_store_with_filter(). This crash is caused by a NULL pointer
  dereference of dev->raw pointer, even though it is checked for NULL in the same function,
  which means there is a race condition. It occurs due to the incorrect order of actions in
  the streamzap_disconnect() function: rc_unregister_device() is called before usb_kill_urb().
  The dev->raw pointer is freed and set to NULL in rc_unregister_device(), and only after that
  usb_kill_urb() waits for in-progress requests to finish.  If rc_unregister_device() is called
  while streamzap_callback() handler is not finished, this can lead to accessing freed resources.
  Thus rc_unregister_device() should be called after usb_kill_urb().  Found by Linux Verification
  Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.'
