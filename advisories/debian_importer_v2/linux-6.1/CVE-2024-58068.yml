summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  OPP: fix dev_pm_opp_find_bw_*()
  when bandwidth table not initialized  If a driver calls dev_pm_opp_find_bw_ceil/floor() the
  retrieve bandwidth from the OPP table but the bandwidth table was not created because the
  interconnect properties were missing in the OPP consumer node, the kernel will crash with:  Unable
  to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000004 ... pc : _read_bw+0x8/0x10
  lr : _opp_table_find_key+0x9c/0x174 ... Call trace:   _read_bw+0x8/0x10 (P)   _opp_table_find_key+0x9c/0x174
  (L)   _find_key+0x98/0x168   dev_pm_opp_find_bw_ceil+0x50/0x88 ...  In order to fix the crash,
  create an assert function to check if the bandwidth table was created before trying to get
  a bandwidth with _read_bw().'
