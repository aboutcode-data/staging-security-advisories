summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  printk: Fix signed
  integer overflow when defining LOG_BUF_LEN_MAX  Shifting 1 << 31 on a 32-bit int causes signed
  integer overflow, which leads to undefined behavior. To prevent this, cast 1 to u32 before
  performing the shift, ensuring well-defined behavior.  This change explicitly avoids any potential
  overflow by ensuring that the shift occurs on an unsigned 32-bit integer.'
