summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/mdiobus:
  Fix potential out-of-bounds read/write access  When using publicly available tools like ''mdio-tools''
  to read/write data from/to network interface and its PHY via mdiobus, there is no verification
  of parameters passed to the ioctl and it accepts any mdio address. Currently there is support
  for 32 addresses in kernel via PHY_MAX_ADDR define, but it is possible to pass higher value
  than that via ioctl. While read/write operation should generally fail in this case, mdiobus
  provides stats array, where wrong address may allow out-of-bounds read/write.  Fix that by
  adding address verification before read/write operation. While this excludes this access from
  any statistics, it improves security of read/write operation.'
