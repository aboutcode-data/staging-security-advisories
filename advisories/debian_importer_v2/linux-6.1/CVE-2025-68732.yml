summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gpu: host1x:
  Fix race in syncpt alloc/free  Fix race condition between host1x_syncpt_alloc() and host1x_syncpt_put()
  by using kref_put_mutex() instead of kref_put() + manual mutex locking.  This ensures no thread
  can acquire the syncpt_mutex after the refcount drops to zero but before syncpt_release acquires
  it. This prevents races where syncpoints could be allocated while still being cleaned up from
  a previous release.  Remove explicit mutex locking in syncpt_release as kref_put_mutex() handles
  this atomically.'
