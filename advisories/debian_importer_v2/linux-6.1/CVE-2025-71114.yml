summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  via_wdt: fix
  critical boot hang due to unnamed resource allocation  The VIA watchdog driver uses allocate_resource()
  to reserve a MMIO region for the watchdog control register. However, the allocated resource
  was not given a name, which causes the kernel resource tree to contain an entry marked as
  "<BAD>" under /proc/iomem on x86 platforms.  During boot, this unnamed resource can lead to
  a critical hang because subsequent resource lookups and conflict checks fail to handle the
  invalid entry properly.'
