summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: ieee802154:
  do not leave a dangling sk pointer in ieee802154_create()  sock_init_data() attaches the allocated
  sk object to the provided sock object. If ieee802154_create() fails later, the allocated sk
  object is freed, but the dangling pointer remains in the provided sock object, which may allow
  use-after-free.  Clear the sk pointer in the sock object on error.'
