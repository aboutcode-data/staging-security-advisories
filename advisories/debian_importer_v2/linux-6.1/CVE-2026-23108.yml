summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: usb_8dev:
  usb_8dev_read_bulk_callback(): fix URB memory leak  Fix similar memory leak as in commit 7352e1d5932a
  ("can: gs_usb: gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): fix URB memory leak").  In usb_8dev_open()
  -> usb_8dev_start(), the URBs for USB-in transfers are allocated, added to the priv->rx_submitted
  anchor and submitted. In the complete callback usb_8dev_read_bulk_callback(), the URBs are
  processed and resubmitted. In usb_8dev_close() -> unlink_all_urbs() the URBs are freed by
  calling usb_kill_anchored_urbs(&priv->rx_submitted).  However, this does not take into account
  that the USB framework unanchors the URB before the complete function is called. This means
  that once an in-URB has been completed, it is no longer anchored and is ultimately not released
  in usb_kill_anchored_urbs().  Fix the memory leak by anchoring the URB in the usb_8dev_read_bulk_callback()
  to the priv->rx_submitted anchor.'
