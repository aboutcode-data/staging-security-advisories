summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix missing
  cleanup on rollforward recovery error  In an error injection test of a routine for mount-time
  recovery, KASAN found a use-after-free bug.  It turned out that if data recovery was performed
  using partial logs created by dsync writes, but an error occurred before starting the log
  writer to create a recovered checkpoint, the inodes whose data had been recovered were left
  in the ns_dirty_files list of the nilfs object and were not freed.  Fix this issue by cleaning
  up inodes that have read the recovery data if the recovery routine fails midway before the
  log writer starts.'
