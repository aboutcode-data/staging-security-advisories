summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: fix timer
  use-after-free on failed mount  Syzbot has found an ODEBUG bug in ext4_fill_super  The del_timer_sync
  function cancels the s_err_report timer, which reminds about filesystem errors daily. We should
  guarantee the timer is no longer active before kfree(sbi).  When filesystem mounting fails,
  the flow goes to failed_mount3, where an error occurs when ext4_stop_mmpd is called, causing
  a read I/O failure. This triggers the ext4_handle_error function that ultimately re-arms the
  timer, leaving the s_err_report timer active before kfree(sbi) is called.  Fix the issue by
  canceling the s_err_report timer after calling ext4_stop_mmpd.'
