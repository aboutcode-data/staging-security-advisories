  - CVE-2025-40176
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tls: wait for
  pending async decryptions if tls_strp_msg_hold fails  Async decryption calls tls_strp_msg_hold
  to create a clone of the input skb to hold references to the memory it uses. If we fail to
  allocate that clone, proceeding with async decryption can lead to various issues (UAF on the
  skb, writing into userspace memory after the recv() call has returned).  In this case, wait
  for all pending decryption requests.'
