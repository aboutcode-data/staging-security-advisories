summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: rtl818x:
  rtl8187: Fix potential buffer underflow in rtl8187_rx_cb()  The rtl8187_rx_cb() calculates
  the rx descriptor header address by subtracting its size from the skb tail pointer. However,
  it does not validate if the received packet (skb->len from urb->actual_length) is large enough
  to contain this header.  If a truncated packet is received, this will lead to a buffer underflow,
  reading memory before the start of the skb data area, and causing a kernel panic.  Add length
  checks for both rtl8187 and rtl8187b descriptor headers before attempting to access them,
  dropping the packet cleanly if the check fails.'
