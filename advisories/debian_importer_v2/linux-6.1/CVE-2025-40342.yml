summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nvme-fc: use
  lock accessing port_state and rport state  nvme_fc_unregister_remote removes the remote port
  on a lport object at any point in time when there is no active association. This races with
  with the reconnect logic, because nvme_fc_create_association is not taking a lock to check
  the port_state and atomically increase the active count on the rport.'
