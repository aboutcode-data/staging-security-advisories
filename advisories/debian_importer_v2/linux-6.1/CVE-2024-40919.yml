summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bnxt_en: Adjust
  logging of firmware messages in case of released token in __hwrm_send()  In case of token
  is released due to token->state == BNXT_HWRM_DEFERRED, released token (set to NULL) is used
  in log messages. This issue is expected to be prevented by HWRM_ERR_CODE_PF_UNAVAILABLE error
  code. But this error code is returned by recent firmware. So some firmware may not return
  it. This may lead to NULL pointer dereference. Adjust this issue by adding token pointer check.  Found
  by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.'
