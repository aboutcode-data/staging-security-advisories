summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/msm: Avoid
  NULL dereference in msm_disp_state_print_regs()  If the allocation in msm_disp_state_dump_regs()
  failed then `block->state` can be NULL. The msm_disp_state_print_regs() function _does_ have
  code to try to handle it with:    if (*reg)     dump_addr = *reg;  ...but since "dump_addr"
  is initialized to NULL the above is actually a noop. The code then goes on to dereference
  `dump_addr`.  Make the function print "Registers not stored" when it sees a NULL to solve
  this. Since we''re touching the code, fix msm_disp_state_print_regs() not to pointlessly take
  a double-pointer and properly mark the pointer as `const`.  Patchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/619657/'
