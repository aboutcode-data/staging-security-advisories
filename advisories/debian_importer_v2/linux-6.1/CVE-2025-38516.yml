summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  pinctrl: qcom:
  msm: mark certain pins as invalid for interrupts  On some platforms, the UFS-reset pin has
  no interrupt logic in TLMM but is nevertheless registered as a GPIO in the kernel. This enables
  the user-space to trigger a BUG() in the pinctrl-msm driver by running, for example: `gpiomon
  -c 0 113` on RB2.  The exact culprit is requesting pins whose intr_detection_width setting
  is not 1 or 2 for interrupts. This hits a BUG() in msm_gpio_irq_set_type(). Potentially crashing
  the kernel due to an invalid request from user-space is not optimal, so let''s go through
  the pins and mark those that would fail the check as invalid for the irq chip as we should
  not even register them as available irqs.  This function can be extended if we determine that
  there are more corner-cases like this.'
