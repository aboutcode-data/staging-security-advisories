summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ksmbd: Fix refcount
  leak when invalid session is found on session lookup  When a session is found but its state
  is not SMB2_SESSION_VALID, It indicates that no valid session was found, but it is missing
  to decrement the reference count acquired by the session lookup, which results in a reference
  count leak. This patch fixes the issue by explicitly calling ksmbd_user_session_put to release
  the reference to the session.'
