summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  page_pool: always
  add GFP_NOWARN for ATOMIC allocations  Driver authors often forget to add GFP_NOWARN for page
  allocation from the datapath. This is annoying to users as OOMs are a fact of life, and we
  pretty much expect network Rx to hit page allocation failures during OOM. Make page pool add
  GFP_NOWARN for ATOMIC allocations by default.'
