summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/rose: prevent
  integer overflows in rose_setsockopt()  In case of possible unpredictably large arguments
  passed to rose_setsockopt() and multiplied by extra values on top of that, integer overflows
  may occur.  Do the safest minimum and fix these issues by checking the contents of ''opt''
  and returning -EINVAL if they are too large. Also, switch to unsigned int and remove useless
  check for negative ''opt'' in ROSE_IDLE case.'
