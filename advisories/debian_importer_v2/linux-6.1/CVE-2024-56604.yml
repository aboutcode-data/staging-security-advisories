summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: RFCOMM:
  avoid leaving dangling sk pointer in rfcomm_sock_alloc()  bt_sock_alloc() attaches allocated
  sk object to the provided sock object. If rfcomm_dlc_alloc() fails, we release the sk object,
  but leave the dangling pointer in the sock object, which may cause use-after-free.  Fix this
  by swapping calls to bt_sock_alloc() and rfcomm_dlc_alloc().'
