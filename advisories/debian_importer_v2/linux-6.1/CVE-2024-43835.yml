summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  virtio_net: Fix\
  \ napi_skb_cache_put warning  After the commit bdacf3e34945 (\"net: Use nested-BH locking\
  \ for napi_alloc_cache.\") was merged, the following warning began to appear:  \t WARNING:\
  \ CPU: 5 PID: 1 at net/core/skbuff.c:1451 napi_skb_cache_put+0x82/0x4b0  \t  __warn+0x12f/0x340\

  \ \t  handle_bug+0x3d/0x80 \t  exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x50 \t  asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x20 \t\

  \ \t  __free_old_xmit+0x1c8/0x510 \t  __pfx___free_old_xmit+0x10/0x10  The issue arises because\
  \ virtio is assuming it's running in NAPI context even when it's not, such as in the netpoll\
  \ case.  To resolve this, modify virtnet_poll_tx() to only set NAPI when budget is available.\
  \ Same for virtnet_poll_cleantx(), which always assumed that it was in a NAPI context."
