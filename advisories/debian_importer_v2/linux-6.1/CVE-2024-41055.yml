summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm: prevent derefencing
  NULL ptr in pfn_section_valid()  Commit 5ec8e8ea8b77 ("mm/sparsemem: fix race in accessing
  memory_section->usage") changed pfn_section_valid() to add a READ_ONCE() call around "ms->usage"
  to fix a race with section_deactivate() where ms->usage can be cleared.  The READ_ONCE() call,
  by itself, is not enough to prevent NULL pointer dereference.  We need to check its value
  before dereferencing it.'
