summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gtp: fix a potential
  NULL pointer dereference  When sockfd_lookup() fails, gtp_encap_enable_socket() returns a
  NULL pointer, but its callers only check for error pointers thus miss the NULL pointer case.  Fix
  it by returning an error pointer with the error code carried from sockfd_lookup().  (I found
  this bug during code inspection.)'
