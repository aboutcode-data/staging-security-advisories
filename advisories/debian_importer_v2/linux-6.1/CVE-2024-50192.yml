summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  irqchip/gic-v4:
  Don''t allow a VMOVP on a dying VPE  Kunkun Jiang reported that there is a small window of
  opportunity for userspace to force a change of affinity for a VPE while the VPE has already
  been unmapped, but the corresponding doorbell interrupt still visible in /proc/irq/.  Plug
  the race by checking the value of vmapp_count, which tracks whether the VPE is mapped ot not,
  and returning an error in this case.  This involves making vmapp_count common to both GICv4.1
  and its v4.0 ancestor.'
