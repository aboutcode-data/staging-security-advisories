summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gpio: pca953x:
  fix pca953x_irq_bus_sync_unlock race  Ensure that `i2c_lock'' is held when setting interrupt
  latch and mask in pca953x_irq_bus_sync_unlock() in order to avoid races.  The other (non-probe)
  call site pca953x_gpio_set_multiple() ensures the lock is held before calling pca953x_write_regs().  The
  problem occurred when a request raced against irq_bus_sync_unlock() approximately once per
  thousand reboots on an i.MX8MP based system.   * Normal case     0-0022: write register AI|3a
