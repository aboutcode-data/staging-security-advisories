summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nvmet: always
  initialize cqe.result  The spec doesn''t mandate that the first two double words (aka results)
  for the command queue entry need to be set to 0 when they are not used (not specified). Though,
  the target implemention returns 0 for TCP and FC but not for RDMA.  Let''s make RDMA behave
  the same and thus explicitly initializing the result field. This prevents leaking any data
  from the stack.'
