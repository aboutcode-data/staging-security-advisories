summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/sched: Abort
  __tc_modify_qdisc if parent class does not exist  Lion''s patch [1] revealed an ancient bug
  in the qdisc API. Whenever a user creates/modifies a qdisc specifying as a parent another
  qdisc, the qdisc API will, during grafting, detect that the user is not trying to attach to
  a class and reject. However grafting is performed after qdisc_create (and thus the qdiscs''
  init callback) is executed. In qdiscs that eventually call qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog during
  init or change (such as fq, hhf, choke, etc), an issue arises. For example, executing the
  following commands:  sudo tc qdisc add dev lo root handle a: htb default 2 sudo tc qdisc add
  dev lo parent a: handle beef fq  Qdiscs such as fq, hhf, choke, etc unconditionally invoke
  qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() in their control path init() or change() which then causes a failure
  to find the child class; however, that does not stop the unconditional invocation of the assumed
  child qdisc''s qlen_notify with a null class. All these qdiscs make the assumption that class
  is non-null.  The solution is ensure that qdisc_leaf() which looks up the parent class, and
  is invoked prior to qdisc_create(), should return failure on not finding the class. In this
  patch, we leverage qdisc_leaf to return ERR_PTRs whenever the parentid doesn''t correspond
  to a class, so that we can detect it earlier on and abort before qdisc_create is called.  [1]
