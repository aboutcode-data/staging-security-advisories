summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: venus:
  hfi: add check to handle incorrect queue size  qsize represents size of shared queued between
  driver and video firmware. Firmware can modify this value to an invalid large value. In such
  situation, empty_space will be bigger than the space actually available. Since new_wr_idx
  is not checked, so the following code will result in an OOB write. ... qsize = qhdr->q_size  if
  (wr_idx >= rd_idx)  empty_space = qsize - (wr_idx - rd_idx) .... if (new_wr_idx < qsize) {  memcpy(wr_ptr,
  packet, dwords << 2) --> OOB write  Add check to ensure qsize is within the allocated size
  while reading and writing packets into the queue.'
