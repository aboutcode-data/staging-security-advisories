summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/bnxt_re:
  Fix a bug while setting up Level-2 PBL pages  Avoid memory corruption while setting up Level-2
  PBL pages for the non MR resources when num_pages > 256K.  There will be a single PDE page
  address (contiguous pages in the case of > PAGE_SIZE), but, current logic assumes multiple
  pages, leading to invalid memory access after 256K PBL entries in the PDE.'
