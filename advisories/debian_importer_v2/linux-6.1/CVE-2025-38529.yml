summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  comedi: aio_iiro_16:\
  \ Fix bit shift out of bounds  When checking for a supported IRQ number, the following test\
  \ is used:  \tif ((1 << it->options[1]) & 0xdcfc) {  However, `it->options[i]` is an unchecked\
  \ `int` value from userspace, so the shift amount could be negative or out of bounds.  Fix\
  \ the test by requiring `it->options[1]` to be within bounds before proceeding with the original\
  \ test.  Valid `it->options[1]` values that select the IRQ will be in the range [1,15]. The\
  \ value 0 explicitly disables the use of interrupts."
