summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  regmap: Fix race
  condition in hwspinlock irqsave routine  Previously, the address of the shared member ''&map->spinlock_flags''
  was passed directly to ''hwspin_lock_timeout_irqsave''. This creates a race condition where
  multiple contexts contending for the lock could overwrite the shared flags variable, potentially
  corrupting the state for the current lock owner.  Fix this by using a local stack variable
  ''flags'' to store the IRQ state temporarily.'
