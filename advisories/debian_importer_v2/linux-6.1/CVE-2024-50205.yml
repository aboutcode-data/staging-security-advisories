summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: firewire-lib:
  Avoid division by zero in apply_constraint_to_size()  The step variable is initialized to
  zero. It is changed in the loop, but if it''s not changed it will remain zero. Add a variable
  check before the division.  The observed behavior was introduced by commit 826b5de90c0b ("ALSA:
  firewire-lib: fix insufficient PCM rule for period/buffer size"), and it is difficult to show
  that any of the interval parameters will satisfy the snd_interval_test() condition with data
  from the amdtp_rate_table[] table.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org)
  with SVACE.'
