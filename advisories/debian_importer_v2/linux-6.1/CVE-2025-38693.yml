summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: dvb-frontends:
  w7090p: fix null-ptr-deref in w7090p_tuner_write_serpar and w7090p_tuner_read_serpar  In w7090p_tuner_write_serpar,
  msg is controlled by user. When msg[0].buf is null and msg[0].len is zero, former checks on
  msg[0].buf would be passed. If accessing msg[0].buf[2] without sanity check, null pointer
  deref would happen. We add check on msg[0].len to prevent crash.  Similar commit: commit 0ed554fd769a
  ("media: dvb-usb: az6027: fix null-ptr-deref in az6027_i2c_xfer()")'
