summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: typec: ucsi:
  displayport: Fix deadlock  This patch introduces the ucsi_con_mutex_lock / ucsi_con_mutex_unlock
  functions to the UCSI driver. ucsi_con_mutex_lock ensures the connector mutex is only locked
  if a connection is established and the partner pointer is valid. This resolves a deadlock
  scenario where ucsi_displayport_remove_partner holds con->mutex waiting for dp_altmode_work
  to complete while dp_altmode_work attempts to acquire it.'
