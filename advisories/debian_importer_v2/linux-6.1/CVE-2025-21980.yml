  - CVE-2025-21980
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sched: address
  a potential NULL pointer dereference in the GRED scheduler.  If kzalloc in gred_init returns
  a NULL pointer, the code follows the error handling path, invoking gred_destroy. This, in
  turn, calls gred_offload, where memset could receive a NULL pointer as input, potentially
  leading to a kernel crash.  When table->opt is NULL in gred_init(), gred_change_table_def()
  is not called yet, so it is not necessary to call ->ndo_setup_tc() in gred_offload().'
