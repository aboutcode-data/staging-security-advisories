summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: pcm: Fix
  race of buffer access at PCM OSS layer  The PCM OSS layer tries to clear the buffer with the
  silence data at initialization (or reconfiguration) of a stream with the explicit call of
  snd_pcm_format_set_silence() with runtime->dma_area.  But this may lead to a UAF because the
  accessed runtime->dma_area might be freed concurrently, as it''s performed outside the PCM
  ops.  For avoiding it, move the code into the PCM core and perform it inside the buffer access
  lock, so that it won''t be changed during the operation.'
