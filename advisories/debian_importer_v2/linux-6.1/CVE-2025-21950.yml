summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drivers: virt:
  acrn: hsm: Use kzalloc to avoid info leak in pmcmd_ioctl  In the "pmcmd_ioctl" function, three
  memory objects allocated by kmalloc are initialized by "hcall_get_cpu_state", which are then
  copied to user space. The initializer is indeed implemented in "acrn_hypercall2" (arch/x86/include/asm/acrn.h).
  There is a risk of information leakage due to uninitialized bytes.'
