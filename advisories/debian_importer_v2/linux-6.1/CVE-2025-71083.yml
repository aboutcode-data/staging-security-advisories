summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/ttm: Avoid
  NULL pointer deref for evicted BOs  It is possible for a BO to exist that is not currently
  associated with a resource, e.g. because it has been evicted.  When devcoredump tries to read
  the contents of all BOs for dumping, we need to expect this as well -- in this case, ENODATA
  is recorded instead of the buffer contents.'
