summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netlink: Fix\
  \ wraparounds of sk->sk_rmem_alloc.  Netlink has this pattern in some places    if (atomic_read(&sk->sk_rmem_alloc)\
  \ > sk->sk_rcvbuf)   \tatomic_add(skb->truesize, &sk->sk_rmem_alloc);  , which has the same\
  \ problem fixed by commit 5a465a0da13e (\"udp: Fix multiple wraparounds of sk->sk_rmem_alloc.\"\
  ).  For example, if we set INT_MAX to SO_RCVBUFFORCE, the condition is always false as the\
  \ two operands are of int.  Then, a single socket can eat as many skb as possible until OOM\
  \ happens, and we can see multiple wraparounds of sk->sk_rmem_alloc.  Let's fix it by using\
  \ atomic_add_return() and comparing the two variables as unsigned int.  Before:   [root@fedora\
  \ ~]# ss -f netlink   Recv-Q      Send-Q Local Address:Port                Peer Address:Port\
