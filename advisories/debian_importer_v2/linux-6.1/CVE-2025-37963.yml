summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  arm64: bpf: Only
  mitigate cBPF programs loaded by unprivileged users  Support for eBPF programs loaded by unprivileged
  users is typically disabled. This means only cBPF programs need to be mitigated for BHB.  In
  addition, only mitigate cBPF programs that were loaded by an unprivileged user. Privileged
  users can also load the same program via eBPF, making the mitigation pointless.'
