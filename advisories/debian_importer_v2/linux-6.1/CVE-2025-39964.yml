  - CVE-2025-39964
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: af_alg
  - Disallow concurrent writes in af_alg_sendmsg  Issuing two writes to the same af_alg socket
  is bogus as the data will be interleaved in an unpredictable fashion.  Furthermore, concurrent
  writes may create inconsistencies in the internal socket state.  Disallow this by adding a
  new ctx->write field that indiciates exclusive ownership for writing.'
