  - CVE-2024-47705
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  block: fix potential
  invalid pointer dereference in blk_add_partition  The blk_add_partition() function initially
  used a single if-condition (IS_ERR(part)) to check for errors when adding a partition. This
  was modified to handle the specific case of -ENXIO separately, allowing the function to proceed
  without logging the error in this case. However, this change unintentionally left a path where
  md_autodetect_dev() could be called without confirming that part is a valid pointer.  This
  commit separates the error handling logic by splitting the initial if-condition, improving
  code readability and handling specific error scenarios explicitly. The function now distinguishes
  the general error case from -ENXIO without altering the existing behavior of md_autodetect_dev()
  calls.'
