  - CVE-2026-23060
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: authencesn
  - reject too-short AAD (assoclen<8) to match ESP/ESN spec  authencesn assumes an ESP/ESN-formatted
  AAD. When assoclen is shorter than the minimum expected length, crypto_authenc_esn_decrypt()
  can advance past the end of the destination scatterlist and trigger a NULL pointer dereference
  in scatterwalk_map_and_copy(), leading to a kernel panic (DoS).  Add a minimum AAD length
  check to fail fast on invalid inputs.'
