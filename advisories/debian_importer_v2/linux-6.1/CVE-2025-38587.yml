summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ipv6: fix possible
  infinite loop in fib6_info_uses_dev()  fib6_info_uses_dev() seems to rely on RCU without an
  explicit protection.  Like the prior fix in rt6_nlmsg_size(), we need to make sure fib6_del_route()
  or fib6_add_rt2node() have not removed the anchor from the list, or we risk an infinite loop.'
