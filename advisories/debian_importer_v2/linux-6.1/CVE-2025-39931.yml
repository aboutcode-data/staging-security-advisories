  - CVE-2025-39931
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: af_alg
  - Set merge to zero early in af_alg_sendmsg  If an error causes af_alg_sendmsg to abort, ctx->merge
  may contain a garbage value from the previous loop.  This may then trigger a crash on the
  next entry into af_alg_sendmsg when it attempts to do a merge that can''t be done.  Fix this
  by setting ctx->merge to zero near the start of the loop.'
