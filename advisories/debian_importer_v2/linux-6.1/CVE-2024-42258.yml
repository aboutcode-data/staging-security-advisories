summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm: huge_memory:
  use !CONFIG_64BIT to relax huge page alignment on 32 bit machines  Yves-Alexis Perez reported
  commit 4ef9ad19e176 ("mm: huge_memory: don''t force huge page alignment on 32 bit") didn''t
  work for x86_32 [1].  It is because x86_32 uses CONFIG_X86_32 instead of CONFIG_32BIT.  !CONFIG_64BIT
  should cover all 32 bit machines.  [1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/CAHbLzkr1LwH3pcTgM+aGQ31ip2bKqiqEQ8=FQB+t2c3dhNKNHA@mail.gmail.com/'
