summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: qat -
  flush misc workqueue during device shutdown  Repeated loading and unloading of a device specific
  QAT driver, for example qat_4xxx, in a tight loop can lead to a crash due to a use-after-free
  scenario. This occurs when a power management (PM) interrupt triggers just before the device-specific
  driver (e.g., qat_4xxx.ko) is unloaded, while the core driver (intel_qat.ko) remains loaded.  Since
  the driver uses a shared workqueue (`qat_misc_wq`) across all devices and owned by intel_qat.ko,
  a deferred routine from the device-specific driver may still be pending in the queue. If this
  routine executes after the driver is unloaded, it can dereference freed memory, resulting
  in a page fault and kernel crash like the following:      BUG: unable to handle page fault
  for address: ffa000002e50a01c     #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode     RIP: 0010:pm_bh_handler+0x1d2/0x250
  [intel_qat]     Call Trace:       pm_bh_handler+0x1d2/0x250 [intel_qat]       process_one_work+0x171/0x340       worker_thread+0x277/0x3a0       kthread+0xf0/0x120       ret_from_fork+0x2d/0x50  To
  prevent this, flush the misc workqueue during device shutdown to ensure that all pending work
  items are completed before the driver is unloaded.  Note: This approach may slightly increase
  shutdown latency if the workqueue contains jobs from other devices, but it ensures correctness
  and stability.'
