summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  atm: clip: Fix
  memory leak of struct clip_vcc.  ioctl(ATMARP_MKIP) allocates struct clip_vcc and set it to
  vcc->user_back.  The code assumes that vcc_destroy_socket() passes NULL skb to vcc->push()
  when the socket is close()d, and then clip_push() frees clip_vcc.  However, ioctl(ATMARPD_CTRL)
  sets NULL to vcc->push() in atm_init_atmarp(), resulting in memory leak.  Let''s serialise
  two ioctl() by lock_sock() and check vcc->push() in atm_init_atmarp() to prevent memleak.'
