summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  char: applicom:
  fix NULL pointer dereference in ac_ioctl  Discovered by Atuin - Automated Vulnerability Discovery
  Engine.  In ac_ioctl, the validation of IndexCard and the check for a valid RamIO pointer
  are skipped when cmd is 6. However, the function unconditionally executes readb(apbs[IndexCard].RamIO
  + VERS) at the end.  If cmd is 6, IndexCard may reference a board that does not exist (where
  RamIO is NULL), leading to a NULL pointer dereference.  Fix this by skipping the readb access
  when cmd is 6, as this command is a global information query and does not target a specific
  board context.'
