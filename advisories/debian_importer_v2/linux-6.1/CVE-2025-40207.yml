summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: v4l2-subdev:
  Fix alloc failure check in v4l2_subdev_call_state_try()  v4l2_subdev_call_state_try() macro
  allocates a subdev state with __v4l2_subdev_state_alloc(), but does not check the returned
  value. If __v4l2_subdev_state_alloc fails, it returns an ERR_PTR, and that would cause v4l2_subdev_call_state_try()
  to crash.  Add proper error handling to v4l2_subdev_call_state_try().'
