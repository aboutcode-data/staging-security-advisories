summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: xilinx_can:
  xcan_write_frame(): fix use-after-free of transmitted SKB  can_put_echo_skb() takes ownership
  of the SKB and it may be freed during or after the call.  However, xilinx_can xcan_write_frame()
  keeps using SKB after the call.  Fix that by only calling can_put_echo_skb() after the code
  is done touching the SKB.  The tx_lock is held for the entire xcan_write_frame() execution
  and also on the can_get_echo_skb() side so the order of operations does not matter.  An earlier
  fix commit 3d3c817c3a40 ("can: xilinx_can: Fix usage of skb memory") did not move the can_put_echo_skb()
  call far enough.  [mkl: add "commit" in front of sha1 in patch description] [mkl: fix indention]'
