  - CVE-2025-38712
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  hfsplus: don''t
  use BUG_ON() in hfsplus_create_attributes_file()  When the volume header contains erroneous
  values that do not reflect the actual state of the filesystem, hfsplus_fill_super() assumes
  that the attributes file is not yet created, which later results in hitting BUG_ON() when
  hfsplus_create_attributes_file() is called. Replace this BUG_ON() with -EIO error with a message
  to suggest running fsck tool.'
