summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  staging: rtl8723bs:
  fix out-of-bounds read in rtw_get_ie() parser  The Information Element (IE) parser rtw_get_ie()
  trusted the length byte of each IE without validating that the IE body (len bytes after the
  2-byte header) fits inside the remaining frame buffer. A malformed frame can advertise an
  IE length larger than the available data, causing the parser to increment its pointer beyond
  the buffer end. This results in out-of-bounds reads or, depending on the pattern, an infinite
  loop.  Fix by validating that (offset + 2 + len) does not exceed the limit before accepting
  the IE or advancing to the next element.  This prevents OOB reads and ensures the parser terminates
  safely on malformed frames.'
