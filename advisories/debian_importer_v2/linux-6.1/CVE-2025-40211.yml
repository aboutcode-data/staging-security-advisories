summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ACPI: video:
  Fix use-after-free in acpi_video_switch_brightness()  The switch_brightness_work delayed work
  accesses device->brightness and device->backlight, freed by acpi_video_dev_unregister_backlight()
  during device removal.  If the work executes after acpi_video_bus_unregister_backlight() frees
  these resources, it causes a use-after-free when acpi_video_switch_brightness() dereferences
  device->brightness or device->backlight.  Fix this by calling cancel_delayed_work_sync() for
  each device''s switch_brightness_work in acpi_video_bus_remove_notify_handler() after removing
  the notify handler that queues the work. This ensures the work completes before the memory
  is freed.  [ rjw: Changelog edit ]'
