  Check null pointers before using dc->clk_mgr  [WHY & HOW] dc->clk_mgr is null checked previously
  in the same function, indicating it might be null.  Passing "dc" to "dc->hwss.apply_idle_power_optimizations",
  which dereferences null "dc->clk_mgr". (The function pointer resolves to "dcn35_apply_idle_power_optimizations".)  This
