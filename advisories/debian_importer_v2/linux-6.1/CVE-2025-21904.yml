  - CVE-2025-21904
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  caif_virtio:
  fix wrong pointer check in cfv_probe()  del_vqs() frees virtqueues, therefore cfv->vq_tx pointer
  should be checked for NULL before calling it, not cfv->vdev. Also the current implementation
  is redundant because the pointer cfv->vdev is dereferenced before it is checked for NULL.  Fix
  this by checking cfv->vq_tx for NULL instead of cfv->vdev before calling del_vqs().'
