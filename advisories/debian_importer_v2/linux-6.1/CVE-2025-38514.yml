summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rxrpc: Fix oops
  due to non-existence of prealloc backlog struct  If an AF_RXRPC service socket is opened and
  bound, but calls are preallocated, then rxrpc_alloc_incoming_call() will oops because the
  rxrpc_backlog struct doesn''t get allocated until the first preallocation is made.  Fix this
  by returning NULL from rxrpc_alloc_incoming_call() if there is no backlog struct.  This will
  cause the incoming call to be aborted.'
