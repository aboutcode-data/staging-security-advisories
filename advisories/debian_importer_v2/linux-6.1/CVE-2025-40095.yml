summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: gadget:
  f_rndis: Refactor bind path to use __free()  After an bind/unbind cycle, the rndis->notify_req
  is left stale. If a subsequent bind fails, the unified error label attempts to free this stale
  request, leading to a NULL pointer dereference when accessing ep->ops->free_request.  Refactor
  the error handling in the bind path to use the __free() automatic cleanup mechanism.'
