summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cpufreq/longhaul:
  handle NULL policy in longhaul_exit  longhaul_exit() was calling cpufreq_cpu_get(0) without
  checking for a NULL policy pointer. On some systems, this could lead to a NULL dereference
  and a kernel warning or panic.  This patch adds a check using unlikely() and returns early
  if the policy is NULL.  Bugzilla: #219962'
