summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  comedi: pcl818:
  fix null-ptr-deref in pcl818_ai_cancel()  Syzbot identified an issue [1] in pcl818_ai_cancel(),
  which stems from the fact that in case of early device detach via pcl818_detach(), subdevice
  dev->read_subdev may not have initialized its pointer to &struct comedi_async as intended.
  Thus, any such dereferencing of &s->async->cmd will lead to general protection fault and kernel
  crash.  Mitigate this problem by removing a call to pcl818_ai_cancel() from pcl818_detach()
  altogether. This way, if the subdevice setups its support for async commands, everything async-related
  will be handled via subdevice''s own ->cancel() function in comedi_device_detach_locked()
  even before pcl818_detach(). If no support for asynchronous commands is provided, there is
  no need to cancel anything either.  [1] Syzbot crash: Oops: general protection fault, probably
