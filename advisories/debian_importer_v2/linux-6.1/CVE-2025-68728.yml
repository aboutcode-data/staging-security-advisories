summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ntfs3: fix uninit
  memory after failed mi_read in mi_format_new  Fix a KMSAN un-init bug found by syzkaller.  ntfs_get_bh()
  expects a buffer from sb_getblk(), that buffer may not be uptodate. We do not bring the buffer
  uptodate before setting it as uptodate. If the buffer were to not be uptodate, it could mean
  adding a buffer with un-init data to the mi record. Attempting to load that record will trigger
  KMSAN.  Avoid this by setting the buffer as uptodate, if it’s not already, by overwriting
  it.'
