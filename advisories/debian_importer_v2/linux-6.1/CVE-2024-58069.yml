summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rtc: pcf85063:
  fix potential OOB write in PCF85063 NVMEM read  The nvmem interface supports variable buffer
  sizes, while the regmap interface operates with fixed-size storage. If an nvmem client uses
  a buffer size less than 4 bytes, regmap_read will write out of bounds as it expects the buffer
  to point at an unsigned int.  Fix this by using an intermediary unsigned int to hold the value.'
