summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mptcp: pm: fix
  ID 0 endp usage after multiple re-creations  ''local_addr_used'' and ''add_addr_accepted''
  are decremented for addresses not related to the initial subflow (ID0), because the source
  and destination addresses of the initial subflows are known from the beginning: they don''t
  count as "additional local address being used" or "ADD_ADDR being accepted".  It is then required
  not to increment them when the entrypoint used by the initial subflow is removed and re-added
  during a connection. Without this modification, this entrypoint cannot be removed and re-added
  more than once.'
