  - CVE-2025-37885
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: x86: Reset
  IRTE to host control if *new* route isn''t postable  Restore an IRTE back to host control
  (remapped or posted MSI mode) if the *new* GSI route prevents posting the IRQ directly to
  a vCPU, regardless of the GSI routing type.  Updating the IRTE if and only if the new GSI
  is an MSI results in KVM leaving an IRTE posting to a vCPU.  The dangling IRTE can result
  in interrupts being incorrectly delivered to the guest, and in the worst case scenario can
  result in use-after-free, e.g. if the VM is torn down, but the underlying host IRQ isn''t
  freed.'
