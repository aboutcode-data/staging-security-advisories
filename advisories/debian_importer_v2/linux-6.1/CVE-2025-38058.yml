  - CVE-2025-38058
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  __legitimize_mnt():
  check for MNT_SYNC_UMOUNT should be under mount_lock  ... or we risk stealing final mntput
  from sync umount - raising mnt_count after umount(2) has verified that victim is not busy,
  but before it has set MNT_SYNC_UMOUNT; in that case __legitimize_mnt() doesn''t see that it''s
  safe to quietly undo mnt_count increment and leaves dropping the reference to caller, where
  it''ll be a full-blown mntput().  Check under mount_lock is needed; leaving the current one
  done before taking that makes no sense - it''s nowhere near common enough to bother with.'
