  - CVE-2023-53421
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  blk-cgroup: Reinit
  blkg_iostat_set after clearing in blkcg_reset_stats()  When blkg_alloc() is called to allocate
  a blkcg_gq structure with the associated blkg_iostat_set''s, there are 2 fields within blkg_iostat_set
  that requires proper initialization - blkg & sync. The former field was introduced by commit
  3b8cc6298724 ("blk-cgroup: Optimize blkcg_rstat_flush()") while the later one was introduced
  by commit f73316482977 ("blk-cgroup: reimplement basic IO stats using cgroup rstat").  Unfortunately
  those fields in the blkg_iostat_set''s are not properly re-initialized when they are cleared
  in v1''s blkcg_reset_stats(). This can lead to a kernel panic due to NULL pointer access of
  the blkg pointer. The missing initialization of sync is less problematic and can be a problem
  in a debug kernel due to missing lockdep initialization.  Fix these problems by re-initializing
  them after memory clearing.'
