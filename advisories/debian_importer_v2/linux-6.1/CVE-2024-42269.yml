summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: iptables:
  Fix potential null-ptr-deref in ip6table_nat_table_init().  ip6table_nat_table_init() accesses
  net->gen->ptr[ip6table_nat_net_ops.id], but the function is exposed to user space before the
  entry is allocated via register_pernet_subsys().  Let''s call register_pernet_subsys() before
  xt_register_template().'
