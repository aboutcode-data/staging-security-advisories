summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: lan743x:
  fix potential out-of-bounds write in lan743x_ptp_io_event_clock_get()  Before calling lan743x_ptp_io_event_clock_get(),
  the ''channel'' value is checked against the maximum value of PCI11X1X_PTP_IO_MAX_CHANNELS(8).
  This seems correct and aligns with the PTP interrupt status register (PTP_INT_STS) specifications.  However,
  lan743x_ptp_io_event_clock_get() writes to ptp->extts[] with only LAN743X_PTP_N_EXTTS(4) elements,
  using channel as an index:      lan743x_ptp_io_event_clock_get(..., u8 channel,...)     {         ...         /*
  Update Local timestamp */         extts = &ptp->extts[channel];         extts->ts.tv_sec =
  sec;         ...     }  To avoid an out-of-bounds write and utilize all the supported GPIO
  inputs, set LAN743X_PTP_N_EXTTS to 8.  Detected using the static analysis tool - Svace.'
