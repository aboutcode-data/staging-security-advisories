summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommu/mediatek:
  Fix NULL pointer deference in mtk_iommu_device_group  Currently, mtk_iommu calls during probe
  iommu_device_register before the hw_list from driver data is initialized. Since iommu probing
  issue fix, it leads to NULL pointer dereference in mtk_iommu_device_group when hw_list is
  accessed with list_first_entry (not null safe).  So, change the call order to ensure iommu_device_register
  is called after the driver data are initialized.'
