summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: typec: displayport:
  Fix potential deadlock  The deadlock can occur due to a recursive lock acquisition of `cros_typec_altmode_data::mutex`.
  The call chain is as follows: 1. cros_typec_altmode_work() acquires the mutex 2. typec_altmode_vdm()
  -> dp_altmode_vdm() -> 3. typec_altmode_exit() -> cros_typec_altmode_exit() 4. cros_typec_altmode_exit()
  attempts to acquire the mutex again  To prevent this, defer the `typec_altmode_exit()` call
  by scheduling it rather than calling it directly from within the mutex-protected context.'
