summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: fix infinite
  loop when replaying fast_commit  When doing fast_commit replay an infinite loop may occur
  due to an uninitialized extent_status struct.  ext4_ext_determine_insert_hole() does not detect
  the replay and calls ext4_es_find_extent_range(), which will return immediately without initializing
  the ''es'' variable.  Because ''es'' contains garbage, an integer overflow may happen causing
  an infinite loop in this function, easily reproducible using fstest generic/039.  This commit
  fixes this issue by unconditionally initializing the structure in function ext4_es_find_extent_range().  Thanks
  to Zhang Yi, for figuring out the real problem!'
