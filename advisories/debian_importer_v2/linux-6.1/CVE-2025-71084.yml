summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/cm: Fix
  leaking the multicast GID table reference  If the CM ID is destroyed while the CM event for
  multicast creating is still queued the cancel_work_sync() will prevent the work from running
  which also prevents destroying the ah_attr. This leaks a refcount and triggers a WARN:     GID
  entry ref leak for dev syz1 index 2 ref=573    WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 655 at drivers/infiniband/core/cache.c:809
  release_gid_table drivers/infiniband/core/cache.c:806 [inline]    WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 655
  at drivers/infiniband/core/cache.c:809 gid_table_release_one+0x284/0x3cc drivers/infiniband/core/cache.c:886  Destroy
  the ah_attr after canceling the work, it is safe to call this twice.'
