summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ksmbd: Fix dangling
  pointer in krb_authenticate  krb_authenticate frees sess->user and does not set the pointer
  to NULL. It calls ksmbd_krb5_authenticate to reinitialise sess->user but that function may
  return without doing so. If that happens then smb2_sess_setup, which calls krb_authenticate,
  will be accessing free''d memory when it later uses sess->user.'
