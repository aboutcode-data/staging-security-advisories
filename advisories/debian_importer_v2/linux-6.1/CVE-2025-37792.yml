summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: btrtl:
  Prevent potential NULL dereference  The btrtl_initialize() function checks that rtl_load_file()
  either had an error or it loaded a zero length file.  However, if it loaded a zero length
  file then the error code is not set correctly.  It results in an error pointer vs NULL bug,
  followed by a NULL pointer dereference.  This was detected by Smatch:  drivers/bluetooth/btrtl.c:592
  btrtl_initialize() warn: passing zero to ''ERR_PTR'''
