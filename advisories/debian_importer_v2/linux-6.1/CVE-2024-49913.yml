summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display:
  Add null check for top_pipe_to_program in commit_planes_for_stream  This commit addresses
  a null pointer dereference issue in the `commit_planes_for_stream` function at line 4140.
  The issue could occur when `top_pipe_to_program` is null.  The fix adds a check to ensure
  `top_pipe_to_program` is not null before accessing its stream_res. This prevents a null pointer
  dereference.  Reported by smatch: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/core/dc.c:4140
  commit_planes_for_stream() error: we previously assumed ''top_pipe_to_program'' could be null
  (see line 3906)'
