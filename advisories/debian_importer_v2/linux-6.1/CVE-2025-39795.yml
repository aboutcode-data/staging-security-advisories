summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  block: avoid
  possible overflow for chunk_sectors check in blk_stack_limits()  In blk_stack_limits(), we
  check that the t->chunk_sectors value is a multiple of the t->physical_block_size value.  However,
  by finding the chunk_sectors value in bytes, we may overflow the unsigned int which holds
  chunk_sectors, so change the check to be based on sectors.'
