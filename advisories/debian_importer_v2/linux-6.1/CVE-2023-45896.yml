  - CVE-2023-45896
summary: 'ntfs3 in the Linux kernel through 6.8.0 allows a physically proximate attacker to
  read kernel memory by mounting a filesystem (e.g., if a Linux distribution is configured to
  allow unprivileged mounts of removable media) and then leveraging local access to trigger
  an out-of-bounds read. A length value can be larger than the amount of memory allocated. NOTE:
  the supplier''s perspective is that there is no vulnerability when an attack requires an attacker-modified
  filesystem image.'
