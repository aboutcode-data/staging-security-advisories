summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: usb-audio:
  Fix NULL pointer deference in try_to_register_card  In try_to_register_card(), the return
  value of usb_ifnum_to_if() is passed directly to usb_interface_claimed() without a NULL check,
  which will lead to a NULL pointer dereference when creating an invalid USB audio device. Fix
  this by adding a check to ensure the interface pointer is valid before passing it to usb_interface_claimed().'
