summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: hci_event:
  validate skb length for unknown CC opcode  In hci_cmd_complete_evt(), if the command complete
  event has an unknown opcode, we assume the first byte of the remaining skb->data contains
  the return status. However, parameter data has previously been pulled in hci_event_func(),
  which may leave the skb empty. If so, using skb->data[0] for the return status uses un-init
  memory.  The fix is to check skb->len before using skb->data.'
