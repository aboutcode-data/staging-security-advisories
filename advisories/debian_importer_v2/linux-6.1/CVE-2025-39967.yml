summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fbcon: fix integer
  overflow in fbcon_do_set_font  Fix integer overflow vulnerabilities in fbcon_do_set_font()
  where font size calculations could overflow when handling user-controlled font parameters.  The
  vulnerabilities occur when: 1. CALC_FONTSZ(h, pitch, charcount) performs h * pith * charcount    multiplication
  with user-controlled values that can overflow. 2. FONT_EXTRA_WORDS * sizeof(int) + size addition
  can also overflow 3. This results in smaller allocations than expected, leading to buffer    overflows
  during font data copying.  Add explicit overflow checking using check_mul_overflow() and check_add_overflow()
  kernel helpers to safety validate all size calculations before allocation.'
