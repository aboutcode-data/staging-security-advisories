summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  binfmt_flat:
  Fix corruption when not offsetting data start  Commit 04d82a6d0881 ("binfmt_flat: allow not
  offsetting data start") introduced a RISC-V specific variant of the FLAT format which does
  not allocate any space for the (obsolete) array of shared library pointers. However, it did
  not disable the code which initializes the array, resulting in the corruption of sizeof(long)
  bytes before the DATA segment, generally the end of the TEXT segment.  Introduce MAX_SHARED_LIBS_UPDATE
  which depends on the state of CONFIG_BINFMT_FLAT_NO_DATA_START_OFFSET to guard the initialization
  of the shared library pointer region so that it will only be initialized if space is reserved
  for it.'
