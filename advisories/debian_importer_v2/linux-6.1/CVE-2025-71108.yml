summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: typec: ucsi:
  Handle incorrect num_connectors capability  The UCSI spec states that the num_connectors field
  is 7 bits, and the 8th bit is reserved and should be set to zero. Some buggy FW has been known
  to set this bit, and it can lead to a system not booting. Flag that the FW is not behaving
  correctly, and auto-fix the value so that the system boots correctly.  Found on Lenovo P1
  G8 during Linux enablement program. The FW will be fixed, but seemed worth addressing in case
  it hit platforms that aren''t officially Linux supported.'
