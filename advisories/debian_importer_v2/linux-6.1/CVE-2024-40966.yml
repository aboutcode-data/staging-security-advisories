  - CVE-2024-40966
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tty: add the
  option to have a tty reject a new ldisc  ... and use it to limit the virtual terminals to
  just N_TTY.  They are kind of special, and in particular, the "con_write()" routine violates
  the "writes cannot sleep" rule that some ldiscs rely on.  This avoids the     BUG: sleeping
  function called from invalid context at kernel/printk/printk.c:2659  when N_GSM has been attached
  to a virtual console, and gsmld_write() calls con_write() while holding a spinlock, and con_write()
  then tries to get the console lock.'
