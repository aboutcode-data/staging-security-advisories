  - CVE-2025-38467
summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/exynos: exynos7_drm_decon:
  add vblank check in IRQ handling  If there''s support for another console device (such as
  a TTY serial), the kernel occasionally panics during boot. The panic message and a relevant
  snippet of the call stack is as follows:    Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference
  at virtual address 000000000000000   Call trace:     drm_crtc_handle_vblank+0x10/0x30 (P)     decon_irq_handler+0x88/0xb4     [...]  Otherwise,
  the panics don''t happen. This indicates that it''s some sort of race condition.  Add a check
  to validate if the drm device can handle vblanks before calling drm_crtc_handle_vblank() to
  avoid this.'
