summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  riscv: kexec:
  Avoid deadlock in kexec crash path  If the kexec crash code is called in the interrupt context,
  the machine_kexec_mask_interrupts() function will trigger a deadlock while trying to acquire
  the irqdesc spinlock and then deactivate irqchip in irq_set_irqchip_state() function.  Unlike
  arm64, riscv only requires irq_eoi handler to complete EOI and keeping irq_set_irqchip_state()
  will only leave this possible deadlock without any use. So we simply remove it.'
