summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iio: adc: rockchip_saradc:
  fix information leak in triggered buffer  The ''data'' local struct is used to push data to
  user space from a triggered buffer, but it does not set values for inactive channels, as it
  only uses iio_for_each_active_channel() to assign new values.  Initialize the struct to zero
  before using it to avoid pushing uninitialized information to userspace.'
