summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  smack: fix bug:
  unprivileged task can create labels  If an unprivileged task is allowed to relabel itself
  (/smack/relabel-self is not empty), it can freely create new labels by writing their names
  into own /proc/PID/attr/smack/current  This occurs because do_setattr() imports the provided
  label in advance, before checking "relabel-self" list.  This change ensures that the "relabel-self"
  list is checked before importing the label.'
