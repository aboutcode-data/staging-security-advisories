summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: protect
  references to superblock parameters exposed in sysfs  The superblock buffers of nilfs2 can
  not only be overwritten at runtime for modifications/repairs, but they are also regularly
  swapped, replaced during resizing, and even abandoned when degrading to one side due to backing
  device issues.  So, accessing them requires mutual exclusion using the reader/writer semaphore
  "nilfs->ns_sem".  Some sysfs attribute show methods read this superblock buffer without the
  necessary mutual exclusion, which can cause problems with pointer dereferencing and memory
  access, so fix it.'
