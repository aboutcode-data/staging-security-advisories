summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  exfat: fix the
  infinite loop in exfat_readdir()  If the file system is corrupted so that a cluster is linked
  to itself in the cluster chain, and there is an unused directory entry in the cluster, ''dentry''
  will not be incremented, causing condition ''dentry < max_dentries'' unable to prevent an
  infinite loop.  This infinite loop causes s_lock not to be released, and other tasks will
  hang, such as exfat_sync_fs().  This commit stops traversing the cluster chain when there
  is unused directory entry in the cluster to avoid this infinite loop.'
