summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  comedi: check
  device''s attached status in compat ioctls  Syzbot identified an issue [1] that crashes kernel,
  seemingly due to unexistent callback dev->get_valid_routes(). By all means, this should not
  occur as said callback must always be set to get_zero_valid_routes() in __comedi_device_postconfig().  As
  the crash seems to appear exclusively in i386 kernels, at least, judging from [1] reports,
  the blame lies with compat versions of standard IOCTL handlers. Several of them are modified
  and do not use comedi_unlocked_ioctl(). While functionality of these ioctls essentially copy
  their original versions, they do not have required sanity check for device''s attached status.
  This, in turn, leads to a possibility of calling select IOCTLs on a device that has not been
  properly setup, even via COMEDI_DEVCONFIG.  Doing so on unconfigured devices means that several
  crucial steps are missed, for instance, specifying dev->get_valid_routes() callback.  Fix
  this somewhat crudely by ensuring device''s attached status before performing any ioctls,
  improving logic consistency between modern and compat functions.  [1] Syzbot report: BUG:
