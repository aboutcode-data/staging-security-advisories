summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: firewire-motu:
  fix buffer overflow in hwdep read for DSP events  The DSP event handling code in hwdep_read()
  could write more bytes to the user buffer than requested, when a user provides a buffer smaller
  than the event header size (8 bytes).  Fix by using min_t() to clamp the copy size, This ensures
  we never copy more than the user requested.'
