summary: 'In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  software node:
  Correct a OOB check in software_node_get_reference_args()  software_node_get_reference_args()
  wants to get @index-th element, so the property value requires at least ''(index + 1) * sizeof(*ref)''
  bytes but that can not be guaranteed by current OOB check, and may cause OOB for malformed
  property.  Fix by using as OOB check ''((index + 1) * sizeof(*ref) > prop->length)''.'
