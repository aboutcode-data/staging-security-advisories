  - CVE-2014-2237
summary: The memcache token backend in OpenStack Identity (Keystone) 2013.1 through 2.013.1.4,
  2013.2 through 2013.2.2, and icehouse before icehouse-3, when issuing a trust token with impersonation
  enabled, does not include this token in the trustee's token-index-list, which prevents the
  token from being invalidated by bulk token revocation and allows the trustee to bypass intended
  access restrictions.
