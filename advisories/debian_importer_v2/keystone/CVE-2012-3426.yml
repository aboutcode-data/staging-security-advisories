summary: OpenStack Keystone before 2012.1.1, as used in OpenStack Folsom before Folsom-1 and
  OpenStack Essex, does not properly implement token expiration, which allows remote authenticated
  users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by (1) creating new tokens through token
  chaining, (2) leveraging possession of a token for a disabled user account, or (3) leveraging
  possession of a token for an account with a changed password.
