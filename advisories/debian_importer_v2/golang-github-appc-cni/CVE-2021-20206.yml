aliases:
  - CVE-2021-20206
summary: An improper limitation of path name flaw was found in containernetworking/cni in versions
  before 0.8.1. When specifying the plugin to load in the 'type' field in the network configuration,
  it is possible to use special elements such as "../" separators to reference binaries elsewhere
  on the system. This flaw allows an attacker to execute other existing binaries other than
  the cni plugins/types, such as 'reboot'. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to
  confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.
