  - CVE-2021-23792
summary: The package com.twelvemonkeys.imageio:imageio-metadata before 3.7.1 are vulnerable
  to XML External Entity (XXE) Injection due to an insecurely initialized XML parser for reading
  XMP Metadata. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability if they are able to supply a file
  (e.g. when an online profile picture is processed) with a malicious XMP segment. If the XMP
  metadata of the uploaded image is parsed, then the XXE vulnerability is triggered.
