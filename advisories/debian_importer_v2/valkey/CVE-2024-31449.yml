summary: Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. An authenticated
  user may use a specially crafted Lua script to trigger a stack buffer overflow in the bit
  library, which may potentially lead to remote code execution. The problem exists in all versions
  of Redis with Lua scripting. This problem has been fixed in Redis versions 6.2.16, 7.2.6,
  and 7.4.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
