  - CVE-2025-46818
summary: Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. Versions 8.2.1 and
  below allow an authenticated user to use a specially crafted Lua script to manipulate different
  LUA objects and potentially run their own code in the context of another user. The problem
  exists in all versions of Redis with LUA scripting. This issue is fixed in version 8.2.2.
  A workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent
  users from executing LUA scripts. This can be done using ACL to block a script by restricting
  both the EVAL and FUNCTION command families.
