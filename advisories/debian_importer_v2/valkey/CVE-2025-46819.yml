summary: Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. Versions 8.2.1 and
  below allow an authenticated user to use a specially crafted LUA script to read out-of-bound
  data or crash the server and subsequent denial of service. The problem exists in all versions
  of Redis with Lua scripting. This issue is fixed in version 8.2.2. To workaround this issue
  without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from executing Lua scripts.
  This can be done using ACL to block a script by restricting both the EVAL and FUNCTION command
  families.
