summary: DjVuLibre is a GPL implementation of DjVu, a web-centric format for distributing documents
  and images. Prior to version 3.5.29, the MMRDecoder::scanruns method is affected by an OOB-write
  vulnerability, because it does not check that the xr pointer stays within the bounds of the
  allocated buffer. This can lead to writes beyond the allocated memory, resulting in a heap
  corruption condition. An out-of-bounds read with pr is also possible for the same reason.
  This issue has been patched in version 3.5.29.
