  - CVE-2020-10174
summary: init_tmp in TeeJee.FileSystem.vala in Timeshift before 20.03 unsafely reuses a preexisting
  temporary directory in the predictable location /tmp/timeshift. It follows symlinks in this
  location or uses directories owned by unprivileged users. Because Timeshift also executes
  scripts under this location, an attacker can attempt to win a race condition to replace scripts
  created by Timeshift with attacker-controlled scripts. Upon success, an attacker-controlled
  script is executed with full root privileges. This logic is practically always triggered when
  Timeshift runs regardless of the command-line arguments used.
