summary: Express.js minimalist web framework for node. Versions of Express.js prior to 4.19.0
  and all pre-release alpha and beta versions of 5.0 are affected by an open redirect vulnerability
  using malformed URLs. When a user of Express performs a redirect using a user-provided URL
  Express performs an encode [using `encodeurl`](https://github.com/pillarjs/encodeurl) on the
  contents before passing it to the `location` header. This can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated
  in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications,
  leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list. The main method
  impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called from within `res.redirect()`. The vulnerability
  is fixed in 4.19.2 and 5.0.0-beta.3.
