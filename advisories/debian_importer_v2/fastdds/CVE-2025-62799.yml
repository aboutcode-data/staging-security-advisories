  - CVE-2025-62799
summary: Fast DDS is a C++ implementation of the DDS (Data Distribution Service) standard of
  the OMG (Object Management Group ). Prior to versions 3.4.1, 3.3.1, and 2.6.11, a heap buffer
  overflow exists in the Fast-DDS DATA_FRAG receive path. An un authenticated sender can transmit
  a single malformed RTPS DATA_FRAG packet where `fragmentSize` and `sampleSize` are craft ed
  to violate internal assumptions. Due to a 4-byte alignment step during fragment metadata initialization,
  the code write s past the end of the allocated payload buffer, causing immediate crash (DoS)
  and potentially enabling memory corruption ( RCE risk). Versions 3.4.1, 3.3.1, and 2.6.11
  patch the issue.
