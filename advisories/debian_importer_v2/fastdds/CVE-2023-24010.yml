  - CVE-2023-24010
summary: An attacker can arbitrarily craft malicious DDS Participants (or ROS 2 Nodes) with
  valid certificates to compromise and get full control of the attacked secure DDS databus system
  by exploiting vulnerable attributes in the configuration of PKCS#7 certificate’s validation.
  This is caused by a non-compliant implementation of permission document verification used
  by some DDS vendors. Specifically, an improper use of the OpenSSL PKCS7_verify function used
  to validate S/MIME signatures.
