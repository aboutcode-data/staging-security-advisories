  - CVE-2025-62602
summary: Fast DDS is a C++ implementation of the DDS (Data Distribution Service) standard of
  the OMG (Object Management Group ). Prior to versions 3.4.1, 3.3.1, and 2.6.11, when the security
  mode is enabled, modifying the DATA Submessage within an  SPDP packet sent by a publisher
  causes a heap buffer overflow, resulting in remote termination of Fast-DDS. If the fields  of
  `PID_IDENTITY_TOKEN` or `PID_PERMISSIONS_TOKEN` in the DATA Submessage are tampered with —
  specially  `readOctetVector`  reads an unchecked `vecsize` that is propagated unchanged into
  `readData` as the `length` parameter — the attacker-contro lled `vecsize` can trigger a 32-bit
  integer overflow during the `length` calculation. That overflow can cause large alloca tion
  attempt that quickly leads to OOM, enabling a remotely-triggerable denial-of-service and remote
  process termination.  Versions 3.4.1, 3.3.1, and 2.6.11 patch the issue.
