  - CVE-2025-64438
summary: Fast DDS is a C++ implementation of the DDS (Data Distribution Service) standard of
  the OMG (Object Management Group ). Prior to versions 3.4.1, 3.3.1, and 2.6.11, a remotely
  triggerable Out-of-Memory (OOM) denial-of-service exists in Fast -DDS when processing RTPS
  GAP submessages under RELIABLE QoS. By sending a tiny GAP packet with a huge gap range (`gapList
  .base - gapStart`), an attacker drives `StatefulReader::processGapMsg()` into an unbounded
  loop that inserts millions of s equence numbers into `WriterProxy::changes_received_` (`std::set`),
  causing multi-GB heap growth and process termination.  No authentication is required beyond
  network reachability to the reader on the DDS domain. In environments without an RSS  limit
  (non-ASan / unlimited), memory consumption was observed to rise to ~64 GB. Versions 3.4.1,
  3.3.1, and 2.6.11 patch t he issue.
