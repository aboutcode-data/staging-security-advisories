  - CVE-2025-62599
summary: Fast DDS is a C++ implementation of the DDS (Data Distribution Service) standard of
  the OMG (Object Management Group ). Prior to versions 3.4.1, 3.3.1, and 2.6.11, when the security
  mode is enabled, modifying the DATA Submessage within an  SPDP packet sent by a publisher
  causes an Out-Of-Memory (OOM) condition, resulting in remote termination of Fast-DDS. If t
  he fields of PID_IDENTITY_TOKEN or PID_PERMISSION_TOKEN in the DATA Submessage — specifically
  by tampering with the length  field in readPropertySeq — are modified, an integer overflow
  occurs, leading to an OOM during the resize operation. Versi ons 3.4.1, 3.3.1, and 2.6.11
  patch the issue.
