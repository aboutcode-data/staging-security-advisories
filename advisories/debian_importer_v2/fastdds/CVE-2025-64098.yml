  - CVE-2025-64098
summary: Fast DDS is a C++ implementation of the DDS (Data Distribution Service) standard of
  the OMG (Object Management Group ). Prior to versions 3.4.1, 3.3.1, and 2.6.11, when the security
  mode is enabled, modifying the DATA Submessage within an  SPDP packet sent by a publisher
  causes an Out-Of-Memory (OOM) condition, resulting in remote termination of Fast-DDS. If t
  he fields of `PID_IDENTITY_TOKEN` or `PID_PERMISSIONS_TOKEN` in the DATA Submessage are tampered
  with — specifically by ta mpering with the the `vecsize` value read by `readOctetVector` —
  a 32-bit integer overflow can occur, causing `std::vector ::resize` to request an attacker-controlled
  size and quickly trigger OOM and remote process termination. Versions 3.4.1, 3 .3.1, and 2.6.11
  patch the issue.
