summary: 'Fast DDS is a C++ implementation of the DDS (Data Distribution Service) standard of
  the OMG (Object Management Group ). ParticipantGenericMessage is the DDS Security control-message
  container that carries not only the handshake but also on going security-control traffic after
  the handshake, such as crypto-token exchange, rekeying, re-authentication, and token  delivery
  for newly appearing endpoints. On receive, the CDR parser is invoked first and deserializes
  the `message_data` (i .e., the `DataHolderSeq`) via the `readParticipantGenericMessage → readDataHolderSeq`
  path. The `DataHolderSeq` is parsed  sequentially: a sequence count (`uint32`), and for each
  DataHolder the `class_id` string (e.g. `DDS:Auth:PKI-DH:1.0+Req`),  string properties (a sequence
  of key/value pairs), and binary properties (a name plus an octet-vector). The parser operat
  es at a stateless level and does not know higher-layer state (for example, whether the handshake
  has already completed), s o it fully unfolds the structure before distinguishing legitimate
  from malformed traffic. Because RTPS permits duplicates,  delays, and retransmissions, a receiver
  must perform at least minimal structural parsing to check identity and sequence n umbers before
  discarding or processing a message; the current implementation, however, does not "peek" only
  at a minimal  header and instead parses the entire `DataHolderSeq`. As a result, prior to
  versions 3.4.1, 3.3.1, and 2.6.11, this parsi ng behavior can trigger an out-of-memory condition
  and remotely terminate the process. Versions 3.4.1, 3.3.1, and 2.6.11 p atch the issue.'
