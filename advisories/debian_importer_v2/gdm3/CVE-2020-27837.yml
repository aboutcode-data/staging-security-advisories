  - CVE-2020-27837
summary: A flaw was found in GDM in versions prior to 3.38.2.1. A race condition in the handling
  of session shutdown makes it possible to bypass the lock screen for a user that has autologin
  enabled, accessing their session without authentication. This is similar to CVE-2017-12164,
  but requires more difficult conditions to exploit.
