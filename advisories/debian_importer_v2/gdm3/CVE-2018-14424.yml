  - CVE-2018-14424
summary: The daemon in GDM through 3.29.1 does not properly unexport display objects from its
  D-Bus interface when they are destroyed, which allows a local attacker to trigger a use-after-free
  via a specially crafted sequence of D-Bus method calls, resulting in a denial of service or
  potential code execution.
