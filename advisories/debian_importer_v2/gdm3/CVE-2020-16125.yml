  - CVE-2020-16125
summary: gdm3 versions before 3.36.2 or 3.38.2 would start gnome-initial-setup if gdm3 can't
  contact the accountservice service via dbus in a timely manner; on Ubuntu (and potentially
  derivatives) this could be be chained with an additional issue that could allow a local user
  to create a new privileged account.
