aliases:
  - CVE-2012-3524
summary: 'libdbus 1.5.x and earlier, when used in setuid or other privileged programs in X.org
  and possibly other products, allows local users to gain privileges and execute arbitrary code
  via the DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS environment variable.  NOTE: libdbus maintainers state that
  this is a vulnerability in the applications that do not cleanse environment variables, not
  in libdbus itself: "we do not support use of libdbus in setuid binaries that do not sanitize
  their environment before their first call into libdbus."'
