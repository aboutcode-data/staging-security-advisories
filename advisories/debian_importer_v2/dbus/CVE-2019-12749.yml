summary: dbus before 1.10.28, 1.12.x before 1.12.16, and 1.13.x before 1.13.12, as used in DBusServer
  in Canonical Upstart in Ubuntu 14.04 (and in some, less common, uses of dbus-daemon), allows
  cookie spoofing because of symlink mishandling in the reference implementation of DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1
  in the libdbus library. (This only affects the DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 authentication mechanism.)
  A malicious client with write access to its own home directory could manipulate a ~/.dbus-keyrings
  symlink to cause a DBusServer with a different uid to read and write in unintended locations.
  In the worst case, this could result in the DBusServer reusing a cookie that is known to the
  malicious client, and treating that cookie as evidence that a subsequent client connection
  came from an attacker-chosen uid, allowing authentication bypass.
