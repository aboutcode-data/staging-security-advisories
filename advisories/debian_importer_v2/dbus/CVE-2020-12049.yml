  - CVE-2020-12049
summary: An issue was discovered in dbus >= 1.3.0 before 1.12.18. The DBusServer in libdbus,
  as used in dbus-daemon, leaks file descriptors when a message exceeds the per-message file
  descriptor limit. A local attacker with access to the D-Bus system bus or another system service's
  private AF_UNIX socket could use this to make the system service reach its file descriptor
  limit, denying service to subsequent D-Bus clients.
