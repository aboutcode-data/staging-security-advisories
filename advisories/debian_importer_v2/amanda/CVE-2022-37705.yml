  - CVE-2022-37705
summary: A privilege escalation flaw was found in Amanda 3.5.1 in which the backup user can
  acquire root privileges. The vulnerable component is the runtar SUID program, which is a wrapper
  to run /usr/bin/tar with specific arguments that are controllable by the attacker. This program
  mishandles the arguments passed to tar binary (it expects that the argument name and value
  are separated with a space; however, separating them with an equals sign is also supported),
