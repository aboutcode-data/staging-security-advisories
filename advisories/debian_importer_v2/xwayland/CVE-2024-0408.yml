aliases:
  - CVE-2024-0408
summary: A flaw was found in the X.Org server. The GLX PBuffer code does not call the XACE hook
  when creating the buffer, leaving it unlabeled. When the client issues another request to
  access that resource (as with a GetGeometry) or when it creates another resource that needs
  to access that buffer, such as a GC, the XSELINUX code will try to use an object that was
  never labeled and crash because the SID is NULL.
