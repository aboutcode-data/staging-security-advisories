  - CVE-2023-6816
summary: A flaw was found in X.Org server. Both DeviceFocusEvent and the XIQueryPointer reply
  contain a bit for each logical button currently down. Buttons can be arbitrarily mapped to
  any value up to 255, but the X.Org Server was only allocating space for the device's particular
  number of buttons, leading to a heap overflow if a bigger value was used.
