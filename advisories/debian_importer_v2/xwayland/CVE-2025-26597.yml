  - CVE-2025-26597
summary: A buffer overflow flaw was found in X.Org and Xwayland. If XkbChangeTypesOfKey() is
  called with a 0 group, it will resize the key symbols table to 0 but leave the key actions
  unchanged. If the same function is later called with a non-zero value of groups, this will
  cause a buffer overflow because the key actions are of the wrong size.
