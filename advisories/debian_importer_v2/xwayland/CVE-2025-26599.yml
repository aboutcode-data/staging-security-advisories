  - CVE-2025-26599
summary: An access to an uninitialized pointer flaw was found in X.Org and Xwayland. The function
  compCheckRedirect() may fail if it cannot allocate the backing pixmap. In that case, compRedirectWindow()
  will return a BadAlloc error without validating the window tree marked just before, which
  leaves the validated data partly initialized and the use of an uninitialized pointer later.
