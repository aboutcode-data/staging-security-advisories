  - CVE-2023-1393
summary: A flaw was found in X.Org Server Overlay Window. A Use-After-Free may lead to local
  privilege escalation. If a client explicitly destroys the compositor overlay window (aka COW),
  the Xserver would leave a dangling pointer to that window in the CompScreen structure, which
  will trigger a use-after-free later.
