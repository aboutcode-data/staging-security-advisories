  - CVE-2023-0494
summary: A vulnerability was found in X.Org. This issue occurs due to a dangling pointer in
  DeepCopyPointerClasses that can be exploited by ProcXkbSetDeviceInfo() and ProcXkbGetDeviceInfo()
  to read and write into freed memory. This can lead to local privilege elevation on systems
  where the X server runs privileged and remote code execution for ssh X forwarding sessions.
