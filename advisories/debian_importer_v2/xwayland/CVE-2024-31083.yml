  - CVE-2024-31083
summary: A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the ProcRenderAddGlyphs() function of Xorg
  servers. This issue occurs when AllocateGlyph() is called to store new glyphs sent by the
  client to the X server, potentially resulting in multiple entries pointing to the same non-refcounted
  glyphs. Consequently, ProcRenderAddGlyphs() may free a glyph, leading to a use-after-free
  scenario when the same glyph pointer is subsequently accessed. This flaw allows an authenticated
  attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system by sending a specially crafted request.
