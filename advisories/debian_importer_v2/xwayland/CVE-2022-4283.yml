  - CVE-2022-4283
summary: A vulnerability was found in X.Org. This security flaw occurs because the XkbCopyNames
  function left a dangling pointer to freed memory, resulting in out-of-bounds memory access
  on subsequent XkbGetKbdByName requests.. This issue can lead to local privileges elevation
  on systems where the X server is running privileged and remote code execution for ssh X forwarding
  sessions.
