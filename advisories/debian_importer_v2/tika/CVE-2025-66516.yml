aliases:
  - CVE-2025-66516
summary: Critical XXE in Apache Tika tika-core (1.13-3.2.1), tika-pdf-module (2.0.0-3.2.1) and
  tika-parsers (1.13-1.28.5) modules on all platforms allows an attacker to carry out XML External
  Entity injection via a crafted XFA file inside of a PDF.   This CVE covers the same vulnerability
  as in CVE-2025-54988. However, this CVE expands the scope of affected packages in two ways.   First,
  while the entrypoint for the vulnerability was the tika-parser-pdf-module as reported in CVE-2025-54988,
  the vulnerability and its fix were in tika-core. Users who upgraded the tika-parser-pdf-module
  but did not upgrade tika-core to >= 3.2.2 would still be vulnerable.   Second, the original
  report failed to mention that in the 1.x Tika releases, the PDFParser was in the "org.apache.tika:tika-parsers"
  module.
