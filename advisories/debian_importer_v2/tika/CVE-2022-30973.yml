summary: We failed to apply the fix for CVE-2022-30126 to the 1.x branch in the 1.28.2 release.
  In Apache Tika, a regular expression in the StandardsText class, used by the StandardsExtractingContentHandler
  could lead to a denial of service caused by backtracking on a specially crafted file. This
  only affects users who are running the StandardsExtractingContentHandler, which is a non-standard
  handler. This is fixed in 1.28.3.
