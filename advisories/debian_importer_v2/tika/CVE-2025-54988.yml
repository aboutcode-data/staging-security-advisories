summary: 'Critical XXE in Apache Tika (tika-parser-pdf-module) in Apache Tika 1.13 through and
  including 3.2.1 on all platforms allows an attacker to carry out XML External Entity injection
  via a crafted XFA file inside of a PDF. An attacker may be able to read sensitive data or
  trigger malicious requests to internal resources or third-party servers. Note that the tika-parser-pdf-module
  is used as a dependency in several Tika packages including at least: tika-parsers-standard-modules,
  tika-parsers-standard-package, tika-app, tika-grpc and tika-server-standard.  Users are recommended
  to upgrade to version 3.2.2, which fixes this issue.'
