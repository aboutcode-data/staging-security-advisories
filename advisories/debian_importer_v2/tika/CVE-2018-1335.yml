summary: From Apache Tika versions 1.7 to 1.17, clients could send carefully crafted headers
  to tika-server that could be used to inject commands into the command line of the server running
  tika-server. This vulnerability only affects those running tika-server on a server that is
  open to untrusted clients. The mitigation is to upgrade to Tika 1.18.
