  - CVE-2018-11796
summary: In Apache Tika 1.19 (CVE-2018-11761), we added an entity expansion limit for XML parsing.
  However, Tika reuses SAXParsers and calls reset() after each parse, which, for Xerces2 parsers,
  as per the documentation, removes the user-specified SecurityManager and thus removes entity
  expansion limits after the first parse. Apache Tika versions from 0.1 to 1.19 are therefore
  still vulnerable to entity expansions which can lead to a denial of service attack. Users
  should upgrade to 1.19.1 or later.
