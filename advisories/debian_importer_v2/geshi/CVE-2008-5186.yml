aliases:
  - CVE-2008-5186
summary: 'The set_language_path function in geshi.php in Generic Syntax Highlighter (GeSHi)
  before 1.0.8.1 might allow remote attackers to conduct file inclusion attacks via crafted
  inputs that influence the default language path ($path variable).  NOTE: this issue has been
  disputed by a vendor, stating that only a static value is used, so this is not a vulnerability
  in GeSHi. Separate CVE identifiers would be created for web applications that integrate GeSHi
  in a way that allows control of the default language path'
