  - CVE-2025-57632
summary: libsmb2 6.2+ is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow. When processing SMB2 chained PDUs (NextCommand),
  libsmb2 repeatedly calls smb2_add_iovector() to append to a fixed-size iovec array without
  checking the upper bound of v->niov (SMB2_MAX_VECTORS=256). An attacker can craft responses
  with many chained PDUs to overflow v->niov and perform heap out-of-bounds writes, causing
  memory corruption, crashes, and potentially arbitrary code execution. The SMB2_OPLOCK_BREAK
  path bypasses message ID validation.
