summary: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. Prior to version 3.21.0,
  offscreen bitmap deletion leaves `gdi->drawing` pointing to freed memory, causing UAF when
  related update packets arrive. A malicious server can trigger a client‑side use after free,
  causing a crash (DoS) and potential heap corruption with code‑execution risk depending on
  allocator behavior and surrounding heap layout. Version 3.21.0 contains a patch for the issue.
