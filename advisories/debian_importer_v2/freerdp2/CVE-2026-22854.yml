summary: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. Prior to 3.20.1, a
  heap-buffer-overflow occurs in drive read when a server-controlled read length is used to
  read file data into an IRP output stream buffer without a hard upper bound, allowing an oversized
  read to overwrite heap memory. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.20.1.
