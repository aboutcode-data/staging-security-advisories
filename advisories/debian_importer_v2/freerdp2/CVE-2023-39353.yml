  - CVE-2023-39353
summary: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under
  the Apache license. Affected versions are subject to a missing offset validation leading to
  Out Of Bound Read. In the `libfreerdp/codec/rfx.c` file there is no offset validation in `tile->quantIdxY`,
  `tile->quantIdxCb`, and `tile->quantIdxCr`. As a result crafted input can lead to an out of
  bounds read access which in turn will cause a crash. This issue has been addressed in versions
  2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
  vulnerability.
