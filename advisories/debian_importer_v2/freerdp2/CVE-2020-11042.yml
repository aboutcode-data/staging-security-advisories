  - CVE-2020-11042
summary: In FreeRDP greater than 1.1 and before 2.0.0, there is an out-of-bounds read in update_read_icon_info.
  It allows reading a attacker-defined amount of client memory (32bit unsigned -> 4GB) to an
  intermediate buffer. This can be used to crash the client or store information for later retrieval.
  This has been patched in 2.0.0.
