  - CVE-2026-25952
summary: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. Prior to version 3.23.0,
  `xf_SetWindowMinMaxInfo` dereferences a freed `xfAppWindow` pointer because `xf_rail_get_window`
  in `xf_rail_server_min_max_info` returns an unprotected pointer from the `railWindows` hash
  table, and the main thread can concurrently delete the window (via a window delete order)
  while the RAIL channel thread is still using the pointer. Version 3.23.0 fixes the issue.
