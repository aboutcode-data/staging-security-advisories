  - CVE-2026-23532
summary: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. Prior to version 3.21.0,
  a client-side heap buffer overflow occurs in the  FreeRDP client’s `gdi_SurfaceToSurface`
  path due to a mismatch between destination rectangle clamping and the actual copy size. A
  malicious server can trigger a client‑side heap buffer overflow, causing a crash (DoS) and
  potential heap corruption with code‑execution risk depending on allocator behavior and surrounding
  heap layout. Version 3.21.0 contains a patch for the issue.
