  - CVE-2026-23533
summary: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. Prior to version 3.21.0,
  a client-side heap buffer overflow occurs in the RDPGFX ClearCodec decode path when maliciously
  crafted residual data causes out-of-bounds writes during color output. A malicious server
  can trigger a client‑side heap buffer overflow, causing a crash (DoS) and potential heap corruption
  with code‑execution risk depending on allocator behavior and surrounding heap layout. Version
  3.21.0 contains a patch for the issue.
