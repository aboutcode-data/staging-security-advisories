  - CVE-2023-39356
summary: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under
  the Apache license. In affected versions a missing offset validation may lead to an Out Of
  Bound Read in the function `gdi_multi_opaque_rect`. In particular there is no code to validate
  if the value `multi_opaque_rect->numRectangles` is less than 45. Looping through `multi_opaque_rect->`numRectangles
  without proper boundary checks can lead to Out-of-Bounds Read errors which will likely lead
  to a crash. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised
  to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
