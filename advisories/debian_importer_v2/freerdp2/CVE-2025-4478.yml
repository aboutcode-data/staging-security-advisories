  - CVE-2025-4478
summary: A flaw was found in the FreeRDP used by Anaconda's remote install feature, where a
  crafted RDP packet could trigger a segmentation fault. This issue causes the service to crash
  and remain defunct, resulting in a denial of service. It occurs pre-boot and is likely due
  to a NULL pointer dereference. Rebooting is required to recover the system.
