  - CVE-2023-40576
summary: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under
  the Apache license. Affected versions are subject to an Out-Of-Bounds Read in the `RleDecompress`
  function. This Out-Of-Bounds Read occurs because FreeRDP processes the `pbSrcBuffer` variable
  without checking if it contains data of sufficient length. Insufficient data in the `pbSrcBuffer`
  variable may cause errors or crashes. This issue has been addressed in version 3.0.0-beta3.
  Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
