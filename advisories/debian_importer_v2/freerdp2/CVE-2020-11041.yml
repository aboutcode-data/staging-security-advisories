  - CVE-2020-11041
summary: In FreeRDP less than or equal to 2.0.0, an outside controlled array index is used unchecked
  for data used as configuration for sound backend (alsa, oss, pulse, ...). The most likely
  outcome is a crash of the client instance followed by no or distorted sound or a session disconnect.
  If a user cannot upgrade to the patched version, a workaround is to disable sound for the
  session. This has been patched in 2.1.0.
