  - CVE-2022-24883
summary: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Prior to version
  2.7.0, server side authentication against a `SAM` file might be successful for invalid credentials
  if the server has configured an invalid `SAM` file path. FreeRDP based clients are not affected.
  RDP server implementations using FreeRDP to authenticate against a `SAM` file are affected.
  Version 2.7.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, use custom authentication via
  `HashCallback` and/or ensure the `SAM` database path configured is valid and the application
  has file handles left.
