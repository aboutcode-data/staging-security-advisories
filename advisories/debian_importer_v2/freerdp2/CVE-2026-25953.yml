  - CVE-2026-25953
summary: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. Prior to version 3.23.0,
  `xf_AppUpdateWindowFromSurface` reads from a freed `xfAppWindow` because the RDPGFX DVC thread
  obtains a bare pointer via `xf_rail_get_window` without any lifetime protection, while the
  main thread can concurrently delete the window through a fastpath window-delete order. Version
  3.23.0 fixes the issue.
