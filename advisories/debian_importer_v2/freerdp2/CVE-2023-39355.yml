  - CVE-2023-39355
summary: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under
  the Apache license. Versions of FreeRDP on the 3.x release branch before beta3 are subject
  to a Use-After-Free in processing `RDPGFX_CMDID_RESETGRAPHICS` packets. If `context->maxPlaneSize`
  is 0, `context->planesBuffer` will be freed. However, without updating `context->planesBuffer`,
  this leads to a Use-After-Free exploit vector. In most environments this should only result
  in a crash. This issue has been addressed in version 3.0.0-beta3 and users of the beta 3.x
  releases are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
