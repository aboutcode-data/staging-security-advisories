  - CVE-2026-25954
summary: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. Prior to version 3.23.0,
  `xf_rail_server_local_move_size` dereferences a freed `xfAppWindow` pointer because `xf_rail_get_window`
  returns an unprotected pointer from the `railWindows` hash table, and the main thread can
  concurrently delete the window (via a window delete order) while the RAIL channel thread is
  still using the pointer. Version 3.23.0 fixes the issue.
