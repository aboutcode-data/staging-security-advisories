  - CVE-2026-23530
summary: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. Prior to version 3.21.0,`freerdp_bitmap_decompress_planar`
  does not validate `nSrcWidth`/`nSrcHeight` against `planar->maxWidth`/`maxHeight` before RLE
  decode. A malicious server can trigger a client‑side heap buffer overflow, causing a crash
  (DoS) and potential heap corruption with code‑execution risk depending on allocator behavior
  and surrounding heap layout. Version 3.21.0 contains a patch for the issue.
