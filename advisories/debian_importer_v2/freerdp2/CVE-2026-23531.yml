  - CVE-2026-23531
summary: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. Prior to version 3.21.0,
  in ClearCodec, when `glyphData` is present, `clear_decompress` calls `freerdp_image_copy_no_overlap`
  without validating the destination rectangle, allowing an out-of-bounds read/write via crafted
  RDPGFX surface updates. A malicious server can trigger a client‑side heap buffer overflow,
  causing a crash (DoS) and potential heap corruption with code‑execution risk depending on
  allocator behavior and surrounding heap layout. Version 3.21.0 contains a patch for the issue.
