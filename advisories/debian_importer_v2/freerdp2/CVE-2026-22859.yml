summary: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. Prior to 3.20.1, the
  URBDRC client does not perform bounds checking on server‑supplied MSUSB_INTERFACE_DESCRIPTOR
  values and uses them as indices in libusb_udev_complete_msconfig_setup, causing an out‑of‑bounds
  read. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.20.1.
