  - CVE-2026-26965
summary: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. Prior to version 3.23.0,
  in the RLE planar decode path, `planar_decompress_plane_rle()` writes into `pDstData` at `((nYDst+y)
  * nDstStep) + (4*nXDst) + nChannel` without verifying that `(nYDst+nSrcHeight)` fits in the
  destination height or that `(nXDst+nSrcWidth)` fits in the destination stride. When `TempFormat
  != DstFormat`, `pDstData` becomes `planar->pTempData` (sized for the desktop), while `nYDst`
  is only validated against the **surface** by `is_within_surface()`. A malicious RDP server
  can exploit this to perform a heap out-of-bounds write with attacker-controlled offset and
  pixel data on any connecting FreeRDP client. The OOB write reaches up to 132,096 bytes past
  the temp buffer end, and  on the brk heap (desktop ≤ 128×128), an adjacent `NSC_CONTEXT` struct's
  `decode` function pointer is overwritten with attacker-controlled pixel data — control-flow–relevant
  corruption (function pointer overwritten) demonstrated under deterministic heap layout (`nsc->decode
  = 0xFF414141FF414141`). Version 3.23.0 fixes the vulnerability.
