  - CVE-2026-23534
summary: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. Prior to version 3.21.0,
  a client-side heap buffer overflow occurs in the ClearCodec bands decode path when crafted
  band coordinates allow writes past the end of the destination surface buffer. A malicious
  server can trigger a client‑side heap buffer overflow, causing a crash (DoS) and potential
  heap corruption with code‑execution risk depending on allocator behavior and surrounding heap
  layout. Version 3.21.0 contains a patch for the issue.
