  - CVE-2011-1075
summary: FreeBSD's crontab calculates the MD5 sum of the previous and new cronjob to determine
  if any changes have been made before copying the new version in. In particular, it uses the
  MD5File() function, which takes a pathname as an argument, and is called with euid 0. A race
  condition in this process may lead to an arbitrary MD5 comparison regardless of the read permissions.
