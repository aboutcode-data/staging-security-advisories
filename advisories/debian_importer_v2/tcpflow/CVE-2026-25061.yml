  - CVE-2026-25061
summary: tcpflow is a TCP/IP packet demultiplexer. In versions up to and including 1.61, wifipcap
  parses 802.11 management frame elements and performs a length check on the wrong field when
  handling the TIM element. A crafted frame with a large TIM length can cause a 1-byte out-of-bounds
  write past `tim.bitmap[251]`. The overflow is small and DoS is the likely impact; code execution
  is potential, but still up in the air. The affected structure is stack-allocated in `handle_beacon()`
  and related handlers. As of time of publication, no known patches are available.
