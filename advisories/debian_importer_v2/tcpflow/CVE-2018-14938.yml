summary: An issue was discovered in wifipcap/wifipcap.cpp in TCPFLOW through 1.5.0-alpha. There
  is an integer overflow in the function handle_prism during caplen processing. If the caplen
  is less than 144, one can cause an integer overflow in the function handle_80211, which will
  result in an out-of-bounds read and may allow access to sensitive memory (or a denial of service).
