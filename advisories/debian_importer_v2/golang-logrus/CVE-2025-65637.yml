  - CVE-2025-65637
summary: A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in github.com/sirupsen/logrus when using Entry.Writer()
  to log a single-line payload larger than 64KB without newline characters. Due to limitations
  in the internal bufio.Scanner, the read fails with "token too long" and the writer pipe is
  closed, leaving Writer() unusable and causing application unavailability (DoS). This affects
  versions < 1.8.3, 1.9.0, and 1.9.2. The issue is fixed in 1.8.3, 1.9.1, and 1.9.3+, where
  the input is chunked and the writer continues to function even if an error is logged.
