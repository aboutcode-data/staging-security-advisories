aliases:
  - CVE-2016-8624
summary: curl before version 7.51.0 doesn't parse the authority component of the URL correctly
  when the host name part ends with a '#' character, and could instead be tricked into connecting
  to a different host. This may have security implications if you for example use an URL parser
  that follows the RFC to check for allowed domains before using curl to request them.
