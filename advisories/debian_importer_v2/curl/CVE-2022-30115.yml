  - CVE-2022-30115
summary: Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS directly insteadof using
  an insecure clear-text HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in theURL. This mechanism could
  be bypassed if the host name in the given URL used atrailing dot while not using one when
  it built the HSTS cache. Or the otherway around - by having the trailing dot in the HSTS cache
  and *not* using thetrailing dot in the URL.
