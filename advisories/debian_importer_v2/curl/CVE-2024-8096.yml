aliases:
  - CVE-2024-8096
summary: When curl is told to use the Certificate Status Request TLS extension, often referred
  to as OCSP stapling, to verify that the server certificate is valid, it might fail to detect
  some OCSP problems and instead wrongly consider the response as fine.  If the returned status
  reports another error than 'revoked' (like for example 'unauthorized') it is not treated as
  a bad certficate.
