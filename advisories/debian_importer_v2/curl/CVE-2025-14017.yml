  - CVE-2025-14017
summary: When doing multi-threaded LDAPS transfers (LDAP over TLS) with libcurl, changing TLS
  options in one thread would inadvertently change them globally and therefore possibly also
  affect other concurrently setup transfers.  Disabling certificate verification for a specific
  transfer could unintentionally disable the feature for other threads as well.
