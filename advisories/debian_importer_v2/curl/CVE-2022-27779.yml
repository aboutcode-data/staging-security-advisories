  - CVE-2022-27779
summary: libcurl wrongly allows cookies to be set for Top Level Domains (TLDs) if thehost name
  is provided with a trailing dot.curl can be told to receive and send cookies. curl's "cookie
  engine" can bebuilt with or without [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/)awareness.
  If PSL support not provided, a more rudimentary check exists to atleast prevent cookies from
  being set on TLDs. This check was broken if thehost name in the URL uses a trailing dot.This
  can allow arbitrary sites to set cookies that then would get sent to adifferent and unrelated
  site or domain.
