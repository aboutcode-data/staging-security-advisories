summary: 'curl before 7.86.0 has a double free. If curl is told to use an HTTP proxy for a transfer
  with a non-HTTP(S) URL, it sets up the connection to the remote server by issuing a CONNECT
  request to the proxy, and then tunnels the rest of the protocol through. An HTTP proxy might
  refuse this request (HTTP proxies often only allow outgoing connections to specific port numbers,
  like 443 for HTTPS) and instead return a non-200 status code to the client. Due to flaws in
  the error/cleanup handling, this could trigger a double free in curl if one of the following
  schemes were used in the URL for the transfer: dict, gopher, gophers, ldap, ldaps, rtmp, rtmps,
  or telnet. The earliest affected version is 7.77.0.'
