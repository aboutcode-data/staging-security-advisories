  - CVE-2024-2398
summary: When an application tells libcurl it wants to allow HTTP/2 server push, and the amount
  of received headers for the push surpasses the maximum allowed limit (1000), libcurl aborts
  the server push. When aborting, libcurl inadvertently does not free all the previously allocated
  headers and instead leaks the memory.  Further, this error condition fails silently and is
  therefore not easily detected by an application.
