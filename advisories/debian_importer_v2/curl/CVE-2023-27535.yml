  - CVE-2023-27535
summary: An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl <8.0.0 in the FTP connection
  reuse feature that can result in wrong credentials being used during subsequent transfers.
  Previously created connections are kept in a connection pool for reuse if they match the current
  setup. However, certain FTP settings such as CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT, CURLOPT_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER,
  CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC, and CURLOPT_USE_SSL were not included in the configuration match checks,
  causing them to match too easily. This could lead to libcurl using the wrong credentials when
  performing a transfer, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.
