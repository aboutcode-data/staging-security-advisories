aliases:
  - CVE-2019-5443
summary: A non-privileged user or program can put code and a config file in a known non-privileged
  path (under C:/usr/local/) that will make curl <= 7.65.1 automatically run the code (as an
  openssl "engine") on invocation. If that curl is invoked by a privileged user it can do anything
  it wants.
