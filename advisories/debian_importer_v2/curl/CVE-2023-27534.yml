  - CVE-2023-27534
summary: A path traversal vulnerability exists in curl <8.0.0 SFTP implementation causes the
  tilde (~) character to be wrongly replaced when used as a prefix in the first path element,
  in addition to its intended use as the first element to indicate a path relative to the user's
  home directory. Attackers can exploit this flaw to bypass filtering or execute arbitrary code
  by crafting a path like /~2/foo while accessing a server with a specific user.
