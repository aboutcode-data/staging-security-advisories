  - CVE-2017-9502
summary: 'In curl before 7.54.1 on Windows and DOS, libcurl''s default protocol function, which
  is the logic that allows an application to set which protocol libcurl should attempt to use
  when given a URL without a scheme part, had a flaw that could lead to it overwriting a heap
  based memory buffer with seven bytes. If the default protocol is specified to be FILE or a
  file: URL lacks two slashes, the given "URL" starts with a drive letter, and libcurl is built
  for Windows or DOS, then libcurl would copy the path 7 bytes off, so that the end of the given
  path would write beyond the malloc buffer (7 bytes being the length in bytes of the ascii
  string "file://").'
