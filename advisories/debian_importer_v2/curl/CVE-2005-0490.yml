aliases:
  - CVE-2005-0490
summary: Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in libcURL and cURL 7.12.1, and possibly other
  versions, allow remote malicious web servers to execute arbitrary code via base64 encoded
  replies that exceed the intended buffer lengths when decoded, which is not properly handled
  by (1) the Curl_input_ntlm function in http_ntlm.c during NTLM authentication or (2) the Curl_krb_kauth
  and krb4_auth functions in krb4.c during Kerberos authentication.
