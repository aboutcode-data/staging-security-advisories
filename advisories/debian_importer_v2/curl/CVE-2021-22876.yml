  - CVE-2021-22876
summary: 'curl 7.1.1 to and including 7.75.0 is vulnerable to an "Exposure of Private Personal
  Information to an Unauthorized Actor" by leaking credentials in the HTTP Referer: header.
  libcurl does not strip off user credentials from the URL when automatically populating the
  Referer: HTTP request header field in outgoing HTTP requests, and therefore risks leaking
  sensitive data to the server that is the target of the second HTTP request.'
