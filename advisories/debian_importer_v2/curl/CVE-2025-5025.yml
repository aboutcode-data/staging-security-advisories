aliases:
  - CVE-2025-5025
summary: libcurl supports *pinning* of the server certificate public key for HTTPS transfers.
  Due to an omission, this check is not performed when connecting with QUIC for HTTP/3, when
  the TLS backend is wolfSSL. Documentation says the option works with wolfSSL, failing to specify
  that it does not for QUIC and HTTP/3. Since pinning makes the transfer succeed if the pin
  is fine, users could unwittingly connect to an impostor server without noticing.
