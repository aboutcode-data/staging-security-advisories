  - CVE-2023-27536
summary: An authentication bypass vulnerability exists libcurl <8.0.0 in the connection reuse
  feature which can reuse previously established connections with incorrect user permissions
  due to a failure to check for changes in the CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION option. This vulnerability
  affects krb5/kerberos/negotiate/GSSAPI transfers and could potentially result in unauthorized
  access to sensitive information. The safest option is to not reuse connections if the CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION
  option has been changed.
