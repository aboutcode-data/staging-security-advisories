  - CVE-2017-1000100
summary: When doing a TFTP transfer and curl/libcurl is given a URL that contains a very long
  file name (longer than about 515 bytes), the file name is truncated to fit within the buffer
  boundaries, but the buffer size is still wrongly updated to use the untruncated length. This
  too large value is then used in the sendto() call, making curl attempt to send more data than
  what is actually put into the buffer. The endto() function will then read beyond the end of
  the heap based buffer. A malicious HTTP(S) server could redirect a vulnerable libcurl-using
  client to a crafted TFTP URL (if the client hasn't restricted which protocols it allows redirects
  to) and trick it to send private memory contents to a remote server over UDP. Limit curl's
  redirect protocols with --proto-redir and libcurl's with CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS.
