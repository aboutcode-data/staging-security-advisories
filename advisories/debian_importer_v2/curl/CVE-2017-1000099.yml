  - CVE-2017-1000099
summary: When asking to get a file from a file:// URL, libcurl provides a feature that outputs
  meta-data about the file using HTTP-like headers. The code doing this would send the wrong
  buffer to the user (stdout or the application's provide callback), which could lead to other
  private data from the heap to get inadvertently displayed. The wrong buffer was an uninitialized
  memory area allocated on the heap and if it turned out to not contain any zero byte, it would
  continue and display the data following that buffer in memory.
