  - CVE-2023-28322
summary: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in curl <v8.1.0 when doing HTTP(S) transfers,
  libcurl might erroneously use the read callback (`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`) to ask for data to
  send, even when the `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` option has been set, if the same handle previously
  wasused to issue a `PUT` request which used that callback. This flaw may surprise the application
  and cause it to misbehave and either send off the wrong data or use memory after free or similar
  in the second transfer. The problem exists in the logic for a reused handle when it is (expected
  to be) changed from a PUT to a POST.
