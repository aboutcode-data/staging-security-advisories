aliases:
  - CVE-2016-8616
summary: A flaw was found in curl before version 7.51.0 When re-using a connection, curl was
  doing case insensitive comparisons of user name and password with the existing connections.
  This means that if an unused connection with proper credentials exists for a protocol that
  has connection-scoped credentials, an attacker can cause that connection to be reused if s/he
  knows the case-insensitive version of the correct password.
