aliases:
  - CVE-2021-22922
summary: When curl is instructed to download content using the metalink feature, thecontents
  is verified against a hash provided in the metalink XML file.The metalink XML file points
  out to the client how to get the same contentfrom a set of different URLs, potentially hosted
  by different servers and theclient can then download the file from one or several of them.
  In a serial orparallel manner.If one of the servers hosting the contents has been breached
  and the contentsof the specific file on that server is replaced with a modified payload, curlshould
  detect this when the hash of the file mismatches after a completeddownload. It should remove
  the contents and instead try getting the contentsfrom another URL. This is not done, and instead
  such a hash mismatch is onlymentioned in text and the potentially malicious content is kept
  in the file ondisk.
