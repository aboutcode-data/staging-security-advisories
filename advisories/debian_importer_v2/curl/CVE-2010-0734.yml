aliases:
  - CVE-2010-0734
summary: content_encoding.c in libcurl 7.10.5 through 7.19.7, when zlib is enabled, does not
  properly restrict the amount of callback data sent to an application that requests automatic
  decompression, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application
  crash) or have unspecified other impact by sending crafted compressed data to an application
  that relies on the intended data-length limit.
