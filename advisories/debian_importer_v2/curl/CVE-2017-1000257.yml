  - CVE-2017-1000257
summary: An IMAP FETCH response line indicates the size of the returned data, in number of bytes.
  When that response says the data is zero bytes, libcurl would pass on that (non-existing)
  data with a pointer and the size (zero) to the deliver-data function. libcurl's deliver-data
  function treats zero as a magic number and invokes strlen() on the data to figure out the
  length. The strlen() is called on a heap based buffer that might not be zero terminated so
  libcurl might read beyond the end of it into whatever memory lies after (or just crash) and
  then deliver that to the application as if it was actually downloaded.
