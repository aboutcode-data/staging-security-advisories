  - CVE-2021-22924
summary: libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for subsequenttransfers
  to reuse, if one of them matches the setup.Due to errors in the logic, the config matching
  function did not take 'issuercert' into account and it compared the involved paths *case insensitively*,which
  could lead to libcurl reusing wrong connections.File paths are, or can be, case sensitive
  on many systems but not all, and caneven vary depending on used file systems.The comparison
  also didn't include the 'issuer cert' which a transfer can setto qualify how to verify the
  server certificate.
