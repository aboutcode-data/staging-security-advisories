  - CVE-2021-22890
summary: curl 7.63.0 to and including 7.75.0 includes vulnerability that allows a malicious
  HTTPS proxy to MITM a connection due to bad handling of TLS 1.3 session tickets. When using
  a HTTPS proxy and TLS 1.3, libcurl can confuse session tickets arriving from the HTTPS proxy
  but work as if they arrived from the remote server and then wrongly "short-cut" the host handshake.
  When confusing the tickets, a HTTPS proxy can trick libcurl to use the wrong session ticket
  resume for the host and thereby circumvent the server TLS certificate check and make a MITM
  attack to be possible to perform unnoticed. Note that such a malicious HTTPS proxy needs to
  provide a certificate that curl will accept for the MITMed server for an attack to work -
  unless curl has been told to ignore the server certificate check.
