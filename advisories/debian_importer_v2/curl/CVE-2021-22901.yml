  - CVE-2021-22901
summary: curl 7.75.0 through 7.76.1 suffers from a use-after-free vulnerability resulting in
  already freed memory being used when a TLS 1.3 session ticket arrives over a connection. A
  malicious server can use this in rare unfortunate circumstances to potentially reach remote
  code execution in the client. When libcurl at run-time sets up support for TLS 1.3 session
  tickets on a connection using OpenSSL, it stores pointers to the transfer in-memory object
  for later retrieval when a session ticket arrives. If the connection is used by multiple transfers
  (like with a reused HTTP/1.1 connection or multiplexed HTTP/2 connection) that first transfer
  object might be freed before the new session is established on that connection and then the
  function will access a memory buffer that might be freed. When using that memory, libcurl
  might even call a function pointer in the object, making it possible for a remote code execution
  if the server could somehow manage to get crafted memory content into the correct place in
  memory.
