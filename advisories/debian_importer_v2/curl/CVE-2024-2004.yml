  - CVE-2024-2004
summary: When a protocol selection parameter option disables all protocols without adding any
  then the default set of protocols would remain in the allowed set due to an error in the logic
  for removing protocols. The below command would perform a request to curl.se with a plaintext
  protocol which has been explicitly disabled.      curl --proto -all,-http http://curl.se  The
  flaw is only present if the set of selected protocols disables the entire set of available
  protocols, in itself a command with no practical use and therefore unlikely to be encountered
  in real situations. The curl security team has thus assessed this to be low severity bug.
