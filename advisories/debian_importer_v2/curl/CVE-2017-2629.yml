aliases:
  - CVE-2017-2629
summary: curl before 7.53.0 has an incorrect TLS Certificate Status Request extension feature
  that asks for a fresh proof of the server's certificate's validity in the code that checks
  for a test success or failure. It ends up always thinking there's valid proof, even when there
  is none or if the server doesn't support the TLS extension in question. This could lead to
  users not detecting when a server's certificate goes invalid or otherwise be mislead that
  the server is in a better shape than it is in reality. This flaw also exists in the command
  line tool (--cert-status).
