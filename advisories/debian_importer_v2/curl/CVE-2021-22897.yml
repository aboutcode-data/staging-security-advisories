  - CVE-2021-22897
summary: curl 7.61.0 through 7.76.1 suffers from exposure of data element to wrong session due
  to a mistake in the code for CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST when libcurl is built to use the Schannel
  TLS library. The selected cipher set was stored in a single "static" variable in the library,
  which has the surprising side-effect that if an application sets up multiple concurrent transfers,
  the last one that sets the ciphers will accidentally control the set used by all transfers.
  In a worst-case scenario, this weakens transport security significantly.
