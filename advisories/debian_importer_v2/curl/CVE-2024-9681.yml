  - CVE-2024-9681
summary: When curl is asked to use HSTS, the expiry time for a subdomain might overwrite a parent
  domain's cache entry, making it end sooner or later than otherwise intended.  This affects
  curl using applications that enable HSTS and use URLs with the insecure `HTTP://` scheme and
  perform transfers with hosts like `x.example.com` as well as `example.com` where the first
  host is a subdomain of the second host.  (The HSTS cache either needs to have been populated
  manually or there needs to have been previous HTTPS accesses done as the cache needs to have
  entries for the domains involved to trigger this problem.)  When `x.example.com` responds
  with `Strict-Transport-Security:` headers, this bug can make the subdomain's expiry timeout
  *bleed over* and get set for the parent domain `example.com` in curl's HSTS cache.  The result
  of a triggered bug is that HTTP accesses to `example.com` get converted to HTTPS for a different
  period of time than what was asked for by the origin server. If `example.com` for example
  stops supporting HTTPS at its expiry time, curl might then fail to access `http://example.com`
  until the (wrongly set) timeout expires. This bug can also expire the parent's entry *earlier*,
  thus making curl inadvertently switch back to insecure HTTP earlier than otherwise intended.
