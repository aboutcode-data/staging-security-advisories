  - CVE-2021-22925
summary: curl supports the `-t` command line option, known as `CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS`in libcurl.
  This rarely used option is used to send variable=content pairs toTELNET servers.Due to flaw
  in the option parser for sending `NEW_ENV` variables, libcurlcould be made to pass on uninitialized
  data from a stack based buffer to theserver. Therefore potentially revealing sensitive internal
  information to theserver using a clear-text network protocol.This could happen because curl
  did not call and use sscanf() correctly whenparsing the string provided by the application.
