  - CVE-2023-27537
summary: A double free vulnerability exists in libcurl <8.0.0 when sharing HSTS data between
  separate "handles". This sharing was introduced without considerations for do this sharing
  across separate threads but there was no indication of this fact in the documentation. Due
  to missing mutexes or thread locks, two threads sharing the same HSTS data could end up doing
  a double-free or use-after-free.
