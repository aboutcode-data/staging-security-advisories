  - CVE-2018-16840
summary: A heap use-after-free flaw was found in curl versions from 7.59.0 through 7.61.1 in
  the code related to closing an easy handle. When closing and cleaning up an 'easy' handle
  in the `Curl_close()` function, the library code first frees a struct (without nulling the
  pointer) and might then subsequently erroneously write to a struct field within that already
  freed struct.
