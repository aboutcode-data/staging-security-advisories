  - CVE-2017-2628
summary: curl, as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 before version 7.19.7-53, did not correctly
  backport the fix for CVE-2015-3148 because it did not reflect the fact that the HAVE_GSSAPI
  define was meanwhile substituted by USE_HTTP_NEGOTIATE. This issue was introduced in RHEL
  6.7 and affects RHEL 6 curl only.
