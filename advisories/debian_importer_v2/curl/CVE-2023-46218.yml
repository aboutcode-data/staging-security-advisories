  - CVE-2023-46218
summary: This flaw allows a malicious HTTP server to set "super cookies" in curl that are then
  passed back to more origins than what is otherwise allowed or possible. This allows a site
  to set cookies that then would get sent to different and unrelated sites and domains.  It
  could do this by exploiting a mixed case flaw in curl's function that verifies a given cookie
  domain against the Public Suffix List (PSL). For example a cookie could be set with `domain=co.UK`
  when the URL used a lower case hostname `curl.co.uk`, even though `co.uk` is listed as a PSL
  domain.
