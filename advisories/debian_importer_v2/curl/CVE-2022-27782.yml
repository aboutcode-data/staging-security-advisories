  - CVE-2022-27782
summary: libcurl would reuse a previously created connection even when a TLS or SSHrelated option
  had been changed that should have prohibited reuse.libcurl keeps previously used connections
  in a connection pool for subsequenttransfers to reuse if one of them matches the setup. However,
  several TLS andSSH settings were left out from the configuration match checks, making themmatch
  too easily.
