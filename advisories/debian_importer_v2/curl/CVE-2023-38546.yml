summary: This flaw allows an attacker to insert cookies at will into a running program using
  libcurl, if the specific series of conditions are met.  libcurl performs transfers. In its
  API, an application creates "easy handles" that are the individual handles for single transfers.  libcurl
  provides a function call that duplicates en easy handle called [curl_easy_duphandle](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_duphandle.html).  If
  a transfer has cookies enabled when the handle is duplicated, the cookie-enable state is also
  cloned - but without cloning the actual cookies. If the source handle did not read any cookies
  from a specific file on disk, the cloned version of the handle would instead store the file
  name as `none` (using the four ASCII letters, no quotes).  Subsequent use of the cloned handle
  that does not explicitly set a source to load cookies from would then inadvertently load cookies
  from a file named `none` - if such a file exists and is readable in the current directory
  of the program using libcurl. And if using the correct file format of course.
