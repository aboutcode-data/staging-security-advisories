  - CVE-2023-23914
summary: A cleartext transmission of sensitive information vulnerability exists in curl <v7.88.0
  that could cause HSTS functionality fail when multiple URLs are requested serially. Using
  its HSTS support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS instead of usingan insecure clear-text
  HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in the URL. ThisHSTS mechanism would however surprisingly
  be ignored by subsequent transferswhen done on the same command line because the state would
  not be properlycarried on.
