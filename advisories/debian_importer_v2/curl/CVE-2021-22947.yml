  - CVE-2021-22947
summary: When curl >= 7.20.0 and <= 7.78.0 connects to an IMAP or POP3 server to retrieve data
  using STARTTLS to upgrade to TLS security, the server can respond and send back multiple responses
  at once that curl caches. curl would then upgrade to TLS but not flush the in-queue of cached
  responses but instead continue using and trustingthe responses it got *before* the TLS handshake
  as if they were authenticated.Using this flaw, it allows a Man-In-The-Middle attacker to first
  inject the fake responses, then pass-through the TLS traffic from the legitimate server and
  trick curl into sending data back to the user thinking the attacker's injected data comes
  from the TLS-protected server.
