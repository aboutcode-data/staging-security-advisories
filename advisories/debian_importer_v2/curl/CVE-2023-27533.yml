aliases:
  - CVE-2023-27533
summary: A vulnerability in input validation exists in curl <8.0 during communication using
  the TELNET protocol may allow an attacker to pass on maliciously crafted user name and "telnet
  options" during server negotiation. The lack of proper input scrubbing allows an attacker
  to send content or perform option negotiation without the application's intent. This vulnerability
  could be exploited if an application allows user input, thereby enabling attackers to execute
  arbitrary code on the system.
