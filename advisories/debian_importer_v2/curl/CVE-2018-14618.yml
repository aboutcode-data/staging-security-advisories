  - CVE-2018-14618
summary: curl before version 7.61.1 is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in the NTLM authentication
  code. The internal function Curl_ntlm_core_mk_nt_hash multiplies the length of the password
  by two (SUM) to figure out how large temporary storage area to allocate from the heap. The
  length value is then subsequently used to iterate over the password and generate output into
  the allocated storage buffer. On systems with a 32 bit size_t, the math to calculate SUM triggers
  an integer overflow when the password length exceeds 2GB (2^31 bytes). This integer overflow
  usually causes a very small buffer to actually get allocated instead of the intended very
  huge one, making the use of that buffer end up in a heap buffer overflow. (This bug is almost
  identical to CVE-2017-8816.)
