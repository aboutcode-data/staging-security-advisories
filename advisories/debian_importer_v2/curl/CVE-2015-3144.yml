  - CVE-2015-3144
summary: The fix_hostname function in cURL and libcurl 7.37.0 through 7.41.0 does not properly
  calculate an index, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds
  read or write and crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact via a zero-length host
  name, as demonstrated by "http://:80" and ":80."
