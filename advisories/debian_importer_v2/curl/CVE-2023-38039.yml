  - CVE-2023-38039
summary: When curl retrieves an HTTP response, it stores the incoming headers so that they can
  be accessed later via the libcurl headers API.  However, curl did not have a limit in how
  many or how large headers it would accept in a response, allowing a malicious server to stream
  an endless series of headers and eventually cause curl to run out of heap memory.
