aliases:
  - CVE-2025-7339
summary: on-headers is a node.js middleware for listening to when a response writes headers.
  A bug in on-headers versions `<1.1.0` may result in response headers being inadvertently modified
  when an array is passed to `response.writeHead()`. Users should upgrade to version 1.1.0 to
  receive a patch. Uses are strongly encouraged to upgrade to `1.1.0`, but this issue can be
  worked around by passing an object to `response.writeHead()` rather than an array.
