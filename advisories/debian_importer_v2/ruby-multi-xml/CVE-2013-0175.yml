aliases:
  - CVE-2013-0175
summary: multi_xml gem 0.5.2 for Ruby, as used in Grape before 0.2.6 and possibly other products,
  does not properly restrict casts of string values, which allows remote attackers to conduct
  object-injection attacks and execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial of service (memory
  and CPU consumption) involving nested XML entity references, by leveraging support for (1)
  YAML type conversion or (2) Symbol type conversion, a similar vulnerability to CVE-2013-0156.
