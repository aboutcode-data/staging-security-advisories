summary: RARLAB WinRAR Recovery Volume Improper Validation of Array Index Remote Code Execution
  Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected
  installations of RARLAB WinRAR. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability
  in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw
  exists within the processing of recovery volumes. The issue results from the lack of proper
  validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory access past the end of an allocated
