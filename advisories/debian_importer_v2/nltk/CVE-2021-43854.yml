  - CVE-2021-43854
summary: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a suite of open source Python modules, data sets,
  and tutorials supporting research and development in Natural Language Processing. Versions
  prior to 3.6.5 are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks. The
  vulnerability is present in PunktSentenceTokenizer, sent_tokenize and word_tokenize. Any users
  of this class, or these two functions, are vulnerable to the ReDoS attack. In short, a specifically
  crafted long input to any of these vulnerable functions will cause them to take a significant
  amount of execution time. If your program relies on any of the vulnerable functions for tokenizing
  unpredictable user input, then we would strongly recommend upgrading to a version of NLTK
  without the vulnerability. For users unable to upgrade the execution time can be bounded by
  limiting the maximum length of an input to any of the vulnerable functions. Our recommendation
  is to implement such a limit.
