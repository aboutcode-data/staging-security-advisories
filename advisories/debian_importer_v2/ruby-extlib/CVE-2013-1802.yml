aliases:
  - CVE-2013-1802
summary: The extlib gem 0.9.15 and earlier for Ruby does not properly restrict casts of string
  values, which might allow remote attackers to conduct object-injection attacks and execute
  arbitrary code, or cause a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption) by leveraging Action
  Pack support for (1) YAML type conversion or (2) Symbol type conversion, a similar vulnerability
  to CVE-2013-0156.
