  - CVE-2020-15261
summary: On Windows the Veyon Service before version 4.4.2 contains an unquoted service path
  vulnerability, allowing locally authenticated users with administrative privileges to run
  malicious executables with LocalSystem privileges. Since Veyon users (both students and teachers)
  usually don't have administrative privileges, this vulnerability is only dangerous in anyway
  unsafe setups. The problem has been fixed in version 4.4.2. As a workaround, the exploitation
  of the vulnerability can be prevented by revoking administrative privileges from all potentially
  untrustworthy users.
