  - CVE-2019-12290
summary: GNU libidn2 before 2.2.0 fails to perform the roundtrip checks specified in RFC3490
  Section 4.2 when converting A-labels to U-labels. This makes it possible in some circumstances
  for one domain to impersonate another. By creating a malicious domain that matches a target
  domain except for the inclusion of certain punycoded Unicode characters (that would be discarded
  when converted first to a Unicode label and then back to an ASCII label), arbitrary domains
  can be impersonated.
