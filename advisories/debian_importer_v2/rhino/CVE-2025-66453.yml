summary: 'Rhino is an open-source implementation of JavaScript written entirely in Java. Prior
  to 1.8.1, 1.7.15.1, and 1.7.14.1, when an application passed an attacker controlled float
  poing number into the toFixed() function, it might lead to high CPU consumption and a potential
  Denial of Service. Small numbers go through this call stack: NativeNumber.numTo > DToA.JS_dtostr
  > DToA.JS_dtoa > DToA.pow5mult where pow5mult attempts to raise 5 to a ridiculous power. This
  vulnerability is fixed in 1.8.1, 1.7.15.1, and 1.7.14.1.'
