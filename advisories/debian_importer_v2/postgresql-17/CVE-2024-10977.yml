  - CVE-2024-10977
summary: Client use of server error message in PostgreSQL allows a server not trusted under
  current SSL or GSS settings to furnish arbitrary non-NUL bytes to the libpq application.  For
  example, a man-in-the-middle attacker could send a long error message that a human or screen-scraper
  user of psql mistakes for valid query results.  This is probably not a concern for clients
  where the user interface unambiguously indicates the boundary between one error message and
  other text.  Versions before PostgreSQL 17.1, 16.5, 15.9, 14.14, 13.17, and 12.21 are affected.
