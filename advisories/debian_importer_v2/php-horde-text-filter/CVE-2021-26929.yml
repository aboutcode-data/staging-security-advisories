aliases:
  - CVE-2021-26929
summary: An XSS issue was discovered in Horde Groupware Webmail Edition through 5.2.22 (where
  the Horde_Text_Filter library before 2.3.7 is used). The attacker can send a plain text e-mail
  message, with JavaScript encoded as a link or email that is mishandled by preProcess in Text2html.php,
  because bespoke use of \x00\x00\x00 and \x01\x01\x01 interferes with XSS defenses.
