  - CVE-2017-7660
summary: Apache Solr uses a PKI based mechanism to secure inter-node communication when security
  is enabled. It is possible to create a specially crafted node name that does not exist as
  part of the cluster and point it to a malicious node. This can trick the nodes in cluster
  to believe that the malicious node is a member of the cluster. So, if Solr users have enabled
  BasicAuth authentication mechanism using the BasicAuthPlugin or if the user has implemented
  a custom Authentication plugin, which does not implement either "HttpClientInterceptorPlugin"
  or "HttpClientBuilderPlugin", his/her servers are vulnerable to this attack. Users who only
  use SSL without basic authentication or those who use Kerberos are not affected.
