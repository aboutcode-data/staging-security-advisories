  - CVE-2020-13957
summary: Apache Solr versions 6.6.0 to 6.6.6, 7.0.0 to 7.7.3 and 8.0.0 to 8.6.2 prevents some
  features considered dangerous (which could be used for remote code execution) to be configured
  in a ConfigSet that's uploaded via API without authentication/authorization. The checks in
  place to prevent such features can be circumvented by using a combination of UPLOAD/CREATE
  actions.
