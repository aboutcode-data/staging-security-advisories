  - CVE-2021-44548
summary: 'An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in DataImportHandler of Apache Solr allows
  an attacker to provide a Windows UNC path resulting in an SMB network call being made from
  the Solr host to another host on the network. If the attacker has wider access to the network,
  this may lead to SMB attacks, which may result in: * The exfiltration of sensitive data such
  as OS user hashes (NTLM/LM hashes), * In case of misconfigured systems, SMB Relay Attacks
  which can lead to user impersonation on SMB Shares or, in a worse-case scenario, Remote Code
  Execution This issue affects all Apache Solr versions prior to 8.11.1. This issue only affects
  Windows.'
