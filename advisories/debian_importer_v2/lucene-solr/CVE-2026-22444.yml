  - CVE-2026-22444
summary: 'The "create core" API of Apache Solr 8.6 through 9.10.0 lacks sufficient input validation
  on some API parameters, which can cause Solr to check the existence of and attempt to read
  file-system paths that should be disallowed by Solr''s  "allowPaths" security setting https://https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/configuration-guide/configuring-solr-xml.html#the-solr-element
  .  These read-only accesses can allow users to create cores using unexpected configsets if
  any are accessible via the filesystem.  On Windows systems configured to allow UNC paths this
  can additionally cause disclosure of NTLM "user" hashes.   Solr deployments are subject to
  this vulnerability if they meet the following criteria:   *  Solr is running in its "standalone"
  mode.   *  Solr''s "allowPath" setting is being used to restrict file access to certain directories.   *  Solr''s
  "create core" API is exposed and accessible to untrusted users.  This can happen if Solr''s  RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin
  https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/deployment-guide/rule-based-authorization-plugin.html  is
  disabled, or if it is enabled but the "core-admin-edit" predefined permission (or an equivalent
  custom permission) is given to low-trust (i.e. non-admin) user roles.  Users can mitigate
  this by enabling Solr''s RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin (if disabled) and configuring a permission-list
  that prevents untrusted users from creating new Solr cores.  Users should also upgrade to
  Apache Solr 9.10.1 or greater, which contain fixes for this issue.'
