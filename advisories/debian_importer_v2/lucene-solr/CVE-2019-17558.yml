summary: Apache Solr 5.0.0 to Apache Solr 8.3.1 are vulnerable to a Remote Code Execution through
  the VelocityResponseWriter. A Velocity template can be provided through Velocity templates
  in a configset `velocity/` directory or as a parameter. A user defined configset could contain
  renderable, potentially malicious, templates. Parameter provided templates are disabled by
  default, but can be enabled by setting `params.resource.loader.enabled` by defining a response
  writer with that setting set to `true`. Defining a response writer requires configuration
  API access. Solr 8.4 removed the params resource loader entirely, and only enables the configset-provided
  template rendering when the configset is `trusted` (has been uploaded by an authenticated
  user).
