aliases:
  - CVE-2018-8010
summary: This vulnerability in Apache Solr 6.0.0 to 6.6.3, 7.0.0 to 7.3.0 relates to an XML
  external entity expansion (XXE) in Solr config files (solrconfig.xml, schema.xml, managed-schema).
  In addition, Xinclude functionality provided in these config files is also affected in a similar
  way. The vulnerability can be used as XXE using file/ftp/http protocols in order to read arbitrary
  local files from the Solr server or the internal network. Users are advised to upgrade to
  either Solr 6.6.4 or Solr 7.3.1 releases both of which address the vulnerability. Once upgrade
  is complete, no other steps are required. Those releases only allow external entities and
  Xincludes that refer to local files / zookeeper resources below the Solr instance directory
  (using Solr's ResourceLoader); usage of absolute URLs is denied. Keep in mind, that external
  entities and XInclude are explicitly supported to better structure config files in large installations.
  Before Solr 6 this was no problem, as config files were not accessible through the APIs.
