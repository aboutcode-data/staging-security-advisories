summary: 'Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed
  Code Resources vulnerability in Apache Solr.  This issue affects Apache Solr: from 8.10.0
  through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.3.0.  The Schema Designer was introduced to allow users
  to more easily configure and test new Schemas and configSets. However, when the feature was
  created, the "trust" (authentication) of these configSets was not considered. External library
  loading is only available to configSets that are "trusted" (created by authenticated users),
  thus non-authenticated users are unable to perform Remote Code Execution. Since the Schema
  Designer loaded configSets without taking their "trust" into account, configSets that were
  created by unauthenticated users were allowed to load external libraries when used in the
  Schema Designer.  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.3.0, which fixes the issue.'
