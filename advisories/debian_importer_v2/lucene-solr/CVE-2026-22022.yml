  - CVE-2026-22022
summary: 'Deployments of Apache Solr 5.3.0 through 9.10.0 that rely on Solr''s "Rule Based Authorization
  Plugin" are vulnerable to allowing unauthorized access to certain Solr APIs, due to insufficiently
  strict input validation in those components.  Only deployments that meet all of the following
  criteria are impacted by this vulnerability:    *  Use of Solr''s "RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin"   *  A
  RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin config (see security.json) that specifies multiple "roles"   *  A
  RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin permission list (see security.json) that uses one or more of
  the following pre-defined permission rules: "config-read", "config-edit", "schema-read", "metrics-read",
  or "security-read".   *  A RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin permission list that doesn''t define
  the "all" pre-defined permission   *  A networking setup that allows clients to make unfiltered
  network requests to Solr. (i.e. user-submitted HTTP/HTTPS requests reach Solr as-is, unmodified
  or restricted by any intervening proxy or gateway)  Users can mitigate this vulnerability
  by ensuring that their RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin configuration specifies the "all" pre-defined
  permission and associates the permission with an "admin" or other privileged role.  Users
  can also upgrade to a Solr version outside of the impacted range, such as the recently released
  Solr 9.10.1.'
