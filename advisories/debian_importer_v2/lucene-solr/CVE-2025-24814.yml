  - CVE-2025-24814
summary: Core creation allows users to replace "trusted" configset files with arbitrary configuration  Solr
  instances that (1) use the "FileSystemConfigSetService" component (the default in "standalone"
  or "user-managed" mode), and (2) are running without authentication and authorization are
  vulnerable to a sort of privilege escalation wherein individual "trusted" configset files
  can be ignored in favor of potentially-untrusted replacements available elsewhere on the filesystem. 
  These replacement config files are treated as "trusted" and can use "<lib>" tags to add to
  Solr's classpath, which an attacker might use to load malicious code as a searchComponent
  or other plugin.  This issue affects all Apache Solr versions up through Solr 9.7.  Users
  can protect against the vulnerability by enabling authentication and authorization on their
  Solr clusters or switching to SolrCloud (and away from "FileSystemConfigSetService").  Users
  are also recommended to upgrade to Solr 9.8.0, which mitigates this issue by disabling use
  of "<lib>" tags by default.
