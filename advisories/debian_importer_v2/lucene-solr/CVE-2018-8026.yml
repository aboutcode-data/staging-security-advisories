aliases:
  - CVE-2018-8026
summary: This vulnerability in Apache Solr 6.0.0 to 6.6.4 and 7.0.0 to 7.3.1 relates to an XML
  external entity expansion (XXE) in Solr config files (currency.xml, enumsConfig.xml referred
  from schema.xml, TIKA parsecontext config file). In addition, Xinclude functionality provided
  in these config files is also affected in a similar way. The vulnerability can be used as
  XXE using file/ftp/http protocols in order to read arbitrary local files from the Solr server
  or the internal network. The manipulated files can be uploaded as configsets using Solr's
  API, allowing to exploit that vulnerability.
