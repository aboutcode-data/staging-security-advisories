  - CVE-2024-52012
summary: 'Relative Path Traversal vulnerability in Apache Solr.  Solr instances running on Windows
  are vulnerable to arbitrary filepath write-access, due to a lack of input-sanitation in the
  "configset upload" API.  Commonly known as a "zipslip", maliciously constructed ZIP files
  can use relative filepaths to write data to unanticipated parts of the filesystem.   This
  issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.6 through 9.7.0.  Users are recommended to upgrade to version
  9.8.0, which fixes the issue.  Users unable to upgrade may also safely prevent the issue by
  using Solr''s "Rule-Based Authentication Plugin" to restrict access to the configset upload
  API, so that it can only be accessed by a trusted set of administrators/users.'
