aliases:
  - CVE-2019-5060
summary: An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the XPM image rendering function
  of SDL2_image 2.0.4. A specially crafted XPM image can cause an integer overflow in the colorhash
  function, allocating too small of a buffer. This buffer can then be written out of bounds,
  resulting in a heap overflow, ultimately ending in code execution. An attacker can display
  a specially crafted image to trigger this vulnerability.
