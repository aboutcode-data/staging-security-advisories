  - CVE-2023-24808
summary: PDFio is a C library for reading and writing PDF files. In versions prior to 1.1.0
  a denial of service (DOS) vulnerability exists in the pdfio parser. Crafted pdf files can
  cause the program to run at 100% utilization and never terminate. The pdf which causes this
  crash found in testing is about 28kb in size and was discovered via fuzzing. Anyone who uses
  this library either as a standalone binary or as a library can be DOSed when attempting to
  parse this type of file. Web servers or other automated processes which rely on this code
  to turn pdf submissions into plaintext can be DOSed when an attacker uploads the pdf. Please
  see the linked GHSA for an example pdf. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
  for this vulnerability.
