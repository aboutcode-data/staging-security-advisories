  - CVE-2024-6763
summary: Eclipse Jetty is a lightweight, highly scalable, Java-based web server and Servlet
  engine . It includes a utility class, HttpURI, for URI/URL parsing.  The HttpURI class does
  insufficient validation on the authority segment of a URI.  However the behaviour of HttpURI  differs
  from the common browsers in how it handles a URI that would be  considered invalid if fully
  validated against the RRC.  Specifically HttpURI  and the browser may differ on the value
  of the host extracted from an  invalid URI and thus a combination of Jetty and a vulnerable
  browser may  be vulnerable to a open redirect attack or to a SSRF attack if the URI  is used
  after passing validation checks.
