summary: 'In Eclipse Jetty, versions <=9.4.57, <=10.0.25, <=11.0.25, <=12.0.21, <=12.1.0.alpha2,
  an HTTP/2 client may trigger the server to send RST_STREAM frames, for example by sending
  frames that are malformed or that should not be sent in a particular stream state, therefore
  forcing the server to consume resources such as CPU and memory.   For example, a client can
  open a stream and then send WINDOW_UPDATE frames with window size increment of 0, which is
  illegal. Per specification  https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113.html#name-window_update
  , the server should send a RST_STREAM frame. The client can now open another stream and send
  another bad WINDOW_UPDATE, therefore causing the server to consume more resources than necessary,
  as this case does not exceed the max number of concurrent streams, yet the client is able
  to create an enormous amount of streams in a short period of time.   The attack can be performed
  with other conditions (for example, a DATA frame for a closed stream) that cause the server
  to send a RST_STREAM frame.    Links:      *   https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/security/advisories/GHSA-mmxm-8w33-wc4h'
