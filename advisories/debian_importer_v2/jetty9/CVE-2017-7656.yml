  - CVE-2017-7656
summary: In Eclipse Jetty, versions 9.2.x and older, 9.3.x (all configurations), and 9.4.x (non-default
  configuration with RFC2616 compliance enabled), HTTP/0.9 is handled poorly. An HTTP/1 style
  request line (i.e. method space URI space version) that declares a version of HTTP/0.9 was
  accepted and treated as a 0.9 request. If deployed behind an intermediary that also accepted
  and passed through the 0.9 version (but did not act on it), then the response sent could be
  interpreted by the intermediary as HTTP/1 headers. This could be used to poison the cache
  if the server allowed the origin client to generate arbitrary content in the response.
