  - CVE-2020-27216
summary: In Eclipse Jetty versions 1.0 thru 9.4.32.v20200930, 10.0.0.alpha1 thru 10.0.0.beta2,
  and 11.0.0.alpha1 thru 11.0.0.beta2O, on Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory
  is shared between all users on that system. A collocated user can observe the process of creating
  a temporary sub directory in the shared temporary directory and race to complete the creation
  of the temporary subdirectory. If the attacker wins the race then they will have read and
  write permission to the subdirectory used to unpack web applications, including their WEB-INF/lib
  jar files and JSP files. If any code is ever executed out of this temporary directory, this
  can lead to a local privilege escalation vulnerability.
