  - CVE-2017-7657
summary: In Eclipse Jetty, versions 9.2.x and older, 9.3.x (all configurations), and 9.4.x (non-default
  configuration with RFC2616 compliance enabled), transfer-encoding chunks are handled poorly.
  The chunk length parsing was vulnerable to an integer overflow. Thus a large chunk size could
  be interpreted as a smaller chunk size and content sent as chunk body could be interpreted
  as a pipelined request. If Jetty was deployed behind an intermediary that imposed some authorization
  and that intermediary allowed arbitrarily large chunks to be passed on unchanged, then this
  flaw could be used to bypass the authorization imposed by the intermediary as the fake pipelined
  request would not be interpreted by the intermediary as a request.
