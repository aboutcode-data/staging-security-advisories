  - CVE-2020-27218
summary: In Eclipse Jetty version 9.4.0.RC0 to 9.4.34.v20201102, 10.0.0.alpha0 to 10.0.0.beta2,
  and 11.0.0.alpha0 to 11.0.0.beta2, if GZIP request body inflation is enabled and requests
  from different clients are multiplexed onto a single connection, and if an attacker can send
  a request with a body that is received entirely but not consumed by the application, then
  a subsequent request on the same connection will see that body prepended to its body. The
  attacker will not see any data but may inject data into the body of the subsequent request.
