  - CVE-2022-31015
summary: Waitress is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3. Waitress versions
  2.1.0 and 2.1.1 may terminate early due to a thread closing a socket while the main thread
  is about to call select(). This will lead to the main thread raising an exception that is
  not handled and then causing the entire application to be killed. This issue has been fixed
  in Waitress 2.1.2 by no longer allowing the WSGI thread to close the socket. Instead, that
  is always delegated to the main thread. There is no work-around for this issue. However, users
  using waitress behind a reverse proxy server are less likely to have issues if the reverse
  proxy always reads the full response.
