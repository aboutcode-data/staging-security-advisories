  - CVE-2024-49769
summary: Waitress is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3. When a remote
  client closes the connection before waitress has had the opportunity to call getpeername()
  waitress won't correctly clean up the connection leading to the main thread attempting to
  write to a socket that no longer exists, but not removing it from the list of sockets to attempt
  to process. This leads to a busy-loop calling the write function. A remote attacker could
  run waitress out of available sockets with very little resources required. Waitress 3.0.1
  contains fixes that remove the race condition.
