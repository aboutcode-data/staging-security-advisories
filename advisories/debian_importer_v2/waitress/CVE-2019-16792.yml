  - CVE-2019-16792
summary: Waitress through version 1.3.1 allows request smuggling by sending the Content-Length
  header twice. Waitress would header fold a double Content-Length header and due to being unable
  to cast the now comma separated value to an integer would set the Content-Length to 0 internally.
  If two Content-Length headers are sent in a single request, Waitress would treat the request
  as having no body, thereby treating the body of the request as a new request in HTTP pipelining.
  This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.
