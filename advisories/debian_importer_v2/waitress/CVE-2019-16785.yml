  - CVE-2019-16785
summary: 'Waitress through version 1.3.1 implemented a "MAY" part of the RFC7230 which states:
  "Although the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is the sequence CRLF, a
  recipient MAY recognize a single LF as a line terminator and ignore any preceding CR." Unfortunately
  if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF the same way as it does those
  with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message
  in two different ways. This can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby
  Waitress may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message.
  This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.'
