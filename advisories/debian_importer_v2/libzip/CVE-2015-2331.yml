aliases:
  - CVE-2015-2331
summary: Integer overflow in the _zip_cdir_new function in zip_dirent.c in libzip 0.11.2 and
  earlier, as used in the ZIP extension in PHP before 5.4.39, 5.5.x before 5.5.23, and 5.6.x
  before 5.6.7 and other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application
  crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a ZIP archive that contains many entries, leading
  to a heap-based buffer overflow.
