  - CVE-2023-28366
summary: The broker in Eclipse Mosquitto 1.3.2 through 2.x before 2.0.16 has a memory leak that
  can be abused remotely when a client sends many QoS 2 messages with duplicate message IDs,
  and fails to respond to PUBREC commands. This occurs because of mishandling of EAGAIN from
  the libc send function.
