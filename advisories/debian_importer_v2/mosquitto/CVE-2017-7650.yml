  - CVE-2017-7650
summary: In Mosquitto before 1.4.12, pattern based ACLs can be bypassed by clients that set
  their username/client id to '#' or '+'. This allows locally or remotely connected clients
  to access MQTT topics that they do have the rights to. The same issue may be present in third
  party authentication/access control plugins for Mosquitto.
