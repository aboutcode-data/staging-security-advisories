aliases:
  - CVE-2017-7652
summary: In Eclipse Mosquitto 1.4.14, if a Mosquitto instance is set running with a configuration
  file, then sending a HUP signal to server triggers the configuration to be reloaded from disk.
  If there are lots of clients connected so that there are no more file descriptors/sockets
  available (default limit typically 1024 file descriptors on Linux), then opening the configuration
  file will fail.
