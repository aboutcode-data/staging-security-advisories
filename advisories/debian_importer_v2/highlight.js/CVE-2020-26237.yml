  - CVE-2020-26237
summary: Highlight.js is a syntax highlighter written in JavaScript. Highlight.js versions before
  9.18.2 and 10.1.2 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. A malicious HTML code block can be
  crafted that will result in prototype pollution of the base object's prototype during highlighting.
  If you allow users to insert custom HTML code blocks into your page/app via parsing Markdown
  code blocks (or similar) and do not filter the language names the user can provide you may
  be vulnerable. The pollution should just be harmless data but this can cause problems for
  applications not expecting these properties to exist and can result in strange behavior or
  application crashes, i.e. a potential DOS vector. If your website or application does not
  render user provided data it should be unaffected. Versions 9.18.2 and 10.1.2 and newer include
  fixes for this vulnerability. If you are using version 7 or 8 you are encouraged to upgrade
  to a newer release.
