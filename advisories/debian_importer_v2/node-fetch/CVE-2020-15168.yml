  - CVE-2020-15168
summary: 'node-fetch before versions 2.6.1 and 3.0.0-beta.9 did not honor the size option after
  following a redirect, which means that when a content size was over the limit, a FetchError
  would never get thrown and the process would end without failure. For most people, this fix
  will have a little or no impact. However, if you are relying on node-fetch to gate files above
  a size, the impact could be significant, for example: If you don''t double-check the size
  of the data after fetch() has completed, your JS thread could get tied up doing work on a
  large file (DoS) and/or cost you money in computing.'
