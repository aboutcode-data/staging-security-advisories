  - CVE-2006-5170
summary: pam_ldap in nss_ldap on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, Fedora Core 3 and earlier, and
  possibly other distributions does not return an error condition when an LDAP directory server
  responds with a PasswordPolicyResponse control response, which causes the pam_authenticate
  function to return a success code even if authentication has failed, as originally reported
  for xscreensaver.
