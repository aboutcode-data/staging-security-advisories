  - CVE-2023-43643
summary: AntiSamy is a library for performing fast, configurable cleansing of HTML coming from
  untrusted sources. Prior to version 1.7.4, there is a potential for a mutation XSS (mXSS)
  vulnerability in AntiSamy caused by flawed parsing of the HTML being sanitized. To be subject
  to this vulnerability the `preserveComments` directive must be enabled in your policy file
  and also allow for certain tags at the same time. As a result, certain crafty inputs can result
  in elements in comment tags being interpreted as executable when using AntiSamy's sanitized
  output. This issue has been patched in AntiSamy 1.7.4 and later.
