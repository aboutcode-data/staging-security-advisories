aliases:
  - CVE-2022-0485
summary: A flaw was found in the copying tool `nbdcopy` of libnbd. When performing multi-threaded
  copies using asynchronous nbd calls, nbdcopy was blindly treating the completion of an asynchronous
  command as successful, rather than checking the *error parameter. This could result in the
  silent creation of a corrupted destination image.
