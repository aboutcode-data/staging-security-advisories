  - CVE-2023-46234
summary: browserify-sign is a package to duplicate the functionality of node's crypto public
  key functions, much of this is based on Fedor Indutny's work on indutny/tls.js. An upper bound
  check issue in `dsaVerify` function allows an attacker to construct signatures that can be
  successfully verified by any public key, thus leading to a signature forgery attack. All places
  in this project that involve DSA verification of user-input signatures will be affected by
  this vulnerability. This issue has been patched in version 4.2.2.
