  - CVE-2013-2777
summary: 'sudo before 1.7.10p5 and 1.8.x before 1.8.6p6, when the tty_tickets option is enabled,
  does not properly validate the controlling terminal device, which allows local users with
  sudo permissions to hijack the authorization of another terminal via vectors related to a
  session without a controlling terminal device and connecting to the standard input, output,
  and error file descriptors of another terminal.  NOTE: this is one of three closely-related
  vulnerabilities that were originally assigned CVE-2013-1776, but they have been SPLIT because
  of different affected versions.'
