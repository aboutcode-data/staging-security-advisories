aliases:
  - CVE-2007-3149
summary: 'sudo, when linked with MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5), does not properly check whether a user
  can currently authenticate to Kerberos, which allows local users to gain privileges, in a
  manner unintended by the sudo security model, via certain KRB5_ environment variable settings.  NOTE:
  another researcher disputes this vulnerability, stating that the attacker must be "a user,
  who can already log into your system, and can already use sudo."'
