summary: parse.c in sudo 1.6.9p17 through 1.6.9p19 does not properly interpret a system group
  (aka %group) in the sudoers file during authorization decisions for a user who belongs to
  that group, which allows local users to leverage an applicable sudoers file and gain root
  privileges via a sudo command.
