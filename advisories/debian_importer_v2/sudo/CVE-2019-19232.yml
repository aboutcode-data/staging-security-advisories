summary: 'In Sudo through 1.8.29, an attacker with access to a Runas ALL sudoer account can
  impersonate a nonexistent user by invoking sudo with a numeric uid that is not associated
  with any user. NOTE: The software maintainer believes that this is not a vulnerability because
  running a command via sudo as a user not present in the local password database is an intentional
  feature. Because this behavior surprised some users, sudo 1.8.30 introduced an option to enable/disable
  this behavior with the default being disabled. However, this does not change the fact that
  sudo was behaving as intended, and as documented, in earlier versions'
