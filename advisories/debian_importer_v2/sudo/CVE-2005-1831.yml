  - CVE-2005-1831
summary: 'Sudo 1.6.8p7 on SuSE Linux 9.3, and possibly other Linux distributions, allows local
  users to gain privileges by using sudo to call su, then entering a blank password and hitting
  CTRL-C. NOTE: SuSE and multiple third-party researchers have not been able to replicate this
  issue, stating "Sudo catches SIGINT and returns an empty string for the password so I don''t
  see how this could happen unless the user''s actual password was empty.'
