  - CVE-2019-19234
summary: 'In Sudo through 1.8.29, the fact that a user has been blocked (e.g., by using the
  ! character in the shadow file instead of a password hash) is not considered, allowing an
  attacker (who has access to a Runas ALL sudoer account) to impersonate any blocked user. NOTE:
  The software maintainer believes that this CVE is not valid. Disabling local password authentication
  for a user is not the same as disabling all access to that user--the user may still be able
  to login via other means (ssh key, kerberos, etc). Both the Linux shadow(5) and passwd(1)
  manuals are clear on this. Indeed it is a valid use case to have local accounts that are _only_
  accessible via sudo and that cannot be logged into with a password. Sudo 1.8.30 added an optional
  setting to check the _shell_ of the target user (not the encrypted password!) against the
  contents of /etc/shells but that is not the same thing as preventing access to users with
  an invalid password hash'
