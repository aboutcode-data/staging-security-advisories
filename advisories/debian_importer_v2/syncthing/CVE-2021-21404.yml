  - CVE-2021-21404
summary: Syncthing is a continuous file synchronization program. In Syncthing before version
  1.15.0, the relay server `strelaysrv` can be caused to crash and exit by sending a relay message
  with a negative length field. Similarly, Syncthing itself can crash for the same reason if
  given a malformed message from a malicious relay server when attempting to join the relay.
  Relay joins are essentially random (from a subset of low latency relays) and Syncthing will
  by default restart when crashing, at which point it's likely to pick another non-malicious
  relay. This flaw is fixed in version 1.15.0.
