  - CVE-2019-10784
summary: phppgadmin through 7.12.1 allows sensitive actions to be performed without validating
  that the request originated from the application. One such area, "database.php" does not verify
  the source of an HTTP request. This can be leveraged by a remote attacker to trick a logged-in
  administrator to visit a malicious page with a CSRF exploit and execute arbitrary system commands
  on the server.
