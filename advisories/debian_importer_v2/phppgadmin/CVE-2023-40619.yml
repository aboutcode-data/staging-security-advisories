aliases:
  - CVE-2023-40619
summary: phpPgAdmin 7.14.4 and earlier is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data which
  may lead to remote code execution because user-controlled data is directly passed to the PHP
  'unserialize()' function in multiple places. An example is the functionality to manage tables
  in 'tables.php' where the 'ma[]' POST parameter is deserialized.
