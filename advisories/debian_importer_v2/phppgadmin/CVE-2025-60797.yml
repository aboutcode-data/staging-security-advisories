  - CVE-2025-60797
summary: phpPgAdmin 7.13.0 and earlier contains a SQL injection vulnerability in dataexport.php
  at line 118. The application directly executes user-supplied SQL queries from the $_REQUEST['query']
  parameter without any sanitization or parameterization via $data->conn->Execute($_REQUEST['query']).
  An authenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL commands,
  potentially leading to complete database compromise, data theft, or privilege escalation.
