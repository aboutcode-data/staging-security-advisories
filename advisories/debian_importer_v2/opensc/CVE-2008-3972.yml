  - CVE-2008-3972
summary: pkcs15-tool in OpenSC before 0.11.6 does not apply security updates to a smart card
  unless the card's label matches the "OpenSC" string, which might allow physically proximate
  attackers to exploit vulnerabilities that the card owner expected were patched, as demonstrated
  by exploitation of CVE-2008-2235.
