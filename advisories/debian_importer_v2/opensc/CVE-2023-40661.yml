  - CVE-2023-40661
summary: "Several memory vulnerabilities were identified within the OpenSC packages, particularly\
  \ in the card enrollment process using pkcs15-init when a user or administrator enrolls cards.\
  \ To take advantage of these flaws, an attacker must have physical access to the computer\
  \ system and employ a custom-crafted USB device or smart card to manipulate responses to APDUs.\
  \ This manipulation can potentially allow \r compromise key generation, certificate loading,\
  \ and other card management operations during enrollment."
