aliases:
  - CVE-2023-40660
summary: A flaw was found in OpenSC packages that allow a potential PIN bypass. When a token/card
  is authenticated by one process, it can perform cryptographic operations in other processes
  when an empty zero-length pin is passed. This issue poses a security risk, particularly for
  OS logon/screen unlock and for small, permanently connected tokens to computers. Additionally,
  the token can internally track login status. This flaw allows an attacker to gain unauthorized
  access, carry out malicious actions, or compromise the system without the user's awareness.
