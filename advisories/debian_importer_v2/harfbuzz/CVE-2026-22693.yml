  - CVE-2026-22693
summary: HarfBuzz is a text shaping engine. Prior to version 12.3.0, a null pointer dereference
  vulnerability exists in the SubtableUnicodesCache::create function located in src/hb-ot-cmap-table.hh.
  The function fails to check if hb_malloc returns NULL before using placement new to construct
  an object at the returned pointer address. When hb_malloc fails to allocate memory (which
  can occur in low-memory conditions or when using custom allocators that simulate allocation
  failures), it returns NULL. The code then attempts to call the constructor on this null pointer
  using placement new syntax, resulting in undefined behavior and a Segmentation Fault. This
  issue has been patched in version 12.3.0.
