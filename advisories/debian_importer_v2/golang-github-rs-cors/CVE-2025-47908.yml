  - CVE-2025-47908
summary: Middleware causes a prohibitive amount of heap allocations when processing malicious
  preflight requests that include a Access-Control-Request-Headers (ACRH) header whose value
  contains many commas. This behavior can be abused by attackers to produce undue load on the
  middleware/server as an attempt to cause a denial of service.
