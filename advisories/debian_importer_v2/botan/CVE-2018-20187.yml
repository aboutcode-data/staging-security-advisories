  - CVE-2018-20187
summary: A side-channel issue was discovered in Botan before 2.9.0. An attacker capable of precisely
  measuring the time taken for ECC key generation may be able to derive information about the
  high bits of the secret key, as the function to derive the public point from the secret scalar
  uses an unblinded Montgomery ladder whose loop iteration count depends on the bitlength of
  the secret. This issue affects only key generation, not ECDSA signatures or ECDH key agreement.
