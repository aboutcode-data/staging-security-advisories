  - CVE-2021-40529
summary: The ElGamal implementation in Botan through 2.18.1, as used in Thunderbird and other
  products, allows plaintext recovery because, during interaction between two cryptographic
  libraries, a certain dangerous combination of the prime defined by the receiver's public key,
  the generator defined by the receiver's public key, and the sender's ephemeral exponents can
  lead to a cross-configuration attack against OpenPGP.
