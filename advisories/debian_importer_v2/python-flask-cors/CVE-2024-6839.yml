aliases:
  - CVE-2024-6839
summary: corydolphin/flask-cors version 4.0.1 contains an improper regex path matching vulnerability.
  The plugin prioritizes longer regex patterns over more specific ones when matching paths,
  which can lead to less restrictive CORS policies being applied to sensitive endpoints. This
  mismatch in regex pattern priority allows unauthorized cross-origin access to sensitive data
  or functionality, potentially exposing confidential information and increasing the risk of
  unauthorized actions by malicious actors.
