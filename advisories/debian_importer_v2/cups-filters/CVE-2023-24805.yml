  - CVE-2023-24805
summary: cups-filters contains backends, filters, and other software required to get the cups
  printing service working on operating systems other than macos. If you use the Backend Error
  Handler (beh) to create an accessible network printer, this security vulnerability can cause
  remote code execution. `beh.c` contains the line `retval = system(cmdline) >> 8;` which calls
  the `system` command with the operand `cmdline`. `cmdline` contains multiple user controlled,
  unsanitized values. As a result an attacker with network access to the hosted print server
  can exploit this vulnerability to inject system commands which are executed in the context
  of the running server. This issue has been addressed in commit `8f2740357` and is expected
  to be bundled in the next release. Users are advised to upgrade when possible and to restrict
  access to network printers in the meantime.
