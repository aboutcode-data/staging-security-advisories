aliases:
  - CVE-2020-28493
summary: This affects the package jinja2 from 0.0.0 and before 2.11.3. The ReDoS vulnerability
  is mainly due to the `_punctuation_re regex` operator and its use of multiple wildcards. The
  last wildcard is the most exploitable as it searches for trailing punctuation. This issue
  can be mitigated by Markdown to format user content instead of the urlize filter, or by implementing
  request timeouts and limiting process memory.
