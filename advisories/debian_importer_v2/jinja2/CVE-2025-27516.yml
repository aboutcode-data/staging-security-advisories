  - CVE-2025-27516
summary: Jinja is an extensible templating engine. Prior to 3.1.6, an oversight in how the Jinja
  sandboxed environment interacts with the |attr filter allows an attacker that controls the
  content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker
  needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of
  application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted
  templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the
  sandbox. However, it's possible to use the |attr filter to get a reference to a string's plain
  format method, bypassing the sandbox. After the fix, the |attr filter no longer bypasses the
  environment's attribute lookup. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.6.
