summary: 'An issue was discovered in Jinja2 2.10. The from_string function is prone to Server
  Side Template Injection (SSTI) where it takes the "source" parameter as a template object,
  renders it, and then returns it. The attacker can exploit it with {{INJECTION COMMANDS}} in
  a URI. NOTE: The maintainer and multiple third parties believe that this vulnerability isn''t
  valid because users shouldn''t use untrusted templates without sandboxing'
