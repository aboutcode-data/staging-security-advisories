  - CVE-2024-56326
summary: Jinja is an extensible templating engine. Prior to 3.1.5, An oversight in how the Jinja
  sandboxed environment detects calls to str.format allows an attacker that controls the content
  of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker
  needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of
  application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted
  templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the
  sandbox. However, it's possible to store a reference to a malicious string's format method,
  then pass that to a filter that calls it. No such filters are built-in to Jinja, but could
  be present through custom filters in an application. After the fix, such indirect calls are
  also handled by the sandbox. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.5.
