  - CVE-2025-27406
summary: Icinga Reporting is the central component for reporting related functionality in the
  monitoring web frontend and framework Icinga Web 2. A vulnerability present in versions 0.10.0
  through 1.0.2 allows to set up a template that allows to embed arbitrary Javascript. This
  enables the attacker to act on behalf of the user, if the template is being previewed; and
  act on behalf of the headless browser, if a report using the template is printed to PDF. This
  issue has been resolved in version 1.0.3 of Icinga Reporting. As a workaround, review all
  templates and remove suspicious settings.
