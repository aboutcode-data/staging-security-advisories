aliases:
  - CVE-2022-1941
summary: A parsing vulnerability for the MessageSet type in the ProtocolBuffers versions prior
  to and including 3.16.1, 3.17.3, 3.18.2, 3.19.4, 3.20.1 and 3.21.5 for protobuf-cpp, and versions
  prior to and including 3.16.1, 3.17.3, 3.18.2, 3.19.4, 3.20.1 and 4.21.5 for protobuf-python
  can lead to out of memory failures. A specially crafted message with multiple key-value per
  elements creates parsing issues, and can lead to a Denial of Service against services receiving
  unsanitized input. We recommend upgrading to versions 3.18.3, 3.19.5, 3.20.2, 3.21.6 for protobuf-cpp
  and 3.18.3, 3.19.5, 3.20.2, 4.21.6 for protobuf-python. Versions for 3.16 and 3.17 are no
  longer updated.
