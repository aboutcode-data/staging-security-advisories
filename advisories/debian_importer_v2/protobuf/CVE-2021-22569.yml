aliases:
  - CVE-2021-22569
summary: An issue in protobuf-java allowed the interleaving of com.google.protobuf.UnknownFieldSet
  fields in such a way that would be processed out of order. A small malicious payload can occupy
  the parser for several minutes by creating large numbers of short-lived objects that cause
  frequent, repeated pauses. We recommend upgrading libraries beyond the vulnerable versions.
