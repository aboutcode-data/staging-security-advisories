aliases:
  - CVE-2019-5737
summary: In Node.js including 6.x before 6.17.0, 8.x before 8.15.1, 10.x before 10.15.2, and
  11.x before 11.10.1, an attacker can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by establishing an HTTP
  or HTTPS connection in keep-alive mode and by sending headers very slowly. This keeps the
  connection and associated resources alive for a long period of time. Potential attacks are
  mitigated by the use of a load balancer or other proxy layer. This vulnerability is an extension
  of CVE-2018-12121, addressed in November and impacts all active Node.js release lines including
  6.x before 6.17.0, 8.x before 8.15.1, 10.x before 10.15.2, and 11.x before 11.10.1.
