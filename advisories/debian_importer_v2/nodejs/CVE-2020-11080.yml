aliases:
  - CVE-2020-11080
summary: In nghttp2 before version 1.41.0, the overly large HTTP/2 SETTINGS frame payload causes
  denial of service. The proof of concept attack involves a malicious client constructing a
  SETTINGS frame with a length of 14,400 bytes (2400 individual settings entries) over and over
  again. The attack causes the CPU to spike at 100%. nghttp2 v1.41.0 fixes this vulnerability.
  There is a workaround to this vulnerability. Implement nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback callback,
  and if received frame is SETTINGS frame and the number of settings entries are large (e.g.,
  > 32), then drop the connection.
