aliases:
  - CVE-2018-7159
summary: 'The HTTP parser in all current versions of Node.js ignores spaces in the `Content-Length`
  header, allowing input such as `Content-Length: 1 2` to be interpreted as having a value of
  `12`. The HTTP specification does not allow for spaces in the `Content-Length` value and the
  Node.js HTTP parser has been brought into line on this particular difference. The security
  risk of this flaw to Node.js users is considered to be VERY LOW as it is difficult, and may
  be impossible, to craft an attack that makes use of this flaw in a way that could not already
  be achieved by supplying an incorrect value for `Content-Length`. Vulnerabilities may exist
  in user-code that make incorrect assumptions about the potential accuracy of this value compared
  to the actual length of the data supplied. Node.js users crafting lower-level HTTP utilities
  are advised to re-check the length of any input supplied after parsing is complete.'
