  - CVE-2023-39331
summary: A previously disclosed vulnerability (CVE-2023-30584) was patched insufficiently in
  commit 205f1e6. The new path traversal vulnerability arises because the implementation does
  not protect itself against the application overwriting built-in utility functions with user-defined
  implementations.  Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model is
  an experimental feature of Node.js.
