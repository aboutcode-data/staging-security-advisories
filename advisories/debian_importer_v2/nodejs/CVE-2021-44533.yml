  - CVE-2021-44533
summary: Node.js < 12.22.9, < 14.18.3, < 16.13.2, and < 17.3.1 did not handle multi-value Relative
  Distinguished Names correctly. Attackers could craft certificate subjects containing a single-value
  Relative Distinguished Name that would be interpreted as a multi-value Relative Distinguished
  Name, for example, in order to inject a Common Name that would allow bypassing the certificate
  subject verification.Affected versions of Node.js that do not accept multi-value Relative
  Distinguished Names and are thus not vulnerable to such attacks themselves. However, third-party
  code that uses node's ambiguous presentation of certificate subjects may be vulnerable.
