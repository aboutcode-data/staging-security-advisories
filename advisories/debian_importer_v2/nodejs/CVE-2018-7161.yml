aliases:
  - CVE-2018-7161
summary: All versions of Node.js 8.x, 9.x, and 10.x are vulnerable and the severity is HIGH.
  An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by causing a node server providing an http2
  server to crash. This can be accomplished by interacting with the http2 server in a manner
  that triggers a cleanup bug where objects are used in native code after they are no longer
  available. This has been addressed by updating the http2 implementation.
