  - CVE-2021-22884
summary: Node.js before 10.24.0, 12.21.0, 14.16.0, and 15.10.0 is vulnerable to DNS rebinding
  attacks as the whitelist includes “localhost6”. When “localhost6” is not present in /etc/hosts,
  it is just an ordinary domain that is resolved via DNS, i.e., over network. If the attacker
  controls the victim's DNS server or can spoof its responses, the DNS rebinding protection
  can be bypassed by using the “localhost6” domain. As long as the attacker uses the “localhost6”
  domain, they can still apply the attack described in CVE-2018-7160.
