aliases:
  - CVE-2018-7158
summary: The `'path'` module in the Node.js 4.x release line contains a potential regular expression
  denial of service (ReDoS) vector. The code in question was replaced in Node.js 6.x and later
  so this vulnerability only impacts all versions of Node.js 4.x. The regular expression, `splitPathRe`,
  used within the `'path'` module for the various path parsing functions, including `path.dirname()`,
  `path.extname()` and `path.parse()` was structured in such a way as to allow an attacker to
  craft a string, that when passed through one of these functions, could take a significant
  amount of time to evaluate, potentially leading to a full denial of service.
