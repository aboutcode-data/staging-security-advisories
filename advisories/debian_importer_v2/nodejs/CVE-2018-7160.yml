aliases:
  - CVE-2018-7160
summary: The Node.js inspector, in 6.x and later is vulnerable to a DNS rebinding attack which
  could be exploited to perform remote code execution. An attack is possible from malicious
  websites open in a web browser on the same computer, or another computer with network access
  to the computer running the Node.js process. A malicious website could use a DNS rebinding
  attack to trick the web browser to bypass same-origin-policy checks and to allow HTTP connections
  to localhost or to hosts on the local network. If a Node.js process with the debug port active
  is running on localhost or on a host on the local network, the malicious website could connect
  to it as a debugger, and get full code execution access.
