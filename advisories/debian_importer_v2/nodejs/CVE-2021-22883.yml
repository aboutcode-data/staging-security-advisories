  - CVE-2021-22883
summary: Node.js before 10.24.0, 12.21.0, 14.16.0, and 15.10.0 is vulnerable to a denial of
  service attack when too many connection attempts with an 'unknownProtocol' are established.
  This leads to a leak of file descriptors. If a file descriptor limit is configured on the
  system, then the server is unable to accept new connections and prevent the process also from
  opening, e.g. a file. If no file descriptor limit is configured, then this lead to an excessive
  memory usage and cause the system to run out of memory.
