aliases:
  - CVE-2018-7162
summary: All versions of Node.js 9.x and 10.x are vulnerable and the severity is HIGH. An attacker
  can cause a denial of service (DoS) by causing a node process which provides an http server
  supporting TLS server to crash. This can be accomplished by sending duplicate/unexpected messages
  during the handshake. This vulnerability has been addressed by updating the TLS implementation.
