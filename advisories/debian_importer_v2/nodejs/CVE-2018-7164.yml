  - CVE-2018-7164
summary: Node.js versions 9.7.0 and later and 10.x are vulnerable and the severity is MEDIUM.
  A bug introduced in 9.7.0 increases the memory consumed when reading from the network into

  a denial of service by sending tiny chunks of data in short succession. This vulnerability
  was restored by reverting to the prior behaviour.
