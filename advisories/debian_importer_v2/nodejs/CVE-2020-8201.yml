  - CVE-2020-8201
summary: Node.js < 12.18.4 and < 14.11 can be exploited to perform HTTP desync attacks and deliver
  malicious payloads to unsuspecting users. The payloads can be crafted by an attacker to hijack
  user sessions, poison cookies, perform clickjacking, and a multitude of other attacks depending
  on the architecture of the underlying system. The attack was possible due to a bug in processing
  of carrier-return symbols in the HTTP header names.
