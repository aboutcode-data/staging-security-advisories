  - CVE-2022-39348
summary: Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications. Started with version
  0.9.4, when the host header does not match a configured host `twisted.web.vhost.NameVirtualHost`
  will return a `NoResource` resource which renders the Host header unescaped into the 404 response
  allowing HTML and script injection. In practice this should be very difficult to exploit as
  being able to modify the Host header of a normal HTTP request implies that one is already
  in a privileged position. This issue was fixed in version 22.10.0rc1. There are no known workarounds.
