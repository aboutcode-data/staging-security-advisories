  - CVE-2025-62494
summary: A type confusion vulnerability exists in the handling of the string addition (+) operation
  within the QuickJS engine.    *  The code first checks if the left-hand operand is a string.     *  It
  then attempts to convert the right-hand operand to a primitive value using JS_ToPrimitiveFree.
  This conversion can trigger a callback (e.g., toString or valueOf).     *  During this callback,
  an attacker can modify the type of the left-hand operand in memory, changing it from a string
  to a different type (e.g., an object or an array).     *  The code then proceeds to call JS_ConcatStringInPlace,
  which still treats the modified left-hand value as a string.   This mismatch between the assumed
  type (string) and the actual type allows an attacker to control the data structure being processed
  by the concatenation logic, resulting in a type confusion condition. This can lead to out-of-bounds
  memory access, potentially resulting in memory corruption and arbitrary code execution in
  the context of the QuickJS runtime.
