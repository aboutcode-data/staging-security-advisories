  - CVE-2025-62491
summary: A Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability exists in the QuickJS engine's standard library
  when iterating over the global list of unhandled rejected promises (ts->rejected_promise_list).    *  The
  function js_std_promise_rejection_check attempts to iterate over the rejected_promise_list
  to report unhandled rejections using a standard list loop.     *  The reason for a promise
  rejection is processed inside the loop, including calling js_std_dump_error1(ctx, rp->reason).     *  If
  the promise rejection reason is an Error object that defines a custom property getter (e.g.,
  via Object.defineProperty), this getter is executed during the error dumping process.     *  The
  malicious custom getter can execute JavaScript code that calls catch() on the same rejected
  promise being processed.     *  Calling catch() internally triggers js_std_promise_rejection_tracker,
  which then removes and frees the current promise entry (JSRejectedPromiseEntry) from the rejected_promise_list.     *  Since
  the list iteration continues using the now-freed memory pointer (el), the subsequent loop
  access results in a Use-After-Free condition.
