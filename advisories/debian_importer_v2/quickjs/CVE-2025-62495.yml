  - CVE-2025-62495
summary: 'An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the QuickJS regular expression engine
  (libregexp) due to an inconsistent representation of the bytecode buffer size.    *  The regular
  expression bytecode is stored in a DynBuf structure, which correctly uses a $\text{size}\_\text{t}$
  (an unsigned type, typically 64-bit) for its size member.     *  However, several functions,
  such as re_emit_op_u32 and other internal parsing routines, incorrectly cast or store this
  DynBuf $\text{size}\_\text{t}$ value into a signed int (typically 32-bit).     *  When a large
  or complex regular expression (such as those generated by a recursive pattern in a Proof-of-Concept)
  causes the bytecode size to exceed $2^{31}$ bytes (the maximum positive value for a signed
  32-bit integer), the size value wraps around, resulting in a negative integer when stored
  in the int variable (Integer Overflow).     *  This negative value is subsequently used in
  offset calculations. For example, within functions like re_parse_disjunction, the negative
  size is used to compute an offset (pos) for patching a jump instruction.     *  This negative
  offset is then incorrectly added to the buffer pointer (s->byte\_code.buf + pos), leading
  to an out-of-bounds write on the first line of the snippet below:  put_u32(s->byte_code.buf
  + pos, len);'
