summary: The (1) Conn_StartLogin and (2) cb_Read_Resolver_Result functions in conn.c in ngIRCd
  18 through 20.2, when the configuration option NoticeAuth is enabled, does not properly handle

  of service (assertion failure and server crash) via unspecified vectors, related to a "notice
  auth" message not being sent to a new client.
