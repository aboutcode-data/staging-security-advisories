  - CVE-2023-49083
summary: cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives and recipes to
  Python developers. Calling `load_pem_pkcs7_certificates` or `load_der_pkcs7_certificates`
  could lead to a NULL-pointer dereference and segfault. Exploitation of this vulnerability
  poses a serious risk of Denial of Service (DoS) for any application attempting to deserialize
  a PKCS7 blob/certificate. The consequences extend to potential disruptions in system availability
  and stability. This vulnerability has been patched in version 41.0.6.
