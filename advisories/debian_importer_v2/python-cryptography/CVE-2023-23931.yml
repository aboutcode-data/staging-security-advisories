  - CVE-2023-23931
summary: cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives and recipes to
  Python developers. In affected versions `Cipher.update_into` would accept Python objects which
  implement the buffer protocol, but provide only immutable buffers. This would allow immutable
  objects (such as `bytes`) to be mutated, thus violating fundamental rules of Python and resulting
  in corrupted output. This now correctly raises an exception. This issue has been present since
  `update_into` was originally introduced in cryptography 1.8.
