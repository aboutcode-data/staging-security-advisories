  - CVE-2021-3909
summary: OctoRPKI does not limit the length of a connection, allowing for a slowloris DOS attack
  to take place which makes OctoRPKI wait forever. Specifically, the repository that OctoRPKI
  sends HTTP requests to will keep the connection open for a day before a response is returned,
  but does keep drip feeding new bytes to keep the connection alive.
