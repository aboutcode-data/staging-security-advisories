summary: An issue was discovered in Open vSwitch (OvS) 2.7.x through 2.7.6, affecting ofproto_rule_insert__
  in ofproto/ofproto.c. During bundle commit, flows that are added in a bundle are applied to
  ofproto in order. If a flow cannot be added (e.g., the flow action is a go-to for a group
  id that does not exist), OvS tries to revert back all previous flows that were successfully
  applied from the same bundle. This is possible since OvS maintains list of old flows that
  were replaced by flows from the bundle. While reinserting old flows, OvS has an assertion
  failure due to a check on rule state != RULE_INITIALIZED. This would work for new flows, but
  for an old flow the rule state is RULE_REMOVED. The assertion failure causes an OvS crash.
