summary: 'rails-html-sanitizer is responsible for sanitizing HTML fragments in Rails applications.
  Prior to version 1.4.4, there is a possible XSS vulnerability with certain configurations
  of Rails::Html::Sanitizer due to an incomplete fix of CVE-2022-32209. Rails::Html::Sanitizer
  may allow an attacker to inject content if the application developer has overridden the sanitizer''s
  allowed tags to allow both "select" and "style" elements. Code is only impacted if allowed
  tags are being overridden. This issue is patched in version 1.4.4. All users overriding the
  allowed tags to include both "select" and "style" should either upgrade or use this workaround:
  Remove either "select" or "style" from the overridden allowed tags. NOTE: Code is _not_ impacted
  if allowed tags are overridden using either the :tags option to the Action View helper method
  sanitize or the :tags option to the instance method SafeListSanitizer#sanitize.'
