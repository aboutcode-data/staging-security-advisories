aliases:
  - CVE-2018-3741
summary: There is a possible XSS vulnerability in all rails-html-sanitizer gem versions below
  1.0.4 for Ruby. The gem allows non-whitelisted attributes to be present in sanitized output
  when input with specially-crafted HTML fragments, and these attributes can lead to an XSS
  attack on target applications. This issue is similar to CVE-2018-8048 in Loofah. All users
  running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.
