  - CVE-2022-23517
summary: rails-html-sanitizer is responsible for sanitizing HTML fragments in Rails applications.
  Certain configurations of rails-html-sanitizer < 1.4.4 use an inefficient regular expression
  that is susceptible to excessive backtracking when attempting to sanitize certain SVG attributes.
  This may lead to a denial of service through CPU resource consumption. This issue has been
  patched in version 1.4.4.
