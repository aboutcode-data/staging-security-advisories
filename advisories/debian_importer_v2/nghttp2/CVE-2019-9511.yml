  - CVE-2019-9511
summary: Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to window size manipulation and stream prioritization
  manipulation, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker requests a large amount
  of data from a specified resource over multiple streams. They manipulate window size and stream
  priority to force the server to queue the data in 1-byte chunks. Depending on how efficiently
  this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.
