  - CVE-2024-28182
summary: nghttp2 is an implementation of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol version 2 in C. The
  nghttp2 library prior to version 1.61.0 keeps reading the unbounded number of HTTP/2 CONTINUATION
  frames even after a stream is reset to keep HPACK context in sync.  This causes excessive
  CPU usage to decode HPACK stream. nghttp2 v1.61.0 mitigates this vulnerability by limiting
  the number of CONTINUATION frames it accepts per stream. There is no workaround for this vulnerability.
