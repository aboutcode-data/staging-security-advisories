aliases:
  - CVE-2020-7694
summary: 'This affects all versions of package uvicorn. The request logger provided by the package
  is vulnerable to ASNI escape sequence injection. Whenever any HTTP request is received, the
  default behaviour of uvicorn is to log its details to either the console or a log file. When
  attackers request crafted URLs with percent-encoded escape sequences, the logging component
  will log the URL after it''s been processed with urllib.parse.unquote, therefore converting
  any percent-encoded characters into their single-character equivalent, which can have special
  meaning in terminal emulators. By requesting URLs with crafted paths, attackers can: * Pollute
  uvicorn''s access logs, therefore jeopardising the integrity of such files. * Use ANSI sequence
  codes to attempt to interact with the terminal emulator that''s displaying the logs (either
  in real time or from a file).'
