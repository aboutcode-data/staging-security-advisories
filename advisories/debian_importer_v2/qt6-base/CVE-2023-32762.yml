  - CVE-2023-32762
summary: An issue was discovered in Qt before 5.15.14, 6.x before 6.2.9, and 6.3.x through 6.5.x
  before 6.5.1. Qt Network incorrectly parses the strict-transport-security (HSTS) header, allowing
  unencrypted connections to be established, even when explicitly prohibited by the server.
  This happens if the case used for this header does not exactly match.
