  - CVE-2025-5455
summary: An issue was found in the private API function qDecodeDataUrl() in QtCore, which is
  used in QTextDocument and QNetworkReply, and, potentially, in user code.  If the function
  was called with malformed data, for example, an URL that contained a "charset" parameter that
  lacked a value (such as "data:charset,"), and Qt was built with assertions enabled, then it
  would hit an assertion, resulting in a denial of service (abort).  This impacts Qt up to 5.15.18,
  6.0.0->6.5.8, 6.6.0->6.8.3 and 6.9.0. This has been fixed in 5.15.19, 6.5.9, 6.8.4 and 6.9.1.
