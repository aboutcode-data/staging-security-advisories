  - CVE-2020-1930
summary: A command execution issue was found in Apache SpamAssassin prior to 3.4.3. Carefully
  crafted nefarious rule configuration (.cf) files can be configured to run system commands
  similar to CVE-2018-11805. With this bug unpatched, exploits can be injected in a number of
  scenarios including the same privileges as spamd is run which may be elevated though doing
  so remotely is difficult. In addition to upgrading to SA 3.4.4, we again recommend that users
  should only use update channels or 3rd party .cf files from trusted places. If you cannot
  upgrade, do not use 3rd party rulesets, do not use sa-compile and do not run spamd as an account
  with elevated privileges.
