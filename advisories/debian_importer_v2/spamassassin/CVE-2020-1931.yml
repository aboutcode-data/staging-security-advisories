aliases:
  - CVE-2020-1931
summary: A command execution issue was found in Apache SpamAssassin prior to 3.4.3. Carefully
  crafted nefarious Configuration (.cf) files can be configured to run system commands similar
  to CVE-2018-11805. This issue is less stealthy and attempts to exploit the issue will throw
  warnings. Thanks to Damian Lukowski at credativ for reporting the issue ethically. With this
  bug unpatched, exploits can be injected in a number of scenarios though doing so remotely
  is difficult. In addition to upgrading to SA 3.4.4, we again recommend that users should only
  use update channels or 3rd party .cf files from trusted places.
