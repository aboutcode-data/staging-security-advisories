  - CVE-2026-26996
summary: minimatch is a minimal matching utility for converting glob expressions into JavaScript
  RegExp objects. Versions 10.2.0 and below are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service
  (ReDoS) when a glob pattern contains many consecutive * wildcards followed by a literal character
  that doesn't appear in the test string. Each * compiles to a separate [^/]*? regex group,
  and when the match fails, V8's regex engine backtracks exponentially across all possible splits.
  The time complexity is O(4^N) where N is the number of * characters. With N=15, a single minimatch()
  call takes ~2 seconds. With N=34, it hangs effectively forever. Any application that passes
  user-controlled strings to minimatch() as the pattern argument is vulnerable to DoS. This
  issue has been fixed in version 10.2.1.
