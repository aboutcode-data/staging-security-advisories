summary: 'minimatch is a minimal matching utility for converting glob expressions into JavaScript
  RegExp objects. Prior to version 10.2.3, 9.0.7, 8.0.6, 7.4.8, 6.2.2, 5.1.8, 4.2.5, and 3.1.4,
  nested `*()` extglobs produce regexps with nested unbounded quantifiers (e.g. `(?:(?:a|b)*)*`),
  which exhibit catastrophic backtracking in V8. With a 12-byte pattern `*(*(*(a|b)))` and an
  18-byte non-matching input, `minimatch()` stalls for over 7 seconds. Adding a single nesting
  level or a few input characters pushes this to minutes. This is the most severe finding: it
  is triggered by the default `minimatch()` API with no special options, and the minimum viable
  pattern is only 12 bytes. The same issue affects `+()` extglobs equally. Versions 10.2.3,
  9.0.7, 8.0.6, 7.4.8, 6.2.2, 5.1.8, 4.2.5, and 3.1.4 fix the issue.'
