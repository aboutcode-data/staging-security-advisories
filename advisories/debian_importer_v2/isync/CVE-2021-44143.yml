  - CVE-2021-44143
summary: A flaw was found in mbsync in isync 1.4.0 through 1.4.3. Due to an unchecked condition,
  a malicious or compromised IMAP server could use a crafted mail message that lacks headers
  (i.e., one that starts with an empty line) to provoke a heap overflow, which could conceivably
  be exploited for remote code execution.
