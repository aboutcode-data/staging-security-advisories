  - CVE-2021-3657
summary: A flaw was found in mbsync versions prior to 1.4.4. Due to inadequate handling of extremely
  large (>=2GiB) IMAP literals, malicious or compromised IMAP servers, and hypothetically even
  external email senders, could cause several different buffer overflows, which could conceivably
  be exploited for remote code execution.
