  - CVE-2026-24747
summary: PyTorch is a Python package that provides tensor computation. Prior to version 2.10.0,
  a vulnerability in PyTorch's `weights_only` unpickler allows an attacker to craft a malicious
  checkpoint file (`.pth`) that, when loaded with `torch.load(..., weights_only=True)`, can
  corrupt memory and potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. Version 2.10.0 fixes the
  issue.
