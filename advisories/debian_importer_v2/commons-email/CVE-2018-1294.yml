aliases:
  - CVE-2018-1294
summary: 'If a user of Apache Commons Email (typically an application programmer) passes unvalidated
  input as the so-called "Bounce Address", and that input contains line-breaks, then the email
  details (recipients, contents, etc.) might be manipulated. Mitigation: Users should upgrade
  to Commons-Email 1.5. You can mitigate this vulnerability for older versions of Commons Email
  by stripping line-breaks from data, that will be passed to Email.setBounceAddress(String).'
