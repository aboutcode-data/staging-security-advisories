  - CVE-2022-31147
summary: The jQuery Validation Plugin (jquery-validation) provides drop-in validation for forms.
  Versions of jquery-validation prior to 1.19.5 are vulnerable to regular expression denial
  of service (ReDoS) when an attacker is able to supply arbitrary input to the url2 method.
  This is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-43306. Users should upgrade to version 1.19.5
  to receive a patch.
