  - CVE-2020-36327
summary: 'Bundler 1.16.0 through 2.2.9 and 2.2.11 through 2.2.16 sometimes chooses a dependency
  source based on the highest gem version number, which means that a rogue gem found at a public
  source may be chosen, even if the intended choice was a private gem that is a dependency of
  another private gem that is explicitly depended on by the application. NOTE: it is not correct
  to use CVE-2021-24105 for every "Dependency Confusion" issue in every product.'
