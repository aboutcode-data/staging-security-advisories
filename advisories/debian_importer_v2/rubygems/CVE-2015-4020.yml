summary: 'RubyGems 2.0.x before 2.0.17, 2.2.x before 2.2.5, and 2.4.x before 2.4.8 does not
  validate the hostname when fetching gems or making API requests, which allows remote attackers
  to redirect requests to arbitrary domains via a crafted DNS SRV record with a domain that
  is suffixed with the original domain name, aka a "DNS hijack attack." NOTE: this vulnerability
  exists because to an incomplete fix for CVE-2015-3900.'
