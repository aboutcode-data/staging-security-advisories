aliases:
  - CVE-2011-3012
summary: The ioQuake3 engine, as used in World of Padman 1.2 and earlier, Tremulous 1.1.0, and
  ioUrbanTerror 2007-12-20, does not check for dangerous file extensions before writing to the
  quake3 directory, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted third-party
  addon that creates a Trojan horse DLL file, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-2764.
