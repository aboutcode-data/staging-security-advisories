aliases:
  - CVE-2017-6903
summary: In ioquake3 before 2017-03-14, the auto-downloading feature has insufficient content
  restrictions. This also affects Quake III Arena, OpenArena, OpenJK, iortcw, and other id Tech
  3 (aka Quake 3 engine) forks. A malicious auto-downloaded file can trigger loading of crafted
  auto-downloaded files as native code DLLs. A malicious auto-downloaded file can contain configuration
  defaults that override the user's. Executable bytecode in a malicious auto-downloaded file
  can set configuration variables to values that will result in unwanted native code DLLs being
  loaded, resulting in sandbox escape.
