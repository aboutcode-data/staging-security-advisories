aliases:
  - CVE-2011-2764
summary: The FS_CheckFilenameIsNotExecutable function in qcommon/files.c in the ioQuake3 engine
  1.36 and earlier, as used in World of Padman, Smokin' Guns, OpenArena, Tremulous, and ioUrbanTerror,
  does not properly determine dangerous file extensions, which allows remote attackers to execute
  arbitrary code via a crafted third-party addon that creates a Trojan horse DLL file.
