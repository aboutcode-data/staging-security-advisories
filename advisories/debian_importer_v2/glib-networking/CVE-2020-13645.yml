  - CVE-2020-13645
summary: In GNOME glib-networking through 2.64.2, the implementation of GTlsClientConnection
  skips hostname verification of the server's TLS certificate if the application fails to specify
  the expected server identity. This is in contrast to its intended documented behavior, to
  fail the certificate verification. Applications that fail to provide the server identity,
  including Balsa before 2.5.11 and 2.6.x before 2.6.1, accept a TLS certificate if the certificate
  is valid for any host.
