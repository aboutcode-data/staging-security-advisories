  - CVE-2020-13920
summary: Apache ActiveMQ uses LocateRegistry.createRegistry() to create the JMX RMI registry
  and binds the server to the "jmxrmi" entry. It is possible to connect to the registry without
  authentication and call the rebind method to rebind jmxrmi to something else. If an attacker
  creates another server to proxy the original, and bound that, he effectively becomes a man
  in the middle and is able to intercept the credentials when an user connects. Upgrade to Apache
  ActiveMQ 5.15.12.
