summary: 'Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ.  During
  unmarshalling of OpenWire commands the size value of buffers was not properly validated which
  could lead to excessive memory allocation and be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS)
  by depleting process memory, thereby affecting applications and services that rely on the
  availability of the ActiveMQ broker when not using mutual TLS connections. This issue affects
  Apache ActiveMQ: from 6.0.0 before 6.1.6, from 5.18.0 before 5.18.7, from 5.17.0 before 5.17.7,
  before 5.16.8. ActiveMQ 5.19.0 is not affected.  Users are recommended to upgrade to version
  6.1.6+, 5.19.0+,  5.18.7+, 5.17.7, or 5.16.8 or which fixes the issue.  Existing users may
  implement mutual TLS to mitigate the risk on affected brokers.'
