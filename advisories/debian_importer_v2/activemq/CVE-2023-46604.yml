  - CVE-2023-46604
summary: The Java OpenWire protocol marshaller is vulnerable to Remote Code  Execution. This
  vulnerability may allow a remote attacker with network  access to either a Java-based OpenWire
  broker or client to run arbitrary  shell commands by manipulating serialized class types in
  the OpenWire  protocol to cause either the client or the broker (respectively) to  instantiate
  any class on the classpath.  Users are recommended to upgrade  both brokers and clients to
  version 5.15.16, 5.16.7, 5.17.6, or 5.18.3  which fixes this issue.
