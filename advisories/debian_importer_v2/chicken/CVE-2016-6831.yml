aliases:
  - CVE-2016-6831
summary: The "process-execute" and "process-spawn" procedures did not free memory correctly
  when the execve() call failed, resulting in a memory leak. This could be abused by an attacker
  to cause resource exhaustion or a denial of service. This affects all releases of CHICKEN
  up to and including 4.11 (it will be fixed in 4.12 and 5.0, which are not yet released).
