  - CVE-2024-45157
summary: 'An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS before 2.28.9 and 3.x before 3.6.1, in which the
  user-selected algorithm is not used. Unlike previously documented, enabling MBEDTLS_PSA_HMAC_DRBG_MD_TYPE
  does not cause the PSA subsystem to use HMAC_DRBG: it uses HMAC_DRBG only when MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_EXTERNAL_RNG
  and MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_C are disabled.'
