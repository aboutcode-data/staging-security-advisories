  - CVE-2020-10932
summary: An issue was discovered in Arm Mbed TLS before 2.16.6 and 2.7.x before 2.7.15. An attacker
  that can get precise enough side-channel measurements can recover the long-term ECDSA private
  key by (1) reconstructing the projective coordinate of the result of scalar multiplication
  by exploiting side channels in the conversion to affine coordinates; (2) using an attack described
  by Naccache, Smart, and Stern in 2003 to recover a few bits of the ephemeral scalar from those
  projective coordinates via several measurements; and (3) using a lattice attack to get from
  there to the long-term ECDSA private key used for the signatures. Typically an attacker would
  have sufficient access when attacking an SGX enclave and controlling the untrusted OS.
