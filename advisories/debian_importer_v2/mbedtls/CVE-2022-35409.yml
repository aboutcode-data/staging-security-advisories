  - CVE-2022-35409
summary: 'An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS before 2.28.1 and 3.x before 3.2.0. In some configurations,
  an unauthenticated attacker can send an invalid ClientHello message to a DTLS server that
  causes a heap-based buffer over-read of up to 255 bytes. This can cause a server crash or
  possibly information disclosure based on error responses. Affected configurations have MBEDTLS_SSL_DTLS_CLIENT_PORT_REUSE
  enabled and MBEDTLS_SSL_IN_CONTENT_LEN less than a threshold that depends on the configuration:
  258 bytes if using mbedtls_ssl_cookie_check, and possibly up to 571 bytes with a custom cookie
  check function.'
