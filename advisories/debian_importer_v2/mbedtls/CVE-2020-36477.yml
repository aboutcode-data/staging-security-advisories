  - CVE-2020-36477
summary: 'An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS before 2.24.0. The verification of X.509 certificates
  when matching the expected common name (the cn argument of mbedtls_x509_crt_verify) with the
  actual certificate name is mishandled: when the subjecAltName extension is present, the expected
  name is compared to any name in that extension regardless of its type. This means that an
  attacker could impersonate a 4-byte or 16-byte domain by getting a certificate for the corresponding
  IPv4 or IPv6 address (this would require the attacker to control that IP address, though).'
