aliases:
  - CVE-2021-3677
summary: A flaw was found in postgresql. A purpose-crafted query can read arbitrary bytes of
  server memory. In the default configuration, any authenticated database user can complete
  this attack at will. The attack does not require the ability to create objects. If server
  settings include max_worker_processes=0, the known versions of this attack are infeasible.
  However, undiscovered variants of the attack may be independent of that setting.
