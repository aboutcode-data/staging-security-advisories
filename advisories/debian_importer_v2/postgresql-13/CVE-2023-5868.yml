  - CVE-2023-5868
summary: A memory disclosure vulnerability was found in PostgreSQL that allows remote users
  to access sensitive information by exploiting certain aggregate function calls with 'unknown'-type
  arguments. Handling 'unknown'-type values from string literals without type designation can
  disclose bytes, potentially revealing notable and confidential information. This issue exists
  due to excessive data output in aggregate function calls, enabling remote users to read some
  portion of system memory.
