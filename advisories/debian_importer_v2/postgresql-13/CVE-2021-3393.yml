aliases:
  - CVE-2021-3393
summary: An information leak was discovered in postgresql in versions before 13.2, before 12.6
  and before 11.11. A user having UPDATE permission but not SELECT permission to a particular
  column could craft queries which, under some circumstances, might disclose values from that
  column in error messages. An attacker could use this flaw to obtain information stored in
  a column they are allowed to write but not read.
