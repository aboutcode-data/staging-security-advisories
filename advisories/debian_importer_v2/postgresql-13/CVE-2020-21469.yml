summary: 'An issue was discovered in PostgreSQL 12.2 allows attackers to cause a denial of service
  via repeatedly sending SIGHUP signals. NOTE: this is disputed by the vendor because untrusted
  users cannot send SIGHUP signals; they can only be sent by a PostgreSQL superuser, a user
  with pg_reload_conf access, or a user with sufficient privileges at the OS level (the postgres
  account or the root account).'
