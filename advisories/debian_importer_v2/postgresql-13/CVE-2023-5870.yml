aliases:
  - CVE-2023-5870
summary: A flaw was found in PostgreSQL involving the pg_cancel_backend role that signals background
  workers, including the logical replication launcher, autovacuum workers, and the autovacuum
  launcher. Successful exploitation requires a non-core extension with a less-resilient background
  worker and would affect that specific background worker only. This issue may allow a remote
  high privileged user to launch a denial of service (DoS) attack.
