  - CVE-2020-25694
summary: A flaw was found in PostgreSQL versions before 13.1, before 12.5, before 11.10, before
  10.15, before 9.6.20 and before 9.5.24. If a client application that creates additional database
  connections only reuses the basic connection parameters while dropping security-relevant parameters,
  an opportunity for a man-in-the-middle attack, or the ability to observe clear-text transmissions,
  could exist. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity
  as well as system availability.
