  - CVE-2022-1552
summary: A flaw was found in PostgreSQL. There is an issue with incomplete efforts to operate
  safely when a privileged user is maintaining another user's objects. The Autovacuum, REINDEX,
  CREATE INDEX, REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW, CLUSTER, and pg_amcheck commands activated relevant
  protections too late or not at all during the process. This flaw allows an attacker with permission
  to create non-temporary objects in at least one schema to execute arbitrary SQL functions
  under a superuser identity.
