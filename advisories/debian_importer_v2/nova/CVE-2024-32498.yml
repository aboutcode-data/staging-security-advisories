  - CVE-2024-32498
summary: An issue was discovered in OpenStack Cinder through 24.0.0, Glance before 28.0.2, and
  Nova before 29.0.3. Arbitrary file access can occur via custom QCOW2 external data. By supplying
  a crafted QCOW2 image that references a specific data file path, an authenticated user may
  convince systems to return a copy of that file's contents from the server, resulting in unauthorized
  access to potentially sensitive data. All Cinder and Nova deployments are affected; only Glance
  deployments with image conversion enabled are affected.
