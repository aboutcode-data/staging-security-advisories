aliases:
  - CVE-2017-17051
summary: An issue was discovered in the default FilterScheduler in OpenStack Nova 16.0.3. By
  repeatedly rebuilding an instance with new images, an authenticated user may consume untracked
  resources on a hypervisor host leading to a denial of service, aka doubled resource allocations.
  This regression was introduced with the fix for OSSA-2017-005 (CVE-2017-16239); however, only
  Nova stable/pike or later deployments with that fix applied and relying on the default FilterScheduler
  are affected.
