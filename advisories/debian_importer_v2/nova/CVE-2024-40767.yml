summary: 'In OpenStack Nova before 27.4.1, 28 before 28.2.1, and 29 before 29.1.1, by supplying
  a raw format image that is actually a crafted QCOW2 image with a backing file path or VMDK
  flat image with a descriptor file path, an authenticated user may convince systems to return
  a copy of the referenced file''s contents from the server, resulting in unauthorized access
  to potentially sensitive data. All Nova deployments are affected. NOTE: this issue exists
  because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2022-47951 and CVE-2024-32498.'
