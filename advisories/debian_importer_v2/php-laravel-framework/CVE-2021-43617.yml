summary: 'Laravel Framework through 8.70.2 does not sufficiently block the upload of executable
  PHP content because Illuminate/Validation/Concerns/ValidatesAttributes.php lacks a check for

  this CVE Record is for Laravel Framework, and is unrelated to any reports concerning incorrectly
  written user applications for image upload.'
