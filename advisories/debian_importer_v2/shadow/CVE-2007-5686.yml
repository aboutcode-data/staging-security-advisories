summary: 'initscripts in rPath Linux 1 sets insecure permissions for the /var/log/btmp file,
  which allows local users to obtain sensitive information regarding authentication attempts.  NOTE:
  because sshd detects the insecure permissions and does not log certain events, this also prevents
  sshd from logging failed authentication attempts by remote attackers.'
