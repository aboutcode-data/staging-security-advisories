  - CVE-2024-56433
summary: 'shadow-utils (aka shadow) 4.4 through 4.17.0 establishes a default /etc/subuid behavior
  (e.g., uid 100000 through 165535 for the first user account) that can realistically conflict
  with the uids of users defined on locally administered networks, potentially leading to account
  takeover, e.g., by leveraging newuidmap for access to an NFS home directory (or same-host
  resources in the case of remote logins by these local network users). NOTE: it may also be
  argued that system administrators should not have assigned uids, within local networks, that
  are within the range that can occur in /etc/subuid.'
