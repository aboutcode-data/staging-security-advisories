  - CVE-2018-16588
summary: 'Privilege escalation can occur in the SUSE useradd.c code in useradd, as distributed
  in the SUSE shadow package through 4.2.1-27.9.1 for SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 (SLE-12) and
  through 4.5-5.39 for SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 (SLE-15). Non-existing intermediate directories
  are created with mode 0777 during user creation. Given that they are world-writable, local
  attackers might use this for privilege escalation and other unspecified attacks.  NOTE: this
  would affect non-SUSE users who took useradd.c code from a 2014-04-02 upstream pull request;
  however, no non-SUSE distribution is known to be affected.'
