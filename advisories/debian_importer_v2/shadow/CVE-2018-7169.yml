  - CVE-2018-7169
summary: An issue was discovered in shadow 4.5. newgidmap (in shadow-utils) is setuid and allows
  an unprivileged user to be placed in a user namespace where setgroups(2) is permitted. This
  allows an attacker to remove themselves from a supplementary group, which may allow access
  to certain filesystem paths if the administrator has used "group blacklisting" (e.g., chmod
  g-rwx) to restrict access to paths. This flaw effectively reverts a security feature in the
  kernel (in particular, the /proc/self/setgroups knob) to prevent this sort of privilege escalation.
