  - CVE-2020-10683
summary: dom4j before 2.0.3 and 2.1.x before 2.1.3 allows external DTDs and External Entities
  by default, which might enable XXE attacks. However, there is popular external documentation
  from OWASP showing how to enable the safe, non-default behavior in any application that uses
  dom4j.
