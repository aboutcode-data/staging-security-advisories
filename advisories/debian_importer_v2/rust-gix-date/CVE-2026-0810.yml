  - CVE-2026-0810
summary: A flaw was found in gix-date. The `gix_date::parse::TimeBuf::as_str` function can generate
  strings containing invalid non-UTF8 characters. This issue violates the internal safety invariants
  of the `TimeBuf` component, leading to undefined behavior when these malformed strings are
  subsequently processed. This could potentially result in application instability or other
  unforeseen consequences.
