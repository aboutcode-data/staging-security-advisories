  - CVE-2025-23395
summary: Screen 5.0.0 when it runs with setuid-root privileges does not drop privileges while
  operating on a user supplied path. This allows unprivileged users to create files in arbitrary
  locations with `root` ownership, the invoking user's (real) group ownership and file mode
  0644. All data written to the Screen PTY will be logged into this file, allowing to escalate
  to root privileges
