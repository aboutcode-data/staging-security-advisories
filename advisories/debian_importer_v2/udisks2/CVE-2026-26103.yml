  - CVE-2026-26103
summary: A flaw was found in the udisks storage management daemon that exposes a privileged
  D-Bus API for restoring LUKS encryption headers without proper authorization checks. The issue
  allows a local unprivileged user to instruct the root-owned udisks daemon to overwrite encryption
  metadata on block devices. This can permanently invalidate encryption keys and render encrypted
  volumes inaccessible. Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service condition through
  irreversible data loss.
