  - CVE-2026-26104
summary: A flaw was found in the udisks storage management daemon that allows unprivileged users
  to back up LUKS encryption headers without authorization. The issue occurs because a privileged
  D-Bus method responsible for exporting encryption metadata does not perform a policy check.
  As a result, sensitive cryptographic metadata can be read and written to attacker-controlled
  locations. This weakens the confidentiality guarantees of encrypted storage volumes.
