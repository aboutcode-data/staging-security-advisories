  - CVE-2020-28896
summary: Mutt before 2.0.2 and NeoMutt before 2020-11-20 did not ensure that $ssl_force_tls
  was processed if an IMAP server's initial server response was invalid. The connection was
  not properly closed, and the code could continue attempting to authenticate. This could result
  in authentication credentials being exposed on an unencrypted connection, or to a machine-in-the-middle.
