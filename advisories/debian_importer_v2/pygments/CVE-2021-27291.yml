summary: In pygments 1.1+, fixed in 2.7.4, the lexers used to parse programming languages rely
  heavily on regular expressions. Some of the regular expressions have exponential or cubic
  worst-case complexity and are vulnerable to ReDoS. By crafting malicious input, an attacker
  can cause a denial of service.
