  - CVE-2023-32731
summary: When gRPC HTTP2 stack raised a header size exceeded error, it skipped parsing the rest
  of the HPACK frame. This caused any HPACK table mutations to also be skipped, resulting in
  a desynchronization of HPACK tables between sender and receiver. If leveraged, say, between
  a proxy and a backend, this could lead to requests from the proxy being interpreted as containing
  headers from different proxy clients - leading to an information leak that can be used for
  privilege escalation or data exfiltration. We recommend upgrading beyond the commit contained
  in  https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/33005 https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/33005
