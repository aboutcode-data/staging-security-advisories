  - CVE-2025-66566
summary: yawkat LZ4 Java provides LZ4 compression for Java. Insufficient clearing of the output
  buffer in Java-based decompressor implementations in lz4-java 1.10.0 and earlier allows remote
  attackers to read previous buffer contents via crafted compressed input. In applications where
  the output buffer is reused without being cleared, this may lead to disclosure of sensitive
  data. JNI-based implementations are not affected. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.10.1.
