  - CVE-2019-15892
summary: An issue was discovered in Varnish Cache before 6.0.4 LTS, and 6.1.x and 6.2.x before
  6.2.1. An HTTP/1 parsing failure allows a remote attacker to trigger an assert by sending
  crafted HTTP/1 requests. The assert will cause an automatic restart with a clean cache, which
  makes it a Denial of Service attack.
