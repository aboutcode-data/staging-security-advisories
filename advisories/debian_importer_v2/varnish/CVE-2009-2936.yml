  - CVE-2009-2936
summary: 'The Command Line Interface (aka Server CLI or administration interface) in the master
  process in the reverse proxy server in Varnish before 2.1.0 does not require authentication
  for commands received through a TCP port, which allows remote attackers to (1) execute arbitrary
  code via a vcl.inline directive that provides a VCL configuration file containing inline C
  code; (2) change the ownership of the master process via param.set, stop, and start directives;
  (3) read the initial line of an arbitrary file via a vcl.load directive; or (4) conduct cross-site
  request forgery (CSRF) attacks that leverage a victim''s location on a trusted network and
  improper input validation of directives.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this report, saying that
  it is "fundamentally misguided and pointless.'
