summary: 'An HTTP Request Forgery issue was discovered in Varnish Cache 5.x and 6.x before 6.0.11,
  7.x before 7.1.2, and 7.2.x before 7.2.1. An attacker may introduce characters through HTTP/2
  pseudo-headers that are invalid in the context of an HTTP/1 request line, causing the Varnish
  server to produce invalid HTTP/1 requests to the backend. This could, in turn, be used to
  exploit vulnerabilities in a server behind the Varnish server. Note: the 6.0.x LTS series
  (before 6.0.11) is affected.'
