aliases:
  - CVE-2026-2327
summary: Versions of the package markdown-it from 13.0.0 and before 14.1.1 are vulnerable to
  Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to the use of the regex /\*+$/ in the linkify
  function. An attacker can supply a long sequence of * characters followed by a non-matching
  character, which triggers excessive backtracking and may lead to a denial-of-service condition.
