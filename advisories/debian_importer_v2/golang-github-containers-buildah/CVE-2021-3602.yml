aliases:
  - CVE-2021-3602
summary: An information disclosure flaw was found in Buildah, when building containers using
  chroot isolation. Running processes in container builds (e.g. Dockerfile RUN commands) can
  access environment variables from parent and grandparent processes. When run in a container
  in a CI/CD environment, environment variables may include sensitive information that was shared
  with the container in order to be used only by Buildah itself (e.g. container registry credentials).
