  - CVE-2024-1753
summary: A flaw was found in Buildah (and subsequently Podman Build) which allows containers
  to mount arbitrary locations on the host filesystem into build containers. A malicious Containerfile
  can use a dummy image with a symbolic link to the root filesystem as a mount source and cause
  the mount operation to mount the host root filesystem inside the RUN step. The commands inside
  the RUN step will then have read-write access to the host filesystem, allowing for full container
  escape at build time.
