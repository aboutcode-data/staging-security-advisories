aliases:
  - CVE-2024-9675
summary: A vulnerability was found in Buildah. Cache mounts do not properly validate that user-specified
  paths for the cache are within our cache directory, allowing a `RUN` instruction in a Container
  file to mount an arbitrary directory from the host (read/write) into the container as long
  as those files can be accessed by the user running Buildah.
