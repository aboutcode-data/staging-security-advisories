  - CVE-2022-39956
summary: The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is affected by a partial rule set bypass
  for HTTP multipart requests by submitting a payload that uses a character encoding scheme
  via the Content-Type or the deprecated Content-Transfer-Encoding multipart MIME header fields
  that will not be decoded and inspected by the web application firewall engine and the rule
  set. The multipart payload will therefore bypass detection. A vulnerable backend that supports
  these encoding schemes can potentially be exploited. The legacy CRS versions 3.0.x and 3.1.x
  are affected, as well as the currently supported versions 3.2.1 and 3.3.2. Integrators and
  users are advised upgrade to 3.2.2 and 3.3.3 respectively. The mitigation against these vulnerabilities
  depends on the installation of the latest ModSecurity version (v2.9.6 / v3.0.8).
