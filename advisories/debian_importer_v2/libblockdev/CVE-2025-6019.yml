summary: A Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) vulnerability was found in libblockdev. Generally,
  the "allow_active" setting in Polkit permits a physically present user to take certain actions
  based on the session type. Due to the way libblockdev interacts with the udisks daemon, an
  "allow_active" user on a system may be able escalate to full root privileges on the target
  host. Normally, udisks mounts user-provided filesystem images with security flags like nosuid
  and nodev to prevent privilege escalation.  However, a local attacker can create a specially
  crafted XFS image containing a SUID-root shell, then trick udisks into resizing it. This mounts
  their malicious filesystem with root privileges, allowing them to execute their SUID-root
  shell and gain complete control of the system.
