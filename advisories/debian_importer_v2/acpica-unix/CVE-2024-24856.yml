  - CVE-2024-24856
summary: The memory allocation function ACPI_ALLOCATE_ZEROED does not guarantee a successful
  allocation, but the subsequent code directly dereferences the pointer that receives it, which
  may lead to null pointer dereference.  To fix this issue, a null pointer check should be added.
  If it is null,  return exception code AE_NO_MEMORY.
