  - CVE-2017-13694
summary: The acpi_ps_complete_final_op() function in drivers/acpi/acpica/psobject.c in the Linux
  kernel through 4.12.9 does not flush the node and node_ext caches and causes a kernel stack
  dump, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory and bypass
  the KASLR protection mechanism (in the kernel through 4.9) via a crafted ACPI table.
