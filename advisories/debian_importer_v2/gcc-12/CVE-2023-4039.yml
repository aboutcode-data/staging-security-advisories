summary: '**DISPUTED**A failure in the -fstack-protector feature in GCC-based toolchains  that
  target AArch64 allows an attacker to exploit an existing buffer  overflow in dynamically-sized
  local variables in your application  without this being detected. This stack-protector failure
  only applies  to C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created using  alloca().
  The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized  local variables.  The default
  behavior when the stack-protector  detects an overflow is to terminate your application, resulting
  in  controlled loss of availability. An attacker who can exploit a buffer  overflow without
  triggering the stack-protector might be able to change  program flow control to cause an uncontrolled
  loss of availability or to  go further and affect confidentiality or integrity. NOTE: The
  GCC project argues that this is a missed hardening bug and not a vulnerability by itself.'
