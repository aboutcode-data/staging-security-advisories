  - CVE-2025-14282
summary: A flaw was found in Dropbear. When running in multi-user mode and authenticating users,
  the dropbear ssh server does the socket forwardings requested by the remote client as root,
  only switching to the logged-in user upon spawning a shell or performing some operations like
  reading the user's files. With the recent ability of also using unix domain sockets as the
  forwarding destination any user able to log in via ssh can connect to any unix socket with
  the root's credentials, bypassing both file system restrictions and any SO_PEERCRED / SO_PASSCRED
  checks performed by the peer.
