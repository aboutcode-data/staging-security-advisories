aliases:
  - CVE-2021-36369
summary: An issue was discovered in Dropbear through 2020.81. Due to a non-RFC-compliant check
  of the available authentication methods in the client-side SSH code, it is possible for an
  SSH server to change the login process in its favor. This attack can bypass additional security
  measures such as FIDO2 tokens or SSH-Askpass. Thus, it allows an attacker to abuse a forwarded
  agent for logging on to another server unnoticed.
