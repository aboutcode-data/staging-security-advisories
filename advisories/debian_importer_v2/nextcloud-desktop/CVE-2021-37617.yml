  - CVE-2021-37617
summary: The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from Nextcloud Server with
  a computer. The Nextcloud Desktop Client invokes its uninstaller script when being installed
  to make sure there are no remnants of previous installations. In versions 3.0.3 through 3.2.4,
  the Client searches the `Uninstall.exe` file in a folder that can be written by regular users.
  This could lead to a case where a malicious user creates a malicious `Uninstall.exe`, which
  would be executed with administrative privileges on the Nextcloud Desktop Client installation.
  This issue is fixed in Nextcloud Desktop Client version 3.3.0. As a workaround, do not allow
  untrusted users to create content in the `C:\` system folder and verify that there is no malicious
  `C:\Uninstall.exe` file on the system.
