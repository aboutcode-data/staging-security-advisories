summary: The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from Nextcloud Server with
  a computer. Clients using the Nextcloud end-to-end encryption feature download the public
  and private key via an API endpoint. In versions prior to 3.3.0, the Nextcloud Desktop client
  fails to check if a private key belongs to previously downloaded public certificate. If the
  Nextcloud instance serves a malicious public key, the data would be encrypted for this key
  and thus could be accessible to a malicious actor. This issue is fixed in Nextcloud Desktop
  Client version 3.3.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.
