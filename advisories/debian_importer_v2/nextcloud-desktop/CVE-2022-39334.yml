  - CVE-2022-39334
summary: Nextcloud also ships a CLI utility called nextcloudcmd which is sometimes used for
  automated scripting and headless servers. Versions of nextcloudcmd prior to 3.6.1 would incorrectly
  trust invalid TLS certificates, which may enable a Man-in-the-middle attack that exposes sensitive
  data or credentials to a network attacker. This affects the CLI only. It does not affect the
  standard GUI desktop Nextcloud clients, and it does not affect the Nextcloud server.
