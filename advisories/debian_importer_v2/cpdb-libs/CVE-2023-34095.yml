  - CVE-2023-34095
summary: cpdb-libs provides frontend and backend libraries for the Common Printing Dialog Backends
  (CPDB) project. In versions 1.0 through 2.0b4, cpdb-libs is vulnerable to buffer overflows
  via improper use of `scanf(3)`. cpdb-libs uses the `fscanf()` and `scanf()` functions to parse
  command lines and configuration files, dropping the read string components into fixed-length
  buffers, but does not limit the length of the strings to be read by `fscanf()` and `scanf()`
  causing buffer overflows when a string is longer than 1023 characters. A patch for this issue
  is available at commit f181bd1f14757c2ae0f17cc76dc20421a40f30b7. As all buffers have a length
  of 1024 characters, the patch limits the maximum string length to be read to 1023 by replacing
  all occurrences of `%s` with `%1023s` in all calls of the `fscanf()` and `scanf()` functions.
