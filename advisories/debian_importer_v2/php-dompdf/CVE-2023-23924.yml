  - CVE-2023-23924
summary: Dompdf is an HTML to PDF converter. The URI validation on dompdf 2.0.1 can be bypassed
  on SVG parsing by passing `<image>` tags with uppercase letters. This may lead to arbitrary
  object unserialize on PHP < 8, through the `phar` URL wrapper. An attacker can exploit the
  vulnerability to call arbitrary URL with arbitrary protocols, if they can provide a SVG file
  to dompdf. In PHP versions before 8.0.0, it leads to arbitrary unserialize, that will lead
  to the very least to an arbitrary file deletion and even remote code execution, depending
  on classes that are available.
