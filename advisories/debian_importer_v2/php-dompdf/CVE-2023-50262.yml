summary: Dompdf is an HTML to PDF converter for PHP. When parsing SVG images Dompdf performs
  an initial validation to ensure that paths within the SVG are allowed. One of the validations
  is that the SVG document does not reference itself. However, prior to version 2.0.4, a recursive
  chained using two or more SVG documents is not correctly validated. Depending on the system
  configuration and attack pattern this could exhaust the memory available to the executing
  process and/or to the server itself.  php-svg-lib, when run in isolation, does not support
  SVG references for `image` elements. However, when used in combination with Dompdf, php-svg-lib
  will process SVG images referenced by an `image` element. Dompdf currently includes validation
  to prevent self-referential `image` references, but a chained reference is not checked. A
  malicious actor may thus trigger infinite recursion by chaining references between two or
  more SVG images.  When Dompdf parses a malicious payload, it will crash due after exceeding
  the allowed execution time or memory usage. An attacker sending multiple request to a system
  can potentially cause resource exhaustion to the point that the system is unable to handle
  incoming request.  Version 2.0.4 contains a fix for this issue.
