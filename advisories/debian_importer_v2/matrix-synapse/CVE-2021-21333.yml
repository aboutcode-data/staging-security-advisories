summary: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse).
  Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version
  1.27.0, the notification emails sent for notifications for missed messages or for an expiring
  account are subject to HTML injection. In the case of the notification for missed messages,
  this could allow an attacker to insert forged content into the email. The account expiry feature
  is not enabled by default and the HTML injection is not controllable by an attacker. This
  is fixed in version 1.27.0.
