summary: 'Synapse is a Matrix protocol homeserver written in Python with the Twisted framework.
  In affected versions it may be possible for a deactivated user to login when using uncommon
  configurations. This only applies if any of the following are true: 1. JSON Web Tokens are
  enabled for login via the `jwt_config.enabled` configuration setting. 2. The local password
  database is enabled via the `password_config.enabled` and `password_config.localdb_enabled`
  configuration settings *and* a user''s password is updated via an admin API after a user is
  deactivated. Note that the local password database is enabled by default, but it is uncommon
  to set a user''s password after they''ve been deactivated. Installations that are configured
  to only allow login via Single Sign-On (SSO) via CAS, SAML or OpenID Connect (OIDC); or via
  an external password provider (e.g. LDAP) are not affected. If not using JSON Web Tokens,
  ensure that deactivated users do not have a password set. This issue has been addressed in
  version 1.85.0. Users are advised to upgrade.'
