summary: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse).
  Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version
  1.33.2 "Push rules" can specify conditions under which they will match, including `event_match`,
  which matches event content against a pattern including wildcards. Certain patterns can cause
  very poor performance in the matching engine, leading to a denial-of-service when processing
  moderate length events. The issue is patched in version 1.33.2. A potential workaround might
  be to prevent users from making custom push rules, by blocking such requests at a reverse-proxy.
