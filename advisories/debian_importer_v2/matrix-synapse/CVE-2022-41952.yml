  - CVE-2022-41952
summary: 'Synapse before 1.52.0 with URL preview functionality enabled will attempt to generate
  URL previews for media stream URLs without properly limiting connection time. Connections
  will only be terminated after `max_spider_size` (default: 10M) bytes have been downloaded,
  which can in some cases lead to long-lived connections towards the streaming media server
  (for instance, Icecast). This can cause excessive traffic and connections toward such servers
  if their stream URL is, for example, posted to a large room with many Synapse instances with
  URL preview enabled. Version 1.52.0 implements a timeout mechanism which will terminate URL
  preview connections after 30 seconds. Since generating URL previews for media streams is not
  supported and always fails, 1.53.0 additionally implements an allow list for content types
  for which Synapse will even attempt to generate a URL preview. Upgrade to 1.53.0 to fully
  resolve the issue. As a workaround, turn off URL preview functionality by setting `url_preview_enabled:
  false` in the Synapse configuration file.'
