  - CVE-2025-61672
summary: Synapse is an open source Matrix homeserver implementation. Lack of validation for
  device keys in Synapse before 1.138.3 and in Synapse 1.139.0 allow an attacker registered
  on the victim homeserver to degrade federation functionality, unpredictably breaking outbound
  federation to other homeservers. The issue is patched in Synapse 1.138.3, 1.138.4, 1.139.1,
  and 1.139.2. Note that even though 1.138.3 and 1.139.1 fix the vulnerability, they inadvertently
  introduced an unrelated regression. For this reason, the maintainers of Synapse recommend
  skipping these releases and upgrading straight to 1.138.4 and 1.139.2.
