summary: 'Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over IP. In
  versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the membership (list of members,
  with their display names) of a room if they know the ID of the room. The vulnerability is
  limited to rooms with `shared` history visibility. Furthermore, the unauthorised user must
  be using an account on a vulnerable homeserver that is in the room. Server administrators
  should upgrade to 1.41.1 or later in order to receive the patch. One workaround is available.
  Administrators of servers that use a reverse proxy could, with potentially unacceptable loss
  of functionality, block the endpoints: `/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at`
  query parameter, and `/_matrix/client/unstable/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter.'
