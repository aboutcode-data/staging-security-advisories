  - CVE-2024-52805
summary: Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver. In Synapse before 1.120.1, multipart/form-data
  requests can in certain configurations transiently increase memory consumption beyond expected
  levels while processing the request, which can be used to amplify denial of service attacks.
  Synapse 1.120.1 resolves the issue by denying requests with unsupported multipart/form-data
  content type.
