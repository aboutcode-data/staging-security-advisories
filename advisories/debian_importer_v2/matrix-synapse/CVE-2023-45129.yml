  - CVE-2023-45129
summary: Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by the Matrix.org
  Foundation. Prior to version 1.94.0, a malicious server ACL event can impact performance temporarily
  or permanently leading to a persistent denial of service. Homeservers running on a closed
  federation (which presumably do not need to use server ACLs) are not affected. Server administrators
  are advised to upgrade to Synapse 1.94.0 or later. As a workaround, rooms with malicious server
  ACL events can be purged and blocked using the admin API.
