  - CVE-2020-26257
summary: Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. Synapse is a
  reference "homeserver" implementation of Matrix. A malicious or poorly-implemented homeserver
  can inject malformed events into a room by specifying a different room id in the path of a
  `/send_join`, `/send_leave`, `/invite` or `/exchange_third_party_invite` request. This can
  lead to a denial of service in which future events will not be correctly sent to other servers
  over federation. This affects any server which accepts federation requests from untrusted
  servers. The Matrix Synapse reference implementation before version 1.23.1 the implementation
  is vulnerable to this injection attack. Issue is fixed in version 1.23.1. As a workaround
  homeserver administrators could limit access to the federation API to trusted servers (for
  example via `federation_domain_whitelist`).
