  - CVE-2020-26890
summary: Matrix Synapse before 1.20.0 erroneously permits non-standard NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity
  JSON values in fields of m.room.member events, allowing remote attackers to execute a denial
  of service attack against the federation and common Matrix clients. If such a malformed event
  is accepted into the room's state, the impact is long-lasting and is not fixed by an upgrade
  to a newer version, requiring the event to be manually redacted instead. Since events are
  replicated to servers of other room members, the impact is not constrained to the server of
  the event sender.
