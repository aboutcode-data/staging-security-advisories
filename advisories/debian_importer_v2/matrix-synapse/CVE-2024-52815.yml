summary: Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver. Synapse versions before 1.120.1 fail to
  properly validate invites received over federation. This vulnerability allows a malicious
  server to send a specially crafted invite that disrupts the invited user's /sync functionality.
  Synapse 1.120.1 rejects such invalid invites received over federation and restores the ability
  to sync for affected users.
