  - CVE-2022-39374
summary: Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by the Matrix.org
  Foundation. If Synapse and a malicious homeserver are both joined to the same room, the malicious
  homeserver can trick Synapse into accepting previously rejected events into its view of the
  current state of that room. This can be exploited in a way that causes all further messages
  and state changes sent in that room from the vulnerable homeserver to be rejected. This issue
  has been patched in version 1.68.0
