  - CVE-2024-53863
summary: 'Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver. In Synapse versions before 1.120.1, enabling
  the dynamic_thumbnails option or processing a specially crafted request could trigger the
  decoding and thumbnail generation of uncommon image formats, potentially invoking external
  tools like Ghostscript for processing. This significantly expands the attack surface in a
  historically vulnerable area, presenting a risk that far outweighs the benefit, particularly
  since these formats are rarely used on the open web or within the Matrix ecosystem. Synapse
  1.120.1 addresses the issue by restricting thumbnail generation to images in the following
  widely used formats: PNG, JPEG, GIF, and WebP. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.120.1.'
