  - CVE-2023-43796
summary: Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver Prior to versions 1.95.1 and 1.96.0rc1,
  cached device information of remote users can be queried from Synapse. This can be used to
  enumerate the remote users known to a homeserver. System administrators are encouraged to
  upgrade to Synapse 1.95.1 or 1.96.0rc1 to receive a patch. As a workaround, the `federation_domain_whitelist`
  can be used to limit federation traffic with a homeserver.
