  - CVE-2024-37303
summary: Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver. Synapse before version 1.106 allows, by
  design, unauthenticated remote participants to trigger a download and caching of remote media
  from a remote homeserver to the local media repository. Such content then also becomes available
  for download from the local homeserver in an unauthenticated way. The implication is that
  unauthenticated remote adversaries can use this functionality to plant problematic content
  into the media repository. Synapse 1.106 introduces a partial mitigation in the form of new
  endpoints which require authentication for media downloads. The unauthenticated endpoints
  will be frozen in a future release, closing the attack vector.
