aliases:
  - CVE-2023-5752
summary: When installing a package from a Mercurial VCS URL  (ie "pip install  hg+...") with
  pip prior to v23.3, the specified Mercurial revision could  be used to inject arbitrary configuration
  options to the "hg clone"  call (ie "--config"). Controlling the Mercurial configuration can
  modify  how and which repository is installed. This vulnerability does not  affect users who
  aren't installing from Mercurial.
