  - CVE-2019-20916
summary: The pip package before 19.2 for Python allows Directory Traversal when a URL is given
  in an install command, because a Content-Disposition header can have ../ in a filename, as
  demonstrated by overwriting the /root/.ssh/authorized_keys file. This occurs in _download_http_url
  in _internal/download.py.
