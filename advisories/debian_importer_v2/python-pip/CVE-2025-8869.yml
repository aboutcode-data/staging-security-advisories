  - CVE-2025-8869
summary: When extracting a tar archive pip may not check symbolic links point into the extraction
  directory if the tarfile module doesn't implement PEP 706. Note that upgrading pip to a "fixed"
  version for this vulnerability doesn't fix all known vulnerabilities that are remediated by
  using a Python version that implements PEP 706.  Note that this is a vulnerability in pip's
  fallback implementation of tar extraction for Python versions that don't implement PEP 706
  and therefore are not secure to all vulnerabilities in the Python 'tarfile' module. If you're
  using a Python version that implements PEP 706 then pip doesn't use the "vulnerable" fallback
  code.  Mitigations include upgrading to a version of pip that includes the fix, upgrading
  to a Python version that implements PEP 706 (Python >=3.9.17, >=3.10.12, >=3.11.4, or >=3.12),
  applying the linked patch, or inspecting source distributions (sdists) before installation
  as is already a best-practice.
