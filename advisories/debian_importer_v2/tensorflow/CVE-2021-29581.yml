summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. Due to lack
  of validation in `tf.raw_ops.CTCBeamSearchDecoder`, an attacker can trigger denial of service
  via segmentation faults. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a74768f8e4efbda4def9f16ee7e13cf3922ac5f7/tensorflow/core/kernels/ctc_decoder_ops.cc#L68-L79)
  fails to detect cases when the input tensor is empty and proceeds to read data from a null
  buffer. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are
  also affected and still in supported range.
