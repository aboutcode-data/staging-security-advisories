  - CVE-2021-37674
summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected
  versions an attacker can trigger a denial of service via a segmentation fault in `tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGrad`
  caused by missing validation. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/maxpooling_op.cc)
  misses some validation for the `orig_input` and `orig_output` tensors. The fixes for CVE-2021-29579
  were incomplete. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 136b51f10903e044308cf77117c0ed9871350475.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported
  range.
