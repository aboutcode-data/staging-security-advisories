summary: In Tensorflow before version 2.3.1, the `RaggedCountSparseOutput` implementation does
  not validate that the input arguments form a valid ragged tensor. In particular, there is
  no validation that the values in the `splits` tensor generate a valid partitioning of the
  `values` tensor. Hence, the code is prone to heap buffer overflow. If `split_values` does
  not end with a value at least `num_values` then the `while` loop condition will trigger a
  read outside of the bounds of `split_values` once `batch_idx` grows too large. The issue is
  patched in commit 3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02 and is released in TensorFlow version
  2.3.1.
