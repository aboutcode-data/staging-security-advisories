  - CVE-2022-29195
summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0,
  2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.StagePeek` does not fully validate
  the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial
  of service attack. The code assumes `index` is a scalar but there is no validation for this
  before accessing its value. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this
  issue.
