  - CVE-2022-23563
summary: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. In multiple places, TensorFlow
  uses `tempfile.mktemp` to create temporary files. While this is acceptable in testing, in
  utilities and libraries it is dangerous as a different process can create the file between
  the check for the filename in `mktemp` and the actual creation of the file by a subsequent
  operation (a TOC/TOU type of weakness). In several instances, TensorFlow was supposed to actually
  create a temporary directory instead of a file. This logic bug is hidden away by the `mktemp`
  function usage. We have patched the issue in several commits, replacing `mktemp` with the
  safer `mkstemp`/`mkdtemp` functions, according to the usage pattern. Users are advised to
  upgrade as soon as possible.
