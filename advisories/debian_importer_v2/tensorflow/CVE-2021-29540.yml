summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker
  can cause a heap buffer overflow to occur in `Conv2DBackpropFilter`. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1b0296c3b8dd9bd948f924aa8cd62f87dbb7c3da/tensorflow/core/kernels/conv_grad_filter_ops.cc#L495-L497)
  computes the size of the filter tensor but does not validate that it matches the number of
  elements in `filter_sizes`. Later, when reading/writing to this buffer, code uses the value
  computed here, instead of the number of elements in the tensor. The fix will be included in
  TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3,
  TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
