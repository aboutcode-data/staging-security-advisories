  - CVE-2021-29596
summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The implementation
  of the `EmbeddingLookup` TFLite operator is vulnerable to a division by zero error(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/e4b29809543b250bc9b19678ec4776299dd569ba/tensorflow/lite/kernels/embedding_lookup.cc#L73-L74).
  An attacker can craft a model such that the first dimension of the `value` input is 0. The
  fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range.
