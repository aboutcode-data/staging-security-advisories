summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. When `RandomPoissonV2`
  receives large input shape and rates, it gives a `CHECK` fail that can trigger a denial of
  service attack. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 552bfced6ce4809db5f3ca305f60ff80dd40c5a3.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported
  range. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
