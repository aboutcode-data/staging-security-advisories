summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker
  can trigger a dereference of a null pointer in `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams`. This is because
  the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1cdd4da14282210cc759e468d9781741ac7d01bf/tensorflow/core/kernels/string_ngrams_op.cc#L67-L74)
  does not fully validate the `data_splits` argument. This would result in `ngrams_data`(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1cdd4da14282210cc759e468d9781741ac7d01bf/tensorflow/core/kernels/string_ngrams_op.cc#L106-L110)
  to be a null pointer when the output would be computed to have 0 or negative size. Later writes
  to the output tensor would then cause a null pointer dereference. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3,
  TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
