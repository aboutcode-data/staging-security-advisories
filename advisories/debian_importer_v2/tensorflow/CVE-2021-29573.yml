  - CVE-2021-29573
summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The implementation
  of `tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGradWithArgmax` is vulnerable to a division by 0. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/279bab6efa22752a2827621b7edb56a730233bd8/tensorflow/core/kernels/maxpooling_op.cc#L1033-L1034)
  fails to validate that the batch dimension of the tensor is non-zero, before dividing by this
  quantity. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are
  also affected and still in supported range.
