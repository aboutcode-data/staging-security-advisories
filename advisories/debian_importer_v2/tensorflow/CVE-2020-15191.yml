  - CVE-2020-15191
summary: In Tensorflow before versions 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, if a user passes an invalid argument
  to `dlpack.to_dlpack` the expected validations will cause variables to bind to `nullptr` while
  setting a `status` variable to the error condition. However, this `status` argument is not
  properly checked. Hence, code following these methods will bind references to null pointers.
  This is undefined behavior and reported as an error if compiling with `-fsanitize=null`. The
  issue is patched in commit 22e07fb204386768e5bcbea563641ea11f96ceb8 and is released in TensorFlow
  versions 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.
