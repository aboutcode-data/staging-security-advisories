summary: 'TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions while
  calculating the size of the output within the `tf.range` kernel, there is a conditional statement
  of type `int64 = condition ? int64 : double`. Due to C++ implicit conversion rules, both branches
  of the condition will be cast to `double` and the result would be truncated before the assignment.
  This result in overflows. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also
  affected and still in supported range.'
