  - CVE-2021-37673
summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected
  versions an attacker can trigger a denial of service via a `CHECK`-fail in `tf.raw_ops.MapStage`.
  The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/map_stage_op.cc#L513)
  does not check that the `key` input is a valid non-empty tensor. We have patched the issue
  in GitHub commit d7de67733925de196ec8863a33445b73f9562d1d. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow
  2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
