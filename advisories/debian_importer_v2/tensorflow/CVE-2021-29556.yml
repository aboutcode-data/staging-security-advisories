summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker
  can cause a denial of service via a FPE runtime error in `tf.raw_ops.Reverse`. This is because
  the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/36229ea9e9451dac14a8b1f4711c435a1d84a594/tensorflow/core/kernels/reverse_op.cc#L75-L76)
  performs a division based on the first dimension of the tensor argument. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3,
  TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
