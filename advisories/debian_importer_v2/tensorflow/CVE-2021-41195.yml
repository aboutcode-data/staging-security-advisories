  - CVE-2021-41195
summary: 'TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the
  implementation of `tf.math.segment_*` operations results in a `CHECK`-fail related abort (and
  denial of service) if a segment id in `segment_ids` is large. This is similar to CVE-2021-29584
  (and similar other reported vulnerabilities in TensorFlow, localized to specific APIs): the
  implementation (both on CPU and GPU) computes the output shape using `AddDim`. However, if
  the number of elements in the tensor overflows an `int64_t` value, `AddDim` results in a `CHECK`
  failure which provokes a `std::abort`. Instead, code should use `AddDimWithStatus`. The fix
  will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1,
  TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported
  range.'
