summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. Due to lack
  of validation in `tf.raw_ops.Dequantize`, an attacker can trigger a read from outside of bounds
  of heap allocated data. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/26003593aa94b1742f34dc22ce88a1e17776a67d/tensorflow/core/kernels/dequantize_op.cc#L106-L131)
  accesses the `min_range` and `max_range` tensors in parallel but fails to check that they
  have the same shape. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4,
  as these are also affected and still in supported range.
