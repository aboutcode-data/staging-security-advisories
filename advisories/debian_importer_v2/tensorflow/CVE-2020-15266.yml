  - CVE-2020-15266
summary: In Tensorflow before version 2.4.0, when the `boxes` argument of `tf.image.crop_and_resize`
  has a very large value, the CPU kernel implementation receives it as a C++ `nan` floating
  point value. Attempting to operate on this is undefined behavior which later produces a segmentation
  fault. The issue is patched in eccb7ec454e6617738554a255d77f08e60ee0808 and TensorFlow 2.4.0
  will be released containing the patch. TensorFlow nightly packages after this commit will
  also have the issue resolved.
