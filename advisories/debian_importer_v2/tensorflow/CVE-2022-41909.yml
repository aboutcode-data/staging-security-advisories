summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. An input `encoded` that
  is not a valid `CompositeTensorVariant` tensor will trigger a segfault in `tf.raw_ops.CompositeTensorVariantToComponents`.
  We have patched the issue in GitHub commits bf594d08d377dc6a3354d9fdb494b32d45f91971 and 660ce5a89eb6766834bdc303d2ab3902aef99d3d.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
