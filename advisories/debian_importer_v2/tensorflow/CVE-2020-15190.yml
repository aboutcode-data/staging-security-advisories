  - CVE-2020-15190
summary: In Tensorflow before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, the `tf.raw_ops.Switch`
  operation takes as input a tensor and a boolean and outputs two tensors. Depending on the
  boolean value, one of the tensors is exactly the input tensor whereas the other one should
  be an empty tensor. However, the eager runtime traverses all tensors in the output. Since
  only one of the tensors is defined, the other one is `nullptr`, hence we are binding a reference
  to `nullptr`. This is undefined behavior and reported as an error if compiling with `-fsanitize=null`.
  In this case, this results in a segmentation fault The issue is patched in commit da8558533d925694483d2c136a9220d6d49d843c,
  and is released in TensorFlow versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.
