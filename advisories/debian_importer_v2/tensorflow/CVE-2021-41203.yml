  - CVE-2021-41203
summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions an
  attacker can trigger undefined behavior, integer overflows, segfaults and `CHECK`-fail crashes
  if they can change saved checkpoints from outside of TensorFlow. This is because the checkpoints
  loading infrastructure is missing validation for invalid file formats. The fixes will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick these commits on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow
  2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
