summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. If `RaggedTensorToVariant`
  is given a `rt_nested_splits` list that contains tensors of ranks other than one, it results
  in a `CHECK` fail that can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. We have patched
  the issue in GitHub commit 88f93dfe691563baa4ae1e80ccde2d5c7a143821. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow
  2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range. There
  are no known workarounds for this issue.
