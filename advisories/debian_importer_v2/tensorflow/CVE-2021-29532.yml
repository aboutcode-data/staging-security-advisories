summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker
  can force accesses outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays by passing in invalid tensor
  values to `tf.raw_ops.RaggedCross`. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/efea03b38fb8d3b81762237dc85e579cc5fc6e87/tensorflow/core/kernels/ragged_cross_op.cc#L456-L487)
  lacks validation for the user supplied arguments. Each of the above branches call a helper
  function after accessing array elements via a `*_list[next_*]` pattern, followed by incrementing
  the `next_*` index. However, as there is no validation that the `next_*` values are in the
  valid range for the corresponding `*_list` arrays, this results in heap OOB reads. The fix
  will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2,
  TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range.
