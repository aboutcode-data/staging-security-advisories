  - CVE-2022-41883
summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. When ops that have specified
  input sizes receive a differing number of inputs, the executor will crash. We have patched
  the issue in GitHub commit f5381e0e10b5a61344109c1b7c174c68110f7629. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow
  2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
