  - CVE-2021-29562
summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker
  can cause a denial of service by exploiting a `CHECK`-failure coming from the implementation
  of `tf.raw_ops.IRFFT`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4,
  as these are also affected and still in supported range.
