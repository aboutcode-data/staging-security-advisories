summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker
  can cause a denial of service by controlling the values of `num_segments` tensor argument
  for `UnsortedSegmentJoin`. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a2a607db15c7cd01d754d37e5448d72a13491bdb/tensorflow/core/kernels/unsorted_segment_join_op.cc#L92-L93)
  assumes that the `num_segments` tensor is a valid scalar. Since the tensor is empty the `CHECK`
  involved in `.scalar<T>()()` that checks that the number of elements is exactly 1 will be
  invalidated and this would result in process termination. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow
  2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
