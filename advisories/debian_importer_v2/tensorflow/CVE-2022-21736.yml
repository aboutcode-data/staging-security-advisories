  - CVE-2022-21736
summary: 'Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `SparseTensorSliceDataset`
  has an undefined behavior: under certain condition it can be made to dereference a `nullptr`
  value. The 3 input arguments to `SparseTensorSliceDataset` represent a sparse tensor. However,
  there are some preconditions that these arguments must satisfy but these are not validated
  in the implementation. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also
  affected and still in supported range.'
