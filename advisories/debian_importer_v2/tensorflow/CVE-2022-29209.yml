summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0,
  2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the macros that TensorFlow uses for writing assertions (e.g., `CHECK_LT`,
  `CHECK_GT`, etc.) have an incorrect logic when comparing `size_t` and `int` values. Due to
  type conversion rules, several of the macros would trigger incorrectly. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1,
  2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.
