  - CVE-2022-21738
summary: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `SparseCountSparseOutput`
  can be made to crash a TensorFlow process by an integer overflow whose result is then used
  in a memory allocation. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also
  affected and still in supported range.
