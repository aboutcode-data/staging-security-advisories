  - CVE-2022-23592
summary: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. TensorFlow's type inference
  can cause a heap out of bounds read as the bounds checking is done in a `DCHECK` (which is
  a no-op during production). An attacker can control the `input_idx` variable such that `ix`
  would be larger than the number of values in `node_t.args`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  2.8.0. This is the only affected version.
