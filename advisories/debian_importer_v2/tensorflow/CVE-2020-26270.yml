  - CVE-2020-26270
summary: In affected versions of TensorFlow running an LSTM/GRU model where the LSTM/GRU layer
  receives an input with zero-length results in a CHECK failure when using the CUDA backend.
  This can result in a query-of-death vulnerability, via denial of service, if users can control
  the input to the layer. This is fixed in versions 1.15.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3, 2.2.2, 2.3.2, and
  2.4.0.
