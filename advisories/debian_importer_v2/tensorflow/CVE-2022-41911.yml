summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. When printing a tensor,
  we get it's data as a `const char*` array (since that's the underlying storage) and then we
  typecast it to the element type. However, conversions from `char` to `bool` are undefined
  if the `char` is not `0` or `1`, so sanitizers/fuzzers will crash. The issue has been patched
  in GitHub commit `1be74370327`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11.0. We will also
  cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, TensorFlow 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range.
