summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker
  can trigger a denial of service via a `CHECK`-fail in converting sparse tensors to CSR Sparse
  matrices. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/800346f2c03a27e182dd4fba48295f65e7790739/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse/kernels.cc#L66)
  does a double redirection to access an element of an array allocated on the heap. If the value
  at `indices(i, 0)` is such that `indices(i, 0) + 1` is outside the bounds of `csr_row_ptr`,
  this results in writing outside of bounds of heap allocated data. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3,
  TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
