  - CVE-2022-29216
summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0,
  2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, TensorFlow's `saved_model_cli` tool is vulnerable to a code injection.
  This can be used to open a reverse shell. This code path was maintained for compatibility
  reasons as the maintainers had several test cases where numpy expressions were used as arguments.
  However, given that the tool is always run manually, the impact of this is still not severe.
  The maintainers have now removed the `safe=False` argument, so all parsing is done without
  calling `eval`. The patch is available in versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4.
