  - CVE-2021-37664
summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected
  versions an attacker can read from outside of bounds of heap allocated data by sending specially
  crafted illegal arguments to `BoostedTreesSparseCalculateBestFeatureSplit`. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/84d053187cb80d975ef2b9684d4b61981bca0c41/tensorflow/core/kernels/boosted_trees/stats_ops.cc)
  needs to validate that each value in `stats_summary_indices` is in range. We have patched
  the issue in GitHub commit e84c975313e8e8e38bb2ea118196369c45c51378. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3,
  and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
