summary: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `Dequantize`
  does not fully validate the value of `axis` and can result in heap OOB accesses. The `axis`
  argument can be `-1` (the default value for the optional argument) or any other positive value
  at most the number of dimensions of the input. Unfortunately, the upper bound is not checked
  and this results in reading past the end of the array containing the dimensions of the input
  tensor. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and
  still in supported range.
