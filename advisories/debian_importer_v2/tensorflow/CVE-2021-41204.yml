  - CVE-2021-41204
summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions during
  TensorFlow's Grappler optimizer phase, constant folding might attempt to deep copy a resource
  tensor. This results in a segfault, as these tensors are supposed to not change. The fix will
  be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1,
  TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported
  range.
