  - CVE-2022-21739
summary: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `QuantizedMaxPool`
  has an undefined behavior where user controlled inputs can trigger a reference binding to
  null pointer. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and
  still in supported range.
