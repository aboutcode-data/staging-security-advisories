  - CVE-2022-29203
summary: 'TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0,
  2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.SpaceToBatchND` (in all backends
  such as XLA and handwritten kernels) is vulnerable to an integer overflow: The result of this
  integer overflow is used to allocate the output tensor, hence we get a denial of service via
  a `CHECK`-failure (assertion failure), as in TFSA-2021-198. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2,
  and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.'
