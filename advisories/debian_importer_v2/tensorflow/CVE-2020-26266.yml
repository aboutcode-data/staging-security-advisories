  - CVE-2020-26266
summary: In affected versions of TensorFlow under certain cases a saved model can trigger use
  of uninitialized values during code execution. This is caused by having tensor buffers be
  filled with the default value of the type but forgetting to default initialize the quantized
  floating point types in Eigen. This is fixed in versions 1.15.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3, 2.2.2, 2.3.2,
  and 2.4.0.
