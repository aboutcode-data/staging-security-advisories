  - CVE-2021-41206
summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions several
  TensorFlow operations are missing validation for the shapes of the tensor arguments involved
  in the call. Depending on the API, this can result in undefined behavior and segfault or `CHECK`-fail
  related crashes but in some scenarios writes and reads from heap populated arrays are also
  possible. We have discovered these issues internally via tooling while working on improving/testing
  GPU op determinism. As such, we don't have reproducers and there will be multiple fixes for
  these issues. These fixes will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick these
  commits on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range.
