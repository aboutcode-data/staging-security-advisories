summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The implementation
  of `tf.raw_ops.ReverseSequence` allows for stack overflow and/or `CHECK`-fail based denial
  of service. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5b3b071975e01f0d250c928b2a8f901cd53b90a7/tensorflow/core/kernels/reverse_sequence_op.cc#L114-L118)
  fails to validate that `seq_dim` and `batch_dim` arguments are valid. Negative values for
  `seq_dim` can result in stack overflow or `CHECK`-failure, depending on the version of Eigen
  code used to implement the operation. Similar behavior can be exhibited by invalid values
  of `batch_dim`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this
  commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range.
