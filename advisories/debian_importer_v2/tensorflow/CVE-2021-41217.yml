summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the
  process of building the control flow graph for a TensorFlow model is vulnerable to a null
  pointer exception when nodes that should be paired are not. This occurs because the code assumes
  that the first node in the pairing (e.g., an `Enter` node) always exists when encountering
  the second node (e.g., an `Exit` node). When this is not the case, `parent` is `nullptr` so
  dereferencing it causes a crash. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also
  cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range.
