summary: In Tensorflow before version 2.3.1, the `RaggedCountSparseOutput` implementation does
  not validate that the input arguments form a valid ragged tensor. In particular, there is
  no validation that the values in the `splits` tensor generate a valid partitioning of the
  `values` tensor. Thus, the code sets up conditions to cause a heap buffer overflow. A `BatchedMap`
  is equivalent to a vector where each element is a hashmap. However, if the first element of
  `splits_values` is not 0, `batch_idx` will never be 1, hence there will be no hashmap at index
  0 in `per_batch_counts`. Trying to access that in the user code results in a segmentation
  fault. The issue is patched in commit 3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02 and is released
  in TensorFlow version 2.3.1.
