summary: In Tensorflow before version 2.3.1, the `RaggedCountSparseOutput` does not validate
  that the input arguments form a valid ragged tensor. In particular, there is no validation
  that the `splits` tensor has the minimum required number of elements. Code uses this quantity
  to initialize a different data structure. Since `BatchedMap` is equivalent to a vector, it
  needs to have at least one element to not be `nullptr`. If user passes a `splits` tensor that
  is empty or has exactly one element, we get a `SIGABRT` signal raised by the operating system.
  The issue is patched in commit 3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02 and is released in
  TensorFlow version 2.3.1.
