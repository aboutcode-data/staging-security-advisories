  - CVE-2020-15193
summary: In Tensorflow before versions 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, the implementation of `dlpack.to_dlpack`
  can be made to use uninitialized memory resulting in further memory corruption. This is because
  the pybind11 glue code assumes that the argument is a tensor. However, there is nothing stopping
  users from passing in a Python object instead of a tensor. The uninitialized memory address
  is due to a `reinterpret_cast` Since the `PyObject` is a Python object, not a TensorFlow Tensor,
  the cast to `EagerTensor` fails. The issue is patched in commit 22e07fb204386768e5bcbea563641ea11f96ceb8
  and is released in TensorFlow versions 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.
