summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the
  code for sparse matrix multiplication is vulnerable to undefined behavior via binding a reference
  to `nullptr`. This occurs whenever the dimensions of `a` or `b` are 0 or less. In the case
  on one of these is 0, an empty output tensor should be allocated (to conserve the invariant
  that output tensors are always allocated when the operation is successful) but nothing should
  be written to it (that is, we should return early from the kernel implementation). Otherwise,
  attempts to write to this empty tensor would result in heap OOB access. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2,
  and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
