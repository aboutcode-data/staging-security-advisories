  - CVE-2020-15192
summary: In Tensorflow before versions 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, if a user passes a list of strings to
  `dlpack.to_dlpack` there is a memory leak following an expected validation failure. The issue
  occurs because the `status` argument during validation failures is not properly checked. Since
  each of the above methods can return an error status, the `status` value must be checked before
  continuing. The issue is patched in commit 22e07fb204386768e5bcbea563641ea11f96ceb8 and is
  released in TensorFlow versions 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.
