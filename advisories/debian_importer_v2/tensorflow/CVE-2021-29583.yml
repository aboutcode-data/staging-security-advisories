summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The implementation
  of `tf.raw_ops.FusedBatchNorm` is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. If the tensors are
  empty, the same implementation can trigger undefined behavior by dereferencing null pointers.
  The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/57d86e0db5d1365f19adcce848dfc1bf89fdd4c7/tensorflow/core/kernels/fused_batch_norm_op.cc)
  fails to validate that `scale`, `offset`, `mean` and `variance` (the last two only when required)
  all have the same number of elements as the number of channels of `x`. This results in heap
  out of bounds reads when the buffers backing these tensors are indexed past their boundary.
  If the tensors are empty, the validation mentioned in the above paragraph would also trigger
  and prevent the undefined behavior. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will
  also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
  2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
