summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The implementation
  of `tf.raw_ops.SdcaOptimizer` triggers undefined behavior due to dereferencing a null pointer.
  The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/60a45c8b6192a4699f2e2709a2645a751d435cc3/tensorflow/core/kernels/sdca_internal.cc)
  does not validate that the user supplied arguments satisfy all constraints expected by the
  op(https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/raw_ops/SdcaOptimizer). The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3,
  TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
