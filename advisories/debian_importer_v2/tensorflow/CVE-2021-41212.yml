summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the
  shape inference code for `tf.ragged.cross` can trigger a read outside of bounds of heap allocated
  array. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on
  TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range.
