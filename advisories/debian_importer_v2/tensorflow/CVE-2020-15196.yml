  - CVE-2020-15196
summary: In Tensorflow version 2.3.0, the `SparseCountSparseOutput` and `RaggedCountSparseOutput`
  implementations don't validate that the `weights` tensor has the same shape as the data. The
  check exists for `DenseCountSparseOutput`, where both tensors are fully specified. In the
  sparse and ragged count weights are still accessed in parallel with the data. But, since there
  is no validation, a user passing fewer weights than the values for the tensors can generate
  a read from outside the bounds of the heap buffer allocated for the weights. The issue is
  patched in commit 3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02 and is released in TensorFlow version
  2.3.1.
