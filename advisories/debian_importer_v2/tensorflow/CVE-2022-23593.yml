  - CVE-2022-23593
summary: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The `simplifyBroadcast` function
  in the MLIR-TFRT infrastructure in TensorFlow is vulnerable to a segfault (hence, denial of
  service), if called with scalar shapes. If all shapes are scalar, then `maxRank` is 0, so
  we build an empty `SmallVector`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. This is the
  only affected version.
