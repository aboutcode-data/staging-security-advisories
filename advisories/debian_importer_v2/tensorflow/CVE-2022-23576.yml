summary: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `OpLevelCostEstimator::CalculateOutputSize`
  is vulnerable to an integer overflow if an attacker can create an operation which would involve
  tensors with large enough number of elements. We can have a large enough number of dimensions
  in `output_shape.dim()` or just a small number of dimensions being large enough to cause an
  overflow in the multiplication. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also
  cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these
  are also affected and still in supported range.
