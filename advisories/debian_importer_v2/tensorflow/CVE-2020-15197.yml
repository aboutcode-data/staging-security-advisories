  - CVE-2020-15197
summary: In Tensorflow before version 2.3.1, the `SparseCountSparseOutput` implementation does
  not validate that the input arguments form a valid sparse tensor. In particular, there is
  no validation that the `indices` tensor has rank 2. This tensor must be a matrix because code
  assumes its elements are accessed as elements of a matrix. However, malicious users can pass
  in tensors of different rank, resulting in a `CHECK` assertion failure and a crash. This can
  be used to cause denial of service in serving installations, if users are allowed to control
  the components of the input sparse tensor. The issue is patched in commit 3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02
  and is released in TensorFlow version 2.3.1.
