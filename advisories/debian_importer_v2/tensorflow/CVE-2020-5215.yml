  - CVE-2020-5215
summary: In TensorFlow before 1.15.2 and 2.0.1, converting a string (from Python) to a tf.float16
  value results in a segmentation fault in eager mode as the format checks for this use case
  are only in the graph mode. This issue can lead to denial of service in inference/training
  where a malicious attacker can send a data point which contains a string instead of a tf.float16
  value. Similar effects can be obtained by manipulating saved models and checkpoints whereby
  replacing a scalar tf.float16 value with a scalar string will trigger this issue due to automatic
  conversions. This can be easily reproduced by tf.constant("hello", tf.float16), if eager execution
  is enabled. This issue is patched in TensorFlow 1.15.1 and 2.0.1 with this vulnerability patched.
  TensorFlow 2.1.0 was released after we fixed the issue, thus it is not affected. Users are
  encouraged to switch to TensorFlow 1.15.1, 2.0.1 or 2.1.0.
