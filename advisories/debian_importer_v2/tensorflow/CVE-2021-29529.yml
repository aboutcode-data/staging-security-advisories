summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker
  can trigger a heap buffer overflow in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedResizeBilinear` by manipulating
  input values so that float rounding results in off-by-one error in accessing image elements.
  This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/44b7f486c0143f68b56c34e2d01e146ee445134a/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_resize_bilinear_op.cc#L62-L66)
  computes two integers (representing the upper and lower bounds for interpolation) by ceiling
  and flooring a floating point value. For some values of `in`, `interpolation->upper[i]` might
  be smaller than `interpolation->lower[i]`. This is an issue if `interpolation->upper[i]` is
  capped at `in_size-1` as it means that `interpolation->lower[i]` points outside of the image.
  Then, in the interpolation code(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/44b7f486c0143f68b56c34e2d01e146ee445134a/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_resize_bilinear_op.cc#L245-L264),
  this would result in heap buffer overflow. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We
  will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and
  TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
