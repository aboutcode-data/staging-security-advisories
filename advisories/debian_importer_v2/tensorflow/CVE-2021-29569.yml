summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The implementation
  of `tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGradWithArgmax` can cause reads outside of bounds of heap allocated
  data if attacker supplies specially crafted inputs. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/ac328eaa3870491ababc147822cd04e91a790643/tensorflow/core/kernels/requantization_range_op.cc#L49-L50)
  assumes that the `input_min` and `input_max` tensors have at least one element, as it accesses
  the first element in two arrays. If the tensors are empty, `.flat<T>()` is an empty object,
  backed by an empty array. Hence, accesing even the 0th element is a read outside the bounds.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range.
