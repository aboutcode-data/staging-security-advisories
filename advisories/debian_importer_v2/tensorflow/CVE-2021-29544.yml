summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker
  can trigger a denial of service via a `CHECK`-fail in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad`.
  This is because the implementation does not validate the rank of the `input_*` tensors. In
  turn, this results in the tensors being passes as they are to `QuantizeAndDequantizePerChannelGradientImpl`.
  However, the `vec<T>` method, requires the rank to 1 and triggers a `CHECK` failure otherwise.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  2.4.2 as this is the only other affected version.
