  - CVE-2022-35989
summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. When `MaxPool` receives
  a window size input array `ksize` with dimensions greater than its input tensor `input`, the
  GPU kernel gives a `CHECK` fail that can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. We
  have patched the issue in GitHub commit 32d7bd3defd134f21a4e344c8dfd40099aaf6b18. The fix
  will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1,
  TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported
  range. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
