  - CVE-2020-15210
summary: In tensorflow-lite before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, if a TFLite
  saved model uses the same tensor as both input and output of an operator, then, depending
  on the operator, we can observe a segmentation fault or just memory corruption. We have patched
  the issue in d58c96946b and will release patch releases for all versions between 1.15 and
  2.3. We recommend users to upgrade to TensorFlow 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.
