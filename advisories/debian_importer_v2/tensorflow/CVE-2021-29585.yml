  - CVE-2021-29585
summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The TFLite computation
  for size of output after padding, `ComputeOutSize`(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0c9692ae7b1671c983569e5d3de5565843d500cf/tensorflow/lite/kernels/padding.h#L43-L55),
  does not check that the `stride` argument is not 0 before doing the division. Users can craft
  special models such that `ComputeOutSize` is called with `stride` set to 0. The fix will be
  included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow
  2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported
  range.
