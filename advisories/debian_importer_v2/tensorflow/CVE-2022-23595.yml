summary: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. When building an XLA compilation
  cache, if default settings are used, TensorFlow triggers a null pointer dereference. In the
  default scenario, all devices are allowed, so `flr->config_proto` is `nullptr`. The fix will
  be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1,
  TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported
  range.
