summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The implementations
  of the `Minimum` and `Maximum` TFLite operators can be used to read data outside of bounds
  of heap allocated objects, if any of the two input tensor arguments are empty. This is because
  the broadcasting implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0d45ea1ca641b21b73bcf9c00e0179cda284e7e7/tensorflow/lite/kernels/internal/reference/maximum_minimum.h#L52-L56)
  indexes in both tensors with the same index but does not validate that the index is within
  bounds. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are
  also affected and still in supported range.
