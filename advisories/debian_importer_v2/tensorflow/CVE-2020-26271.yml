  - CVE-2020-26271
summary: In affected versions of TensorFlow under certain cases, loading a saved model can result
  in accessing uninitialized memory while building the computation graph. The MakeEdge function
  creates an edge between one output tensor of the src node (given by output_index) and the
  input slot of the dst node (given by input_index). This is only possible if the types of the
  tensors on both sides coincide, so the function begins by obtaining the corresponding DataType
  values and comparing these for equality. However, there is no check that the indices point
  to inside of the arrays they index into. Thus, this can result in accessing data out of bounds
  of the corresponding heap allocated arrays. In most scenarios, this can manifest as unitialized
  data access, but if the index points far away from the boundaries of the arrays this can be
  used to leak addresses from the library. This is fixed in versions 1.15.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3, 2.2.2,
  2.3.2, and 2.4.0.
