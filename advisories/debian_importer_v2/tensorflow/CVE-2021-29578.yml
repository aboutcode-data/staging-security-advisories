  - CVE-2021-29578
summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The implementation
  of `tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPoolGrad` is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/dcba796a28364d6d7f003f6fe733d82726dda713/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_avg_pool_op.cc#L216)
  fails to validate that the pooling sequence arguments have enough elements as required by
  the `out_backprop` tensor shape. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also
  cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
  2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
