summary: 'gssproxy (aka gss-proxy) before 0.8.3 does not unlock cond_mutex before pthread exit
  in gp_worker_main() in gp_workers.c. NOTE: An upstream comment states "We are already on a
  shutdown path when running the code in question, so a DoS there doesn''t make any sense, and
  there has been no additional information provided us (as upstream) to indicate why this would
  be a problem.'
