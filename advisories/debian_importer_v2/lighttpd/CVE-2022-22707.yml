  - CVE-2022-22707
summary: In lighttpd 1.4.46 through 1.4.63, the mod_extforward_Forwarded function of the mod_extforward
  plugin has a stack-based buffer overflow (4 bytes representing -1), as demonstrated by remote
  denial of service (daemon crash) in a non-default configuration. The non-default configuration
  requires handling of the Forwarded header in a somewhat unusual manner. Also, a 32-bit system
  is much more likely to be affected than a 64-bit system.
