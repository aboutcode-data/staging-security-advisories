aliases:
  - CVE-2024-5458
summary: In PHP versions 8.1.* before 8.1.29, 8.2.* before 8.2.20, 8.3.* before 8.3.8, due to
  a code logic error, filtering functions such as filter_var when validating URLs (FILTER_VALIDATE_URL)
  for certain types of URLs the function will result in invalid user information (username +
  password part of URLs) being treated as valid user information. This may lead to the downstream
  code accepting invalid URLs as valid and parsing them incorrectly.
