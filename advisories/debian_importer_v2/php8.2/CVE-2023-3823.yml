  - CVE-2023-3823
summary: In PHP versions 8.0.* before 8.0.30, 8.1.* before 8.1.22, and 8.2.* before 8.2.8 various
  XML functions rely on libxml global state to track configuration variables, like whether external
  entities are loaded. This state is assumed to be unchanged unless the user explicitly changes
  it by calling appropriate function. However, since the state is process-global, other modules
  - such as ImageMagick - may also use this library within the same process, and change that
  global state for their internal purposes, and leave it in a state where external entities
  loading is enabled. This can lead to the situation where external XML is parsed with external
  entities loaded, which can lead to disclosure of any local files accessible to PHP. This vulnerable
  state may persist in the same process across many requests, until the process is shut down.
