aliases:
  - CVE-2025-1220
summary: In PHP versions:8.1.* before 8.1.33, 8.2.* before 8.2.29, 8.3.* before 8.3.23, 8.4.*
  before 8.4.10 some functions like fsockopen() lack validation that the hostname supplied does
  not contain null characters. This may lead to other functions like parse_url() treat the hostname
  in different way, thus opening way to security problems if the user code implements access
  checks before access using such functions.
