  - CVE-2025-52565
summary: runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification.
  Versions 1.0.0-rc3 through 1.2.7, 1.3.0-rc.1 through 1.3.2, and 1.4.0-rc.1 through 1.4.0-rc.2,
  due to insufficient checks when bind-mounting `/dev/pts/$n` to `/dev/console` inside the container,
  an attacker can trick runc into bind-mounting paths which would normally be made read-only
  or be masked onto a path that the attacker can write to. This attack is very similar in concept
  and application to CVE-2025-31133, except that it attacks a similar vulnerability in a different
  target (namely, the bind-mount of `/dev/pts/$n` to `/dev/console` as configured for all containers
  that allocate a console). This happens after `pivot_root(2)`, so this cannot be used to write
  to host files directly -- however, as with CVE-2025-31133, this can load to denial of service
  of the host or a container breakout by providing the attacker with a writable copy of `/proc/sysrq-trigger`
  or `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` (respectively). This issue is fixed in versions 1.2.8,
  1.3.3 and 1.4.0-rc.3.
