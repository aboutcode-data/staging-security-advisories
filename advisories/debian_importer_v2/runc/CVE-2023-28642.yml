summary: 'runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification.
  It was found that AppArmor can be bypassed when `/proc` inside the container is symlinked
  with a specific mount configuration. This issue has been fixed in runc version 1.1.5, by prohibiting
  symlinked `/proc`. See PR #3785 for details. users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to
  upgrade should avoid using an untrusted container image.'
