  - CVE-2024-21626
summary: runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI
  specification. In runc 1.1.11 and earlier, due to an internal file descriptor leak, an attacker
  could cause a newly-spawned container process (from runc exec) to have a working directory
  in the host filesystem namespace, allowing for a container escape by giving access to the
  host filesystem ("attack 2"). The same attack could be used by a malicious image to allow
  a container process to gain access to the host filesystem through runc run ("attack 1"). Variants
  of attacks 1 and 2 could be also be used to overwrite semi-arbitrary host binaries, allowing
  for complete container escapes ("attack 3a" and "attack 3b"). runc 1.1.12 includes patches
  for this issue.
