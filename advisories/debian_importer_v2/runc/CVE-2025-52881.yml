summary: runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification.
  In versions 1.2.7, 1.3.2 and 1.4.0-rc.2, an attacker can trick runc into misdirecting writes
  to /proc to other procfs files through the use of a racing container with shared mounts (we
  have also verified this attack is possible to exploit using a standard Dockerfile with docker
  buildx build as that also permits triggering parallel execution of containers with custom
  shared mounts configured). This redirect could be through symbolic links in a tmpfs or theoretically
  other methods such as regular bind-mounts. While similar, the mitigation applied for the related
  CVE, CVE-2019-19921, was fairly limited and effectively only caused runc to verify that when
  LSM labels are written they are actually procfs files. This issue is fixed in versions 1.2.8,
  1.3.3, and 1.4.0-rc.3.
