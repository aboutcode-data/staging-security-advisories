  - CVE-2021-43784
summary: runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI
  specification. In runc, netlink is used internally as a serialization system for specifying
  the relevant container configuration to the `C` portion of the code (responsible for the based
  namespace setup of containers). In all versions of runc prior to 1.0.3, the encoder did not
  handle the possibility of an integer overflow in the 16-bit length field for the byte array
  attribute type, meaning that a large enough malicious byte array attribute could result in
  the length overflowing and the attribute contents being parsed as netlink messages for container
  configuration. This vulnerability requires the attacker to have some control over the configuration
  of the container and would allow the attacker to bypass the namespace restrictions of the
  container by simply adding their own netlink payload which disables all namespaces. The main
  users impacted are those who allow untrusted images with untrusted configurations to run on
  their machines (such as with shared cloud infrastructure). runc version 1.0.3 contains a fix
  for this bug. As a workaround, one may try disallowing untrusted namespace paths from your
  container. It should be noted that untrusted namespace paths would allow the attacker to disable
  namespace protections entirely even in the absence of this bug.
