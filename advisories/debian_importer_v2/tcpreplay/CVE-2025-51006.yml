aliases:
  - CVE-2025-51006
summary: Within tcpreplay's tcprewrite, a double free vulnerability has been identified in the
  dlt_linuxsll2_cleanup() function in plugins/dlt_linuxsll2/linuxsll2.c. This vulnerability
  is triggered when tcpedit_dlt_cleanup() indirectly invokes the cleanup routine multiple times
  on the same memory region. By supplying a specifically crafted pcap file to the tcprewrite
  binary, a local attacker can exploit this flaw to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via memory
  corruption.
