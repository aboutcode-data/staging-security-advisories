summary: 'Apache Commons Configuration performs variable interpolation, allowing properties
  to be dynamically evaluated and expanded. The standard format for interpolation is "${prefix:name}",
  where "prefix" is used to locate an instance of org.apache.commons.configuration2.interpol.Lookup
  that performs the interpolation. Starting with version 2.4 and continuing through 2.7, the
  set of default Lookup instances included interpolators that could result in arbitrary code
  execution or contact with remote servers. These lookups are: - "script" - execute expressions
  using the JVM script execution engine (javax.script) - "dns" - resolve dns records - "url"
  - load values from urls, including from remote servers Applications using the interpolation
  defaults in the affected versions may be vulnerable to remote code execution or unintentional
  contact with remote servers if untrusted configuration values are used. Users are recommended
  to upgrade to Apache Commons Configuration 2.8.0, which disables the problematic interpolators
  by default.'
