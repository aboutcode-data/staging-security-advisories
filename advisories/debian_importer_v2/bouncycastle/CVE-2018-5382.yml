aliases:
  - CVE-2018-5382
summary: The default BKS keystore use an HMAC that is only 16 bits long, which can allow an
  attacker to compromise the integrity of a BKS keystore. Bouncy Castle release 1.47 changes
  the BKS format to a format which uses a 160 bit HMAC instead. This applies to any BKS keystore
  generated prior to BC 1.47. For situations where people need to create the files for legacy
  reasons a specific keystore type "BKS-V1" was introduced in 1.49. It should be noted that
  the use of "BKS-V1" is discouraged by the library authors and should only be used where it
  is otherwise safe to do so, as in where the use of a 16 bit checksum for the file integrity
  check is not going to cause a security issue in itself.
