  - CVE-2013-0169
summary: The TLS protocol 1.1 and 1.2 and the DTLS protocol 1.0 and 1.2, as used in OpenSSL,
  OpenJDK, PolarSSL, and other products, do not properly consider timing side-channel attacks
  on a MAC check requirement during the processing of malformed CBC padding, which allows remote
  attackers to conduct distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery attacks via statistical
  analysis of timing data for crafted packets, aka the "Lucky Thirteen" issue.
