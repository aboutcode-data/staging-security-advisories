aliases:
  - CVE-2024-34447
summary: An issue was discovered in the Bouncy Castle Crypto Package For Java before BC TLS
  Java 1.0.19 (ships with BC Java 1.78, BC Java (LTS) 2.73.6) and before BC FIPS TLS Java 1.0.19.
  When endpoint identification is enabled in the BCJSSE and an SSL socket is created without
  an explicit hostname (as happens with HttpsURLConnection), hostname verification could be
  performed against a DNS-resolved IP address in some situations, opening up a possibility of
  DNS poisoning.
