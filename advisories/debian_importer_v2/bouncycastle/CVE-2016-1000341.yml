  - CVE-2016-1000341
summary: In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider version 1.55 and earlier DSA signature generation
  is vulnerable to timing attack. Where timings can be closely observed for the generation of
  signatures, the lack of blinding in 1.55, or earlier, may allow an attacker to gain information
  about the signature's k value and ultimately the private value as well.
