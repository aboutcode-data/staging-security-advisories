aliases:
  - CVE-2013-1624
summary: The TLS implementation in the Bouncy Castle Java library before 1.48 and C# library
  before 1.8 does not properly consider timing side-channel attacks on a noncompliant MAC check
  operation during the processing of malformed CBC padding, which allows remote attackers to
  conduct distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery attacks via statistical analysis of
  timing data for crafted packets, a related issue to CVE-2013-0169.
