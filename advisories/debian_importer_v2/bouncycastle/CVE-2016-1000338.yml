  - CVE-2016-1000338
summary: In Bouncy Castle JCE Provider version 1.55 and earlier the DSA does not fully validate
  ASN.1 encoding of signature on verification. It is possible to inject extra elements in the
  sequence making up the signature and still have it validate, which in some cases may allow
  the introduction of 'invisible' data into a signed structure.
