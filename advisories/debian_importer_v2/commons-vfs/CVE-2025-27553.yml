  - CVE-2025-27553
summary: 'Relative Path Traversal vulnerability in Apache Commons VFS before 2.10.0.  The FileObject
  API in Commons VFS has a ''resolveFile'' method that takes a ''scope'' parameter. Specifying
  ''NameScope.DESCENDENT'' promises that "an exception is thrown if the resolved file is not
  a descendent of the base file". However, when the path contains encoded ".." characters (for
  example, "%2E%2E/bar.txt"), it might return file objects that are not a descendent of the
  base file, without throwing an exception. This issue affects Apache Commons VFS: before 2.10.0.  Users
  are recommended to upgrade to version 2.10.0, which fixes the issue.'
