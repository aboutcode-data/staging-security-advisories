  - CVE-2024-6873
summary: It is possible to crash or redirect the execution flow of the ClickHouse server process
  from an unauthenticated vector by sending a specially crafted request to the ClickHouse server
  native interface. This redirection is limited to what is available within a 256-byte range
  of memory at the time of execution, and no known remote code execution (RCE) code has been
  produced or exploited.   Fixes have been merged to all currently supported version of ClickHouse. If
  you are maintaining your own forked version of ClickHouse or using an older version and cannot
  upgrade, the fix for this vulnerability can be found in this commit  https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64024
