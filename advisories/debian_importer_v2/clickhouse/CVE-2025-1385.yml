aliases:
  - CVE-2025-1385
summary: 'When the library bridge feature is enabled, the clickhouse-library-bridge exposes
  an HTTP API on localhost. This allows clickhouse-server to dynamically load a library from
  a specified path and execute it in an isolated process. Combined with the ClickHouse table
  engine functionality that permits file uploads to specific directories, a misconfigured server
  can be exploited by an attacker with privilege to access to both table engines to execute
  arbitrary code on the ClickHouse server.  You can check if your ClickHouse server is vulnerable
  to this vulnerability by inspecting the configuration file and confirming if the following
  setting is enabled:  <library_bridge>    <port>9019</port> </library_bridge>'
