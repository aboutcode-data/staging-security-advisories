summary: A flaw was found in Openstack manilla owning a Ceph File system "share", which enables
  the owner to read/write any manilla share or entire file system. The vulnerability is due
  to a bug in the "volumes" plugin in Ceph Manager. This allows an attacker to compromise Confidentiality
  and Integrity of a file system. Fixed in RHCS 5.2 and Ceph 17.2.2.
