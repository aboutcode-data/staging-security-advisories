  - CVE-2020-27781
summary: User credentials can be manipulated and stolen by Native CephFS consumers of OpenStack
  Manila, resulting in potential privilege escalation. An Open Stack Manila user can request
  access to a share to an arbitrary cephx user, including existing users. The access key is
  retrieved via the interface drivers. Then, all users of the requesting OpenStack project can
  view the access key. This enables the attacker to target any resource that the user has access
  to. This can be done to even "admin" users, compromising the ceph administrator. This flaw
  affects Ceph versions prior to 14.2.16, 15.x prior to 15.2.8, and 16.x prior to 16.2.0.
