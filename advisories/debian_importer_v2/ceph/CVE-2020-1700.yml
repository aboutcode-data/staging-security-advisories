aliases:
  - CVE-2020-1700
summary: A flaw was found in the way the Ceph RGW Beast front-end handles unexpected disconnects.
  An authenticated attacker can abuse this flaw by making multiple disconnect attempts resulting
  in a permanent leak of a socket connection by radosgw. This flaw could lead to a denial of
  service condition by pile up of CLOSE_WAIT sockets, eventually leading to the exhaustion of
  available resources, preventing legitimate users from connecting to the system.
