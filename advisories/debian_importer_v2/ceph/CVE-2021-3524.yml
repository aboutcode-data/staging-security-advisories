aliases:
  - CVE-2021-3524
summary: A flaw was found in the Red Hat Ceph Storage RadosGW (Ceph Object Gateway) in versions
  before 14.2.21. The vulnerability is related to the injection of HTTP headers via a CORS ExposeHeader
  tag. The newline character in the ExposeHeader tag in the CORS configuration file generates
  a header injection in the response when the CORS request is made. In addition, the prior bug
  fix for CVE-2020-10753 did not account for the use of \r as a header separator, thus a new
  flaw has been created.
