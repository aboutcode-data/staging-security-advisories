aliases:
  - CVE-2020-25660
summary: A flaw was found in the Cephx authentication protocol in versions before 15.2.6 and
  before 14.2.14, where it does not verify Ceph clients correctly and is then vulnerable to
  replay attacks in Nautilus. This flaw allows an attacker with access to the Ceph cluster network
  to authenticate with the Ceph service via a packet sniffer and perform actions allowed by
  the Ceph service. This issue is a reintroduction of CVE-2018-1128, affecting the msgr2 protocol.
  The msgr 2 protocol is used for all communication except older clients that do not support
  the msgr2 protocol. The msgr1 protocol is not affected. The highest threat from this vulnerability
  is to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability.
