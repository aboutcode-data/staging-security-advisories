  - CVE-2021-3979
summary: A key length flaw was found in Red Hat Ceph Storage. An attacker can exploit the fact
  that the key length is incorrectly passed in an encryption algorithm to create a non random
  key, which is weaker and can be exploited for loss of confidentiality and integrity on encrypted
  disks.
