aliases:
  - CVE-2021-20288
summary: An authentication flaw was found in ceph in versions before 14.2.20. When the monitor
  handles CEPHX_GET_AUTH_SESSION_KEY requests, it doesn't sanitize other_keys, allowing key
  reuse. An attacker who can request a global_id can exploit the ability of any user to request
  a global_id previously associated with another user, as ceph does not force the reuse of old
  keys to generate new ones. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality
  and integrity as well as system availability.
