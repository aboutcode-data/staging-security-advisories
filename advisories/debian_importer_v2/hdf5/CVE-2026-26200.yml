  - CVE-2026-26200
summary: HDF5 is software for managing data. Prior to version 1.14.4-2, an attacker who can
  control an `h5` file parsed by HDF5 can trigger a write-based heap buffer overflow condition.
  This can lead to a denial-of-service condition, and potentially further issues such as remote
  code execution depending on the practical exploitability of the heap overflow against modern
  operating systems. Real-world exploitability of this issue in terms of remote-code execution
  is currently unknown. Version 1.14.4-2 fixes the issue.
