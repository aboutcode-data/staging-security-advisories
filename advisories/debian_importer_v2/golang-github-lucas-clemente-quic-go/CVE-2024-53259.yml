  - CVE-2024-53259
summary: quic-go is an implementation of the QUIC protocol in Go. An off-path attacker can inject
  an ICMP Packet Too Large packet. Since affected quic-go versions used IP_PMTUDISC_DO, the
  kernel would then return a "message too large" error on sendmsg, i.e. when quic-go attempts
  to send a packet that exceeds the MTU claimed in that ICMP packet. By setting this value to
  smaller than 1200 bytes (the minimum MTU for QUIC), the attacker can disrupt a QUIC connection.
  Crucially, this can be done after completion of the handshake, thereby circumventing any TCP
  fallback that might be implemented on the application layer (for example, many browsers fall
  back to HTTP over TCP if they're unable to establish a QUIC connection). The attacker needs
  to at least know the client's IP and port tuple to mount an attack. This vulnerability is
  fixed in 0.48.2.
