summary: 'quic-go through 0.27.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption)
  via a Slowloris variant in which incomplete QUIC or HTTP/3 requests are sent. This occurs
  because mtu_discoverer.go misparses the MTU Discovery service and consequently overflows the
  probe timer. NOTE: the vendor''s position is that this behavior should not be listed as a
  vulnerability on the CVE List'
