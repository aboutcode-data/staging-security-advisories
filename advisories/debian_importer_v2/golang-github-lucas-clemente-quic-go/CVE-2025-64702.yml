  - CVE-2025-64702
summary: quic-go is an implementation of the QUIC protocol in Go. Versions 0.56.0 and below
  are vulnerable to excessive memory allocation through quic-go's HTTP/3 client and server implementations
  by sending a QPACK-encoded HEADERS frame that decodes into a large header field section (many
  unique header names and/or large values). The implementation builds an http.Header (used on
  the http.Request and http.Response, respectively), while only enforcing limits on the size
  of the (QPACK-compressed) HEADERS frame, but not on the decoded header, leading to memory
  exhaustion. This issue is fixed in version 0.57.0.
