  - CVE-2024-52522
summary: Rclone is a command-line program to sync files and directories to and from different
  cloud storage providers. Insecure handling of symlinks with --links and --metadata in rclone
  while copying to local disk allows unprivileged users to indirectly modify ownership and permissions
  on symlink target files when a superuser or privileged process performs a copy. This vulnerability
  could enable privilege escalation and unauthorized access to critical system files, compromising
  system integrity, confidentiality, and availability. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.68.2.
