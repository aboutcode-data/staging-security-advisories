  - CVE-2020-28924
summary: 'An issue was discovered in Rclone before 1.53.3. Due to the use of a weak random number
  generator, the password generator has been producing weak passwords with much less entropy
  than advertised. The suggested passwords depend deterministically on the time the second rclone
  was started. This limits the entropy of the passwords enormously. These passwords are often
  used in the crypt backend for encryption of data. It would be possible to make a dictionary
  of all possible passwords with about 38 million entries per password length. This would make
  decryption of secret material possible with a plausible amount of effort. NOTE: all passwords
  generated by affected versions should be changed.'
