summary: The rfbProcessClientNormalMessage function in libvncserver/rfbserver.c in LibVNCServer
  0.9.9 and earlier does not properly handle attempts to send a large amount of ClientCutText
  data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption or daemon
  crash) via a crafted message that is processed by using a single unchecked malloc.
