aliases:
  - CVE-2025-66564
summary: Sigstore Timestamp Authority is a service for issuing RFC 3161 timestamps. Prior to
  2.0.3, Function api.ParseJSONRequest currently splits (via a call to strings.Split) an optionally-provided
  OID (which is untrusted data) on periods. Similarly, function api.getContentType splits the
  Content-Type header (which is also untrusted data) on an application string. As a result,
  in the face of a malicious request with either an excessively long OID in the payload containing
  many period characters or a malformed Content-Type header, a call to api.ParseJSONRequest
  or api.getContentType incurs allocations of O(n) bytes (where n stands for the length of the
  function's argument). This vulnerability is fixed in 2.0.3.
