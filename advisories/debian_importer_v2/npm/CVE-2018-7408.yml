  - CVE-2018-7408
summary: 'An issue was discovered in an npm 5.7.0 2018-02-21 pre-release (marked as "next: 5.7.0"
  and therefore automatically installed by an "npm upgrade -g npm" command, and also announced
  in the vendor''s blog without mention of pre-release status). It might allow local users to
  bypass intended filesystem access restrictions because ownerships of /etc and /usr directories
  are being changed unexpectedly, related to a "correctMkdir" issue.'
