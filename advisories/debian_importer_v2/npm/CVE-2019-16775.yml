  - CVE-2019-16775
summary: Versions of the npm CLI prior to 6.13.3 are vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Write.
  It is possible for packages to create symlinks to files outside of thenode_modules folder
  through the bin field upon installation. A properly constructed entry in the package.json
  bin field would allow a package publisher to create a symlink pointing to arbitrary files
  on a user's system when the package is installed. This behavior is still possible through
  install scripts. This vulnerability bypasses a user using the --ignore-scripts install option.
