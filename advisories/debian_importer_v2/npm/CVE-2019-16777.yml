  - CVE-2019-16777
summary: Versions of the npm CLI prior to 6.13.4 are vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Overwrite.
  It fails to prevent existing globally-installed binaries to be overwritten by other package
  installations. For example, if a package was installed globally and created a serve binary,
  any subsequent installs of packages that also create a serve binary would overwrite the previous
  serve binary. This behavior is still allowed in local installations and also through install
  scripts. This vulnerability bypasses a user using the --ignore-scripts install option.
