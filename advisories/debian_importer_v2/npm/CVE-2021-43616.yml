  - CVE-2021-43616
summary: 'The npm ci command in npm 7.x and 8.x through 8.1.3 proceeds with an installation
  even if dependency information in package-lock.json differs from package.json. This behavior
  is inconsistent with the documentation, and makes it easier for attackers to install malware
  that was supposed to have been blocked by an exact version match requirement in package-lock.json.
  NOTE: The npm team believes this is not a vulnerability. It would require someone to socially
  engineer package.json which has different dependencies than package-lock.json. That user would
  have to have file system or write access to change dependencies. The npm team states preventing
  malicious actors from socially engineering or gaining file system access is outside the scope
  of the npm CLI.'
