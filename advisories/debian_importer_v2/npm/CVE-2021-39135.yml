  - CVE-2021-39135
summary: '`@npmcli/arborist`, the library that calculates dependency trees and manages the node_modules
  folder hierarchy for the npm command line interface, aims to guarantee that package dependency
  contracts will be met, and the extraction of package contents will always be performed into
  the expected folder. This is accomplished by extracting package contents into a project''s
  `node_modules` folder. If the `node_modules` folder of the root project or any of its dependencies
  is somehow replaced with a symbolic link, it could allow Arborist to write package dependencies
  to any arbitrary location on the file system. Note that symbolic links contained within package
  artifact contents are filtered out, so another means of creating a `node_modules` symbolic
  link would have to be employed. 1. A `preinstall` script could replace `node_modules` with
  a symlink. (This is prevented by using `--ignore-scripts`.) 2. An attacker could supply the
  target with a git repository, instructing them to run `npm install --ignore-scripts` in the
  root. This may be successful, because `npm install --ignore-scripts` is typically not capable
  of making changes outside of the project directory, so it may be deemed safe. This is patched
  in @npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above. For more information
  including workarounds please see the referenced GHSA-gmw6-94gg-2rc2.'
