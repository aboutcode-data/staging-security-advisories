  - CVE-2021-4024
summary: A flaw was found in podman. The `podman machine` function (used to create and manage
  Podman virtual machine containing a Podman process) spawns a `gvproxy` process on the host
  system. The `gvproxy` API is accessible on port 7777 on all IP addresses on the host. If that
  port is open on the host's firewall, an attacker can potentially use the `gvproxy` API to
  forward ports on the host to ports in the VM, making private services on the VM accessible
  to the network. This issue could be also used to interrupt the host's services by forwarding
  all ports to the VM.
