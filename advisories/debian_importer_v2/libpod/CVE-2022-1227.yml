  - CVE-2022-1227
summary: A privilege escalation flaw was found in Podman. This flaw allows an attacker to publish
  a malicious image to a public registry. Once this image is downloaded by a potential victim,
  the vulnerability is triggered after a user runs the 'podman top' command. This action gives
  the attacker access to the host filesystem, leading to information disclosure or denial of
  service.
