  - CVE-2019-18466
summary: An issue was discovered in Podman in libpod before 1.6.0. It resolves a symlink in
  the host context during a copy operation from the container to the host, because an undesired
  glob operation occurs. An attacker could create a container image containing particular symlinks
  that, when copied by a victim user to the host filesystem, may overwrite existing files with
  others from the host.
