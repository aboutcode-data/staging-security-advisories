  - CVE-2021-20188
summary: A flaw was found in podman before 1.7.0. File permissions for non-root users running
  in a privileged container are not correctly checked. This flaw can be abused by a low-privileged
  user inside the container to access any other file in the container, even if owned by the
  root user inside the container. It does not allow to directly escape the container, though
  being a privileged container means that a lot of security features are disabled when running
  the container. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity
  as well as system availability.
