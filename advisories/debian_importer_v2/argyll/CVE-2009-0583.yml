aliases:
  - CVE-2009-0583
summary: Multiple integer overflows in icc.c in the International Color Consortium (ICC) Format
  library (aka icclib), as used in Ghostscript 8.64 and earlier and Argyll Color Management
  System (CMS) 1.0.3 and earlier, allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service
  (heap-based buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code by using
  a device file for a translation request that operates on a crafted image file and targets
  a certain "native color space," related to an ICC profile in a (1) PostScript or (2) PDF file
  with embedded images.
