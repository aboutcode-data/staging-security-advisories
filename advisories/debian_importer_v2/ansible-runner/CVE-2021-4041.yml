aliases:
  - CVE-2021-4041
summary: A flaw was found in ansible-runner. An improper escaping of the shell command, while
  calling the ansible_runner.interface.run_command, can lead to parameters getting executed
  as host's shell command. A developer could unintentionally write code that gets executed in
  the host rather than the virtual environment.
