summary: A Remote Code Execution vulnerability has been found in the Horde_Image library when
  using the "Im" backend that utilizes ImageMagick's "convert" utility. It's not exploitable
  through any Horde application, because the code path to the vulnerability is not used by any
  Horde code. Custom applications using the Horde_Image library might be affected. This vulnerability
  affects all versions of Horde_Image from 2.0.0 to 2.5.1, and is fixed in 2.5.2. The problem
  is missing input validation of the index field in _raw() during construction of an ImageMagick
  command line.
