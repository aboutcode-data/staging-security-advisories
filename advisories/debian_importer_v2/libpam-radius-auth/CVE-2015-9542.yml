aliases:
  - CVE-2015-9542
summary: add_password in pam_radius_auth.c in pam_radius 1.4.0 does not correctly check the
  length of the input password, and is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow during memcpy().
  An attacker could send a crafted password to an application (loading the pam_radius library)
  and crash it. Arbitrary code execution might be possible, depending on the application, C
  library, compiler, and other factors.
