  - CVE-2013-7299
summary: framework/common/messageheaderparser.cpp in Tntnet before 2.2.1 allows remote attackers
  to obtain sensitive information via a header that ends in \n instead of \r\n, which prevents
  a null terminator from being added and causes Tntnet to include headers from other requests.
