  - CVE-2019-10732
summary: In KDE KMail 5.2.3, an attacker in possession of S/MIME or PGP encrypted emails can
  wrap them as sub-parts within a crafted multipart email. The encrypted part(s) can further
  be hidden using HTML/CSS or ASCII newline characters. This modified multipart email can be
  re-sent by the attacker to the intended receiver. If the receiver replies to this (benign
  looking) email, they unknowingly leak the plaintext of the encrypted message part(s) back
  to the attacker.
