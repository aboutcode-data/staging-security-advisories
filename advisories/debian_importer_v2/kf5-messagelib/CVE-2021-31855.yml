  - CVE-2021-31855
summary: KDE Messagelib through 5.17.0 reveals cleartext of encrypted messages in some situations.
  Deleting an attachment of a decrypted encrypted message stored on a remote server (e.g., an
  IMAP server) causes KMail to upload the decrypted content of the message to the remote server.
  With a crafted message, a user could be tricked into decrypting an encrypted message and then
  deleting an attachment attached to this message. If the attacker has access to the messages
  stored on the email server, then the attacker could read the decrypted content of the encrypted
  message. This occurs in ViewerPrivate::deleteAttachment in messageviewer/src/viewer/viewer_p.cpp.
