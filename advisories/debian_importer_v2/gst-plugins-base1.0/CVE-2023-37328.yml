summary: GStreamer PGS File Parsing Heap-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.
  This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations
  of GStreamer. Interaction with this library is required to exploit this vulnerability but
  attack vectors may vary depending on the implementation.  The specific flaw exists within
  the parsing of PGS subtitle files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of
  the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can
  leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. . Was ZDI-CAN-20994.
