  - CVE-2020-12402
summary: During RSA key generation, bignum implementations used a variation of the Binary Extended
  Euclidean Algorithm which entailed significantly input-dependent flow. This allowed an attacker
  able to perform electromagnetic-based side channel attacks to record traces leading to the
  recovery of the secret primes. *Note:* An unmodified Firefox browser does not generate RSA
  keys in normal operation and is not affected, but products built on top of it might. This
  vulnerability affects Firefox < 78.
