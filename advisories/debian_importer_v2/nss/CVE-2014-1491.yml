summary: Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) before 3.15.4, as used in Mozilla Firefox before
  27.0, Firefox ESR 24.x before 24.3, Thunderbird before 24.3, SeaMonkey before 2.24, and other
  products, does not properly restrict public values in Diffie-Hellman key exchanges, which
  makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass cryptographic protection mechanisms in ticket
  handling by leveraging use of a certain value.
