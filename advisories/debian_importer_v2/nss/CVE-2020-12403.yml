  - CVE-2020-12403
summary: A flaw was found in the way CHACHA20-POLY1305 was implemented in NSS in versions before
  3.55. When using multi-part Chacha20, it could cause out-of-bounds reads. This issue was fixed
  by explicitly disabling multi-part ChaCha20 (which was not functioning correctly) and strictly
  enforcing tag length. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and
  system availability.
