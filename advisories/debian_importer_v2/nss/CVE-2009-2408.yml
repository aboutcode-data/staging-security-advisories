summary: 'Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) before 3.12.3, Firefox before 3.0.13, Thunderbird
  before 2.0.0.23, and SeaMonkey before 1.1.18 do not properly handle a ''\0'' character in
  a domain name in the subject''s Common Name (CN) field of an X.509 certificate, which allows
  man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued
  by a legitimate Certification Authority. NOTE: this was originally reported for Firefox before
  3.5.'
