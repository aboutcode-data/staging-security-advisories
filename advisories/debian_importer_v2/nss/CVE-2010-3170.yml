summary: Mozilla Firefox before 3.5.14 and 3.6.x before 3.6.11, Thunderbird before 3.0.9 and
  3.1.x before 3.1.5, and SeaMonkey before 2.0.9 recognize a wildcard IP address in the subject's
  Common Name field of an X.509 certificate, which might allow man-in-the-middle attackers to
  spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification
  Authority.
