summary: Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) before 3.20.2, as used in Mozilla Firefox before
  43.0.2 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.5.2, does not reject MD5 signatures in Server Key Exchange
  messages in TLS 1.2 Handshake Protocol traffic, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle
  attackers to spoof servers by triggering a collision.
