summary: PAM-PKCS#11 is a Linux-PAM login module that allows a X.509 certificate based user
  login. Prior to version 0.6.13, if cert_policy is set to none (the default value), then pam_pkcs11
  will only check if the user is capable of logging into the token. An attacker may create a
  different token with the user's public data (e.g. the user's certificate) and a PIN known
  to the attacker. If no signature with the private key is required, then the attacker may now
  login as user with that created token. The default to *not* check the private key's signature
  has been changed with commit commi6638576892b59a99389043c90a1e7dd4d783b921, so that all versions
  starting with pam_pkcs11-0.6.0 should be affected. As a workaround, in `pam_pkcs11.conf`,
  set at least `cert_policy = signature;`.
