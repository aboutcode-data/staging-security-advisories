  - CVE-2018-10852
summary: The UNIX pipe which sudo uses to contact SSSD and read the available sudo rules from
  SSSD has too wide permissions, which means that anyone who can send a message using the same
  raw protocol that sudo and SSSD use can read the sudo rules available for any user. This affects
  versions of SSSD before 1.16.3.
