aliases:
  - CVE-2010-0014
summary: System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) before 1.0.1, when the krb5 auth_provider is
  configured but the KDC is unreachable, allows physically proximate attackers to authenticate,
  via an arbitrary password, to the screen-locking program on a workstation that has any user's
  Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT); and might allow remote attackers to bypass intended
  access restrictions via vectors involving an arbitrary password in conjunction with a valid
  TGT.
