summary: A vulnerability was found in sssd. If a user was configured with no home directory
  set, sssd would return '/' (the root directory) instead of '' (the empty string / no home
  directory). This could impact services that restrict the user's filesystem access to within
  their home directory through chroot() etc. All versions before 2.1 are vulnerable.
