aliases:
  - CVE-2026-1285
summary: An issue was discovered in 6.0 before 6.0.2, 5.2 before 5.2.11, and 4.2 before 4.2.28.
  `django.utils.text.Truncator.chars()` and `Truncator.words()` methods (with `html=True`) and
  the `truncatechars_html` and `truncatewords_html` template filters allow a remote attacker
  to cause a potential denial-of-service via crafted inputs containing a large number of unmatched
  HTML end tags. Earlier, unsupported Django series (such as 5.0.x, 4.1.x, and 3.2.x) were not
  evaluated and may also be affected. Django would like to thank Seokchan Yoon for reporting
  this issue.
