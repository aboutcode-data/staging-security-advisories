  - CVE-2018-7537
summary: An issue was discovered in Django 2.0 before 2.0.3, 1.11 before 1.11.11, and 1.8 before
  1.8.19. If django.utils.text.Truncator's chars() and words() methods were passed the html=True
  argument, they were extremely slow to evaluate certain inputs due to a catastrophic backtracking
  vulnerability in a regular expression. The chars() and words() methods are used to implement
  the truncatechars_html and truncatewords_html template filters, which were thus vulnerable.
