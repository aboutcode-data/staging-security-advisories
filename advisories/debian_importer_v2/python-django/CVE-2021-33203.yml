  - CVE-2021-33203
summary: Django before 2.2.24, 3.x before 3.1.12, and 3.2.x before 3.2.4 has a potential directory
  traversal via django.contrib.admindocs. Staff members could use the TemplateDetailView view
  to check the existence of arbitrary files. Additionally, if (and only if) the default admindocs
  templates have been customized by application developers to also show file contents, then
  not only the existence but also the file contents would have been exposed. In other words,
  there is directory traversal outside of the template root directories.
