  - CVE-2018-16984
summary: An issue was discovered in Django 2.1 before 2.1.2, in which unprivileged users can
  read the password hashes of arbitrary accounts. The read-only password widget used by the
  Django Admin to display an obfuscated password hash was bypassed if a user has only the "view"
  permission (new in Django 2.1), resulting in display of the entire password hash to those
  users. This may result in a vulnerability for sites with legacy user accounts using insecure
  hashes.
