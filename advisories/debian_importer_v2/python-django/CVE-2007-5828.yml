  - CVE-2007-5828
summary: 'Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the admin panel in Django 0.96
  allows remote attackers to change passwords of arbitrary users via a request to admin/auth/user/1/password/.  NOTE:
  this issue has been disputed by Debian, since product documentation includes a recommendation
  for a CSRF protection module that is included with the product.  However, CVE considers this
  an issue because the default configuration does not use this module'
