aliases:
  - CVE-2025-48964
summary: 'ping in iputils before 20250602 allows a denial of service (application error in adaptive
  ping mode or incorrect data collection) via a crafted ICMP Echo Reply packet, because a zero
  timestamp can lead to large intermediate values that have an integer overflow when squared
  during statistics calculations. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2025-47268
  (that fix was only about timestamp calculations, and it did not account for a specific scenario
  where the original timestamp in the ICMP payload is zero).'
