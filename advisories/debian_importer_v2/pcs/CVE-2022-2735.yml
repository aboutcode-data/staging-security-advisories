summary: A vulnerability was found in the PCS project. This issue occurs due to incorrect permissions
  on a Unix socket used for internal communication between PCS daemons. A privilege escalation
  could happen by obtaining an authentication token for a hacluster user. With the "hacluster"
  token, this flaw allows an attacker to have complete control over the cluster managed by PCS.
