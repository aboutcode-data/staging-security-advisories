  - CVE-2005-2377
summary: 'nss_ldap 181 to versions before 213, as used in Mandrake Corporate Server and Mandrake
  10.0, and other operating systems, does not properly handle a SIGPIPE signal when sending
  a search request to an LDAP directory server, which might allow remote attackers to cause
  a denial of service (crond and other application crash) if they can cause an LDAP server to
  become unavailable.  NOTE: it is not clear whether this attack scenario is sufficient to include
  this item in CVE.'
