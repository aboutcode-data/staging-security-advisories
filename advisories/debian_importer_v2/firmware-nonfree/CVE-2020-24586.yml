aliases:
  - CVE-2020-24586
summary: The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and
  Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that received fragments be cleared from memory
  after (re)connecting to a network. Under the right circumstances, when another device sends
  fragmented frames encrypted using WEP, CCMP, or GCMP, this can be abused to inject arbitrary
  network packets and/or exfiltrate user data.
