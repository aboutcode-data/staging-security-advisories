summary: 'Protection mechanism failure for some Intel(R) NPU Drivers within Ring 3: User Applications
  may allow a denial of service. Unprivileged software adversary with an authenticated user
  combined with a low complexity attack may enable denial of service. This result may potentially
  occur via local access when attack requirements are not present without special internal knowledge
  and requires no user interaction. The potential vulnerability may impact the confidentiality
  (none), integrity (none) and availability (high) of the vulnerable system, resulting in subsequent
  system confidentiality (none), integrity (none) and availability (none) impacts.'
