aliases:
  - CVE-2020-24588
summary: The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and
  Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header
  field is authenticated. Against devices that support receiving non-SSP A-MSDU frames (which
  is mandatory as part of 802.11n), an adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network
  packets.
