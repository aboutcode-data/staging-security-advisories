  - CVE-2011-3630
summary: Hardlink before 0.1.2 suffer from multiple stack-based buffer overflow flaws because
  of the way directory trees with deeply nested directories are processed. A remote attacker
  could provide a specially-crafted directory tree, and trick the local user into consolidating
  it, leading to hardlink executable crash, or, potentially arbitrary code execution with the
  privileges of the user running the hardlink executable.
