aliases:
  - CVE-2011-3631
summary: Hardlink before 0.1.2 has multiple integer overflows leading to heap-based buffer overflows
  because of the way string lengths concatenation is done in the calculation of the required
  memory space to be used. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted directory tree
  and trick the local user into consolidating it, leading to hardlink executable crash or potentially
  arbitrary code execution with user privileges.
