summary: Integer underflow in the unlzw function in unlzw.c in gzip before 1.4 on 64-bit platforms,
  as used in ncompress and probably others, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted archive that uses LZW
  compression, leading to an array index error.
