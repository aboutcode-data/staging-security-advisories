aliases:
  - CVE-2024-31079
summary: When NGINX Plus or NGINX OSS are configured to use the HTTP/3 QUIC module, undisclosed
  HTTP/3 requests can cause NGINX worker processes to terminate or cause other potential impact.
  This attack requires that a request be specifically timed during the connection draining process,
  which the attacker has no visibility and limited influence over.
