  - CVE-2012-4929
summary: The TLS protocol 1.2 and earlier, as used in Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Qt, and
  other products, can encrypt compressed data without properly obfuscating the length of the
  unencrypted data, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain plaintext HTTP headers
  by observing length differences during a series of guesses in which a string in an HTTP request
  potentially matches an unknown string in an HTTP header, aka a "CRIME" attack.
