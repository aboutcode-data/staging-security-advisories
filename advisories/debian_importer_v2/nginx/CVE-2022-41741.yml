aliases:
  - CVE-2022-41741
summary: NGINX Open Source before versions 1.23.2 and 1.22.1, NGINX Open Source Subscription
  before versions R2 P1 and R1 P1, and NGINX Plus before versions R27 P1 and R26 P1 have a vulnerability
  in the module ngx_http_mp4_module that might allow a local attacker to corrupt NGINX worker
  memory, resulting in its termination or potential other impact using a specially crafted audio
  or video file. The issue affects only NGINX products that are built with the ngx_http_mp4_module,
  when the mp4 directive is used in the configuration file. Further, the attack is possible
  only if an attacker can trigger processing of a specially crafted audio or video file with
  the module ngx_http_mp4_module.
