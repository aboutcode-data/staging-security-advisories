  - CVE-2025-53859
summary: 'NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus have a vulnerability in the ngx_mail_smtp_module
  that might allow an unauthenticated attacker to over-read NGINX SMTP authentication process
  memory; as a result, the server side may leak arbitrary bytes sent in a request to the authentication
  server. This issue happens during the NGINX SMTP authentication process and requires the attacker
  to make preparations against the target system to extract the leaked data. The issue affects
  NGINX only if (1) it is built with the ngx_mail_smtp_module, (2) the smtp_auth directive is
  configured with method "none," and (3) the authentication server returns the "Auth-Wait" response
  header.     Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are
  not evaluated.'
