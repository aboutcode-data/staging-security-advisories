  - CVE-2024-7347
summary: 'NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus have a vulnerability in the ngx_http_mp4_module,
  which might allow an attacker to over-read NGINX worker memory resulting in its termination,
  using a specially crafted mp4 file. The issue only affects NGINX if it is built with the ngx_http_mp4_module
  and the mp4 directive is used in the configuration file. Additionally, the attack is possible
  only if an attacker can trigger the processing of a specially crafted mp4 file with the ngx_http_mp4_module. 
  Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated.'
