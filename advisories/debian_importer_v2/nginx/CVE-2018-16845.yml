  - CVE-2018-16845
summary: nginx before versions 1.15.6, 1.14.1 has a vulnerability in the ngx_http_mp4_module,
  which might allow an attacker to cause infinite loop in a worker process, cause a worker process
  crash, or might result in worker process memory disclosure by using a specially crafted mp4
  file. The issue only affects nginx if it is built with the ngx_http_mp4_module (the module
  is not built by default) and the .mp4. directive is used in the configuration file. Further,
  the attack is only possible if an attacker is able to trigger processing of a specially crafted
  mp4 file with the ngx_http_mp4_module.
