  - CVE-2016-8860
summary: Tor before 0.2.8.9 and 0.2.9.x before 0.2.9.4-alpha had internal functions that were
  entitled to expect that buf_t data had NUL termination, but the implementation of or/buffers.c
  did not ensure that NUL termination was present, which allows remote attackers to cause a
  denial of service (client, hidden service, relay, or authority crash) via crafted data.
