  - CVE-2009-0654
summary: 'Tor 0.2.0.28, and probably 0.2.0.34 and earlier, allows remote attackers, with control
  of an entry router and an exit router, to confirm that a sender and receiver are communicating
  via vectors involving (1) replaying, (2) modifying, (3) inserting, or (4) deleting a single
  cell, and then observing cell recognition errors at the exit router.  NOTE: the vendor disputes
  the significance of this issue, noting that the product''s design "accepted end-to-end correlation
  as an attack that is too expensive to solve."'
