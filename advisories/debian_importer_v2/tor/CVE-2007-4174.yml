aliases:
  - CVE-2007-4174
summary: Tor before 0.1.2.16, when ControlPort is enabled, does not properly restrict commands
  to localhost port 9051, which allows remote attackers to modify the torrc configuration file,
  compromise anonymity, and have other unspecified impact via HTTP POST data containing commands
  without valid authentication, as demonstrated by an HTML form (1) hosted on a web site or
  (2) injected by a Tor exit node.
