  - CVE-2017-11565
summary: 'debian/tor.init in the Debian tor_0.2.9.11-1~deb9u1 package for Tor was designed to
  execute aa-exec from the standard system pathname if the apparmor package is installed, but
  implements this incorrectly (with a wrong assumption that the specific pathname would remain
  the same forever), which allows attackers to bypass intended AppArmor restrictions by leveraging
  the silent loss of this protection mechanism. NOTE: this does not affect systems, such as
  default Debian stretch installations, on which Tor startup relies on a systemd unit file (instead
  of this tor.init script).'
