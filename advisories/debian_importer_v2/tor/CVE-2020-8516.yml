summary: 'The daemon in Tor through 0.4.1.8 and 0.4.2.x through 0.4.2.6 does not verify that
  a rendezvous node is known before attempting to connect to it, which might make it easier
  for remote attackers to discover circuit information. NOTE: The network team of Tor claims
  this is an intended behavior and not a vulnerability'
