aliases:
  - CVE-2014-5117
summary: Tor before 0.2.4.23 and 0.2.5 before 0.2.5.6-alpha maintains a circuit after an inbound
  RELAY_EARLY cell is received by a client, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct
  traffic-confirmation attacks by using the pattern of RELAY and RELAY_EARLY cells as a means
  of communicating information about hidden service names.
