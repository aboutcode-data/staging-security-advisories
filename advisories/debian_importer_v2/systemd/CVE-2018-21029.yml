summary: 'systemd 239 through 245 accepts any certificate signed by a trusted certificate authority
  for DNS Over TLS. Server Name Indication (SNI) is not sent, and there is no hostname validation
  with the GnuTLS backend. NOTE: This has been disputed by the developer as not a vulnerability
  since hostname validation does not have anything to do with this issue (i.e. there is no hostname
  to be sent)'
