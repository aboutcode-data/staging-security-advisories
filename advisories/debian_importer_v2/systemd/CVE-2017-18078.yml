  - CVE-2017-18078
summary: systemd-tmpfiles in systemd before 237 attempts to support ownership/permission changes
  on hardlinked files even if the fs.protected_hardlinks sysctl is turned off, which allows
  local users to bypass intended access restrictions via vectors involving a hard link to a
  file for which the user lacks write access, as demonstrated by changing the ownership of the
  /etc/passwd file.
