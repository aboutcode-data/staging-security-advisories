  - CVE-2019-6454
summary: An issue was discovered in sd-bus in systemd 239. bus_process_object() in libsystemd/sd-bus/bus-objects.c
  allocates a variable-length stack buffer for temporarily storing the object path of incoming
  D-Bus messages. An unprivileged local user can exploit this by sending a specially crafted
  message to PID1, causing the stack pointer to jump over the stack guard pages into an unmapped
  memory region and trigger a denial of service (systemd PID1 crash and kernel panic).
