  - CVE-2019-3842
summary: In systemd before v242-rc4, it was discovered that pam_systemd does not properly sanitize
  the environment before using the XDG_SEAT variable. It is possible for an attacker, in some
  particular configurations, to set a XDG_SEAT environment variable which allows for commands
  to be checked against polkit policies using the "allow_active" element rather than "allow_any".
