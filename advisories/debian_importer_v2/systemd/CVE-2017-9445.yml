  - CVE-2017-9445
summary: In systemd through 233, certain sizes passed to dns_packet_new in systemd-resolved
  can cause it to allocate a buffer that's too small. A malicious DNS server can exploit this
  via a response with a specially crafted TCP payload to trick systemd-resolved into allocating
  a buffer that's too small, and subsequently write arbitrary data beyond the end of it.
