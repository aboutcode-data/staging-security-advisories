aliases:
  - CVE-2022-2526
summary: A use-after-free vulnerability was found in systemd. This issue occurs due to the on_stream_io()
  function and dns_stream_complete() function in 'resolved-dns-stream.c' not incrementing the
  reference counting for the DnsStream object. Therefore, other functions and callbacks called
  can dereference the DNSStream object, causing the use-after-free when the reference is still
  used later.
