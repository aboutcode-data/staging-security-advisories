  - CVE-2025-4598
summary: A vulnerability was found in systemd-coredump. This flaw allows an attacker to force
  a SUID process to crash and replace it with a non-SUID binary to access the original's privileged
  process coredump, allowing the attacker to read sensitive data, such as /etc/shadow content,
  loaded by the original process.  A SUID binary or process has a special type of permission,
  which allows the process to run with the file owner's permissions, regardless of the user
  executing the binary. This allows the process to access more restricted data than unprivileged
  users or processes would be able to. An attacker can leverage this flaw by forcing a SUID
  process to crash and force the Linux kernel to recycle the process PID before systemd-coredump
  can analyze the /proc/pid/auxv file. If the attacker wins the race condition, they gain access
  to the original's SUID process coredump file. They can read sensitive content loaded into
  memory by the original binary, affecting data confidentiality.
