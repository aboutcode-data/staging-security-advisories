  - CVE-2022-45873
summary: systemd 250 and 251 allows local users to achieve a systemd-coredump deadlock by triggering
  a crash that has a long backtrace. This occurs in parse_elf_object in shared/elf-util.c. The
  exploitation methodology is to crash a binary calling the same function recursively, and put
  it in a deeply nested directory to make its backtrace large enough to cause the deadlock.
  This must be done 16 times when MaxConnections=16 is set for the systemd/units/systemd-coredump.socket
  file.
