summary: systemd-tmpfiles in systemd through 237 mishandles symlinks present in non-terminal
  path components, which allows local users to obtain ownership of arbitrary files via vectors
  involving creation of a directory and a file under that directory, and later replacing that
  directory with a symlink. This occurs even if the fs.protected_symlinks sysctl is turned on.
