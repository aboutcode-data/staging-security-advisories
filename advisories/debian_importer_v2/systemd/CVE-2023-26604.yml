  - CVE-2023-26604
summary: systemd before 247 does not adequately block local privilege escalation for some Sudo
  configurations, e.g., plausible sudoers files in which the "systemctl status" command may
  be executed. Specifically, systemd does not set LESSSECURE to 1, and thus other programs may
  be launched from the less program. This presents a substantial security risk when running
  systemctl from Sudo, because less executes as root when the terminal size is too small to
  show the complete systemctl output.
