aliases:
  - CVE-2018-16888
summary: It was discovered systemd does not correctly check the content of PIDFile files before
  using it to kill processes. When a service is run from an unprivileged user (e.g. User field
  set in the service file), a local attacker who is able to write to the PIDFile of the mentioned
  service may use this flaw to trick systemd into killing other services and/or privileged processes.
  Versions before v237 are vulnerable.
