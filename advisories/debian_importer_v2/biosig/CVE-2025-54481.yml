  - CVE-2025-54481
summary: "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the MFER parsing functionality\
  \ of The Biosig Project libbiosig 3.9.0 and Master Branch (35a819fa). A specially crafted\
  \ MFER file can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file\
  \ to trigger this vulnerability.This vulnerability manifests on line 8744 of biosig.c on the\
  \ current master branch (35a819fa), when the Tag is 3:\r \r \t\t\t\telse if (tag==3) {\r \t\
  \t\t\t\t// character code\r \t\t\t\t\tchar v[17];\t\t// [1]\r \t\t\t\t\tif (len>16) fprintf(stderr,\"\
  Warning MFER tag2 incorrect length %i>16\\n\",len);\r \t\t\t\t\tcurPos += ifread(&v,1,len,hdr);\r\
  \ \t\t\t\t\tv[len]  = 0;\r \r In this case, the overflowed buffer is the newly-declared `v`\
  \ \\[1\\] instead of `buf`. Since `v` is only 17 bytes large, much smaller values of `len`\
  \ (even those encoded using a single octet) can trigger an overflow in this code path."
