summary: "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the MFER parsing functionality\
  \ of The Biosig Project libbiosig 3.9.0 and Master Branch (35a819fa). A specially crafted\
  \ MFER file can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file\
  \ to trigger this vulnerability.This vulnerability manifests on line 8970 of biosig.c on the\
  \ current master branch (35a819fa), when the Tag is 63:\r \r                 else if (tag==63)\
  \ {\r                     uint8_t tag2=255, len2=255;\r \r                     count = 0;\r\
  \                     while ((count<len) && !(FlagInfiniteLength && len2==0 && tag2==0)){\r\
  \                         curPos += ifread(&tag2,1,1,hdr);\r                         curPos\
  \ += ifread(&len2,1,1,hdr);\r                         if (VERBOSE_LEVEL==9)\r            \
  \                 fprintf(stdout,\"MFER: tag=%3i chan=%2i len=%-4i tag2=%3i len2=%3i curPos=%i\
  \ %li count=%4i\\n\",tag,chan,len,tag2,len2,curPos,iftell(hdr),(int)count);\r \r         \
  \                if (FlagInfiniteLength && len2==0 && tag2==0) break;\r \r               \
  \          count  += (2+len2);\r                         curPos += ifread(&buf,1,len2,hdr);\r\
  \ \r Here, the number of bytes read is not the Data Length decoded from the current frame\
  \ in the file (`len`) but rather is a new length contained in a single octet read from the\
  \ same input file (`len2`). Despite this, a stack-based buffer overflow condition can still\
  \ occur, as the destination buffer is still `buf`, which has a size of only 128 bytes, while\
  \ `len2` can be as large as 255."
