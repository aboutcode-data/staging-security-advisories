  - CVE-2025-54490
summary: "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the MFER parsing functionality\
  \ of The Biosig Project libbiosig 3.9.0 and Master Branch (35a819fa). A specially crafted\
  \ MFER file can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file\
  \ to trigger this vulnerability.This vulnerability manifests on line 9090 of biosig.c on the\
  \ current master branch (35a819fa), when the Tag is 64:\r \r                 else if (tag==64)\
  \     //0x40\r                 {\r                     // preamble\r                     char\
  \ tmp[256];  // [1]\r                     curPos += ifread(tmp,1,len,hdr);\r \r In this case,\
  \ the overflowed buffer is the newly-declared `tmp` \\[1\\] instead of `buf`. While `tmp`\
  \ is larger than `buf`, having a size of 256 bytes, a stack overflow can still occur in cases\
  \ where `len` is encoded using multiple octets and is greater than 256."
