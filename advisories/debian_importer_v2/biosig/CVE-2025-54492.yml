  - CVE-2025-54492
summary: "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the MFER parsing functionality\
  \ of The Biosig Project libbiosig 3.9.0 and Master Branch (35a819fa). A specially crafted\
  \ MFER file can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file\
  \ to trigger this vulnerability.This vulnerability manifests on line 9141 of biosig.c on the\
  \ current master branch (35a819fa), when the Tag is 67:\r \r                 else if (tag==67)\
  \     //0x43: Sample skew\r                 {\r                     int skew=0;     // [1]\r\
  \                     curPos += ifread(&skew, 1, len,hdr);\r \r In this case, the address\
  \ of the newly-defined integer `skew` \\[1\\] is overflowed instead of `buf`. This means a\
  \ stack overflow can occur using much smaller values of `len` in this code path."
