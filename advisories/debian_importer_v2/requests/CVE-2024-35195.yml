  - CVE-2024-35195
summary: Requests is a HTTP library. Prior to 2.32.0, when making requests through a Requests
  `Session`, if the first request is made with `verify=False` to disable cert verification,
  all subsequent requests to the same host will continue to ignore cert verification regardless
  of changes to the value of `verify`. This behavior will continue for the lifecycle of the
  connection in the connection pool. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.32.0.
