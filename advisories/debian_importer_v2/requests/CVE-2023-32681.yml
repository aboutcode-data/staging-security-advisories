  - CVE-2023-32681
summary: Requests is a HTTP library. Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization
  headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of
  how we use `rebuild_proxies` to reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to requests. For
  HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request
  itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over
  HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has
  no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials
  to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate
  sensitive information. This issue has been patched in version 2.31.0.
