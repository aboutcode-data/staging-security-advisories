  - CVE-2020-14300
summary: The docker packages version docker-1.13.1-108.git4ef4b30.el7 as released for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 7 Extras via RHBA-2020:0053 (https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2020:0053)
  included an incorrect version of runc that was missing multiple bug and security fixes. One
  of the fixes regressed in that update was the fix for CVE-2016-9962, that was previously corrected
  in the docker packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras via RHSA-2017:0116 (https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:0116).
  The CVE-2020-14300 was assigned to this security regression and it is specific to the docker
  packages produced by Red Hat. The original issue - CVE-2016-9962 - could possibly allow a
  process inside container to compromise a process entering container namespace and execute
  arbitrary code outside of the container. This could lead to compromise of the container host
  or other containers running on the same container host. This issue only affects a single version
  of Docker, 1.13.1-108.git4ef4b30, shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. Both earlier and
  later versions are not affected.
