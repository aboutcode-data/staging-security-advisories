summary: Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable software containerization.
  A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where supplementary groups are not set up properly.
  If an attacker has direct access to a container and manipulates their supplementary group
  access, they may be able to use supplementary group access to bypass primary group restrictions
  in some cases, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or gaining the ability
  to execute code in that container.  This bug is fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.18. Running
  containers should be stopped and restarted for the permissions to be fixed. For users unable
  to upgrade, this problem can be worked around by not using the `"USER $USERNAME"` Dockerfile
  instruction. Instead by calling `ENTRYPOINT ["su", "-", "user"]` the supplementary groups
  will be set up properly.
