summary: Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable software containerization.
  A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where attempting to copy files using `docker cp` into
  a specially-crafted container can result in Unix file permission changes for existing files
  in the host’s filesystem, widening access to others. This bug does not directly allow files
  to be read, modified, or executed without an additional cooperating process. This bug has
  been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.9. Users should update to this version as soon as
  possible. Running containers do not need to be restarted.
