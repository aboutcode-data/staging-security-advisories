aliases:
  - CVE-2022-48521
summary: An issue was discovered in OpenDKIM through 2.10.3, and 2.11.x through 2.11.0-Beta2.
  It fails to keep track of ordinal numbers when removing fake Authentication-Results header
  fields, which allows a remote attacker to craft an e-mail message with a fake sender address
  such that programs that rely on Authentication-Results from OpenDKIM will treat the message
  as having a valid DKIM signature when in fact it has none.
