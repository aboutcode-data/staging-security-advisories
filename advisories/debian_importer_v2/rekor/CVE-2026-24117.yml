  - CVE-2026-24117
summary: Rekor is a software supply chain transparency log. In versions 1.4.3 and below, attackers
  can trigger SSRF to arbitrary internal services because /api/v1/index/retrieve supports retrieving
  a public key via user-provided URL. Since the SSRF only can trigger GET requests, the request
  cannot mutate state. The response from the GET request is not returned to the caller so data
  exfiltration is not possible. A malicious actor could attempt to probe an internal network
  through Blind SSRF. The issue has been fixed in version 1.5.0. To workaround this issue, disable
  the search endpoint with --enable_retrieve_api=false.
