  - CVE-2026-23831
summary: Rekor is a software supply chain transparency log. In versions 1.4.3 and below, the
  entry implementation can panic on attacker-controlled input when canonicalizing a proposed
  entry with an empty spec.message, causing nil Pointer Dereference. Function validate() returns
  nil (success) when message is empty, leaving sign1Msg uninitialized, and Canonicalize() later
  dereferences v.sign1Msg.Payload. A malformed proposed entry of the cose/v0.0.1 type can cause
  a panic on a thread within the Rekor process. The thread is recovered so the client receives
  a 500 error message and service still continues, so the availability impact of this is minimal.
  This issue has been fixed in version 1.5.0.
