  - CVE-2025-62711
summary: Wasmtime is a runtime for WebAssembly. In versions from 38.0.0 to before 38.0.3, the
  implementation of component-model related host-to-wasm trampolines in Wasmtime contained a
  bug where it's possible to carefully craft a component, which when called in a specific way,
  would crash the host with a segfault or assert failure. Wasmtime 38.0.3 has been released
  and is patched to fix this issue. There are no workarounds.
