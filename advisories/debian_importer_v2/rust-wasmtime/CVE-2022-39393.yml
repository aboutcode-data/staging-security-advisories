  - CVE-2022-39393
summary: Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. Prior to versions 2.0.2 and 1.0.2,
  there is a bug in Wasmtime's implementation of its pooling instance allocator where when a
  linear memory is reused for another instance the initial heap snapshot of the prior instance
  can be visible, erroneously to the next instance. This bug has been patched and users should
  upgrade to Wasmtime 2.0.2 and 1.0.2. Other mitigations include disabling the pooling allocator
  and disabling the `memory-init-cow`.
