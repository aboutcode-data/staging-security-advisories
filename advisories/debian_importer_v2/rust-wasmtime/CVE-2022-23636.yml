summary: Wasmtime is an open source runtime for WebAssembly & WASI. Prior to versions 0.34.1
  and 0.33.1, there exists a bug in the pooling instance allocator in Wasmtime's runtime where
  a failure to instantiate an instance for a module that defines an `externref` global will
  result in an invalid drop of a `VMExternRef` via an uninitialized pointer. A number of conditions
  listed in the GitHub Security Advisory must be true in order for an instance to be vulnerable
  to this issue. Maintainers believe that the effective impact of this bug is relatively small
  because the usage of `externref` is still uncommon and without a resource limiter configured
  on the `Store`, which is not the default configuration, it is only possible to trigger the
  bug from an error returned by `mprotect` or `VirtualAlloc`. Note that on Linux with the `uffd`
  feature enabled, it is only possible to trigger the bug from a resource limiter as the call
  to `mprotect` is skipped. The bug has been fixed in 0.34.1 and 0.33.1 and users are encouraged
  to upgrade as soon as possible. If it is not possible to upgrade to version 0.34.1 or 0.33.1
  of the `wasmtime` crate, it is recommend that support for the reference types proposal be
  disabled by passing `false` to `Config::wasm_reference_types`. Doing so will prevent modules
  that use `externref` from being loaded entirely.
