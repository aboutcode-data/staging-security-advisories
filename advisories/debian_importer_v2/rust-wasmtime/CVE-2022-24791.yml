summary: 'Wasmtime is a standalone JIT-style runtime for WebAssembly, using Cranelift. There
  is a use after free vulnerability in Wasmtime when both running Wasm that uses externrefs
  and enabling epoch interruption in Wasmtime. If you are not explicitly enabling epoch interruption
  (it is disabled by default) then you are not affected. If you are explicitly disabling the
  Wasm reference types proposal (it is enabled by default) then you are also not affected. The
  use after free is caused by Cranelift failing to emit stack maps when there are safepoints
  inside cold blocks. Cold blocks occur when epoch interruption is enabled. Cold blocks are
  emitted at the end of compiled functions, and change the order blocks are emitted versus defined.
  This reordering accidentally caused Cranelift to skip emitting some stack maps because it
  expected to emit the stack maps in block definition order, rather than block emission order.
  When Wasmtime would eventually collect garbage, it would fail to find live references on the
  stack because of the missing stack maps, think that they were unreferenced garbage, and therefore
  reclaim them. Then after the collection ended, the Wasm code could use the reclaimed-too-early
  references, which is a use after free. Patches have been released in versions 0.34.2 and 0.35.2,
  which fix the vulnerability. All Wasmtime users are recommended to upgrade to these patched
  versions. If upgrading is not an option for you at this time, you can avoid the vulnerability
  by either: disabling the Wasm reference types proposal, config.wasm_reference_types(false);
  or by disabling epoch interruption if you were previously enabling it. config.epoch_interruption(false).'
