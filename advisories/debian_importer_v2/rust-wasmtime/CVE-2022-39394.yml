  - CVE-2022-39394
summary: Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. Prior to version 2.0.2, there is
  a bug in Wasmtime's C API implementation where the definition of the `wasmtime_trap_code`
  does not match its declared signature in the `wasmtime/trap.h` header file. This discrepancy
  causes the function implementation to perform a 4-byte write into a 1-byte buffer provided
  by the caller. This can lead to three zero bytes being written beyond the 1-byte location
  provided by the caller. This bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime 2.0.2.
  This bug can be worked around by providing a 4-byte buffer casted to a 1-byte buffer when
  calling `wasmtime_trap_code`. Users of the `wasmtime` crate are not affected by this issue,
  only users of the C API function `wasmtime_trap_code` are affected.
