  - CVE-2023-41880
summary: Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. Wasmtime versions from 10.0.0 to
  versions 10.02, 11.0.2, and 12.0.1 contain a miscompilation of the WebAssembly `i64x2.shr_s`
  instruction on x86_64 platforms when the shift amount is a constant value that is larger than
  32. Only x86_64 is affected so all other targets are not affected by this. The miscompilation
  results in the instruction producing an incorrect result, namely the low 32-bits of the second
  lane of the vector are derived from the low 32-bits of the second lane of the input vector
  instead of the high 32-bits. The primary impact of this issue is that any WebAssembly program
  using the `i64x2.shr_s` with a constant shift amount larger than 32 may produce an incorrect
  result.  This issue is not an escape from the WebAssembly sandbox. Execution of WebAssembly
  guest programs will still behave correctly with respect to memory sandboxing and isolation
  from the host. Wasmtime considers non-spec-compliant behavior as a security issue nonetheless.  This
  issue was discovered through fuzzing of Wasmtime's code generator Cranelift.  Wasmtime versions
  10.0.2, 11.0.2, and 12.0.2 are all patched to no longer have this miscompilation. This issue
  only affects x86_64 hosts and the only workaround is to either scan for this pattern in wasm
  modules which is nontrivial or to disable the SIMD proposal for WebAssembly. Users prior to
  10.0.0 are unaffected by this vulnerability.
