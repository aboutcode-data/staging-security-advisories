  - CVE-2019-3895
summary: An access-control flaw was found in the Octavia service when the cloud platform was
  deployed using Red Hat OpenStack Platform Director. An attacker could cause new amphorae to
  run based on any arbitrary image. This meant that a remote attacker could upload a new amphorae
  image and, if requested to spawn new amphorae, Octavia would then pick up the compromised
  image.
