  - CVE-2026-24686
summary: go-tuf is a Go implementation of The Update Framework (TUF). go-tuf's TAP 4 Multirepo
  Client uses the map file repository name string (`repoName`) as a filesystem path component
  when selecting the local metadata cache directory. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to
  version 2.4.1, if an application accepts a map file from an untrusted source, an attacker
  can supply a `repoName` containing traversal (e.g., `../escaped-repo`) and cause go-tuf to
  create directories and write the root metadata file outside the intended `LocalMetadataDir`
  cache base, within the running process's filesystem permissions. Version 2.4.1 contains a
  patch.
