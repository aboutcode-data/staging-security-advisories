aliases:
  - CVE-2024-47534
summary: go-tuf is a Go implementation of The Update Framework (TUF). The go-tuf client inconsistently
  traces the delegations. For example, if targets delegate to "A", and to "B", and "B" delegates
  to "C", then the client should trace the delegations in the order "A" then "B" then "C" but
  it may incorrectly trace the delegations "B"->"C"->"A". This vulnerability is fixed in 2.0.1.
