  - CVE-2015-9258
summary: In Docker Notary before 0.1, gotuf/signed/verify.go has a Signature Algorithm Not Matched
  to Key vulnerability. Because an attacker controls the field specifying the signature algorithm,
  they might (for example) be able to forge a signature by forcing a misinterpretation of an
  RSA-PSS key as Ed25519 elliptic-curve data.
