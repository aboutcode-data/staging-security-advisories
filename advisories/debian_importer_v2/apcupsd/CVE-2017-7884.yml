  - CVE-2017-7884
summary: In Adam Kropelin adk0212 APC UPS Daemon through 3.14.14, the default installation of
  APCUPSD allows a local authenticated, but unprivileged, user to run arbitrary code with elevated
  privileges by replacing the service executable apcupsd.exe with a malicious executable that
  will run with SYSTEM privileges at startup. This occurs because of "RW NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated
  Users" permissions for %SYSTEMDRIVE%\apcupsd\bin\apcupsd.exe.
