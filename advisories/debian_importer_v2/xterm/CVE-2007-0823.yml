  - CVE-2007-0823
summary: 'xterm on Slackware Linux 10.2 stores information that had been displayed for a different
  user account using the same xterm process, which might allow local users to bypass file permissions
  and read other users'' files, or obtain other sensitive information, by reading the xterm
  process memory.  NOTE: it could be argued that this is an expected consequence of multiple
  users sharing the same interactive process, in which case this is not a vulnerability.'
