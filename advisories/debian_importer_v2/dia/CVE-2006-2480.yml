summary: 'Format string vulnerability in Dia 0.94 allows user-assisted attackers to cause a
  denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code by triggering errors or warnings,
  as demonstrated via format string specifiers in a .bmp filename.  NOTE: the original exploit
  was demonstrated through a command line argument, but there are other mechanisms for input
  that are automatically processed by Dia, such as a crafted .dia file.'
