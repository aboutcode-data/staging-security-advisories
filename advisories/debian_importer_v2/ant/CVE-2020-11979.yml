  - CVE-2020-11979
summary: As mitigation for CVE-2020-1945 Apache Ant 1.10.8 changed the permissions of temporary
  files it created so that only the current user was allowed to access them. Unfortunately the
  fixcrlf task deleted the temporary file and created a new one without said protection, effectively
  nullifying the effort. This would still allow an attacker to inject modified source files
  into the build process.
