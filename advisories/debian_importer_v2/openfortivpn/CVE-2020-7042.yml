  - CVE-2020-7042
summary: An issue was discovered in openfortivpn 1.11.0 when used with OpenSSL 1.0.2 or later.
  tunnel.c mishandles certificate validation because the hostname check operates on uninitialized
  memory. The outcome is that a valid certificate is never accepted (only a malformed certificate
  may be accepted).
