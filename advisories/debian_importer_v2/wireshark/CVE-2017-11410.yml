  - CVE-2017-11410
summary: 'In Wireshark through 2.0.13 and 2.2.x through 2.2.7, the WBXML dissector could go
  into an infinite loop, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture file. This was
  addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-wbxml.c by adding validation of the relationships between
  indexes and lengths. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2017-7702.'
