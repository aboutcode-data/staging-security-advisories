  - CVE-2016-9374
summary: In Wireshark 2.2.0 to 2.2.1 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.7, the AllJoyn dissector could crash with
  a buffer over-read, triggered by network traffic or a capture file. This was addressed in
  epan/dissectors/packet-alljoyn.c by ensuring that a length variable properly tracked the state
  of a signature variable.
