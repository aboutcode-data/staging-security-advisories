  - CVE-2016-2529
summary: The iseries_check_file_type function in wiretap/iseries.c in the iSeries file parser
  in Wireshark 2.0.x before 2.0.2 does not consider that a line may lack the "OBJECT PROTOCOL"
  substring, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read
  and application crash) via a crafted file.
