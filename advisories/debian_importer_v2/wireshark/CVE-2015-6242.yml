aliases:
  - CVE-2015-6242
summary: The wmem_block_split_free_chunk function in epan/wmem/wmem_allocator_block.c in the
  wmem block allocator in the memory manager in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.7 does not properly
  consider a certain case of multiple realloc operations that restore a memory chunk to its
  original size, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (incorrect free
  operation and application crash) via a crafted packet.
