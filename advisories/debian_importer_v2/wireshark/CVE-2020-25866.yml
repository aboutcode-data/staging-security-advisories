  - CVE-2020-25866
summary: In Wireshark 3.2.0 to 3.2.6 and 3.0.0 to 3.0.13, the BLIP protocol dissector has a
  NULL pointer dereference because a buffer was sized for compressed (not uncompressed) messages.
  This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-blip.c by allowing reasonable compression ratios
  and rejecting ZIP bombs.
