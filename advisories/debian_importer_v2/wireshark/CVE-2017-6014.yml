aliases:
  - CVE-2017-6014
summary: In Wireshark 2.2.4 and earlier, a crafted or malformed STANAG 4607 capture file will
  cause an infinite loop and memory exhaustion. If the packet size field in a packet header
  is null, the offset to read from will not advance, causing continuous attempts to read the
  same zero length packet. This will quickly exhaust all system memory.
