summary: 'influxData influxDB before v1.8.10 contains no authentication mechanism or controls,
  allowing unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary commands. NOTE: the CVE ID assignment
  is disputed because the vendor''s documentation states "If InfluxDB is being deployed on a
  publicly accessible endpoint, we strongly recommend authentication be enabled. Otherwise the
  data will be publicly available to any unauthenticated user. The default settings do NOT enable
  authentication and authorization.'
