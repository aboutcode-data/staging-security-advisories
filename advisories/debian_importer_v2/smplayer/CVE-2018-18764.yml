  - CVE-2018-18764
summary: An exploitable arbitrary memory read vulnerability exists in the MQTT packet-parsing
  functionality of Cesanta Mongoose 6.13. It is a heap-based buffer over-read in a parse_mqtt
  getu16 call. A specially crafted MQTT SUBSCRIBE packet can cause an arbitrary out-of-bounds
  memory read potentially resulting in information disclosure and denial of service. An attacker
  needs to send a specially crafted MQTT packet over the network to trigger this vulnerability.
