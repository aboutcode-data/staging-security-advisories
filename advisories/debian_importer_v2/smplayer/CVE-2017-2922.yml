  - CVE-2017-2922
summary: An exploitable memory corruption vulnerability exists in the Websocket protocol implementation
  of Cesanta Mongoose 6.8. A specially crafted websocket packet can cause a buffer to be allocated
  while leaving stale pointers which leads to a use-after-free vulnerability which can be exploited
  to achieve remote code execution. An attacker needs to send a specially crafted websocket
  packet over the network to trigger this vulnerability.
