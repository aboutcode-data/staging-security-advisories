summary: An exploitable arbitrary memory read vulnerability exists in the MQTT packet parsing
  functionality of Cesanta Mongoose 6.8. A specially crafted MQTT packet can cause an arbitrary
  out-of-bounds memory read and write potentially resulting in information disclosure, denial
  of service and remote code execution. An attacker needs to send a specially crafted MQTT packet
  over the network to trigger this vulnerability.
