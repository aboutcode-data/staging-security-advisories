  - CVE-2025-40923
summary: Plack-Middleware-Session before version 0.35 for Perl generates session ids insecurely.  The
  default session id generator returns a SHA-1 hash seeded with the built-in rand function,
  the epoch time, and the PID. The PID will come from a small set of numbers, and the epoch
  time may be guessed, if it is not leaked from the HTTP Date header. The built-in rand function
  is unsuitable for cryptographic usage.  Predicable session ids could allow an attacker to
  gain access to systems.
