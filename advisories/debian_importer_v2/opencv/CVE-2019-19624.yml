  - CVE-2019-19624
summary: An out-of-bounds read was discovered in OpenCV before 4.1.1. Specifically, variable
  coarsest_scale is assumed to be greater than or equal to finest_scale within the calc()/ocl_calc()
  functions in dis_flow.cpp. However, this is not true when dealing with small images, leading
  to an out-of-bounds read of the heap-allocated arrays Ux and Uy.
