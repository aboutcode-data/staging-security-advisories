  - CVE-2022-28550
summary: Matthias-Wandel/jhead jhead 3.06 is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via shellescape(),
  jhead.c, jhead. jhead copies strings to a stack buffer when it detects a &i or &o. However,
  jhead does not check the boundary of the stack buffer. As a result, there will be a stack
  buffer overflow problem when multiple `&i` or `&o` are given.
