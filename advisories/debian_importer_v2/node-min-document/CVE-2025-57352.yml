  - CVE-2025-57352
summary: A vulnerability exists in the 'min-document' package prior to version 2.19.0, stemming
  from improper handling of namespace operations in the removeAttributeNS method. By processing
  malicious input involving the __proto__ property, an attacker can manipulate the prototype
  chain of JavaScript objects, leading to denial of service or arbitrary code execution. This
  issue arises from insufficient validation of attribute namespace removal operations, allowing
  unintended modification of critical object prototypes. The vulnerability remains unaddressed
  in the latest available version.
