  - CVE-2025-69209
summary: 'ArduinoCore-avr contains the source code and configuration files of the Arduino AVR
  Boards platform. A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.8.7 allows an attacker to trigger
  a stack-based buffer overflow when converting floating-point values to strings with high precision.
  By passing very large `decimalPlaces` values to the affected String constructors or concat
  methods, the `dtostrf` function writes beyond fixed-size stack buffers, causing memory corruption
  and denial of service. Under specific conditions, this could enable arbitrary code execution
  on AVR-based Arduino boards.  ### Patches  - The Fix is included starting from the `1.8.7`
  release available from the following link [ArduinoCore-avr v1.8.7](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-avr)  -
  The Fixing Commit is available at the following link [1a6a417f89c8901dad646efce74ae9d3ddebfd59](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-avr/pull/613/commits/1a6a417f89c8901dad646efce74ae9d3ddebfd59)  ###
