  - CVE-2024-24577
summary: libgit2 is a portable C implementation of the Git core methods provided as a linkable
  library with a solid API, allowing to build Git functionality into your application. Using
  well-crafted inputs to `git_index_add` can cause heap corruption that could be leveraged for
  arbitrary code execution. There is an issue in the `has_dir_name` function in `src/libgit2/index.c`,
  which frees an entry that should not be freed. The freed entry is later used and overwritten
  with potentially bad actor-controlled data leading to controlled heap corruption. Depending
  on the application that uses libgit2, this could lead to arbitrary code execution. This issue
  has been patched in version 1.6.5 and 1.7.2.
