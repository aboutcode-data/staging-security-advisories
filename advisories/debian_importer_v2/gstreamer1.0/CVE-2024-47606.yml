  - CVE-2024-47606
summary: GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An integer
  underflow has been detected in the function qtdemux_parse_theora_extension within qtdemux.c.
  The vulnerability occurs due to an underflow of the gint size variable, which causes size
  to hold a large unintended value when cast to an unsigned integer. This 32-bit negative value
  is then cast to a 64-bit unsigned integer (0xfffffffffffffffa) in a subsequent call to gst_buffer_new_and_alloc.
  The function gst_buffer_new_allocate then attempts to allocate memory, eventually calling
  _sysmem_new_block. The function _sysmem_new_block adds alignment and header size to the (unsigned)
  size, causing the overflow of the 'slice_size' variable. As a result, only 0x89 bytes are
  allocated, despite the large input size. When the following memcpy call occurs in gst_buffer_fill,
  the data from the input file will overwrite the content of the GstMapInfo info structure.
  Finally, during the call to gst_memory_unmap, the overwritten memory may cause a function
  pointer hijack, as the mem->allocator->mem_unmap_full function is called with a corrupted
  pointer. This function pointer overwrite could allow an attacker to alter the execution flow
  of the program, leading to arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.
