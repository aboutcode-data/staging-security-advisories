summary: cmark-gfm is GitHub's extended version of the C reference implementation of CommonMark.
  Prior to versions 0.29.0.gfm.3 and 0.28.3.gfm.21, an integer overflow in cmark-gfm's table
  row parsing `table.c:row_from_string` may lead to heap memory corruption when parsing tables
  who's marker rows contain more than UINT16_MAX columns. The impact of this heap corruption
  ranges from Information Leak to Arbitrary Code Execution depending on how and where `cmark-gfm`
  is used. If `cmark-gfm` is used for rendering remote user controlled markdown, this vulnerability
  may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in applications employing affected versions of the
  `cmark-gfm` library. This vulnerability has been patched in the following cmark-gfm versions
  0.29.0.gfm.3 and 0.28.3.gfm.21. A workaround is available. The vulnerability exists in the
  table markdown extensions of cmark-gfm. Disabling the table extension will prevent this vulnerability
  from being triggered.
