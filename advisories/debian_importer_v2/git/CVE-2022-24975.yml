summary: 'The --mirror documentation for Git through 2.35.1 does not mention the availability
  of deleted content, aka the "GitBleed" issue. This could present a security risk if information-disclosure
  auditing processes rely on a clone operation without the --mirror option. Note: This has been
  disputed by multiple 3rd parties who believe this is an intended feature of the git binary
  and does not pose a security risk.'
