  - CVE-2017-1000117
summary: A malicious third-party can give a crafted "ssh://..." URL to an unsuspecting victim,
  and an attempt to visit the URL can result in any program that exists on the victim's machine
  being executed. Such a URL could be placed in the .gitmodules file of a malicious project,
  and an unsuspecting victim could be tricked into running "git clone --recurse-submodules"
  to trigger the vulnerability.
