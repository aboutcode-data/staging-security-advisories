  - CVE-2018-11235
summary: In Git before 2.13.7, 2.14.x before 2.14.4, 2.15.x before 2.15.2, 2.16.x before 2.16.4,
  and 2.17.x before 2.17.1, remote code execution can occur. With a crafted .gitmodules file,
  a malicious project can execute an arbitrary script on a machine that runs "git clone --recurse-submodules"
  because submodule "names" are obtained from this file, and then appended to $GIT_DIR/modules,
  leading to directory traversal with "../" in a name. Finally, post-checkout hooks from a submodule
  are executed, bypassing the intended design in which hooks are not obtained from a remote
  server.
