  - CVE-2022-39253
summary: 'Git is an open source, scalable, distributed revision control system. Versions prior
  to 2.30.6, 2.31.5, 2.32.4, 2.33.5, 2.34.5, 2.35.5, 2.36.3, and 2.37.4 are subject to exposure
  of sensitive information to a malicious actor. When performing a local clone (where the source
  and target of the clone are on the same volume), Git copies the contents of the source''s
  `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory into the destination by either creating hardlinks to the source
  contents, or copying them (if hardlinks are disabled via `--no-hardlinks`). A malicious actor
  could convince a victim to clone a repository with a symbolic link pointing at sensitive information
  on the victim''s machine. This can be done either by having the victim clone a malicious repository
  on the same machine, or having them clone a malicious repository embedded as a bare repository
  via a submodule from any source, provided they clone with the `--recurse-submodules` option.
  Git does not create symbolic links in the `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory. The problem has been
  patched in the versions published on 2022-10-18, and backported to v2.30.x. Potential workarounds:
  Avoid cloning untrusted repositories using the `--local` optimization when on a shared machine,
  either by passing the `--no-local` option to `git clone` or cloning from a URL that uses the
  `file://` scheme. Alternatively, avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources with `--recurse-submodules`
  or run `git config --global protocol.file.allow user`.'
