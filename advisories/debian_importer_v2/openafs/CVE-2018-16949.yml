aliases:
  - CVE-2018-16949
summary: An issue was discovered in OpenAFS before 1.6.23 and 1.8.x before 1.8.2. Several data
  types used as RPC input variables were implemented as unbounded array types, limited only
  by the inherent 32-bit length field to 4 GB. An unauthenticated attacker could send, or claim
  to send, large input values and consume server resources waiting for those inputs, denying
  service to other valid connections.
