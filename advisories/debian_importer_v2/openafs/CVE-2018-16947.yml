aliases:
  - CVE-2018-16947
summary: An issue was discovered in OpenAFS before 1.6.23 and 1.8.x before 1.8.2. The backup
  tape controller (butc) process accepts incoming RPCs but does not require (or allow for) authentication
  of those RPCs. Handling those RPCs results in operations being performed with administrator
  credentials, including dumping/restoring volume contents and manipulating the backup database.
  For example, an unauthenticated attacker can replace any volume's content with arbitrary data.
