aliases:
  - CVE-2018-16948
summary: An issue was discovered in OpenAFS before 1.6.23 and 1.8.x before 1.8.2. Several RPC
  server routines did not fully initialize their output variables before returning, leaking
  memory contents from both the stack and the heap. Because the OpenAFS cache manager functions
  as an Rx server for the AFSCB service, clients are also susceptible to information leakage.
  For example, RXAFSCB_TellMeAboutYourself leaks kernel memory and KAM_ListEntry leaks kaserver
  memory.
