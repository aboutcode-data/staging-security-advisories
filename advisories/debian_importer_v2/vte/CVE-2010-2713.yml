  - CVE-2010-2713
summary: 'The vte_sequence_handler_window_manipulation function in vteseq.c in libvte (aka libvte9)
  in VTE 0.25.1 and earlier, as used in gnome-terminal, does not properly handle escape sequences,
  which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands or obtain potentially sensitive
  information via a (1) window title or (2) icon title sequence.  NOTE: this issue exists because
  of a CVE-2003-0070 regression.'
