summary: VTE, as used by default in gnome-terminal terminal emulator 2.2 and as an option in
  gnome-terminal 2.0, allows attackers to modify the window title via a certain character escape
  sequence and then insert it back to the command line in the user's terminal, e.g. when the
  user views a file containing the malicious sequence, which could allow the attacker to execute
  arbitrary commands.
