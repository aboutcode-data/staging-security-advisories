summary: 'The Netdata web application through 1.13.0 allows remote attackers to inject their
  own malicious HTML code into an imported snapshot, aka HTML Injection. Successful exploitation
  will allow attacker-supplied HTML to run in the context of the affected browser, potentially
  allowing the attacker to steal authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered
  to the user. NOTE: the vendor disputes the risk because there is a clear warning next to the
  button for importing a snapshot'
