  - CVE-2022-23516
summary: Loofah is a general library for manipulating and transforming HTML/XML documents and
  fragments, built on top of Nokogiri. Loofah >= 2.2.0, < 2.19.1 uses recursion for sanitizing
  CDATA sections, making it susceptible to stack exhaustion and raising a SystemStackError exception.  This
  may lead to a denial of service through CPU resource consumption. This issue is patched in
  version 2.19.1. Users who are unable to upgrade may be able to mitigate this vulnerability
  by limiting the length of the strings that are sanitized.
