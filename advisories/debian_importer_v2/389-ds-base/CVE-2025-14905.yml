  - CVE-2025-14905
summary: A flaw was found in the 389-ds-base server. A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists
  in the `schema_attr_enum_callback` function within the `schema.c` file. This occurs because
  the code incorrectly calculates the buffer size by summing alias string lengths without accounting
  for additional formatting characters. When a large number of aliases are processed, this oversight
  can lead to a heap overflow, potentially allowing a remote attacker to cause a Denial of Service
  (DoS) or achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE).
