  - CVE-2016-7420
summary: Crypto++ (aka cryptopp) through 5.6.4 does not document the requirement for a compile-time
  NDEBUG definition disabling the many assert calls that are unintended in production use, which
  might allow context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information by leveraging access
  to process memory after an assertion failure, as demonstrated by reading a core dump.
