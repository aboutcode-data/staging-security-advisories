  - CVE-2024-29039
summary: tpm2 is the source repository for the Trusted Platform Module (TPM2.0) tools. This
  vulnerability allows attackers to manipulate tpm2_checkquote outputs by altering the TPML_PCR_SELECTION
  in the PCR input file.  As a result, digest values are incorrectly mapped to PCR slots and
  banks, providing a misleading picture of the TPM state. This issue has been patched in version
  5.7.
