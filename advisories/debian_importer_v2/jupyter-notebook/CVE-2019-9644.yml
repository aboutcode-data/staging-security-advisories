  - CVE-2019-9644
summary: An XSSI (cross-site inclusion) vulnerability in Jupyter Notebook before 5.7.6 allows
  inclusion of resources on malicious pages when visited by users who are authenticated with
  a Jupyter server. Access to the content of resources has been demonstrated with Internet Explorer
  through capturing of error messages, though not reproduced with other browsers. This occurs
  because Internet Explorer's error messages can include the content of any invalid JavaScript
  that was encountered.
