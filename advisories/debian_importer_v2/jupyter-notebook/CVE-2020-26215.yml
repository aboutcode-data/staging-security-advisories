  - CVE-2020-26215
summary: Jupyter Notebook before version 6.1.5 has an Open redirect vulnerability. A maliciously
  crafted link to a notebook server could redirect the browser to a different website. All notebook
  servers are technically affected, however, these maliciously crafted links can only be reasonably
  made for known notebook server hosts. A link to your notebook server may appear safe, but
  ultimately redirect to a spoofed server on the public internet. The issue is patched in version
  6.1.5.
