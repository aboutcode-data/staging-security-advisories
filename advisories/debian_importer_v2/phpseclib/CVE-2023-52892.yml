  - CVE-2023-52892
summary: In phpseclib before 1.0.22, 2.x before 2.0.46, and 3.x before 3.0.33, some characters
  in Subject Alternative Name fields in TLS certificates are incorrectly allowed to have a special
  meaning in regular expressions (such as a + wildcard), leading to name confusion in X.509
  certificate host verification.
