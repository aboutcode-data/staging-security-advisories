aliases:
  - CVE-2025-9784
summary: A flaw was found in Undertow where malformed client requests can trigger server-side
  stream resets without triggering abuse counters. This issue, referred to as the "MadeYouReset"
  attack, allows malicious clients to induce excessive server workload by repeatedly causing
  server-side stream aborts. While not a protocol bug, this highlights a common implementation
  weakness that can be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS).
