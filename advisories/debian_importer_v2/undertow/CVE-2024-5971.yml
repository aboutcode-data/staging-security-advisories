aliases:
  - CVE-2024-5971
summary: A vulnerability was found in Undertow, where the chunked response hangs after the body
  was flushed. The response headers and body were sent but the client would continue waiting
  as Undertow does not send the expected 0\r\n termination of the chunked response. This results
  in uncontrolled resource consumption, leaving the server side to a denial of service attack.
  This happens only with Java 17 TLSv1.3 scenarios.
