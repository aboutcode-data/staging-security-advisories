aliases:
  - CVE-2024-7885
summary: A vulnerability was found in Undertow where the ProxyProtocolReadListener reuses the
  same StringBuilder instance across multiple requests. This issue occurs when the parseProxyProtocolV1
  method processes multiple requests on the same HTTP connection. As a result, different requests
  may share the same StringBuilder instance, potentially leading to information leakage between
  requests or responses. In some cases, a value from a previous request or response may be erroneously
  reused, which could lead to unintended data exposure. This issue primarily results in errors
  and connection termination but creates a risk of data leakage in multi-request environments.
