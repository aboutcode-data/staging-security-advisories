aliases:
  - CVE-2024-3653
summary: A vulnerability was found in Undertow. This issue requires enabling the learning-push
  handler in the server's config, which is disabled by default, leaving the maxAge config in
  the handler unconfigured. The default is -1, which makes the handler vulnerable. If someone
  overwrites that config, the server is not subject to the attack. The attacker needs to be
  able to reach the server with a normal HTTP request.
