aliases:
  - CVE-2022-1319
summary: A flaw was found in Undertow. For an AJP 400 response, EAP 7 is improperly sending
  two response packets, and those packets have the reuse flag set even though JBoss EAP closes
  the connection. A failure occurs when the connection is reused after a 400 by CPING since
  it reads in the second SEND_HEADERS response packet instead of a CPONG.
