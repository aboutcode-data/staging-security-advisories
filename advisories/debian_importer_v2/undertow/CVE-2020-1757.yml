  - CVE-2020-1757
summary: A flaw was found in all undertow-2.x.x SP1 versions prior to undertow-2.0.30.SP1, all
  undertow-1.x.x and undertow-2.x.x versions prior to undertow-2.1.0.Final, where the Servlet
  container causes servletPath to normalize incorrectly by truncating the path after semicolon
  which may lead to an application mapping resulting in the security bypass.
