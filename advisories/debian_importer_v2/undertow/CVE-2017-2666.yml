aliases:
  - CVE-2017-2666
summary: It was discovered in Undertow that the code that parsed the HTTP request line permitted
  invalid characters. This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy that also permitted
  the invalid characters but with a different interpretation, to inject data into the HTTP response.
  By manipulating the HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack,
  or obtain sensitive information from requests other than their own.
