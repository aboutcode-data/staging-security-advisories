aliases:
  - CVE-2024-6162
summary: A vulnerability was found in Undertow, where URL-encoded request paths can be mishandled
  during concurrent requests on the AJP listener. This issue arises because the same buffer
  is used to decode the paths for multiple requests simultaneously, leading to incorrect path
  information being processed. As a result, the server may attempt to access the wrong path,
  causing errors such as "404 Not Found" or other application failures. This flaw can potentially
  lead to a denial of service, as legitimate resources become inaccessible due to the path mix-up.
