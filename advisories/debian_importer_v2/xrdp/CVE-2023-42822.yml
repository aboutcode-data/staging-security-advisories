  - CVE-2023-42822
summary: xrdp is an open source remote desktop protocol server. Access to the font glyphs in
  xrdp_painter.c is not bounds-checked . Since some of this data is controllable by the user,
  this can result in an out-of-bounds read within the xrdp executable. The vulnerability allows
  an out-of-bounds read within a potentially privileged process. On non-Debian platforms, xrdp
  tends to run as root. Potentially an out-of-bounds write can follow the out-of-bounds read.
  There is no denial-of-service impact, providing xrdp is running in forking mode. This issue
  has been addressed in release 0.9.23.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
  for this vulnerability.
