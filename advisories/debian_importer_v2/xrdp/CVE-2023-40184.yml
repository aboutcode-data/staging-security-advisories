  - CVE-2023-40184
summary: xrdp is an open source remote desktop protocol (RDP) server. In versions prior to 0.9.23
  improper handling of session establishment errors allows bypassing OS-level session restrictions.
  The `auth_start_session` function can return non-zero (1) value on, e.g., PAM error which
  may result in in session restrictions such as max concurrent sessions per user by PAM (ex
  ./etc/security/limits.conf) to be bypassed. Users (administrators) don't use restrictions
  by PAM are not affected. This issue has been addressed in release version 0.9.23. Users are
  advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
