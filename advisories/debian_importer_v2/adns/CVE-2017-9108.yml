  - CVE-2017-9108
summary: An issue was discovered in adns before 1.5.2. adnshost mishandles a missing final newline
  on a stdin read. It is wrong to increment used as well as setting r, since used is incremented
  according to r, later. Rather one should be doing what read() would have done. Without this
  fix, adnshost may read and process one byte beyond the buffer, perhaps crashing or perhaps
  somehow leaking the value of that byte.
