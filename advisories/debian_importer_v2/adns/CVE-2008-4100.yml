summary: 'GNU adns 1.4 and earlier uses a fixed source port and sequential transaction IDs for
  DNS requests, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof DNS responses, a different
  vulnerability than CVE-2008-1447.  NOTE: the vendor reports that this is intended behavior
  and is compatible with the product''s intended role in a trusted environment.'
