  - CVE-2020-17437
summary: An issue was discovered in uIP 1.0, as used in Contiki 3.0 and other products. When
  the Urgent flag is set in a TCP packet, and the stack is configured to ignore the urgent data,
  the stack attempts to use the value of the Urgent pointer bytes to separate the Urgent data
  from the normal data, by calculating the offset at which the normal data should be present
  in the global buffer. However, the length of this offset is not checked; therefore, for large
  values of the Urgent pointer bytes, the data pointer can point to memory that is way beyond
  the data buffer in uip_process in uip.c.
