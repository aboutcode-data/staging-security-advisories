  - CVE-2021-42523
summary: There are two Information Disclosure vulnerabilities in colord, and they lie in colord/src/cd-device-db.c
  and colord/src/cd-profile-db.c separately. They exist because the 'err_msg' of 'sqlite3_exec'
  is not releasing after use, while libxml2 emphasizes that the caller needs to release it.
