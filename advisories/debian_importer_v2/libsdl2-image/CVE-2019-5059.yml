aliases:
  - CVE-2019-5059
summary: An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the XPM image rendering functionality
  of SDL2_image 2.0.4. A specially crafted XPM image can cause an integer overflow, allocating
  too small of a buffer. This buffer can then be written out of bounds resulting in a heap overflow,
  ultimately ending in code execution. An attacker can display a specially crafted image to
  trigger this vulnerability.
