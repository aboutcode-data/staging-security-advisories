  in the Qt corelib module on Windows which potentially allows Symlink Attacks and the use of
  Malicious Files. Issue originates from CVE-2024-38081. The vulnerability arises from the use
  of the GetTempPath API, which can be exploited by attackers to manipulate temporary file paths,
  potentially leading to unauthorized access and privilege escalation. The affected public API

  with TempLocation, QTemporaryDir, and QTemporaryFile.This issue affects all version of Qt
  up to and including 5.15.18, from 6.0.0 through 6.5.8, from 6.6.0 through 6.8.1. It is fixed
  in Qt 5.15.19, Qt 6.5.9, Qt 6.8.2, 6.9.0
