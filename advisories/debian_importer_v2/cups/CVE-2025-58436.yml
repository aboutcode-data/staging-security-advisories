summary: OpenPrinting CUPS is an open source printing system for Linux and other Unix-like operating
  systems. Prior to version 2.4.15, a client that connects to cupsd but sends slow messages,
  e.g. only one byte per second, delays cupsd as a whole, such that it becomes unusable by other
  clients. This issue has been patched in version 2.4.15.
