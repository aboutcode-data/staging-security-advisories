  - CVE-2011-3170
summary: The gif_read_lzw function in filter/image-gif.c in CUPS 1.4.8 and earlier does not
  properly handle the first code word in an LZW stream, which allows remote attackers to trigger
  a heap-based buffer overflow, and possibly execute arbitrary code, via a crafted stream, a
  different vulnerability than CVE-2011-2896.
