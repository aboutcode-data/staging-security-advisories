  - CVE-2005-3193
summary: Heap-based buffer overflow in the JPXStream::readCodestream function in the JPX stream
  parsing code (JPXStream.c) for xpdf 3.01 and earlier, as used in products such as (1) Poppler,
  (2) teTeX, (3) KDE kpdf, (4) CUPS, and (5) libextractor allows user-assisted attackers to
  cause a denial of service (heap corruption) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted
  PDF file with large size values that cause insufficient memory to be allocated.
