  - CVE-2009-0163
summary: Integer overflow in the TIFF image decoding routines in CUPS 1.3.9 and earlier allows
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) and possibly execute arbitrary
  code via a crafted TIFF image, which is not properly handled by the (1) _cupsImageReadTIFF
  function in the imagetops filter and (2) imagetoraster filter, leading to a heap-based buffer
  overflow.
