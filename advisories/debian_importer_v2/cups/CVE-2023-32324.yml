  - CVE-2023-32324
summary: OpenPrinting CUPS is an open source printing system. In versions 2.4.2 and prior, a
  heap buffer overflow vulnerability would allow a remote attacker to launch a denial of service
  (DoS) attack. A buffer overflow vulnerability in the function `format_log_line` could allow
  remote attackers to cause a DoS on the affected system. Exploitation of the vulnerability
  can be triggered when the configuration file `cupsd.conf` sets the value of `loglevel `to
  `DEBUG`. No known patches or workarounds exist at time of publication.
