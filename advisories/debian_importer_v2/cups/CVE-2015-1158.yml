aliases:
  - CVE-2015-1158
summary: The add_job function in scheduler/ipp.c in cupsd in CUPS before 2.0.3 performs incorrect
  free operations for multiple-value job-originating-host-name attributes, which allows remote
  attackers to trigger data corruption for reference-counted strings via a crafted (1) IPP_CREATE_JOB
  or (2) IPP_PRINT_JOB request, as demonstrated by replacing the configuration file and consequently
  executing arbitrary code.
