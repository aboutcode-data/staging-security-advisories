  - CVE-2010-1748
summary: The cgi_initialize_string function in cgi-bin/var.c in the web interface in CUPS before
  1.4.4, as used on Apple Mac OS X 10.5.8, Mac OS X 10.6 before 10.6.4, and other platforms,
  does not properly handle parameter values containing a % (percent) character without two subsequent
  hex characters, which allows context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information from
  cupsd process memory via a crafted request, as demonstrated by the (1) /admin?OP=redirect&URL=%
  and (2) /admin?URL=/admin/&OP=% URIs.
