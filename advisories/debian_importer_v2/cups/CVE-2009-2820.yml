aliases:
  - CVE-2009-2820
summary: The web interface in CUPS before 1.4.2, as used on Apple Mac OS X before 10.6.2 and
  other platforms, does not properly handle (1) HTTP headers and (2) HTML templates, which allows
  remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and HTTP response splitting
  attacks via vectors related to (a) the product's web interface, (b) the configuration of the
  print system, and (c) the titles of printed jobs, as demonstrated by an XSS attack that uses
  the kerberos parameter to the admin program, and leverages attribute injection and HTTP Parameter
  Pollution (HPP) issues.
