summary: 'OpenPrinting CUPS is a standards-based, open source printing system for Linux and
  other Unix-like operating systems. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 2.4.6, CUPS
  logs data of free memory to the logging service AFTER the connection has been closed, when
  it should have logged the data right before. This is a use-after-free bug that impacts the
  entire cupsd process.  The exact cause of this issue is the function `httpClose(con->http)`
  being called in `scheduler/client.c`. The problem is that httpClose always, provided its argument
  is not null, frees the pointer at the end of the call, only for cupsdLogClient to pass the
  pointer to httpGetHostname. This issue happens in function `cupsdAcceptClient` if LogLevel
  is warn or higher and in two scenarios: there is a double-lookup for the IP Address (HostNameLookups
  Double is set in `cupsd.conf`) which fails to resolve, or if CUPS is compiled with TCP wrappers
  and the connection is refused by rules from `/etc/hosts.allow` and `/etc/hosts.deny`.  Version
  2.4.6 has a patch for this issue.'
