  - CVE-2025-58364
summary: OpenPrinting CUPS is an open source printing system for Linux and other Unix-like operating
  systems. In versions 2.4.12 and earlier, an unsafe deserialization and validation of printer
  attributes causes null dereference in the libcups library. This is a remote DoS vulnerability
  available in local subnet in default configurations. It can cause the cups & cups-browsed
  to crash, on all the machines in local network who are listening for printers (so by default
  for all regular linux machines). On systems where the vulnerability CVE-2024-47176 (cups-filters
  1.x/cups-browsed 2.x vulnerability) was not fixed, and the firewall on the machine does not
  reject incoming communication to IPP port, and the machine is set to be available to public
  internet, attack vector "Network" is possible. The current versions of CUPS and cups-browsed
  projects have the attack vector "Adjacent" in their default configurations. Version 2.4.13
  contains a patch for CVE-2025-58364.
