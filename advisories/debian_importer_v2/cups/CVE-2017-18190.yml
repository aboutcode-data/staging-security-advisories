  - CVE-2017-18190
summary: A localhost.localdomain whitelist entry in valid_host() in scheduler/client.c in CUPS
  before 2.2.2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary IPP commands by sending POST requests
  to the CUPS daemon in conjunction with DNS rebinding. The localhost.localdomain name is often
  resolved via a DNS server (neither the OS nor the web browser is responsible for ensuring
  that localhost.localdomain is 127.0.0.1).
