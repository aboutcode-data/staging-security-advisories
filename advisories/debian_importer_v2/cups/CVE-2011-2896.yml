aliases:
  - CVE-2011-2896
summary: The LZW decompressor in the LWZReadByte function in giftoppm.c in the David Koblas
  GIF decoder in PBMPLUS, as used in the gif_read_lzw function in filter/image-gif.c in CUPS
  before 1.4.7, the LZWReadByte function in plug-ins/common/file-gif-load.c in GIMP 2.6.11 and
  earlier, the LZWReadByte function in img/gifread.c in XPCE in SWI-Prolog 5.10.4 and earlier,
  and other products, does not properly handle code words that are absent from the decompression
  table when encountered, which allows remote attackers to trigger an infinite loop or a heap-based
  buffer overflow, and possibly execute arbitrary code, via a crafted compressed stream, a related
  issue to CVE-2006-1168 and CVE-2011-2895.
