  - CVE-2019-11730
summary: 'A vulnerability exists where if a user opens a locally saved HTML file, this file
  can use file: URIs to access other files in the same directory or sub-directories if the names
  are known or guessed. The Fetch API can then be used to read the contents of any files stored
  in these directories and they may uploaded to a server. It was demonstrated that in combination
  with a popular Android messaging app, if a malicious HTML attachment is sent to a user and
  they opened that attachment in Firefox, due to that app''s predictable pattern for locally-saved
  file names, it is possible to read attachments the victim received from other correspondents.
  This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 60.8, Firefox < 68, and Thunderbird < 60.8.'
