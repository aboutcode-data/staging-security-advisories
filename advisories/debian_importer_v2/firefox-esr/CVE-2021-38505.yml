  - CVE-2021-38505
summary: Microsoft introduced a new feature in Windows 10 known as Cloud Clipboard which, if
  enabled, will record data copied to the clipboard to the cloud, and make it available on other
  computers in certain scenarios. Applications that wish to prevent copied data from being recorded
  in Cloud History must use specific clipboard formats; and Firefox before versions 94 and ESR
  91.3 did not implement them. This could have caused sensitive data to be recorded to a user's
  Microsoft account. *This bug only affects Firefox for Windows 10+ with Cloud Clipboard enabled.
  Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird
  < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.
