  - CVE-2021-38507
summary: The Opportunistic Encryption feature of HTTP2 (RFC 8164) allows a connection to be
  transparently upgraded to TLS while retaining the visual properties of an HTTP connection,
  including being same-origin with unencrypted connections on port 80. However, if a second
  encrypted port on the same IP address (e.g. port 8443) did not opt-in to opportunistic encryption;
  a network attacker could forward a connection from the browser to port 443 to port 8443, causing
  the browser to treat the content of port 8443 as same-origin with HTTP. This was resolved
  by disabling the Opportunistic Encryption feature, which had low usage. This vulnerability
  affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.
