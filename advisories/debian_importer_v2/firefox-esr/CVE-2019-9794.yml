summary: 'A vulnerability was discovered where specific command line arguments are not properly
  discarded during Firefox invocation as a shell handler for URLs. This could be used to retrieve
  and execute files whose location is supplied through these command line arguments if Firefox
  is configured as the default URI handler for a given URI scheme in third party applications
  and these applications insufficiently sanitize URL data. *Note: This issue only affects Windows
  operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird
  < 60.6, Firefox ESR < 60.6, and Firefox < 66.'
