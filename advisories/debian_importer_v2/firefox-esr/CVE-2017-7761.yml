summary: 'The Mozilla Maintenance Service "helper.exe" application creates a temporary directory
  writable by non-privileged users. When this is combined with creation of a junction (a form
  of symbolic link), protected files in the target directory of the junction can be deleted

  local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected. This
  vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 52.2 and Firefox < 54.'
