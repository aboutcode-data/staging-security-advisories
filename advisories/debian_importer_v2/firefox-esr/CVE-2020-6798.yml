  - CVE-2020-6798
summary: If a template tag was used in a select tag, the parser could be confused and allow
  JavaScript parsing and execution when it should not be allowed. A site that relied on the
  browser behaving correctly could suffer a cross-site scripting vulnerability as a result.
  In general, this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because
  scripting is disabled when reading mail, but is potentially a risk in browser or browser-like
  contexts. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.5, Firefox < 73, and Firefox < ESR68.5.
