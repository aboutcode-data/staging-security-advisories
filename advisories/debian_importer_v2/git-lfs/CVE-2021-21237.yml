  - CVE-2021-21237
summary: Git LFS is a command line extension for managing large files with Git. On Windows,
  if Git LFS operates on a malicious repository with a git.bat or git.exe file in the current
  directory, that program would be executed, permitting the attacker to execute arbitrary code.
  This does not affect Unix systems. This is the result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-27955.
  This issue occurs because on Windows, Go includes (and prefers) the current directory when
  the name of a command run does not contain a directory separator. Other than avoiding untrusted
  repositories or using a different operating system, there is no workaround. This is fixed
  in v2.13.2.
