  - CVE-2025-0411
summary: 7-Zip Mark-of-the-Web Bypass Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers
  to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web protection mechanism on affected installations of 7-Zip. User
  interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
  page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of archived files.
  When extracting files from a crafted archive that bears the Mark-of-the-Web, 7-Zip does not
  propagate the Mark-of-the-Web to the extracted files. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability
  to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Was ZDI-CAN-25456.
