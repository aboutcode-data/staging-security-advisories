  - CVE-2020-11078
summary: In httplib2 before version 0.18.0, an attacker controlling unescaped part of uri for
  `httplib2.Http.request()` could change request headers and body, send additional hidden requests
  to same server. This vulnerability impacts software that uses httplib2 with uri constructed
  by string concatenation, as opposed to proper urllib building with escaping. This has been
  fixed in 0.18.0.
