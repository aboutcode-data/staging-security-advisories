  - CVE-2019-20454
summary: An out-of-bounds read was discovered in PCRE before 10.34 when the pattern \X is JIT
  compiled and used to match specially crafted subjects in non-UTF mode. Applications that use
  PCRE to parse untrusted input may be vulnerable to this flaw, which would allow an attacker
  to crash the application. The flaw occurs in do_extuni_no_utf in pcre2_jit_compile.c.
