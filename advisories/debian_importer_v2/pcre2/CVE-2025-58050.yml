  - CVE-2025-58050
summary: The PCRE2 library is a set of C functions that implement regular expression pattern
  matching. In version 10.45, a heap-buffer-overflow read vulnerability exists in the PCRE2
  regular expression matching engine, specifically within the handling of the (*scs:...) (Scan
  SubString) verb when combined with (*ACCEPT) in src/pcre2_match.c. This vulnerability may
  potentially lead to information disclosure if the out-of-bounds data read during the memcmp
  affects the final match result in a way observable by the attacker. This issue has been resolved
  in version 10.46.
