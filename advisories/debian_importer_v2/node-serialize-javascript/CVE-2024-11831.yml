aliases:
  - CVE-2024-11831
summary: A flaw was found in npm-serialize-javascript. The vulnerability occurs because the
  serialize-javascript module does not properly sanitize certain inputs, such as regex or other
  JavaScript object types, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code. This code could be
  executed when deserialized by a web browser, causing Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This
  issue is critical in environments where serialized data is sent to web clients, potentially
  compromising the security of the website or web application using this package.
