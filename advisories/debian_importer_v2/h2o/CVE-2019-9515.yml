  - CVE-2019-9515
summary: Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a settings flood, potentially leading
  to a denial of service. The attacker sends a stream of SETTINGS frames to the peer. Since
  the RFC requires that the peer reply with one acknowledgement per SETTINGS frame, an empty
  SETTINGS frame is almost equivalent in behavior to a ping. Depending on how efficiently this
  data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.
