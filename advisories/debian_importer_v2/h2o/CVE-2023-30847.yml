  - CVE-2023-30847
summary: H2O is an HTTP server. In versions 2.3.0-beta2 and prior, when the reverse proxy handler
  tries to processes a certain type of invalid HTTP request, it tries to build an upstream URL
  by reading from uninitialized pointer. This behavior can lead to crashes or leak of information
  to back end HTTP servers. Pull request  number 3229 fixes the issue. The pull request has
  been merged to the `master` branch in commit f010336. Users should upgrade to commit f010336
  or later.
