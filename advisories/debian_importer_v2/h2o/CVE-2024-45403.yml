  - CVE-2024-45403
summary: h2o is an HTTP server with support for HTTP/1.x, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. When h2o is configured
  as a reverse proxy and HTTP/3 requests are cancelled by the client, h2o might crash due to
  an assertion failure. The crash can be exploited by an attacker to mount a Denial-of-Service
  attack. By default, the h2o standalone server automatically restarts, minimizing the impact.
  However, HTTP requests that were served concurrently will still be disrupted. The vulnerability
  has been addressed in commit 1ed32b2. Users may disable the use of HTTP/3 to mitigate the
  issue.
