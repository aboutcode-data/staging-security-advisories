  - CVE-2019-9514
summary: Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a reset flood, potentially leading to
  a denial of service. The attacker opens a number of streams and sends an invalid request over
  each stream that should solicit a stream of RST_STREAM frames from the peer. Depending on
  how the peer queues the RST_STREAM frames, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both.
