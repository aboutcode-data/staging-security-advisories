  - CVE-2019-9512
summary: Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to ping floods, potentially leading to a
  denial of service. The attacker sends continual pings to an HTTP/2 peer, causing the peer
  to build an internal queue of responses. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued,
  this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.
