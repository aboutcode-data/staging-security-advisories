summary: 'Jackson-core contains core low-level incremental ("streaming") parser and generator
  abstractions used by Jackson Data Processor. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version
  2.13.0, a flaw in jackson-core''s `JsonLocation._appendSourceDesc` method allows up to 500
  bytes of unintended memory content to be included in exception messages. When parsing JSON
  from a byte array with an offset and length, the exception message incorrectly reads from
  the beginning of the array instead of the logical payload start. This results in possible
  information disclosure in systems using pooled or reused buffers, like Netty or Vert.x. This
  issue was silently fixed in jackson-core version 2.13.0, released on September 30, 2021, via
  PR #652. All users should upgrade to version 2.13.0 or later. If upgrading is not immediately
  possible, applications can mitigate the issue by disabling exception message exposure to clients
  to avoid returning parsing exception messages in HTTP responses and/or disabling source inclusion
  in exceptions to prevent Jackson from embedding any source content in exception messages,
  avoiding leakage.'
