  - CVE-2023-34104
summary: 'fast-xml-parser is an open source, pure javascript xml parser. fast-xml-parser allows
  special characters in entity names, which are not escaped or sanitized. Since the entity name
  is used for creating a regex for searching and replacing entities in the XML body, an attacker
  can abuse it for denial of service (DoS) attacks. By crafting an entity name that results
  in an intentionally bad performing regex and utilizing it in the entity replacement step of
  the parser, this can cause the parser to stall for an indefinite amount of time. This problem
  has been resolved in v4.2.4. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should
  avoid using DOCTYPE parsing by setting the `processEntities: false` option.'
