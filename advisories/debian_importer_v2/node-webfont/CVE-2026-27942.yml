  - CVE-2026-27942
summary: fast-xml-parser allows users to validate XML, parse XML to JS object, or build XML
  from JS object without C/C++ based libraries and no callback. Prior to version 5.3.8, the
  application crashes with stack overflow when user use XML builder with `preserveOrder:true`.
  Version 5.3.8 fixes the issue. As a workaround, use XML builder with `preserveOrder:false`
  or check the input data before passing to builder.
