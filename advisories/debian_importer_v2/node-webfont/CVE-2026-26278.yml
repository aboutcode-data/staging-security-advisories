  - CVE-2026-26278
summary: 'fast-xml-parser allows users to validate XML, parse XML to JS object, or build XML
  from JS object without C/C++ based libraries and no callback. In versions 4.1.3 through 5.3.5,
  the XML parser can be forced to do an unlimited amount of entity expansion. With a very small
  XML input, it’s possible to make the parser spend seconds or even minutes processing a single
  request, effectively freezing the application. Version 5.3.6 fixes the issue. As a workaround,
  avoid using DOCTYPE parsing by `processEntities: false` option.'
