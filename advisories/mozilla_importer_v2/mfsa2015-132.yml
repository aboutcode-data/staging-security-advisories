summary: |
  Mozilla developer Ehsan Akhgari reported a mechanism through which a
  web worker could be used
  to bypass secure requirements for WebSockets when workers are used to create WebSockets.
  This allows for the bypassing of mixed content WebSocket policy.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
