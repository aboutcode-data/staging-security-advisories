summary: "Security researcher Xiaofeng Zheng of the Blue Lotus Team at\nTsinghua University\
  \ reported reported that a Web Proxy returning a 407 Proxy\nAuthentication response with a\
  \ Set-Cookie header could inject\ncookies into the originally requested domain. This could\
  \ be used for\nsession-fixation attacks. This attack only allows cookies to be written but\
  \ does\nnot allow them to be read. \n\nIn general this flaw cannot be exploited through email\
  \ in the\nThunderbird product, but is potentially a risk in browser or browser-like\ncontexts."
