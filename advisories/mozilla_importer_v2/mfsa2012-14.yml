summary: |
  Security researcher Atte Kettunen from OUSPG found two
  issues with Firefox's handling of SVG using the Address Sanitizer tool. The
  first issue, critically rated, is a use-after-free in SVG animation that could
  potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. The second issue is rated moderate
  and is an out of bounds read in SVG Filters. This could potentially incorporate
  data from the user's memory, making it accessible to the page content.
