  - CVE-2022-26387
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  When installing an add-on, Thunderbird verified the signature before prompting the user; but while the user was confirming the prompt, the underlying add-on file could have been modified and Thunderbird would not have noticed.
