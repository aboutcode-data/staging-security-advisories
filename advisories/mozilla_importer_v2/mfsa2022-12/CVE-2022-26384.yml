  - CVE-2022-26384
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  If an attacker could control the contents of an iframe sandboxed with allow-popups but not allow-scripts, they were able to craft a link that, when clicked, would lead to JavaScript execution in violation of the sandbox.
