  - CVE-2022-26386
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Previously Thunderbird for macOS and Linux would download temporary files to a user-specific directory in /tmp, but this behavior was changed to download them to /tmp where they could be affected by other local users.  This behavior was reverted to the original, user-specific directory. *This bug only affects Thunderbird for macOS and Linux. Other operating systems are unaffected.*
