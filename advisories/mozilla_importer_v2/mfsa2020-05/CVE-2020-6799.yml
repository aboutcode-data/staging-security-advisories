  - CVE-2020-6799
summary: 'Command line arguments could have been injected during Firefox invocation as a shell
  handler for certain unsupported file types. This required Firefox to be configured as the
  default handler for a given file type and for a file downloaded to be opened in a third party
  application that insufficiently sanitized URL data. In that situation, clicking a link in
  the third party application could have been used to retrieve and execute files whose location
  was supplied through command line arguments. *Note: This issue only affects Windows operating
  systems and when Firefox is configured as the default handler for non-default filetypes. Other
  operating systems are unaffected.*'
