summary: |
  An anonymous security researcher reported via TippingPoint's Zero
  Day Initiative that insufficient checks were being performed to test
  whether the Flash module was properly dynamically unloaded.
  The researcher demonstrated that a SWF file which dynamically unloads
  itself from an outside JavaScript function can cause the browser to access
  a memory address no longer mapped to the Flash module, resulting in a
  crash.  This crash could be used by an attacker to run arbitrary code
  on a victim's computer.
  Firefox 3 is not affected by this issue.
