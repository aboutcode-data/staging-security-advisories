summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported that
  a form input control's type could be changed during the restoration of a
  closed tab. An attacker could set an input control's text value to the
  path of a local file whose location was known to the attacker. If the tab
  was then closed and the victim persuaded to re-open it, upon restoring the
  tab the attacker could use this vulnerability to change the input type to
  file. Scripts in the page could then automatically submit
  the form and steal the contents of the user's local file.
