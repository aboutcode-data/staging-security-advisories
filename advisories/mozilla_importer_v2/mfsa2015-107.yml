summary: |
  Security researcher Francisco Alonso of the NowSecure Research Team
  used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover an out-of-bounds read issue during 2D canvas
  rendering. This was due to an issue in the cairo graphics library when surfaces are
  created with 32-bit color depth but displayed on a 16-bit color depth system, which is
  unsupported. This allows an attacker to read an amount of random memory following the heap
  for the 16-bit surface leading to information disclosure.

  This issue is specific to Linux in certain configurations and does not
  affect Windows or OS X systems.
