summary: |
  Google security researcher Robert Swiecki reported
  that functions used by the Gopher parser to convert text to HTML tags
  could be exploited to turn text into executable JavaScript.  If an
  attacker could create a file or directory on a Gopher server with the
  encoded script as part of its name the script would then run in a
  victim's browser within the context of the site.
