summary: |
  Ronen Zilberman and Michal Zalewski both reported that it was possible to exploit a timing issue to inject content into about:blank frames in a page.

  When opening a window from a script, it is possible to spoof the content of the
  newly opened window's frames within a short time frame, while the window is
  loading.
