summary: |
  Security researcher Frans Rosén reported that URLs with certain
  escaped characters in hostnames are parsed incorrectly. This leads to parsing being
  abandoned when an effected escaped character is encountered followed by a navigation to
  the previously parsed version of the URL. When combined with a site allowing for
  navigation redirection that allows for escaped characters, this could lead to potential
  extraction of site specific tokens.
