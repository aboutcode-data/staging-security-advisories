summary: |
  Marius Schilder of Google Security reported that
  when a XMLHttpRequest is made to a same-origin resource
  which 302 redirects to a resource in a different domain, the response
  from the cross-domain resource is readable by the site issuing the
  XHR.  Cookies marked HttpOnly were not readable, but
  other potentially sensitive data could be revealed in the XHR response
  including URL parameters and content in the response body.
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and
  could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is
  not the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
  JavaScript in mail.
