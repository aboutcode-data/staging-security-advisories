summary: |
  Mozilla developer Eric Faust reported that during JavaScript compilation GetElementIC typed array stubs can be generated outside observed typesets. This could lead to unpredictable behavior with a potential security impact.

  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
