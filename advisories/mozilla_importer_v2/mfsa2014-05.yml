summary: |
  Security researcher Jordan Milne reported an information
  leak where document.caretPositionFromPoint and
  document.elementFromPoint functions could be used on a cross-origin
  iframe to gain information on the iframe's DOM and other attributes through a
  timing attack, violating same-origin policy.


  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Seamonkey product because scripting is disabled in mail, but is potentially a
  risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
