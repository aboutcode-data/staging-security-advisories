aliases:
  - CVE-2025-26696
summary: |
  *Many of these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Certain crafted MIME email messages that claimed to contain an encrypted OpenPGP message, which instead contained an OpenPGP signed message, were wrongly shown as being encrypted.
