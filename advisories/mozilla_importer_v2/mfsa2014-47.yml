summary: |
  Mozilla developer Boris Zbarsky discovered that the debugger
  will work with some objects while bypassing XrayWrappers. This could lead to
  privilege escalation if the victim used the debugger to interact with a
  malicious page.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but is
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
