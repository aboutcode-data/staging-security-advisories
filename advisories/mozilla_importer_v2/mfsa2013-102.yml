summary: |
  Security researcher Abhishek Arya (Inferno) of the Google
  Chrome Security Team used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a
  user-after-free when interacting with HTML document templates. This leads to a
  potentially exploitable crash.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but is
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
