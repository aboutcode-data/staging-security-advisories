summary: |
  Security researcher Aki Helin used the Address Sanitizer
  tool to discover an out-of-bounds read during playback of a malformed MP3 format
  audio file which switches sample formats. This could trigger a potentially
  exploitable crash or the reading of out-of-bounds memory content in some
  circumstances.
