summary: |
  Mozilla community member Federico Lanusse reported a
  mechanism where a web worker can violate same-origin policy and bypass
  cross-origin checks through XMLHttpRequest. This could allow for cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attacks by web workers.

  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but are
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
