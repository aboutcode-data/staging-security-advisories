summary: |
  Security researcher Gregory Fleischer reported
  that when a Java LiveConnect script was loaded via
  a data: URL which redirects via a meta refresh, then the
  resulting plugin object was created with the wrong security principal
  and thus received elevated privileges such as the abilities to read
  local files, launch processes, and create network connections.
