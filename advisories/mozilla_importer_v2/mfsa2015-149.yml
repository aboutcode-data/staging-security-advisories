summary: |
  Security researcher Tsubasa Iinuma reported a mechanism to violate
  same-origin policy to content using data: and view-source: URIs
  to confuse protections and bypass restrictions. This resulted in the ability to read data from cross-site URLs and local files.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
