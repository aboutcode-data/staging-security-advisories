summary: |
  Georgi Guninski demonstrated that even with JavaScript disabled in
  mail (the default) an attacker can still execute JavaScript when a
  mail message is viewed, replied to, or forwarded by putting the script
  in a remote XBL file loaded by the message. The executed script could
  be used to alter or change the appearance of the message, and can
  act as a "mail-tap" to spy on the contents added to a reply or forward.
  For example, the attacker could make a provocative offer to
  a rival business and then watch the internal debate as it was forwarded
  and replied to.
  The victim would have to have chosen to "Load Images"--either for the
  individual message or as the default setting -- in order for the XBL file
  to be loaded and the JavaScript executed.
