summary: |
  Security researcher Nils discovered a mechanism to break out
  of the Gecko Media
  Plugin (GMP) sandbox on Windows systems. The GMP sandbox is currently only
  used to host h.264 video playback using the OpenH264 plugin but is being
  developed to host other other media plugins. This bug would allow an attacker to
  escape or bypass the GMP sandbox if another exploitable bug is found in a GMP
  media plugin which allowed them to compromise the GMP process.

  This bugs only affects Windows systems. OS X and Linux systems
  are not affected by it.
