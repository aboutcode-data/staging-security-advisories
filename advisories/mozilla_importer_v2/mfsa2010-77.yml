summary: |
  Security researcher wushi of team509 reported that
  when a XUL tree had an HTML <div> element nested inside a
  <treechildren> element then code attempting to display content
  in the XUL tree would incorrectly treat the <div> element as a
  parent node to tree content underneath it resulting in incorrect
  indexes being calculated for the child content.  These incorrect
  indexes were used in subsequent array operations which resulted in
  writing data past the end of an allocated buffer.  An attacker could
  use this issue to crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on
  their machine.
