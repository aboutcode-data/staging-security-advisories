summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported that
  through an interaction of frames and browser history it was possible to make the
  browser believe attacker-supplied content came from the location of a previous
  page in browser history. This allows for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by
  loading scripts from a misrepresented malicious site through relative locations
  and the potential access of stored credentials of a spoofed site.
  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
