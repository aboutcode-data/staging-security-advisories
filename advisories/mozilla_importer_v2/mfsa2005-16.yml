summary: |
  Michael Krax demonstrates that the download dialog and security dialogs
  can be spoofed by partially covering them with an overlapping window.
  Some users may not notice the OS window border and browser statusbar
  bisecting what appears to be a single dialog, and be convinced by the
  spoofing text of the top-most window to click on the "Allow" or "Open"
  button of the window below.
  If the security dialog button is clicked signed scripts could perform
  any action on the users machine.
  If the download button is clicked a file could be downloaded to the
  default download location. If the target file MIME type is one handled
  by a helper app clicking the button could launch that helper app. If
  there's a known exploit in a popular or default helper app then opening
  the attackers file in that app could take advantage of that exploit.
