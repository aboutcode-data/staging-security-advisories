summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported
  that the same-origin check in
  nsXMLHttpRequest::NotifyEventListeners() could be
  bypassed. This vulnerability could be used to execute JavaScript in
  the context of a different website.
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and
  could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is
  not the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
  JavaScript in mail.
