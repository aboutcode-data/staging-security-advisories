summary: |
  A child frame can call top.focus() even if the framing page comes from a different
  origin and has overridden the focus() routine. The call is made in the context
  of the child frame. The attacker would look for a target site with a framed
  page that makes this call but doesn't verify that its parent comes from the same
  site. The attacker could steal cookies and passwords from the framed page, or
  take actions on behalf of a signed-in user. This attack would work only against
  sites that use frames in this manner.
