summary: |
  Security researcher Gregory Fleischer reported
  that the exception messages generated by
  Mozilla's GeckoActiveXObject differ based on whether or
  not the requested COM object's ProgID is present in the system
  registry.  A malicious site could use this vulnerability to enumerate
  a list of COM objects installed on a user's system and create a
  profile to track the user across browsing sessions.
