summary: |
  Security researcher regenrecht reported via
  TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that there was a remaining dangling
  pointer issue leftover from the fix
  to CVE-2010-2753.
  Under certain circumstances one of the pointers held by a XUL tree
  selection could be freed and then later reused, potentially resulting
  in the execution of attacker-controlled memory.
