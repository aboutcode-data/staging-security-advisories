  - CVE-2023-23603
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Regular expressions used to filter out forbidden properties and values from style directives in calls to console.log weren't accounting for external URLs. Data could then be potentially exfiltrated from the browser.
