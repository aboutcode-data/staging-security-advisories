summary: |
  Security researcher Armin Ebert reported that a user
  readable file in a known local path could be uploaded to a malicious site. This
  was done by manipulating the autocomplete feature in a form and user interaction
  with it. While the local file is not visibly uploaded through the form, its
  contents are made available through the Document Object Model (DOM) to script
  content on the attacking page, leading to information disclosure.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
