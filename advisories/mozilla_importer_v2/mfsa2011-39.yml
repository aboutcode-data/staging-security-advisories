summary: "Ian Graham of Citrix Online reported that when multiple\nLocation headers were present\
  \ in a redirect response \nMozilla behavior differed from other browsers: Mozilla would use\
  \ the second\nLocation header while Chrome and Internet Explorer would use\nthe first. Two\
  \ copies of this header with different values could be a symptom\nof a CRLF injection attack\
  \ against a vulnerable server. Most commonly it is\nthe Location header itself that is vulnerable\
  \ to the response\nsplitting and therefore the copy preferred by Mozilla is more likely to\
  \ be\nthe malicious one. It is possible, however, that the first copy was the\ninjected one\
  \ depending on the nature of the server vulnerability.\n\nThe Mozilla browser engine has been\
  \ changed to treat two copies of this\nheader with different values as an error condition.\
  \ The same has been done\nwith the headers Content-Length and Content-Disposition"
