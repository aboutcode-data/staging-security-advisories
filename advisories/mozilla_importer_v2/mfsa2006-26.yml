summary: |
  As a privacy measure to prevent senders (primarily spammers)
  from tracking when e-mail is read Thunderbird does not load
  remote content referenced from an HTML mail message until a
  user tells it to do so. This normally includes the content of
  frames and CSS files, but CrashFr showed it was possible to
  bypass this restriction through indirection: the direct
  CSS or iframe src is included in-line, with that including
  remote content.
