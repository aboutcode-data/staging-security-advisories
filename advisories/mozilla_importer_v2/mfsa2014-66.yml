summary: "Mozilla developer Boris Zbarsky discovered an issue where\nnetwork-level redirects\
  \ cause an <iframe> sandbox to forget \nits unique origin and behave as if the allow-same-origin\
  \ keyword \nwere applied. This allows the sandboxed content to access other content from \n\
  the same origin without explicit approval. \n\nIn general this flaw cannot be exploited through\
  \ email in the\nThunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk\
  \ in\nbrowser or browser-like contexts."
