summary: |
  Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory safety bugs
  in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
  products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption
  under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
  least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

  Update (March 1, 2011): CVE-2010-3777 was
  fixed in Firefox 3.5.17
