summary: |
  Michal Zalewski reported that it was possible to bypass the same-origin checks and read from cached (wyciwyg) documents.

  It is possible to access wyciwyg:// documents without proper same domain policy
  checks through the use of HTTP 302 redirects.

  This enables the attacker to steal sensitive data displayed on dynamically
  generated pages; perform cache poisoning; and execute own code or display own
  content with URL bar and SSL certificate data of the attacked page (URL
  spoofing++).
