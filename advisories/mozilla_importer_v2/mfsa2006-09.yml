summary: |
  shutdown reported a method of injecting running JavaScript code into
  a page on another site using a modal alert to suspend an event handler
  while a new page is being loaded. This vulnerability allows an attacker
  to steal any confidential information the new page might contain,
  including any passwords and cookies which might allow the attacker
  to log on to that site as the victim.
  shutdown also reported a variant using the two-argument form of eval() that
  did not require a modal dialog and would be much less obtrusive.
  moz_bug_r_a4 reported two variants that bypassed our initial fixes,
  one using "new Script()", the other extending the eval() attack using
  window.__proto__
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
  and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
  the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
  JavaScript in mail.
