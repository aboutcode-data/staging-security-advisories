summary: |
  Security researcher Seb Patane reported stack buffer
  overflows in both the Maintenance Service and the Mozilla Updater when
  unexpectedly long paths were encountered. A local attacker could pass these as
  command-line arguments to the Maintenance Service to crash either program and
  potentially lead to arbitrary code being run with the Administrator privileges
  used by the Maintenance Service and inherited by the Updater.
