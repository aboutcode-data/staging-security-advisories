summary: |
  Security researcher Herre reported a use-after-free
  vulnerability when a Content Policy modifies the Document Object Model to
  remove a DOM object, which is then used afterwards due to an error in microtask
  implementation. This leads to an exploitable crash.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
