summary: |
  Mozilla developers and community members identified and fixed
  several stability bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other
  Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of
  memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that with
  enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
  arbitrary code.
