  - CVE-2021-43528
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Thunderbird unexpectedly enabled JavaScript in the composition area.
  The JavaScript execution context was limited to this area and did not
  receive chrome-level privileges, but could be used as a stepping stone
  to further an attack with other vulnerabilities.
