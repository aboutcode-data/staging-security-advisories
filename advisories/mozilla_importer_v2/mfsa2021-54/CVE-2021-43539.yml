  - CVE-2021-43539
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Failure to correctly record the location of live pointers across wasm instance calls resulted in a GC occurring within the call not tracing those live pointers. This could have led to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash.
