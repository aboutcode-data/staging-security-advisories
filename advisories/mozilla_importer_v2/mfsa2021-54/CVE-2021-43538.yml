  - CVE-2021-43538
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  By misusing a race in our notification code, an attacker could have forcefully hidden the notification for pages that had received full screen and pointer lock access, which could have been used for spoofing attacks.
