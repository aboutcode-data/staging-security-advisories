summary: "Security researcher Cody Crews reported a method to call a\ncontent level constructor\
  \ that allows for this constructor to have chrome\nprivileged access. This affects chrome\
  \ object wrappers (COW) and allows for\nwrite actions on objects when only read actions should\
  \ be allowed. This can lead\nto cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. \n\nIn general these flaws\
  \ cannot be exploited through email in the\nThunderbird product because scripting is disabled,\
  \ but are\npotentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts."
