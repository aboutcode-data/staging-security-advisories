summary: |
  Dropping a javascript: or data: link on a tab executes in the context
  of the site already loaded in the tab. If an attacker could convince a
  user to drag and drop such a link on a particular tab this could be used
  to steal information or credentials associated with the site in that tab.
  If the target tab contained privileged content, such as about:config, the
  dropped javascript link could run arbitrary code on the user's machine.
