summary: |
  Security researcher Sergey Glazunov reported that
  it was possible to access the locationbar property of
  a window object after it had been closed.  Since the
  closed window's memory could have been subsequently
  reused by the system it was possible that an attempt to access
  the locationbar property could result in the execution of
  attacker-controlled memory.
