summary: |
  Mozilla community member Jerry Baker reported a crashing issue found through Thunderbird when downloading messages over a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection. This was caused by a bug in the networking code assuming that secure connections were entirely handled on the socket transport thread when they can occur on a variety of threads. The resulting crash was potentially exploitable.

  While the initial issue was found through Thunderbird, the affected networking library is common to Mozilla code.
