summary: |
  Mozilla security engineer David Keeler reported that when an
  overridable error is encountered, such as those for expired certificates or a
  host name does not match a certificate, pinning checks can be be skipped. This
  would allow for a user to override a pinned certificate when they should not be
  able to do so. This issue does not allow for third parties to cause a
  certificate to be overridden and the user would still have to manually do so.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
