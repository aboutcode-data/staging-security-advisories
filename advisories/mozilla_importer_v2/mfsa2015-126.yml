summary: |
  Mozilla developer Frédéric Wang reported an issue affecting
  accessibility tools on OS X. This occurs when when an accessibility tool requests the
  index of a table row through the NSAccessibilityIndexAttribute value. This
  was caused by an error in how HTML tables are exposed to accessibility tools, which can
  result in a potentially exploitable crash.

  This issue only affects OS X systems and does not affect Windows, Linux,
  or Android installations.
