summary: |
  Mozilla developer Josh Soref of Nokia reported that
  documents failed to call certain security checks when attempting to
  preload images.  Although the image content is not available to the page, it
  is possible to specify protocols that are normally not allowed in a web page
  such as file:. This includes internal schemes implemented by
  add-ons that might perform privileged actions resulting in something like a
  Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack against the add-on. Potential severity
  would depend on the add-ons installed.
