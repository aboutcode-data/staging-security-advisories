summary: |
  Georgi Guninski reports integer overflows in the new
  E4X, SVG, and Canvas features. These lead to memory corruption that
  is potentially exploitable to run arbitrary code.
  These flaws were introduced during Firefox 1.5 and SeaMonkey 1.0
  development and do not affect Firefox 1.0 or the Mozilla Suite 1.7
  Thunderbird 1.5 could be vulnerable if JavaScript is
  enabled in mail. This is not the default setting and we strongly
  discourage users from turning on JavaScript in mail. Thunderbird
  is not vulnerable in its default configuration.
  Update (13 April 2006)
  This flaw has been fixed in Thunderbird 1.5.0.2
