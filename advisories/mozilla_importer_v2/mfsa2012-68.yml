summary: |
  Security researcher vsemozhetbyt reported that when the
  DOMParser is used to parse text/html data in a Firefox extension, linked
  resources within this HTML data will be loaded. If the data being parsed in the
  extension is untrusted, it could lead to information leakage and can
  potentially be combined with other attacks to become exploitable.
