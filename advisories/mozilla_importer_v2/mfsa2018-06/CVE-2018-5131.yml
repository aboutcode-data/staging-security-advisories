  - CVE-2018-5131
summary: Under certain circumstances the fetch() API can return transient local copies of resources
  that were sent with a no-store or no-cache cache header instead of downloading a copy from
  the network as it should. This can result in previously stored, locally cached data of a website
  being accessible to users if they share a common profile while browsing.
