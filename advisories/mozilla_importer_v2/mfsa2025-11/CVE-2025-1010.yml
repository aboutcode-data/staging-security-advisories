summary: |
  *Flaws inherited from the Firefox code base are generally not exploitable through email in Thunderbird, as scripting is disabled when reading mail. However, they may pose a risk in other features that display remote web content.*

  An attacker could have caused a use-after-free via the Custom Highlight API, leading to a potentially exploitable crash.
