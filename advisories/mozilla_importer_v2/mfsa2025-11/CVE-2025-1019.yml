  - CVE-2025-1019
summary: |
  *Flaws inherited from the Firefox code base are generally not exploitable through email in Thunderbird, as scripting is disabled when reading mail. However, they may pose a risk in other features that display remote web content.*

  The z-order of the browser windows could be manipulated to hide the fullscreen notification. This could potentially be leveraged to perform a spoofing attack.
