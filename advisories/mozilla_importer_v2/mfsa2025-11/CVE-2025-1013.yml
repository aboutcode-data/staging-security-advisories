summary: |
  *Flaws inherited from the Firefox code base are generally not exploitable through email in Thunderbird, as scripting is disabled when reading mail. However, they may pose a risk in other features that display remote web content.*

  A race condition could have led to private browsing tabs being opened in normal browsing windows. This could have resulted in a potential privacy leak.
