summary: 'The libtremor library has the same flaw as CVE-2018-5146. This library is used by
  Firefox in place of libvorbis on Android and ARM platforms.*Update: The 52.7.2 source release
  accidentally did not include this patch (the Mozilla-produced 52.7.2 binaries are fine). Anyone
  building 52.7.2 on ARM should use revision 5cd5586a2f48424a9031a3fa4c782954a9df9a52 instead
  of the released source.'
