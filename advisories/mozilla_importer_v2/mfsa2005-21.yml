summary: "If a windows user can be convinced to download a .lnk file \ntwice to the same location\
  \ an attacker can overwrite \n(essentially delete) arbitrary files on the user's machine:\
  \ the file \nreferenced by the first .lnk will be overwritten by the \nsecond download rather\
  \ than replacing the .lnk itself.\nOn some older versions of windows .pif and .url files can\
  \ be used to\naccomplish the same thing.\nIf an attacker knows the user will download twice\
  \ and is able to\nsend different content the second time then attackers could\nreplace the\
  \ targeted file with content of their choosing. The first\n.lnk would point to the target\
  \ file and the second download would\ncontain the compromised version of the target."
