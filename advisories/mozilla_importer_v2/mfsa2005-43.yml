summary: |
  Some security checks intended to prevent script injection were incorrect
  and could be bypassed by wrapping a javascript: url in the
  view-source: pseudo-protocol. Michael Krax demonstrated
  that a variant of his favicon exploit
  could still execute arbitrary code, and the same technique could also
  be used to perform cross-site scripting.
  Georgi Guninski demonstrated the same flaw wrapping javascript: urls
  with the jar: pseudo-protocol.
  L. David Baron discovered a nested variant that defeated checks
  in the script security manager.
