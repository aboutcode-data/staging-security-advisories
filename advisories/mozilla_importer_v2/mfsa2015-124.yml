summary: |
  Security researcher Muneaki Nishimura reported that on Firefox for
  Android, a search engine can be registered and used to launch Firefox through an Android
  intent. When Firefox for Android is launched, the URL can executed with Firefox's
  system privileges if the crash reporter is used. This allows for the reading of local log
  files within Firefox, potentially leaking private information, and the loading of local
  HTML files through file: URIs.

  This issue only affects Firefox for Android on Android 4.4 or earlier. It
  does not affect more recent versions of Android except for causing a non-exploitable
  crash. Firefox on other operating systems is not affected.
