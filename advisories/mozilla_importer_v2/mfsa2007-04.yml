summary: |
  David Eckel reported that browser UI elements--such as the host name
  and security indicators--could be spoofed by using a large, mostly
  transparent, custom cursor and adjusting the CSS3 hotspot property
  so that the visible part of the cursor floated outside the browser
  content area.
  This feature was introduced in Firefox 1.5 and does not affect products
  based on Mozilla 1.7 or earlier such as Firefox 1.0
