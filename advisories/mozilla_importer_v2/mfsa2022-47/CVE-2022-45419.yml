summary: |
  This advisory was updated December 13, 2022 to add CVE-2022-46882 and CVE-2022-46883. Both fixes were included in the original release of Firefox 107, but did not appear in the advisory published at that time.

  If the user added a security exception for an invalid TLS certificate, opened an ongoing TLS connection with a server that used that certificate, and then deleted the exception, Firefox would have kept the connection alive, making it seem like the certificate was still trusted.
