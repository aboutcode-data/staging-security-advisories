summary: |
  This advisory was updated December 13, 2022 to add CVE-2022-46882 and CVE-2022-46883. Both fixes were included in the original release of Firefox 107, but did not appear in the advisory published at that time.

  When a ServiceWorker intercepted a request with FetchEvent, the origin of the request was lost after the ServiceWorker took ownership of it.  This had the effect of negating SameSite cookie protections.  This was addressed in the spec and then in browsers.
