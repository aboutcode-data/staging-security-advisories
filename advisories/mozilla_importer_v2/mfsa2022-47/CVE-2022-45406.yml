summary: |
  This advisory was updated December 13, 2022 to add CVE-2022-46882 and CVE-2022-46883. Both fixes were included in the original release of Firefox 107, but did not appear in the advisory published at that time.

  If an out-of-memory condition occurred when creating a JavaScript global, a JavaScript realm may be deleted while references to it lived on in a BaseShape. This could lead to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash.
