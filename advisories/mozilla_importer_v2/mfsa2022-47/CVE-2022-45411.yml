summary: |
  This advisory was updated December 13, 2022 to add CVE-2022-46882 and CVE-2022-46883. Both fixes were included in the original release of Firefox 107, but did not appear in the advisory published at that time.

  Cross-Site Tracing occurs when a server will echo a request back via the Trace method, allowing an XSS attack to access to authorization headers and cookies inaccessible to JavaScript (such as cookies protected by HTTPOnly).  To mitigate this attack, browsers placed limits on fetch() and XMLHttpRequest; however some webservers have implemented non-standard headers such as X-Http-Method-Override that override the HTTP method, and made this attack possible again.  Firefox has applied the same mitigations to the use of this and similar headers.
