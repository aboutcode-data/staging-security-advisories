summary: |
  Security researcher J23 reported via
  TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that an array class used to store
  CSS values contained an integer overflow vulnerability.  The 16 bit
  integer value used in allocating the size of the array could overflow,
  resulting in too small a memory buffer being created.  When the array
  was later populated with CSS values data would be written past the end
  of the buffer potentially resulting in the execution of
  attacker-controlled memory.
