summary: |
  As part of the Firefox 1.5.0.5 stability and security release, developers
  in the Mozilla community looked for and fixed several crash bugs to
  improve the stability of Mozilla clients. Some of these crashes showed
  evidence of memory corruption that we presume could be exploited to
  run arbitrary code with enough effort.
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
  and would be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
  the default setting and we strongly discourage users from enabling
  JavaScript in mail.
