summary: "When a webpage requires a plugin that is not installed the user can click to\nlaunch\
  \ the Plugin Finder Service (PFS) to find an appropriate plugin. If the\nservice does not\
  \ have an appropriate plugin the EMBED tag is checked for a\nPLUGINSPAGE attribute, and if\
  \ one is found the \nPFS dialog will contain a\n\"manual install\" button that will load the\
  \ PLUGINSPAGE url.\nOmar Khan reported that if the PLUGINSPAGE attribute contains a javascript:\
  \ url\nthen pressing the button could launch arbitrary code capable of stealing local\ndata\
  \ or installing malicious code.\nDoron Rosenberg reported a variant that injects script by\n\
  appending it to a malformed URL of any protocol.\nThe plugin finder in the Mozilla Suite is\
  \ not affected by this issue."
