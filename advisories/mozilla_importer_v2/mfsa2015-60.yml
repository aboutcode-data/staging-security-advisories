summary: |
  Security researcher Jann Horn reported that when Mozilla
  Foundation Security Advisory 2015-25 was fixed in Firefox 37, an error was
  made that caused the fix to not be applied to Firefox 38, effectively causing
  the bug to be unfixed in Firefox 38 (and Firefox ESR38) once it shipped. As
  Armin Ebert reported for that issue, opening hyperlinks on a
  page with the mouse and specific keyboard key combinations could allow a Chrome
  privileged URL to be opened without context restrictions being preserved. This
  could allow for local files or resources from a known location to be opened with
  local privileges, bypassing security protections.
