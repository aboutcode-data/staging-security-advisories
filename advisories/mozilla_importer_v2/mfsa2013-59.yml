summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported that
  XrayWrappers can be bypassed to call content-defined toString and valueOf methods through DefaultValue. This can lead to unexpected behavior when privileged code acts on the incorrect values.
  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
