summary: |
  Security researcher Oriol reported memory corruption when local files
  are modified (by either the user or another program) at the same time being read using the
  FileReader API. This flaw requires that input be taken from a local file in
  order to be triggered and cannot be triggered by web content. This results in a
  potentially exploitable crash when triggered.
