  - CVE-2018-12402
summary: The internal WebBrowserPersist code does not use correct origin context for a resource
  being saved. This manifests when sub-resources are loaded as part of "Save Page As..." functionality.
  For example, a malicious page could recover a visitor's Windows username and NTLM hash by
  including resources otherwise unreachable to the malicious page, if they can convince the
  visitor to save the complete web page. Similarly, SameSite cookies are sent on cross-origin
  requests when the "Save Page As..." menu item is selected to save a page, which can result
  in saving the wrong version of resources based on those cookies.
