summary: 'During HTTP Live Stream playback on Firefox for Android, audio data can be accessed
  across origins in violation of security policies. Because the problem is in the underlying
  Android service, this issue is addressed by treating all HLS streams as cross-origin and opaque
  to access. *Note: this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Desktop versions of Firefox
  are unaffected.*'
