summary: "Security researcher Jordi Chancel reported that on Firefox for\nAndroid, when a URL\
  \ is pasted with an unknown protocol, such as secure: or\nhttpz:, the pasted URL is shown\
  \ in the addressbar but no navigation occurs.\nOther addressbar attributes present before\
  \ this pasted URL is entered will continue to be\nrendered. This could lead to potential spoofing\
  \ by a malicious site. \n \nThis issue only affects Firefox for Android and does not affect\
  \ Firefox on\nOS X, Linux, or Windows operating systems."
