  - CVE-2019-11712
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  POST requests made by NPAPI plugins, such as Flash, that receive a status 308 redirect response can bypass CORS requirements. This can allow an attacker to perform Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
