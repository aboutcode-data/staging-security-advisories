aliases:
  - CVE-2019-11709
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Mozilla developers and community members Andreea Pavel, Christian Holler, Honza Bambas, Jason Kratzer, and Jeff Gilbert reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 67, Firefox ESR 60.7, and Thunderbird 60.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
