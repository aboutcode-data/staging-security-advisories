summary: "Security researchers Yossef Oren, Vasileios P. Kemerlis, Simha Sethumadhavan,\nAngelos\
  \ D. Keromytis of Columbia University's Network Security Lab reported a\nmethod of using the\
  \ High Resolution Time API for side channel attacks. This attack uses\nJavaScript loaded through\
  \ a hostile web page to track access to the last-level\ncache over a period of time as a user\
  \ engages in other browser activity. This attack takes\nadvantage of the performance.now()\
  \ API's use of single nanosecond resolution\nfor timing. \nSecurity researcher Amit Klein\
  \ independently reported use of the\nperformance.now() API on Windows systems to extract the\
  \ Windows counter\nfrequency as an avenue for side channel attacks. \n\nBoth of these flaws\
  \ allow for the disclosure of private information, user\nfingerprinting, and data leakage.\
  \ They have been addressed by reducing the resolution of\nthe performance.now() API to 5 microseconds\
  \ to remove the precision in\nresolution available to attackers.\n\nThe Windows counter frequency\
  \ issue does not affect Linux or OS X systems."
