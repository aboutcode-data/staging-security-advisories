summary: |
  Security researchers Yosuke Hasegawa
  and Masatoshi Kimura reported that the x-mac-arabic,
  x-mac-farsi and x-mac-hebrew character encodings are vulnerable to XSS
  attacks due to some characters being converted to angle brackets when
  displayed by the rendering engine.  Sites using these character
  encodings would thus be potentially vulnerable to script injection
  attacks if their script filtering code fails to strip out these
  specific characters.
