summary: |
  Security researcher Atte Kettunen from OUSPG reported
  several heap memory corruption issues found using the Address Sanitizer tool.
  These issues are potentially exploitable, allowing for remote code execution.

  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
