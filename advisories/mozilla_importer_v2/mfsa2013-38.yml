summary: |
  Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski reported a method to use
  browser navigations through history to load an arbitrary website with that
  page's baseURI property pointing to another site instead of the seemingly loaded
  one. The user will continue to see the incorrect site in the addressbar of the
  browser. This allows for a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or the theft of
  data through a phishing attack.

  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
