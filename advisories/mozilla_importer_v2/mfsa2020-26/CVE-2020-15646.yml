  - CVE-2020-15646
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  If an attacker intercepts Thunderbird's initial attempt to perform automatic account setup using the Microsoft Exchange autodiscovery mechanism, and the attacker sends a crafted response, then Thunderbird sends username and password over https to a server controlled by the attacker.
