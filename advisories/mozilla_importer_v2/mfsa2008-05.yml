summary: |
  Gerry Eisenhaur reported the chrome: URI scheme
  improperly allowed directory traversal that could be used to load
  JavaScript, images, and stylesheets from local files in known locations.
  This traversal was possible only when the browser had installed add-ons
  which used "flat" packaging rather than the more popular .jar packaging,
  and the attacker would need to target that specific add-on.
  Mozilla researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported that this
  vulnerability could be used to steal the contents of the browser's
  sessionstore.js file, which contains session cookie data
  and information about currently open web pages.
