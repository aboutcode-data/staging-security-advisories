summary: |
  Mozilla developer Bobby Holley reported that security wrappers filter at the time of property access, but once a function is returned, the caller can use this function without further security checks. This affects cross-origin wrappers, allowing for write actions on objects when only read actions should be properly allowed. This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
