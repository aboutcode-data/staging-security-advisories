summary: |
  Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski discovered an issue
  where sites that have been given notification permissions by a user can bypass
  security checks on source components for the Web Notification API. This allows
  for script to be run in a privileged context through notifications, leading to
  arbitrary code execution on these sites.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but is
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
