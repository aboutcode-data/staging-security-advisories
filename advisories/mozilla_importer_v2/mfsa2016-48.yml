summary: |
  Mozilla engineer Mark Goodwin discovered that the Firefox Health
  Report (about:healthreport) accepts certain events from any content document
  present in the remote-report iframe. If there were another vulnerability that allowed the
  injection of web content into the Firefox Health Report iframe, this content could change
  the sharing preferences of a user by firing the appropriate events at it    s containing
  page.
