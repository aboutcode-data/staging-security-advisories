summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported
  that the XPCOM utility XPCVariant::VariantDataToJS
  unwrapped doubly-wrapped objects before returning them to chrome
  callers.  This could result in chrome privileged code calling methods
  on an object which had previously been created or modified by web
  content, potentially executing malicious JavaScript code with chrome
  privileges.
