summary: |
  Security researcher regenrecht reported via
  TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the
  way <option> elements are inserted into a XUL
  tree <optgroup>.  In certain cases, the number of
  references to an <option> element is under-counted so
  that when the element is deleted, a live pointer to its old location
  is kept around and may later be used.  An attacker could potentially
  use these conditions to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
