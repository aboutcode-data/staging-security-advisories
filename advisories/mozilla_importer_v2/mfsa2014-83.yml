summary: |
  Mozilla developers and community identified and fixed several memory safety
  bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products.
  Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
  circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these
  could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
