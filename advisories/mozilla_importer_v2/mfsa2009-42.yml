summary: "IOActive security researcher Dan Kaminsky reported a\nmismatch in the treatment of\
  \ domain names in SSL certificates between SSL\nclients and the Certificate Authorities (CA)\
  \ which issue server certificates.\nIn particular, if a malicious person requested a certificate\
  \ for a host name\nwith an invalid null character in it most CAs would issue the\ncertificate\
  \ if the requester owned the domain specified after the null, while\nmost SSL clients (browsers)\
  \ ignored that part of the name and used the\nunvalidated part in front of the null. This\
  \ made it possible for attackers to\nobtain certificates that would function for any site\
  \ they wished to target.\nThese certificates could be used to intercept and potentially alter\
  \ encrypted\ncommunication between the client and a server such as sensitive bank\naccount\
  \ transactions.\nThis vulnerability was independently reported to us by researcher\nMoxie\
  \ Marlinspike who also noted that since Firefox\nrelies on SSL to protect the integrity of\
  \ security updates this attack\ncould be used to serve malicious updates. \nMozilla would\
  \ like to thank Dan and the Microsoft Vulnerability\nResearch team for coordinating a multiple-vendor\
  \ response to this problem."
