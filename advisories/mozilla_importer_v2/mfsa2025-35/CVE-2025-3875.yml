summary: |
  *Updated June 10, 2025 to remove CVE-2025-3877 which was mistakenly marked as fixed. This vulnerability was fixed in Thunderbird 128.11.1/139.0.2 under the identifier CVE-2025-5986.*

  Thunderbird parses addresses in a way that can allow sender
  spoofing in case the server allows an invalid From address to be
  used. For example, if the From header contains an (invalid) value
  "Spoofed Name  ",
  Thunderbird treats spoofed@example.com as the actual address.
