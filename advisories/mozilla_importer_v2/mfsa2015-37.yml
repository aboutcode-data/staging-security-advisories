summary: "Mozilla developer Christoph Kerschbaumer discovered an issue\nwhile investigating\
  \ Mozilla\nFoundation Security Advisory 2015-03, previously reported by security\nresearcher\
  \ Muneaki Nishimura. This flaw was that a cross-origin\nresource sharing (CORS) request should\
  \ not follow 30x redirections after\npreflight according to the specification. This only affects\n\
  sendBeacon() requests but could allow for a potential Cross-site\nrequest forgery (XSRF) attack\
  \ from malicious websites. \n\nIn general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the\n\
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in\nbrowser or\
  \ browser-like contexts."
