summary: |
  Security researcher Mark Poticha reported an issue where
  incorrect SSL certificate information can be displayed on the addressbar,
  showing the SSL data for a previous site while another has been loaded. This is
  caused by two onLocationChange events being fired out of the expected order,
  leading to the displayed certificate data to not be updated. This can be used
  for phishing attacks by allowing the user to input form or other data on a
  newer, attacking, site while the credentials of an older site appear on the
  addressbar.
