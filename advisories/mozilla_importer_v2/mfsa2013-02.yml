summary: "Security researcher Abhishek Arya (Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team discovered\
  \ a series critically rated of use-after-free, out of bounds read, and buffer overflow issues\
  \ using the Address Sanitizer tool in shipped software. These issues are potentially exploitable,\
  \ allowing for remote code execution. We would also like to thank Abhishek for reporting three\
  \ additional user-after-free and out of bounds read flaws introduced during Firefox development\
  \ that were fixed before general release. \n\nIn general these flaws cannot be exploited through\
  \ email in the\nThunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are\n\
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products."
