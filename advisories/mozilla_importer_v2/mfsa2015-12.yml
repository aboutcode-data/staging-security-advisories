summary: |
  Security researcher Holger Fuhrmannek reported that when the
  Mozilla updater is run directly, the updater will load binary DLL format files
  from the local working directory or from the Windows temporary directories. This
  occurs when it is run without the Mozilla Maintenance Service on Windows
  systems. This allowed for possibly malicious DLL files to execute with elevated
  privileges if a user agrees when a User Account Control (UAC) prompt from
  Windows is displayed.

  This issue is specific to Windows and does not affect Linux or
  OS X systems.
