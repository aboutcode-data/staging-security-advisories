summary: |
  Mozilla developer David Parks discovered while reviewing
  Firefox crash reports that personal data can sometimes be contained in reports
  from OS X systems. This is because these OS X crash reports will contain the
  native key that triggered the crash and this can sometimes contain key press
  information that was being entered when the crash occurred.

  This issue does not affect Linux or Windows installations of
  Firefox.
