summary: |
  Mozilla developer Boris Zbarsky reported that a malicious app could use the AlarmAPI to read the values of cross-origin references, such as an iframe's location object, as part of an alarm's JSON data. This allows a malicious app to bypass same-origin policy.

  Users are only at risk for this issue if a web app has been installed.
