summary: |
  Security researcher Chris Rohlf of Matasano
  Security reported that the implementation of the HTML frameset element
  contained an integer overflow vulnerability.  The code responsible for
  parsing the frameset columns used an 8-byte counter for the column
  numbers, so when a very large number of columns was passed in the
  counter would overflow.  When this counter was subsequently used to
  allocate memory for the frameset, the memory buffer would be too
  small, potentially resulting in a heap buffer overflow and execution
  of attacker-controlled memory.
