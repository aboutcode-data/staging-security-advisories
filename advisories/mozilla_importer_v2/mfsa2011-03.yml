summary: |
  Security researcher regenrecht reported via
  TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that a method used
  by JSON.stringify contained a use-after-free error in
  which a currently in-use pointer was freed and subsequently
  dereferenced.  This could lead to arbitrary code execution if an
  attacker was able to store malicious code in the freed section of
  memory.
  Mozilla developer Igor Bukanov also independently
  discovered and reported this issue two weeks after the initial
  report was received.
