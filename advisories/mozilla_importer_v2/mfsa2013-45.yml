summary: |
  Security researcher Robert Kugler discovered that in some
  instances the Mozilla Maintenance Service on Windows will be vulnerable to some
  previously fixed privilege escalation attacks that allowed for local privilege
  escalation. This was caused by the Mozilla Updater not updating Windows Registry
  entries for the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which fixed the earlier issues
  present if Firefox 12 had been installed. New installations of Firefox after
  version 12 are not affected by this issue. Local file system access is necessary
  in order for this issue to be exploitable and it cannot be triggered through web
  content.
