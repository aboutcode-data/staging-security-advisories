summary: |
  Security researcher Sachin Shinde reported that moving
  certain XBL-backed nodes from a document into the replacement document
  created by document.open() can cause a JavaScript
  compartment mismatch which can often lead to exploitable conditions.

  Starting with Firefox 20 this condition was turned into a run-time
  assertion that would crash the browser in an unexploitable way, and in
  Firefox 24 the underlying cause was fixed.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
