aliases:
  - CVE-2019-17022
summary: When pasting a <style> tag from the clipboard into a rich text editor, the CSS sanitizer
  does not escape < and > characters. Because the resulting string is pasted directly into the
  text node of the element this does not result in a direct injection into the webpage; however,
  if a webpage subsequently copies the node's innerHTML, assigning it to another innerHTML,
  this would result in an XSS vulnerability. Two WYSIWYG editors were identified with this behavior,
  more may exist.
