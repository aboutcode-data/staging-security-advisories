summary: |
  Security researcher Guido Landi discovered that a
  XSL stylesheet could be used to crash the browser during a XSL
  transformation.  An attacker could potentially use this crash to run
  arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
  This vulnerability was also previously reported as a stability
  problem by Ubuntu community member, Andre.  Ubuntu
  community member Michael Rooney reported Andre's
  findings to Mozilla, and Mozilla community member Martin
  helped reduce Andre's original testcase and contributed a patch to fix
  the vulnerability.
