summary: |
  Scripts in XBL controls from web content continued to be run even when
  Javascript was disabled. By itself this causes no harm, but it could be
  combined with most script-based exploits to attack people running
  vulnerable versions who thought disabling javascript would protect them.
  In the Thunderbird and Mozilla Suite mail clients Javascript is disabled by
  default for protection against denial-of-service attacks and worms; this
  vulnerability could be used to bypass that protection.
