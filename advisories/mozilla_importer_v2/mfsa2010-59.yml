summary: |
  Mozilla developer Blake Kaplan reported that the
  wrapper class XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper (SJOW), a security
  wrapper that allows content-defined objects to be safely accessed by
  privileged code, creates scope chains ending in outer objects.  Users
  of SJOWs which expect the scope chain to end on an inner object may be
  handed a chrome privileged object which could be leveraged to run
  arbitrary JavaScript with chrome privileges.
  Michal Zalewski's recent contributions helped to
  identify this architectural weakness.
