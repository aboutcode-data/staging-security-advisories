summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Hashed codes of JavaScript objects are shared between pages. This allows for pointer leaks because an object’s address can be discovered through hash codes, and also allows for data leakage of an object’s content using these hash codes.
