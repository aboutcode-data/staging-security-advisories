summary: |
  Security researcher Ronald Crane reported three vulnerabilities
  affecting released code that were found through code inspection. These include a high
  rated memory safety issue in the ANGLE graphics library, a moderate rated potential wild
  pointer flaw when handling zip files, and a critical rated integer overflow during
  metadata parsing in Mozilla's use of the libstagefright library.
  The first two issues do not all have clear mechanisms to be exploited through web
  content but are vulnerable if a mechanism can be found to trigger them. The libstagefright
  issue could potentially be triggered by a malicious MP4 format video file, allowing for
  arbitrary code execution.
