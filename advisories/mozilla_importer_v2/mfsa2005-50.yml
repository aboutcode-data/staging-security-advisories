summary: |
  When InstallVersion.compareTo() is passed an object rather than a string
  it assumed the object was another InstallVersion without verifying it.
  When passed a different kind of object the browser would generally
  crash with an access violation.
  shutdown has demonstrated that different javascript objects can be
  passed on some OS versions to get control over the instruction pointer.
  We assume this could be developed further to run arbitrary machine code
  if the attacker can get exploit code loaded at a predictable address.
  Update:(2005-12-14) Aviv Raff has posted a proof of concept
  exploit of this flaw that demonstrates execution of attacker-supplied
  code on windows.
