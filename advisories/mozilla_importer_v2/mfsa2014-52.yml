summary: "Security researcher Nils used the Address Sanitizer to\ndiscover a use-after-free\
  \ problem with the SMIL Animation Controller when\ninteracting with and rendering improperly\
  \ formed web content. This causes a\npotentially exploitable crash. \n\nIn general this flaw\
  \ cannot be exploited through email in the\nThunderbird and Seamonky products because scripting\
  \ is disabled, but is \npotentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts."
