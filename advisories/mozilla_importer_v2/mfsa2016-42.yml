summary: |
  Security researcher Looben Yang reported two issues discovered in
  Service Workers using Address Sanitizer.

  The first of these is a use-after-free vulnerability caused by a
  ServiceWorkerInfo object being kept active beyond the life its owning
  registration. When it is later called through this registration, a use-after-free results.

  In the second issue, a race condition leading to a buffer overflow was found in the
  ServiceWorkerManager. This leads to a potentially exploitable crash when
  triggered.
