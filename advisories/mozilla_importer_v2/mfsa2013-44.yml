summary: |
  Security researcher Seb Patane reported an issue with the
  Mozilla Maintenance Service on Windows. This issue allows unprivileged users to
  local privilege escalation through the system privileges used by the service
  when interacting with local malicious software. This allows the user to bypass
  integrity checks leading to local privilege escalation. Local file system access
  is necessary in order for this issue to be exploitable and it cannot be
  triggered through web content.
