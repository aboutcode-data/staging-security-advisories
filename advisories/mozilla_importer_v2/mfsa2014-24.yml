summary: |
  Firefox for Android includes a Crash Reporter which sends crash data to
  Mozilla for analysis. Security researcher Roee Hay reported
  that third party Android applications could launch the crash reporter with their
  own arguments. Normally applications cannot read the private files of another
  application, but this vulnerability allowed a malicious application to specify a
  local file in the Firefox profile and it to its own server leading to
  information disclosure. The crash reporter can also be invoked in a manner
  causing an immediate crash of Firefox, leading to a potential denial of service
  (DOS) attack.
