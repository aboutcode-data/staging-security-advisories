summary: |
  Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski reported that it is possible to shadow the location object using Object.defineProperty. This could be used to confuse the current location to plugins, allowing for possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

  Update October 9, 2012: This advisory was updated to reflect the fact that bug 756719 was also fixed in ESR 10.0.8.
