summary: |
  Jakob Balle and Carsten Eiram of
  Secunia Research reported a race condition
  in NPObjWrapper_NewResolve when accessing the properties
  of a NPObject, a wrapped JSObject.  Balle
  and Eiram demonstrated that this condition could be reached by
  navigating away from a web page during the loading of a Java applet.
  Under such conditions the Java object would be destroyed but later
  called into resulting in a free memory read. It might be possible
  for an attacker to write to the freed memory before it is reused and run
  arbitrary code on the victim's computer.
  This vulnerability does not affect Firefox 2 nor other
  products built using the "Gecko 1.8" version of Mozilla code.
