summary: |
  Mozilla community member Watson Ladd reported that the
  implementation of Elliptical Curve Cryptography (ECC) multiplication for
  Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) signature validation in
  Network Security Services (NSS) did not handle exceptional cases correctly. This
  could potentially allow for signature forgery. This issue was fixed in NSS
  version 3.19.1.
