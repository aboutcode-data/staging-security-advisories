summary: |
  Mozilla employee Mike Kaply reported that the Firefox session restore
  data can contain passwords in plain text if a password input field on a page has its type
  changed from "password" to "text" during a session. This can occur if the password input
  field has a scripted mechanism to display the password to the user. Once this type is
  changed, the password data will persist as clear text within stored form data for this
  page. This could result in a potential revelation of site passwords on sites that use this
  mechanism to display password data if an attacker could find a way to read the session
  restoration file.
