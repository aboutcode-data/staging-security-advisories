summary: |
  Security researcher Ronald Crane reported three vulnerabilities
  affecting released code that were found through code inspection. These included a
  buffer overflow in the ANGLE graphics library and two issues of missing status checks in
  SVG rendering and during cryptographic key manipulation. These do not all have clear
  mechanisms to be exploited through web content but are vulnerable if a mechanism can be
  found to trigger them.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
