summary: |
  shutdown demonstrated that blocked popups opened from the status bar
  "blocked popups" icon were always opened in the context of the site
  listed in the Location (address) bar, even if the blocked popup were
  originally opened by a subframe loaded from another site. This allows
  the popup to perform a cross-site scripting attack against the framing
  web site.
  This does not appear to be much of a practical threat. The malicious
  page would first have to get itself framed by the target page, attempt
  to open a popup, and then convince the user that the popup contents
  were so important or interesting that it must be opened manually. (Before
  MFSA 2006-61 was fixed the first step
  was simpler: find a target site that uses frames and open it in a
  popup -- which might itself be blocked.)
