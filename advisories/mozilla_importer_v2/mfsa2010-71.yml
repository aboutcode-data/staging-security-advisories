summary: |
  Mozilla developer Ehsan Akhgari reported that a
  function used to load external libraries on Windows platforms was
  using a relative path to a DLL-loading application and was thus
  vulnerable to binary planting if an attacker was able to place an
  executable of the same name in the current working directory or any of
  the other locations that Windows searches for executables.
  Dmitri Gribenko reported that the script used to
  launch Mozilla applications on Linux was effectively including the
  current working directory in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  environment variable.  If an attacker was able to place into the
  current working directory a malicious shared library with the same
  name as a library that the bootstrapping script depends on the
  attacker could have their library loaded instead of the legitimate
  library.
