summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported
  that the XMLHttpRequestSpy module in the Firebug add-on was exposing
  an underlying chrome privilege escalation vulnerability.  When the
  XMLHttpRequestSpy object was created, it would attach various
  properties of itself to objects defined in web content, which were not
  being properly wrapped to prevent their exposure to chrome privileged
  objects.  This could result in an attacker running arbitrary
  JavaScript on a victim's machine, though it required the victim to
  have Firebug installed, so the overall severity of the issue was
  determined to be High.
  This vulnerability does not affect Firefox 3.6
