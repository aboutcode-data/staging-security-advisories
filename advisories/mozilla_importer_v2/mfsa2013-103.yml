summary: |
  Mozilla has updated the version of Network Security
  Services (NSS) library used in Mozilla projects to NSS 3.15.3 with the
  exception of ESR17-based releases, which have been updated to NSS 3.14.5. This
  addresses several moderate to critical rated networking security issues.
  Google developer Andrew Tinits reported a potentially
  exploitable buffer overflow that was fixed in both NSS 3.15.3 and NSS
  3.14.5.
