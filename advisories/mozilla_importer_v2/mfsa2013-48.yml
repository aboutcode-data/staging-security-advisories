summary: |
  Security researcher Abhishek Arya (Inferno) of the Google
  Chrome Security Team used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a series of
  use-after-free, out of bounds read, and invalid write problems rated as moderate
  to critical as security issues in shipped software. Some of these issues are
  potentially exploitable, allowing for remote code execution. We would also like
  to thank Abhishek for reporting additional use-after-free flaws in
  dir=auto code introduced during Firefox development. These were
  fixed before general release.
