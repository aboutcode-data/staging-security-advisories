summary: "Security researcher Frédéric Hoguin reported a mechanism where the\nMozilla Windows\
  \ updater could be used to overwrite arbitrary files. He found that files\nextracted by the\
  \ updater from a MAR archive are not locked for writing and\ncan be overwritten by other processes\
  \ while the updater is running. A malicious local\nprogram could invoke the updater and then\
  \ interfere with the extracted files, replacing\nthem with its own. This vulnerability could\
  \ be used for privilege escalation if these\noverwritten files were later invoked by other\
  \ Windows components that had higher\nprivileges. \n\nThis issue does not affect non-Windows\
  \ operating systems."
