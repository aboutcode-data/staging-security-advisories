aliases:
  - CVE-2021-4126
summary: |
  When receiving an OpenPGP/MIME signed email message that contains an
  additional outer MIME message layer, for example a message footer added by a
  mailing list gateway, Thunderbird only considered the inner signed message for
  the signature validity. This gave the false impression that the additional contents
  were also covered by the digital signature. Starting with Thunderbird version 91.4.1,
  only the signature that belongs to the top level MIME part will be considered for
  the displayed status.
