summary: |
  Security researcher Jukka Jylänki reported a use-after-free in
  JavaScript caused by how objects and pointers are handled during incremental garbage
  collection in some circumstances working with object groups. When triggered, this causes a
  potential exploitable crash but is mitigated by the difficulties in controlling the crash
  and its output.
