summary: |
  Security researcher Martin Straka reported
  that Gecko-based browsers update the .href property of stylesheet
  DOM nodes to reflect the final URI of the stylesheet after following
  any 302 redirects (much as the document.location property is updated).
  This differs from other browsers and could potentially reveal sensitive
  URL parameters, such as those used by Single-signon systems, to scripts
  on the page.
