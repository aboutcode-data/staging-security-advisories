summary: |
  Security research firm VUPEN, via TippingPoint's Pwn2Own
  contest, reported that memory pressure during Garbage Collection could lead to
  memory corruption of TypeObjects in the JS engine, resulting in an exploitable
  use-after-free condition.
  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but is
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
