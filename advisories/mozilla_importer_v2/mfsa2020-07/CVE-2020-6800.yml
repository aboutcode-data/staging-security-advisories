aliases:
  - CVE-2020-6800
summary: Mozilla developers and community members Raul Gurzau, Tyson Smith, Bob Clary, Liz Henry,
  and Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 72 and Firefox ESR 68.4.
  Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort
  some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.*In general, these flaws cannot
  be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading
  mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*
