aliases:
  - CVE-2020-6794
summary: If a user saved passwords before Thunderbird 60 and then later set a master password,
  an unencrypted copy of these passwords is still accessible. This is because the older stored
  password file was not deleted when the data was copied to a new format starting in Thunderbird
  60. The new master password is added only on the new file. This could allow the exposure of
  stored password data outside of user expectations.
