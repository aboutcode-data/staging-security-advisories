aliases:
  - CVE-2020-6798
summary: If a <template> tag was used in a <select%gt; tag, the parser could be confused and
  allow JavaScript parsing and execution when it should not be allowed. A site that relied on
  the browser behaving correctly could suffer a cross-site scripting vulnerability as a result.*In
  general, this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting
  is disabled when reading mail, but is potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.*
