summary: Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported that if code executed by the evalInSandbox
  function sets location.href, it can get the wrong subject principal for the URL check, ignoring
  the sandbox's Javascript context and gaining the context of evalInSandbox object. This can
  lead to malicious web content being able to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or
  stealing a copy of a local file if the user has installed an add-on vulnerable to this attack.
