summary: |
  Sites can use the _search target to open links in the Firefox sidebar. Two
  missing security checks allow malicious scripts to first open a privileged
  page (such as about:config) and then inject script using a javascript: url.
  This could be used to install malicious code or steal data without user interaction.
