summary: |
  Security researcher Cody Crews reported that some Javascript
  components will perform checks against the wrong uniform resource identifier
  (URI) before performing security sensitive actions. This will return an
  incorrect location for the originator of the call. This could be used to bypass
  same-origin policy, allowing for cross-site scripting (XSS) or the installation
  of malicious add-ons from third-party pages.
  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but are
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
