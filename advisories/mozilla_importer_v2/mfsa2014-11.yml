summary: |
  Soeren Balko reported a crash when
  terminating a web worker running asm.js code after passing an
  object between threads. This crash is potentially exploitable.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled in mail, but is
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
