summary: |
  Security researcher Byoungyoung Lee of Georgia Tech
  Information Security Center (GTISC) used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover
  a use-after-free during state change events while updating the offline cache.
  This leads to a potentially exploitable crash.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but is
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
