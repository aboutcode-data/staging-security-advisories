summary: |
  Updated November 6, 2024 to add CVE-2024-10941 which was fixed in Firefox 126 but not included in the original advisory.

  An iterator stop condition was missing when handling WASM code in the built-in profiler, potentially leading to invalid memory access and undefined behavior. *Note:* This issue only affects the application when the profiler is running.
