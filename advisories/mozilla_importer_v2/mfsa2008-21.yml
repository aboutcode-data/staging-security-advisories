summary: |
  Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability bugs in the
  browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of
  these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
  circumstances and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these
  could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and could
  be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not the
  default setting and we strongly discourage users from running JavaScript in
  mail. Without further investigation we cannot rule out the possibility that
  for some of these an attacker might be able to prepare memory for exploitation
  through some means other than JavaScript such as large images.
