summary: |
  shutdown discovered it was possible to use the Object.watch()
  method to access an internal function object (the "clone parent")
  which could then be used to run arbitrary JavaScript code with
  full permission. This could be used to install malware such as
  password sniffers or viruses.
  In pre-release versions of Firefox 1.5 the same technique could
  be applied to the Array generic methods introduced in that release.
  Thunderbird shares the JavaScript engine with Firefox
  and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
  the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
  JavaScript in mail.
