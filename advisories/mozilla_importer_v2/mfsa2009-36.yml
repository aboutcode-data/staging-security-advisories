summary: |
  oCERT security researcher Will Drewry reported a
  series of heap and integer overflow vulnerabilities which
  independently affected multiple font glyph rendering libraries.  On
  Linux platforms libpango was susceptible to the vulnerabilities while
  on OS X CoreGraphics was similarly vulnerable.  An attacker could
  trigger these overflows by constructing a very large text run for the
  browser to display.  Such an overflow can result in a crash which the
  attacker could potentially use to run arbitrary code on a victim's
  computer.
  The open-source nature of Linux meant that Mozilla was able to work
  with the libpango maintainers to implement the correct fix
  in version 1.24 of that system library which was distributed with OS
  security updates. On Mac OS X Firefox works around the CoreGraphics
  flaw by limiting the length of text runs passed to the system.
