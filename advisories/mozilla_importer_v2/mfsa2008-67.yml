summary: |
  Kojima Hajime reported that unlike literal null
  characters which were handled correctly, the escaped form '\0'
  was ignored by the CSS parser and treated as if it was not present in
  the CSS input string.  This issue could potentially be used to bypass
  script sanitization routines in web applications.  The severity of
  this issue was determined to be low.
