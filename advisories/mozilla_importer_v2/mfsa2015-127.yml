summary: |
  Security researcher Shinto K Anto reported an issue with cross-origin
  resource sharing (CORS) "preflight" requests when receiving certain
  Content-Type headers. This is due to an error in implementation resulting in
  trying to process multiple media types when they are returned in the
  Content-Type headers from a server. This is disallowed in the CORS specification and results in a simple instead of a
  "preflight" request, leading to potential same-origin policy violation.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
