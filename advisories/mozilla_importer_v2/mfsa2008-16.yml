summary: |
  Security researcher Gregory Fleischer demonstrated a
  problem with the HTTP Referer: (sic) header sent with requests
  to URLs containing Basic Authentication credentials with empty usernames.
  In these cases a number of leading characters, based on the length of the
  password in the URL, are removed from the referrer hostname. Fleischer
  pointed out that websites which only check the Referer: header
  to protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) could be attacked using
  this flaw. This concept was based on and expanded from a post to the
  sla.ckers.org forum by security researcher RSnake.
