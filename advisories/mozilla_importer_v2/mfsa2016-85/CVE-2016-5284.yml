aliases:
  - CVE-2016-5284
summary: Due to flaws in the process we used to update "Preloaded Public Key Pinning" in our
  releases, the pinning for add-on updates became ineffective in early September. An attacker
  who was able to get a mis-issued certificate for a Mozilla web site could send malicious add-on
  updates to users on networks controlled by the attacker. Users who have not installed any
  add-ons are not affected.
