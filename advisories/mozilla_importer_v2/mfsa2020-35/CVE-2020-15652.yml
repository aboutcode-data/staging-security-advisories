  - CVE-2020-15652
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  By observing the stack trace for JavaScript errors in web workers, it was possible to leak the result of a cross-origin redirect. This applied only to content that can be parsed as script.
