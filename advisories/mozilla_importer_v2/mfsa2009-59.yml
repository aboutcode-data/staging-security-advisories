summary: |
  Security researcher Alin Rad Pop of Secunia
  Research reported a heap-based buffer overflow in Mozilla's string to
  floating point number conversion routines.  Using this vulnerability
  an attacker could craft some malicious JavaScript code containing a
  very long string to be converted to a floating point number which
  would result in improper memory allocation and the execution of an
  arbitrary memory location.  This vulnerability could thus be leveraged
  by the attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
  Update: The underlying flaw in the dtoa routines used
  by Mozilla appears to be essentially the same as that reported against the
  libc gdtoa routine by Maksymilian Arciemowicz.
