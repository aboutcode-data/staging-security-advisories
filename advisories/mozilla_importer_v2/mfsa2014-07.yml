summary: |
  Mozilla security engineer Frederik Braun reported an issue
  where the implementation of Content Security Policy (CSP) is not in compliance
  with the specification. XSLT stylesheets
  must be subject to script-src directives but Mozilla's
  implementation of CSP treats them as styles. This could lead to unexpected
  script execution if the style-src directives were less restrictive
  than those for scripts.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Seamonkey product because scripting is disabled in mail, but is potentially a
  risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
