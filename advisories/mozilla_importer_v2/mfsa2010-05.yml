summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher Georgi Guninski
  reported that when a SVG document which is served
  with Content-Type: application/octet-stream is embedded
  into another document via an <embed> tag
  with type="image/svg+xml", the Content-Type is ignored
  and the SVG document is processed normally.  A website which allows
  arbitrary binary data to be uploaded but which relies
  on Content-Type: application/octet-stream to prevent
  script execution could have such protection bypassed.  An attacker
  could upload a SVG document containing JavaScript as a binary file to
  a website, embed the SVG document into a malicious page on another
  site, and gain access to the script environment from the SVG-serving
  site, bypassing the same-origin policy.
