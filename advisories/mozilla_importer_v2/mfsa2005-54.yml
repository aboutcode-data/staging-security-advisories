summary: |
  Alerts and prompts created by scripts in web pages are presented with the
  generic title [JavaScript Application] which sometimes makes it difficult to know
  which site created them.  A malicious page could attempt to cause a prompt
  to appear in front of a trusted site in an attempt to extract information
  such as passwords from the user.
  In the fixed version these prompts will contain the hostname from the
  page which created it.
