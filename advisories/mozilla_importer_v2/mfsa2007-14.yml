summary: |
  Nicolas Derouet reported two problems with
  cookie handling in Mozilla clients. The first was that the
  cookie path parameter was not subject to any length checks, and
  this could be abused to cause the victim's browser to use excessive
  amounts of memory while it was running as well as waste the disk
  space used to store the cookie until it expired.
  Cookies sent by an HTTP server are limited to a
  reasonable size by the general limit on the size of an HTTP header,
  but cookies created programmatically through JavaScript and
  added using document.cookie could have a path
  of any length the script could create -- potentially several
  tens of megabytes.
  The second issue was that the cookie path and name values
  were not checked for the presence of the delimiter used for
  internal cookie storage, and if present this confused future
  interpretation of the cookie data. Since the cookie host continued
  to be set correctly there was very little that could be done
  that the site could not legitimately set in the first place. One
  exception was the ability for a non-secure site to create "secure"
  cookies (it still could not read them), which might be a problem
  on some sites. Other fields in the file could be faked, but scripts
  that could set cookies at all could generally set them anyway.
