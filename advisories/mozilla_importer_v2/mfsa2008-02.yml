  Security researchers hong and Gregory
  Fleischer each reported a variant on earlier reported bugs
  regarding focus shifting in file input controls. Their variants
  used file input controls nested inside <label> tags
  to take advantage of automatic focus shifting into the file input field
  noted on the Hacker WebZine. As with the earlier reported issues
  this issue could be used to force a user to upload arbitrary files
  assuming the attacker knows the full path and name of the file.
  These bugs are variations on earlier problems reported by
  Charles McAuley and Michal Zalewski
  which were fixed in Firefox 2.0.0.4, as well as an issue reported by
  hong which was fixed in Firefox 2.0.0.8.
  Gregory Fleischer also submitted several other variations of
  the same problem.
