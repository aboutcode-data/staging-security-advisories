summary: |
  Mozilla developer Roee Hay reported that Firefox for
  Android profile paths leak to the Android system log. When running on Android
  4.2 or earlier, other applications are able to read these log files, leading to
  information disclosure from the user's profile directory. This issue was also
  independently reported by Mozilla developer Richard Newman.
