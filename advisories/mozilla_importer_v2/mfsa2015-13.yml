summary: |
  Security researcher Muneaki Nishimura reported that when
  certificate pinning is set to "strict" mode, a period ('.') appended to a
  hostname in the address of a site allowed the bypass key pinning (HPKP) and HTTP
  Strict Transport Security (HSTS). Sites with a period appended were treated as
  having a different origin than sites without the period. If an attacker had a
  security certificate for a domain with the added period, this would allow for a
  Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on users.
