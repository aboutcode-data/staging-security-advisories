summary: |
  Security researcher Muneaki Nishimura reported that
  navigator.sendBeacon() does not follow the cross-origin resource
  sharing (CORS) specification. This results in the request from
  sendBeacon() lacking an origin header in violation of
  the W3C Beacon specification and not
  being treated as a CORS request. This allows for a potential Cross-site request
  forgery (XSRF) attack from malicious websites.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
