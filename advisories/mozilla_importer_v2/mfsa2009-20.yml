summary: |
  Security researcher Prateek Saxena reported that a
  malicious MozSearch plugin could be created using a javascript: URI in
  the SearchForm value.  This URI is used as the default
  landing page when an empty search is performed.  If an attacker could
  get a user to install the malicious plugin and perform an empty
  search, the SearchForm javascript: URI would be executed
  within the context of the currently open page.
