summary: |
  Security researcher Abdulrahman Alqabandi reported that when a local
  HTML file resides in the same directory as a malicious local shortcut file, the shortcut
  can be called by the local page to allow the page to read the contents of local files or
  directories or to load an arbitrary website in violation of same-origin policy, allowing
  for data theft. In order for this vulnerability to be triggered, both the malicious HTML
  file as well as the shortcut must be saved to the same local directory and then loaded
  from there by a user.
