summary: |
  Security researcher Ucha Gobejishvili used the Address
  Sanitizer tool to find a buffer overflow while parsing compressed XML content.
  This was due to an error in how buffer space is created and modified when
  handling large amounts of XML data. This results in a potentially exploitable
  crash.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
