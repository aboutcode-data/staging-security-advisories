summary: Mozilla developers Timothy Nikkel, Andrew McCreight, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported
  memory safety bugs present in Firefox 110 and Firefox ESR 102.8. Some of these bugs showed
  evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have
  been exploited to run arbitrary code.
