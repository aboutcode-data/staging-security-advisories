  - CVE-2021-23961
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Further techniques that built on the slipstream research combined with a malicious webpage could have exposed both an internal network's hosts as well as services running on the user's local machine.
