  - CVE-2021-29945
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  The WebAssembly JIT could miscalculate the size of a return type, which could lead to a null read and result in a crash.
  *Note: This issue only affected x86-32 platforms. Other platforms are unaffected.*
