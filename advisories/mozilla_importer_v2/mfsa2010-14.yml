summary: |
  Mozilla developer Wladimir Palant reported that
  stylesheets used in remote XUL documents can wind up in the XUL cache
  where it can later be accessed by browser chrome for use in styling
  the user interface.  A malicious website could use this issue to
  pollute a user's XUL cache and change style attributes of their
  browser such as font size and color.
