summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported
  vulnerabilities in the session-restore feature by which content could be
  injected into an incorrect document storage location, including
  storage locations for other domains.  An attacker could utilize these
  issues to violate the browser's same-origin policy and perform an XSS
  attack while SessionStore data is being restored.
  moz_bug_r_a4 also reported that one variant could be used by an
  attacker to run arbitrary JavaScript with chrome privileges.
