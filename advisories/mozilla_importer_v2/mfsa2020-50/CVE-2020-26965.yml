summary: Some websites have a feature "Show Password" where clicking a button will change a
  password field into a textbook field, revealing the typed password. If, when using a software
  keyboard that remembers user input, a user typed their password and used that feature, the
  type of the password field was changed, resulting in a keyboard layout change and the possibility
  for the software keyboard to remember the typed password.
