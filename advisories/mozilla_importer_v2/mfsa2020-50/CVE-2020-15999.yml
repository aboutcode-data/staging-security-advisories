summary: 'In Freetype, if PNG images were embedded into fonts, the Load_SBit_Png function contained
  an integer overflow that led to a heap buffer overflow, memory corruption, and an exploitable
  crash.*Note: While Project Zero did discover instances of this vulnerability being exploited
  in the wild against Chrome, in Firefox this vulnerability is only triggerable if a rarely-used,
  hidden preference is toggled, and only affected Linux and Android operating systems. Other
  operating systems are unaffected; and Linux and Android are unaffected in the default configuration.*'
