summary: |
  Security researcher Tim McCormack reported that when a page requests a
  series of permissions in a short timespan, the resulting permission notifications can show
  the icon for the wrong permission request. This can lead to user confusion and inadvertent
  consent given when a user is prompted by web content to give permissions, such as for
  geolocation or microphone access.
