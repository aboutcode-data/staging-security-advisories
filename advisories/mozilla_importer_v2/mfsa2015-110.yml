summary: "Security researcher Mario Gomes reported that when a previously\nloaded image on a\
  \ page is drag and dropped into content after a redirect, the redirected\nURL is available\
  \ to scripts. This is a violation of the  Fetch specification's defined behavior for\n\"Atomic\
  \ HTTP redirect handling\" which states that redirected URLs are not exposed to any\nAPIs.\
  \ This can allow for information leakage. \n\nIn general this flaw cannot be exploited through\
  \ email in the\nThunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk\
  \ in\nbrowser or browser-like contexts."
