summary: |
  Security researcher Evgeny Legerov of Intevydis
  reported that the WOFF decoder contains an integer overflow in a
  font decompression routine.  This flaw could result in too small a
  memory buffer being allocated to store a downloadable font.  An
  attacker could use this vulnerability to crash a victim's browser
  and execute arbitrary code on his/her system.
  Support for the WOFF downloadable font format
  is new in Firefox 3.6 (Gecko 1.9.2); this vulnerability does not affect
  products built on earlier versions of the Mozilla browser engine.
