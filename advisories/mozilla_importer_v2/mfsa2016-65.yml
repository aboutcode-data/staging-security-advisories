summary: |
  Security researcher Bert Massop reported a crash in the Cairo graphics
  layer on Linux systems using the LibAV library included in version 0.10 of the FFmpeg
  library. This was due to an error when allocating the LibAV header when decoding some
  videos.

  This only affects systems running the Linux operating system that also
  have FFMpeg version 0.10 installed and does not affect OS X or Windows systems.
