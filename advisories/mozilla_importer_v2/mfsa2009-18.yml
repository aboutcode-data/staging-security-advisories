summary: |
  Web developer Cefn Hoile reported that sites which
  allow users to embed third-party stylesheets are vulnerable to script
  injection attacks using XBL bindings.  While this behavior was
  documented previously, it was determined that this particular risk was
  not well-understood by some websites.  To mitigate this risk Mozilla
  added a restriction that requires XBL bindings to come from the same
  origin as the bound document.
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and
  could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is
  not the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
  JavaScript in mail.
