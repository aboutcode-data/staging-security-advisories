  - CVE-2019-9796
summary: A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when the SMIL animation controller incorrectly
  registers with the refresh driver twice when only a single registration is expected. When
  a registration is later freed with the removal of the animation controller element, the refresh
  driver incorrectly leaves a dangling pointer to the driver's observer array.
