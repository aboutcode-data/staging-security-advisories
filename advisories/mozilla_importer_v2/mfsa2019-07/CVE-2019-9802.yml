  - CVE-2019-9802
summary: If a Sandbox content process is compromised, it can initiate an FTP download which
  will then use a child process to render the downloaded data. The downloaded data can then
  be passed to the Chrome process with an arbitrary file length supplied by an attacker, bypassing
  sandbox protections and allow for a potential memory read of adjacent data from the privileged
  Chrome process, which may include sensitive data.
