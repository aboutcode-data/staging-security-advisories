summary: |
  Security researcher Jonathan Morgan reported that
  when a page loaded over an insecure protocol, such as http: or file:,
  sets its document.location to a https: URL which
  responds with a 204 status and empty response body, the insecure page
  will receive SSL indicators near the location bar, but will not have
  its page content modified in any way.  This could lead to a user
  believing they were on a secure page when in fact they were not.
  Security researcher Jordi Chancel reported an
  issue similar to one fixed
  in mfsa2009-44 in which a web page can
  set document.location to a URL that can't be displayed
  properly and then inject content into the resulting blank page.  An
  attacker could use this vulnerability to place a legitimate-looking
  but invalid URL in the location bar and inject HTML and JavaScript
  into the body of the page, resulting in a spoofing attack.
