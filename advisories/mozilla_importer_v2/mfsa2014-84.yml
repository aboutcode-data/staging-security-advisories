summary: |
  Security researcher Cody Crews reported a method to trigger
  chrome level XML Binding Language (XBL) bindings through web content. This was
  possible because some chrome accessible CSS stylesheets had their primary
  namespace improperly declared. When this occurred, it was possible to use these
  stylesheets to manipulate XBL bindings, allowing web content to bypass security
  restrictions. This issue was limited to a specific set of stylesheets.
