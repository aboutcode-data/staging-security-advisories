summary: |
  Security researcher Abhishek Arya (Inferno) of the Google
  Chrome Security Team reported a use-after-free vulnerability when the alt key
  is used in conjunction with toplevel menu items in Firefox. This results in a potentially
  exploitable crash when triggered. This vulnerability is mitigated by not being triggerable
  by web content, only direct user interaction with the keyboard.
