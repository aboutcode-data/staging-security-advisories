summary: |
  Yazan Tommalieh discovered a flaw that once users have
  viewed the default Firefox start page (about:home), subsequent pages they
  navigate to in that same tab could use script to activate the buttons that were
  on the about:home page. Most of these simply open Firefox dialogs such as
  Settings or History, which might alarm users. In some cases a malicious page
  could trigger session restore and cause data loss if the current tabs are
  replaced by a previously stored set.
