summary: |
  Google notified Mozilla that an intermediate
  certificate, which chains up to a root included in Mozilla’s root store, was
  loaded into a man-in-the-middle (MITM) traffic management device. This
  certificate was issued by Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes
  d'information (ANSSI), an agency of the French government and a certificate
  authority in Mozilla's root program. A subordinate certificate authority of
  ANSSI mis-issued an intermediate certificate that they installed on a network
  monitoring device, which enabled the device to act as a MITM proxy
  performing traffic management of domain names or IP addresses that the
  certificate holder did not own or control.
  The issue was not specific to Firefox but there was evidence that one of the
  certificates was used for MITM traffic management of domain names that the
  customer did not legitimately own or control. This issue was resolved by
  revoking trust in the intermediate used by the sub-CA to issue the certificate
  for the MITM device.
