summary: |
  Mozilla community member Geoff reported that URL shortcut
  files on Windows (for example, saved IE favorites) could be interpreted as if
  they were in the local file context when opened by Firefox, although the
  referenced remote content would be downloaded and displayed. Scripts loaded
  from the remote site would have access to all local file content in Firefox 2
  if they were programmed to look for it.
  Exploiting this vulnerability would involve first fooling the user into
  saving such a shortcut to a malicious site--typically from some other program
  since Firefox does not use this format--and then find the saved file on the
  desktop and choose to open it with Firefox.
  In affected pre-release versions of Firefox 3 the vulnerability was
  further mitigated by the additional restrictions on file content that prevent
  searching the local disk in this manner. Malicious scripts could only read
  from files with known names stored in the same folder (or sub-folder) as
  the shortcut.
