summary: |
  Security researcher Jukka Jylänki reported a crash in
  the the Cairo graphics library. This happens when Cairo paints out-of-bounds to
  the destination buffer in the compositing function when working with canvas in
  certain circumstances. This issue allows malicious web content to cause a
  potentially exploitable crash.

  This issue only affects Firefox 28 and Seamonkey 2.25 on
  Windows. Earlier versions of both products and installations on Linux and OS X
  were unaffected
