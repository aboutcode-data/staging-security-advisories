summary: "A malicious search plugin could run javascript in the context of the\ndisplayed page\
  \ each time a search is run. This could be used to steal\ncookies or page contents, or issue\
  \ commands to that site on the user's\nbehalf. If the open page has elevated privileges (about:plugins,\n\
  about:config) then the script could install malicious software when\na search is performed.\
  \ javascript: urls are no longer supported as\na search action.\nIf the user installs a search\
  \ plugin from a malicious site the\nnew search plugin could silently replace an existing one\
  \ by \nchoosing the same filename and using a long enough server path to push the\nfilename\
  \ part off the edge of the confirmation dialog. To the user it\nwould appear as if the new\
  \ plugin failed to install, but searches performed\nusing the overwritten plugin would be\
  \ handled by the malicious one. If the\nultimate results came from redirecting to the original\
  \ site this could\nremain undetected for some time. The malicious site could use this to\n\
  track people's search history, or perhaps to add their own paid results\nat the top of what\
  \ the user would assume to be a reputable search site.\nNew search plugins no longer overwrite\
  \ existing ones. If\nyou need to reinstall or upgrade an existing search plugin\nyou will\
  \ have to find and manually delete the old one first"
