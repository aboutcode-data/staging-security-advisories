summary: |
  Security researcher lokihardt, working with HP's Zero Day Initiative,
  reported a use-after-free issue in the SetBody function of
  HTMLDocument. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
