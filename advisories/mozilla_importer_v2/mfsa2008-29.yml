summary: |
  Mozilla developer Daniel Glazman demonstrated that
  an improperly encoded .properties file in an add-on can result in
  uninitialized memory being used.  This could potentially result in
  small chunks of data formerly used by other programs being exposed
  to the add-on code. If the localized string were made available to
  web content by the add-on this might leak sensitive data.
