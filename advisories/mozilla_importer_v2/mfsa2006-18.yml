summary: |
  A particular sequence of HTML tags that reliably crash
  Mozilla clients was reported by an anonymous researcher via
  TippingPoint and the Zero Day Initiative. The crash is due to memory corruption
  that can be exploited to run arbitrary code.
  Mozilla mail clients will crash on the tag sequence, but
  without the ability to run scripts to fill memory with the attack
  code it may not be possible for an attacker to exploit this crash.
