  When a TLS Certificate error occurs on a domain protected by the HSTS header, the browser should not allow the user to bypass the certificate error.  On Firefox for Android, the user was presented with the option to bypass the error; this could only have been done by the user explicitly. *This bug only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*
