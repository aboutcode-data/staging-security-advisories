summary: |
  *Note*: While [Bug 1771084](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1771084) does not represent a specific vulnerability that was fixed, we recommend anyone rebasing patches to include it. 102 branch: Patch [1](https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/rev/82e3067ad2e7) and [2](https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/rev/6e4639dc3614). 91 Branch: Patch [1](https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-esr91/rev/72bca7a337e4) and [2](https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-esr91/rev/befef01949f2) (Despite saying Parts 2 and 3, there is no Part 1)

  The MediaError message property should be consistent to avoid leaking information about cross-origin resources; however for a same-site cross-origin resource, the message could have leaked information enabling XS-Leaks attacks.
