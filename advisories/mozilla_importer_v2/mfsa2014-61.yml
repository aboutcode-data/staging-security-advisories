summary: |
  Security researcher Jethro Beekman of the University of
  California, Berkeley reported a crash when the FireOnStateChange
  event is triggered in some circumstances. This leads to a use-after-free and a
  potentially exploitable crash when it occurs.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
