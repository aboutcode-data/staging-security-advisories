summary: |
  Compiler Engineer Dan Gohman of Google discovered a flaw in
  the JavaScript engine where memory was being incorrectly allocated for some
  functions and the calls for allocations were not always properly checked for
  overflow, leading to potential buffer overflows. When combined with other
  vulnerabilities, these flaws could be potentially exploitable.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but is
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
