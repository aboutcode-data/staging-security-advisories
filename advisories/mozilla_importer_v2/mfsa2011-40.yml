summary: |
  Mariusz Mlynski reported that if you could convince
  a user to hold down the Enter key--as part of a game or test,
  perhaps--a malicious page could pop up a download dialog where the held
  key would then activate the default Open action. For some file types this
  would be merely annoying (the equivalent of a pop-up) but other file
  types have powerful scripting capabilities. And this would provide an
  avenue for an attacker to exploit a vulnerability in applications not
  normally exposed to potentially hostile internet content.

  Mariusz also reported a similar flaw with manual plugin installation
  using the PLUGINSPAGE attribute. It was possible to create
  an internal error that suppressed a confirmation dialog, such that holding
  enter would lead to the installation of an arbitrary add-on. (This variant
  did not affect Firefox 3.6)
