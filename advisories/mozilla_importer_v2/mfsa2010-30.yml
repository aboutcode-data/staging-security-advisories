summary: |
  Security researcher Martin Barbella reported via
  TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that an XSLT node sorting routine
  contained an integer overflow vulnerability.  In cases where one of
  the nodes to be sorted contained a very large text value, the integer
  used to allocate a memory buffer to store its value would overflow,
  resulting in too small a buffer being created.  An attacker could use
  this vulnerability to write data past the end of the buffer, causing
  the browser to crash and potentially running arbitrary code on a
  victim's computer.
