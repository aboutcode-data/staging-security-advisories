aliases:
  - CVE-2020-6811
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  The 'Copy as cURL' feature of Devtools' network tab did not properly escape the HTTP method of a request, which can be controlled by the website. If a user used the 'Copy as Curl' feature and pasted the command into a terminal, it could have resulted in command injection and arbitrary command execution.
