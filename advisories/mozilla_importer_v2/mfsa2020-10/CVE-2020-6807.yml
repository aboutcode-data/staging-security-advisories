  - CVE-2020-6807
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  When a device was changed while a stream was about to be destroyed, the stream-reinit task may have been executed after the stream was destroyed, causing a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash.
