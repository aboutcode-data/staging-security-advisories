  - CVE-2024-11698
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  A flaw in handling fullscreen transitions may have inadvertently caused the application to become stuck in fullscreen mode when a modal dialog was opened during the transition. This issue left users unable to exit fullscreen mode using standard actions like pressing "Esc" or accessing right-click menus, resulting in a disrupted browsing experience until the browser is restarted.  *This bug only affects the application when running on macOS. Other operating systems are unaffected.*
