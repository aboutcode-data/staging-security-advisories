  - CVE-2023-4575
summary: When creating a callback over IPC for showing the File Picker window, multiple of the
  same callbacks could have been created at a time and eventually all simultaneously destroyed
  as soon as one of the callbacks finished. This could have led to a use-after-free causing
  a potentially exploitable crash.
