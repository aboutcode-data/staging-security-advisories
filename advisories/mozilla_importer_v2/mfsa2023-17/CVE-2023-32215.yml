summary: Mozilla developers and community members Gabriele Svelto, Andrew Osmond, Emily McDonough,
  Sebastian Hengst, Andrew McCreight and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs
  present in Firefox 112 and Firefox ESR 102.10. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
  corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited
  to run arbitrary code.
