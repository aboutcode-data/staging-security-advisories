summary: |
  Security researcher Stuart Larsen reported two issues with HTTP/2
  resulting in integer underflows that lead to intentional aborts when the errors are
  detected.

  In the first issue, if a malformed HTTP2 header frame is received with only a single
  byte, an integer underflow can be created in some circumstances. In the second issue, a
  malformed HTTP2 PushPromse frame is received and the length of the decompressed buffer is
  miscalculated, leading to another integer underflow. In both of these instances, more
  memory is allocated than is allowed, triggering assertions and intentional aborts (a
  denial of service) but no exploitable crashes.
