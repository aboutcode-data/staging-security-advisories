summary: |
  Security researcher ilxu1a reported, through HP Zero Day
  Initiative's Pwn2Own contest, a flaw in Mozilla's implementation of typed array
  bounds checking in JavaScript just-in-time compilation (JIT) and its management
  of bounds checking for heap access. This flaw can be leveraged into the reading
  and writing of memory allowing for arbitrary code execution on the local system.
