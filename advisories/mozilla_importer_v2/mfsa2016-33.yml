summary: |
  Security researcher Ronald Crane reported a race condition in
  GetStaticInstance in WebRTC which results in a use-after-free. This could
  result in a potentially exploitable crash. This issue was found through code inspection
  and does not have clear mechanism to be exploited through web content but is vulnerable if
  a mechanism can be found to trigger it.
