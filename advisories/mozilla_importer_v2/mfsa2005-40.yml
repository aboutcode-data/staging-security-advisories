summary: |
  The native implementations of InstallTrigger and other XPInstall-related
  javascript objects did not properly validate that they were called on
  instances of the correct type. By passing other objects, even raw numbers,
  the javascript interpreter would jump to the wrong place in memory.
  Although no proof of concept has been developed we believe this could
  be exploited.
