summary: |
  Mozilla community member Ms2ger discovered that some
  DOMSVGZoomEvent functions are used without being properly
  initialized, causing uninitialized memory to be used when they are called by web
  content. This could lead to a information leakage to sites depending on the
  contents of this uninitialized memory.

  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but are
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
