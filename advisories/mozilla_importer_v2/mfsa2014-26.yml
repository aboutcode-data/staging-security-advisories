summary: |
  Security researcher Tyson Smith and Jesse
  Schwartzentruber of the BlackBerry Security Automated Analysis Team
  used the Address Sanitizer tool while fuzzing to discover an out-of-bounds read
  during polygon rendering in MathML. This can allow web content to potentially
  read protected memory addresses. In combination with previous techniques used
  for SVG timing attacks, this could allow for text values to be read across
  domains, leading to information disclosure.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but is
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
