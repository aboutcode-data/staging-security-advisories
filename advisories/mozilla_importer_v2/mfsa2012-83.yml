summary: "Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski reported that when\nInstallTrigger fails, it throws\
  \ an error wrapped in a Chrome Object Wrapper\n(COW) that fails to specify exposed properties.\
  \ These can then be added to the\nresulting object by an attacker, allowing access to chrome\
  \ privileged functions\nthrough script.\n\nWhile investigating this issue, Mozilla security\
  \ researcher\nmoz_bug_r_a4 found that COW did not disallow accessing of\nproperties from a\
  \ standard prototype in some situations, even when the original\nissue had been fixed.\n\n\
  These issues could allow for a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or arbitrary\ncode execution.\
  \ \n\nIn general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the\nThunderbird and SeaMonkey\
  \ products because scripting is disabled, but are\npotentially a risk in browser or browser-like\
  \ contexts in those products."
