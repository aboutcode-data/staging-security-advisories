  - CVE-2023-29551
summary: Mozilla developers Randell Jesup, Andrew McCreight, Gabriele Svelto, and the Mozilla
  Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 111. Some of these bugs showed
  evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have
  been exploited to run arbitrary code.
