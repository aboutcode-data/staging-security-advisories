summary: 'A local attacker can trick the Mozilla Maintenance Service into applying an unsigned
  update file by pointing the service at an update file on a malicious SMB server. The update
  file can be replaced after the signature check, before the use, because the write-lock requested
  by the service does not work on a SMB server.*Note: This attack requires local system access
  and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*'
