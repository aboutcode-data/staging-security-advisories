  - CVE-2023-4421
summary: |
  Although this issue was embargoed until 2023, it was fixed in NSS 3.61 as released on January 22, 2021
  The NSS code used for checking PKCS#1 v1.5 was leaking information useful in mounting Bleichenbacher-like attacks.
  Both the overall correctness of the padding as well as the length of the encrypted message was leaking through timing side-channel.
  By sending large number of attacker-selected ciphertexts, the attacker would be able to decrypt a previously intercepted PKCS#1 v1.5 ciphertext (for example, to decrypt a TLS session that used RSA key exchange), or forge a signature using the victim's key.
  The issue was fixed by implementing the implicit rejection algorithm, in which the NSS returns a deterministic random message in case invalid padding is detected, as proposed in the Marvin Attack paper.
