summary: |
  Mozilla cryptographer Nelson Bolyard reported that
  the SSL implementation was permitting servers to use Diffie-Hellman
  Ephemeral mode (DHE) with too short of a minimum key length.  DHE keys
  of such lengths are trivially breakable on modern hardware so SSL
  servers operating in this mode were providing very little effective
  security for their clients.
