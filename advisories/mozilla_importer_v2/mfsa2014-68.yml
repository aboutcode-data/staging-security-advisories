summary: |
  Security researcher Abhishek Arya (Inferno) of the Google
  Chrome Security Team used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a
  use-after-free during cycle collection. This was found in interactions with the
  SVG content through the document object model (DOM) with animating SVG content.
  This leads to a potentially exploitable crash.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
