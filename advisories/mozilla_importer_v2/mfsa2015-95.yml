summary: |
  Security researcher Bas Venis reported a mechanism where add-ons could
  be installed from a different source than user expectations. Normally, when a user enters
  the URL to an add-on directly in the addressbar, warning prompts are bypassed because it
  is the result of direct user action. He discovered that a data: URL could be
  manipulated on a loaded page to simulate this direct user input of the add-on's URL, which
  would result in a bypassing of the install permission prompt. He also reported that in the
  absence of the permission prompt, it is possible to cause the actual installation prompt
  to appear above another site's location by causing a page navigation immediately after
  triggering add-on installation. This could manipulate a user into falsely believing a
  trusted site (such as addons.mozilla.org) has
  initiated the installation. This could lead to users installing an add-on from a malicious
  source.
