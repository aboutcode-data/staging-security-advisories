  - CVE-2019-11763
summary: Failure to correctly handle null bytes when processing HTML entities resulted in Firefox
  incorrectly parsing these entities. This could have led to HTML comment text being treated
  as HTML which could have led to XSS in a web application under certain conditions. It could
  have also led to HTML entities being masked from filters - enabling the use of entities to
  mask the actual characters of interest from filters.
