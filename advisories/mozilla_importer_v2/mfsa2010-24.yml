summary: |
  Mozilla community member Wladimir Palant reported
  that XML documents were failing to call certain security checks when
  loading new content.  This could result in certain resources being
  loaded that would otherwise violate security policies set by the
  browser or installed add-ons.
  This issue has not been fixed in Firefox 3.0
