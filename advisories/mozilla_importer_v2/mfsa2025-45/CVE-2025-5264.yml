  - CVE-2025-5264
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Due to insufficient escaping of the newline character in the “Copy as cURL” feature, an attacker could trick a user into using this command, potentially leading to local code execution on the user's system.
