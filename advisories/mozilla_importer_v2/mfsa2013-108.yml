summary: |
  Security researchers Tyson Smith and Jesse
  Schwartzentruber of the BlackBerry Security Automated Analysis Team
  used the Address Sanitizer tool while fuzzing to discover a user-after-free when
  interacting with event listeners from the mListeners array. This
  leads to a potentially exploitable crash.

  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
