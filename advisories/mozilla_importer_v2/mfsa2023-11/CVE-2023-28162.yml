  - CVE-2023-28162
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  While implementing AudioWorklets, some code may have casted one type to another, invalid, dynamic type. This could have led to a potentially exploitable crash.
