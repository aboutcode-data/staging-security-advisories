aliases:
  - CVE-2023-28163
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  When downloading files through the Save As dialog on Windows with suggested filenames containing environment variable names, Windows would have resolved those in the context of the current user. *This bug only affects Thunderbird on Windows. Other versions of Thunderbird are unaffected.*
