summary: |
  MFSA 2006-60 reported that RSA digital signatures with a low exponent
  (typically 3) could be forged. This flaw was corrected in the
  Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) library version 3.11.3 used
  by Firefox 2.0 and current development versions of Mozilla clients.
  Ulrich Kuehn reported that Firefox 1.5.0.7, which incorporated
  NSS version 3.10.2, was incompletely patched and remained vulnerable
  to a variant of this attack.
