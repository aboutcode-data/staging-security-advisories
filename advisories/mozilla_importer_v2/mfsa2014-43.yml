summary: "Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported a method\nto use browser navigations\
  \ through history to load a website with that page's\nbaseURI property pointing to that of\
  \ another site instead of the seemingly\nloaded one. The user will continue to see the incorrect\
  \ site in the addressbar\nof the browser. This allows for a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack\
  \ or the theft\nof data through a phishing attack. \n\nIn general this flaw cannot be exploited\
  \ through email in the\nThunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled,\
  \ but is\npotentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts."
