summary: |
  Security researcher Scott Bell used the Address Sanitizer
  tool to discover a use-after-free when using a <select>
  element in a form after it has been destroyed. This could lead to a potentially
  exploitable crash.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
