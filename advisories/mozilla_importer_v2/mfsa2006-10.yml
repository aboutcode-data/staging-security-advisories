summary: |
  Igor Bukanov has audited the JavaScript engine for routines that use
  temporary variables not protected against garbage-collection.
  If malicious content could cause garbage-collection to run during the
  lifetime of these temporaries then the original routine would end up
  operating on freed memory.
  The risk appears remote, but this type of memory corruption could
  potentially be used by an attacker to run arbitrary code including
  the installation of malware.
  Thunderbird shares the JavaScript engine with Firefox
  and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
  the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
  JavaScript in mail.
  Update (29 July 2006)
  Added reference to bug 313500 which was part of this audit.
