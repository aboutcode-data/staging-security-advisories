summary: |
  An anonymous researcher, via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative
  program, reported a vulnerability in Mozilla's garbage collection
  process.  The vulnerability was caused by improper memory management
  of a set of cloned XUL DOM elements which were linked as a parent and
  child.  After reloading the browser on a page with such linked
  elements, the browser would crash when attempting to access an object
  which was already destroyed.  An attacker could use this crash to run
  arbitrary code on the victim's computer.
  This vulnerability does not affect Firefox 2,
  Thunderbird 2, or released versions of SeaMonkey.
