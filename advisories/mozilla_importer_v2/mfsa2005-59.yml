summary: |
  URLs passed to Linux versions of Firefox and Thunderbird on the command-line were
  not correctly protected against interpretation by the shell. As a result
  a malicious URL can result in the execution of shell commands with
  the privileges of the user. If Firefox is set as the default handler for
  web URLs then opening a URL in another program (for example, links
  in a mail or chat client) can result in shell command execution.
