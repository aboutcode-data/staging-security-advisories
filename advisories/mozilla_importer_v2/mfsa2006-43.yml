summary: |
  Web content could access the nsISelectionPrivate interface of the Selection
  object and use it to add a SelectionListener. The listener would be called when
  the user did a "Find" on the page or a "select all", and as intended this
  shouldn't cause any problems. But as with escaping the PAC sandbox
  in MFSA 2006-31 and content-defined DOM setters in
  MFSA 2006-37 moz_bug_r_a4 figured a way to
  leverage the fact that the notifications were created in a privileged context
  into arbitrary code execution.
