aliases:
  - CVE-2017-7755
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  The Firefox installer on Windows can be made to load malicious DLL files stored in the same directory as the installer when it is run. This allows privileged execution if the installer is run with elevated privileges. *Note: This attack only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*
