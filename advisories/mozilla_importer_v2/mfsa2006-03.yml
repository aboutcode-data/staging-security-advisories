summary: |
  Web pages with extremely long titles--the public demonstration
  had a title 2.5 million characters long--cause subsequent
  launches of the browser to appear to "hang" for up to a few
  minutes, or even crash if the computer has insufficient memory.
  Once affected this condition will recur every time the browser
  is started until the item expires from the saved browsing history
  or the user deletes the file history.dat from
  the user profile directory.
  Update (13 April 2006)
  Updated versions of Firefox 1.0 and the Mozilla Suite 1.7
  have been released containing this fix.
