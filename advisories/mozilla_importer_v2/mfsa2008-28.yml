summary: |
  Security researcher Gregory Fleischer reported a
  vulnerability in the way Mozilla indicates the origin of a document to the
  Java Embedding Plugin (JEP) that ships with Firefox on Mac OS X. This
  vulnerability could allow a malicious Java applet to bypass the same-origin
  policy and create arbitrary socket connections to other domains.
