summary: |
  Security researcher Michal Zalewski demonstrated
  that timer-enabled security dialogs can be subverted by attackers using
  JavaScript to change the window focus.  Zalewski showed that a user
  could be tricked into confirming a security dialog of this type by
  bringing the dialog back into focus right before a user clicked in
  a predictable time and place.
