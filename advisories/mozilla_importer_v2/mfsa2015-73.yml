summary: |
  Security researcher Muneaki Nishimura reported an issue with Gaia's System app
  which allows an attacker to inject HTML code into the System app's context via specially-crafted
  search links. The injection occurs when the user opens such malicious link in the browser and then
  presses the HOME button or uses the Show Windows function.
