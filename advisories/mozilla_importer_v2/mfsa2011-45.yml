summary: |
  University of California, Davis researchers Liang Cai
  and Hao Chen presented a paper at the 2011 USENIX HotSec
  workshop on inferring keystrokes from device motion data on mobile devices.
  Web pages can now receive data similar to the apps studied in that paper
  and likely present a similar risk. We have decided to limit motion data
  events to the currently-active tab to prevent the possibility of background
  tabs attempting to decipher keystrokes the user is entering into the
  foreground tab.
