summary: |
  Yosuke Hasegawa reported that the Mozilla browser engine
  mishandled invalid sequences in the Shift-JIS encoding. When encountering an
  invalid pair Mozilla would turn the entire two-byte sequence into a single
  unknown character rather than an unknown character followed by a valid
  single-byte character. On some sites attackers may have been able to
  end their input with the first byte of a two byte sequence; when that
  input was later put into a page context it might cause the following
  delimiter (such as a double-quote) to be consumed, breaking the format
  of the page.  Depending on the page this could potentially be used to
  steal data or inject script into the page.
