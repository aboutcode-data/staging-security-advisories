summary: |
  As part of the Firefox 1.5.0.2 release we fixed several crash bugs to
  improve the stability of the product, with a particular focus on
  finding crashes caused by DHTML. Some of these crashes showed
  evidence of memory corruption that we presume could be exploited
  to run arbitrary code with enough effort.
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
  and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
  the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
  JavaScript in mail.
