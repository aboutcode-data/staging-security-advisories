summary: |
  Security researcher Ucha Gobejishvili reported a denial of service
  (DOS) attack when doing certain WebGL operations in a canvas requiring an unusually large
  amount buffer to be allocated from video memory. This resulted in memory resource
  exhaustion with some Intel video cards, requiring the computer to be rebooted to return
  functionality. This was resolved by putting in additional checks on the amount of memory
  to be allocated during graphics processing.
  This issue was limited to a subset of Intel drivers on Linux. Other
  operating systems were not affected.
  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
