summary: "Mozilla developer Blake Kaplan reported that the \nwindow.location object was made\
  \ a normal overridable JavaScript object\nin the Firefox 3.6 browser engine (Gecko 1.9.2)\
  \ because new mechanisms\nwere developed to enforce the same-origin policy between windows\
  \ and frames.\nThis object is unfortunately also used by some plugins to determine the page\n\
  origin used for access restrictions. A malicious page could override this\nobject to fool\
  \ a plugin into granting access to data on another site or the\nlocal file system. The behavior\
  \ of older Firefox versions has been restored.\n\nThis flaw does not affect earlier versions\
  \ of Firefox, or other\nprograms such as Thunderbird or SeaMonkey built on older versions\n\
  of the browser engine."
