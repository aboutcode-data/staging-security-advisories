aliases:
  - CVE-2020-15682
summary: When a link to an external protocol was clicked, a prompt was presented that allowed
  the user to choose what application to open it in. An attacker could induce that prompt to
  be associated with an origin they didn't control, resulting in a spoofing attack. This was
  fixed by changing external protocol prompts to be tab-modal while also ensuring they could
  not be incorrectly associated with a different origin.
