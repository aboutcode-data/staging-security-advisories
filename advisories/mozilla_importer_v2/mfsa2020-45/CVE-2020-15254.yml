  - CVE-2020-15254
summary: In the crossbeam rust crate, the bounded channel incorrectly assumed that Vec::from_iter
  had allocated capacity that was the same as the number of iterator elements. Vec::from_iter
  does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the bounded
  channel reconstructs Vec from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumptions - this is
  unsound and caused a deallocation with the incorrect capacity when Vec::from_iter had allocated
  different sizes than the number of iterator elements. The impact on Firefox is undetermined,
  but in another use case, the behavior was causing corruption of jemalloc structures.
