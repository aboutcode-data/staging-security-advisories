summary: |
  Security researcher regenrecht reported via
  TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that a select event handler for XUL
  tree items could be called after the tree item was deleted.  This
  results in the execution of previously freed memory which an attacker
  could use to crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on the
  victim's computer.
  This vulnerability does not affect Firefox 3.6
