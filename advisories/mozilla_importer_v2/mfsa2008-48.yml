summary: |
  Mozilla developer Georgi Guninski reported that
  the canvas element could be used in conjunction with an HTTP redirect
  to bypass same-origin restrictions and gain access to the content in
  arbitrary images from other domains.  This vulnerability could be used
  by an attacker to steal private information from a victim who is
  logged into a website that stores the data in images.
  Security researchers Michal Zalewski
  and Chris Evans also reported an additional threat
  caused by this vulnerability in which an attacker can enumerate the
  software installed on a victim's computer by using moz-icon as the
  redirection target.
  Firefox 3 is not affected by this issue.
