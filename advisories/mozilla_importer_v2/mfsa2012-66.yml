summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher Mark Goodwin discovered an issue
  with the Firefox developer tools' debugger. If remote debugging is disabled, but
  the experimental HTTPMonitor extension has been installed and enabled, a remote
  user can connect to and use the remote debugging service through the port used
  by HTTPMonitor. A remote-enabled flag has been added to resolve
  this problem and close the port unless debugging is explicitly enabled.
