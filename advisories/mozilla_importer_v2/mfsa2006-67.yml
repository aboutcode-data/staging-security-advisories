summary: |
  shutdown demonstrated that it was possible to modify a
  Script object while it was executing, potentially leading to the
  execution of arbitrary JavaScript bytecode.
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
  and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
  the default setting and we strongly discourage users from enabling
  JavaScript in mail.
  The Firefox 2.0 release is not affected by this vulnerability.
