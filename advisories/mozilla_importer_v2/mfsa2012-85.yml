summary: "Security researcher Abhishek Arya (Inferno) of the Google\nChrome Security Team discovered\
  \ a series of use-after-free, buffer overflow, and\nout of bounds read issues using the Address\
  \ Sanitizer tool in shipped software.\nThese issues are potentially exploitable, allowing\
  \ for remote code execution.\nWe would also like to thank Abhishek for reporting two additional\
  \ use-after-free\nflaws introduced during Firefox 16 development and fixed before general\
  \ release. \n\nIn general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the\nThunderbird\
  \ and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are\npotentially a risk in browser\
  \ or browser-like contexts in those products."
