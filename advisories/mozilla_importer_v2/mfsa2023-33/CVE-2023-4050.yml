  - CVE-2023-4050
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  In some cases, an untrusted input stream was copied to a stack buffer without checking its size. This resulted in a potentially exploitable crash which could have led to a sandbox escape.
