summary: |
  moz_bug_r_a4 reported that the src attribute of an IMG
  element loaded in a frame could be changed to a javascript: URI that was able
  to bypass the protections against cross-site script (XSS) injection.
  The injected script could steal credentials and financial data, or perform
  destructive actions on behalf of a logged-in user.
