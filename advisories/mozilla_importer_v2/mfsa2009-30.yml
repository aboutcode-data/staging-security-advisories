summary: |
  Security researchers Adam Barth and Collin
  Jackson reported that when a file: resource is
  loaded via the location bar it inherits the principal of the
  previously loaded document.  This vulnerability can potentially give
  the newly loaded document additional privileges to access the contents
  of other local files that it wouldn't otherwise have permission to read.

  A potential victim would first have to have downloaded the attackers
  document to their local machine. Then the victim would have to open another
  document in a directory of interest to the attacker before opening the
  attacker's file in the same window.

  Prior to version 3.0, Firefox (like browsers from other
  vendors) treated all local files as having the same origin without
  restriction. This vulnerability is a partial bypass of the restrictions
  implemented in Firefox 3.0
