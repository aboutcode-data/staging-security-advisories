summary: |
  Mozilla intern Julian Hector discovered a regression in the graphics buffer management
  of Firefox OS's graphics layer that would lead to graphics memory corruption by providing negative size
  parameters. JavaScript can not access the graphics layer in a way required to trigger this vulnerability,
  but it could be potentially used in a staged attack.
