summary: |
  Security researcher Alexander Kolesnik reported while the
  Mozilla platform does not yet support TLS connections to TURN and STUN servers,
  the WebRTC implementation would accept turns: and
  stuns: URIs and then attempt plaintext connections to the servers
  when these were used. This can lead to disclosure of credentials through a
  Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack as the connection is not encrypted.
