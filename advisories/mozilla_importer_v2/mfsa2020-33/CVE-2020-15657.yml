  - CVE-2020-15657
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Firefox could be made to load attacker-supplied DLL files from the installation directory.
  This required an attacker that is already capable of placing files in the installation directory.
  *Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*
