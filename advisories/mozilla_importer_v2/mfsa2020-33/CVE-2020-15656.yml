aliases:
  - CVE-2020-15656
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  JIT optimizations involving the Javascript arguments object could confuse later optimizations.
  This risk was already mitigated by various precautions in the code, resulting in this bug rated at only moderate severity.
