  - CVE-2020-15658
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  The code for downloading files did not properly take care of special characters,
  which led to an attacker being able to cut off the file ending at an earlier position, leading to a different file type being downloaded than shown in the dialog.
