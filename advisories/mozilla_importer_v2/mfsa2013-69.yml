summary: "Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported a\nmechanism to execute arbitrary\
  \ code or a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack when\nCertificate Request Message Format (CRMF)\
  \ request is generated in certain\ncircumstances. \n\nIn general these flaws cannot be exploited\
  \ through email in the\nThunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled,\
  \ but are\npotentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products."
