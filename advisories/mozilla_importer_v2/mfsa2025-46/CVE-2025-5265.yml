aliases:
  - CVE-2025-5265
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Due to insufficient escaping of the ampersand character in the “Copy as cURL” feature, an attacker could trick a user into using this command, potentially leading to local code execution on the user's system.*This bug only affects Firefox for Windows. Other versions of Firefox are unaffected.*
