summary: |
  Security researcher Juan Pablo Lopez Yacubian
  reported that the default Windows font used to render the locationbar
  and other text fields was improperly displaying certain Unicode
  characters with tall line-height.  In such cases the tall line-height
  would cause the rest of the text in the input field to be scrolled
  vertically out of view.  An attacker could use this vulnerability to
  prevent a user from seeing the URL of a malicious site.
  Corrie Sloot also independently reported this
  issue to Mozilla.
