aliases:
  - CVE-2024-2616
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  To harden ICU against exploitation, the behavior for out-of-memory conditions was changed to crash instead of attempt to continue.
