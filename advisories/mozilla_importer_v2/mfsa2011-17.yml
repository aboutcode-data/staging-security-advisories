summary: |
  Two crashes that could potentially be exploited to run malicious
  code were found in the WebGL feature and fixed in Firefox 4.0.1.
  In addition the WebGLES libraries could potentially be used to bypass
  a security feature of recent Windows versions. The WebGL feature was
  introduced in Firefox 4; older versions are not affected by these issues.
  Nils reported that the WebGLES libraries in the Windows
  version of Firefox were compiled without ASLR protection. An attacker who
  found an exploitable memory corruption flaw could then use these libraries
  to bypass ASLR on Windows Vista and Windows 7, making the flaw as exploitable
  on those platforms as it would be on Windows XP or other platforms.
