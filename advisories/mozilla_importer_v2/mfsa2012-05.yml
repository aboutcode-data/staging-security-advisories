summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported that frame
  scripts bypass XPConnect security checks when calling untrusted objects. This
  allows for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks through web pages and Firefox
  extensions. The fix enables the Script Security Manager (SSM) to force security
  checks on all frame scripts.

  Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by this
  vulnerability.
