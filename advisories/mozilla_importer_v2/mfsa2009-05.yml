summary: "Developer and Mozilla community member Wladimir Palant\nreported that cookies marked\
  \ HTTPOnly were readable by JavaScript via\nthe XMLHttpRequest.getResponseHeader and \nXMLHttpRequest.getAllResponseHeaders\
  \ APIs.  This vulnerability\nbypasses the security mechanism provided by the HTTPOnly flag\
  \ which\nintends to restrict JavaScript access to document.cookie.\nThe fix prevents the XMLHttpRequest\
  \ feature from accessing the\nSet-Cookie and Set-Cookie2 headers of any response\nwhether\
  \ or not the HTTPOnly flag was set for those cookies."
