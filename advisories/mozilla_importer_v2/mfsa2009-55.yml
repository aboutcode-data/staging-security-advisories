summary: |
  Security researcher Marco C. reported a flaw in
  the parsing of regular expressions used in Proxy Auto-configuration
  (PAC) files.  In certain cases this flaw could be used by an attacker
  to crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on their computer.
  Since this vulnerability requires the victim to have PAC configured in
  their environment with specific regular expressions which can trigger
  the crash, the severity of the issue was determined to be
  moderate.
