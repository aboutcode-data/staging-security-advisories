summary: |
  Using the Address Sanitizer tool, security researcher Atte
  Kettunen from OUSPG discovered a buffer overflow during interaction
  with the Web Audio buffer for playback because of an error in the the amount of
  allocated memory for buffers. This leads to a potentially exploitable crash with
  some audio content.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
