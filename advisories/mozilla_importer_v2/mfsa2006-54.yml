summary: |
  shutdown reports that cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks could be
  performed using the construct XPCNativeWrapper(window).Function(...),
  which created a function that appeared to belong to the window in
  question even after it had been navigated to the target site.
  This vulnerability was introduced during Firefox 1.5 development, it does
  not affect Firefox 1.0 or Mozilla Suite 1.7
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
  and would be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
  the default setting and we strongly discourage users from enabling
  JavaScript in mail.
