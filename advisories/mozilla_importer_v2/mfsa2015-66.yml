summary: |
  Security researcher Ronald Crane reported seven
  vulnerabilities affecting released code that he found through code inspection.
  These included three uses of uninitialized memory, one poor validation
  leading to an exploitable crash, one read of unowned memory in zip files, and
  two buffer overflows. These do not all have clear mechanisms to be exploited
  through web content but are vulnerable if a mechanism can be found to trigger
  them.
