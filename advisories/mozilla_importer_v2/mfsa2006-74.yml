summary: |
  Georgi Guninski reported that long Content-Type headers in external message
  bodies could cause a heap buffer overflow when processing mail headers.
  While working on that code David Bienvenu discovered a similar overflow
  could occur when processing long rfc2047-encoded headers.
  Either overflow could be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
