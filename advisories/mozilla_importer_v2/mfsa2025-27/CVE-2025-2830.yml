summary: |
  By crafting a malformed file name for an attachment in a multipart
  message, an attacker can trick Thunderbird into including a
  directory listing of /tmp when the message is forwarded or edited
  as a new message. This vulnerability could allow attackers to
  disclose sensitive information from the victim's system. This
  vulnerability is not limited to Linux; similar behavior has been
  observed on Windows as well.
