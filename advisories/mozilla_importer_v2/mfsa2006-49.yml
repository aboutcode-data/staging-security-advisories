summary: |
  A VCard attachment with a malformed base64 field (such as a photo) can
  trigger a heap buffer overwrite. These have proven exploitable in the
  past, though in this case the overwrite is accompanied by an integer
  underflow that would attempt to copy more data than the typical machine
  has, leading to a crash.
