summary: |
  Security researcher Tsubasa Iinuma reported a mechanism where the
  displayed addressbar can be spoofed to users. This issue involves using history navigation
  in concert with the Location protocol property. After navigating from a malicious page to
  another, if the user navigates back to the initial page, the displayed URL will not
  reflect the reloaded page. This could be used to trick users into potentially treating the
  page as a different and trusted site.
