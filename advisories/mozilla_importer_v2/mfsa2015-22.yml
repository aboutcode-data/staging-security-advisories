summary: |
  Security researcher Atte Kettunen used the Address Sanitizer
  tool to discover a crash while drawing images through the Cairo graphics library
  while using the DrawTarget function. This can result in a
  segmentation fault due to zero-ing out of memory outside the bounds of the
  image.
