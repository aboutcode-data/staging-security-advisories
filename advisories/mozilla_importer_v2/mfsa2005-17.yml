summary: |
  The installation confirmation dialog shows the source of the software.
  By adding a long, fake "user:pass" in front of the true hostname the
  user might be convinced to trust software that comes from an untrustworthy
  source. This is similar to attempts used in some phishing mail:
  "http://www.mozilla.org@attacker.com/install.xpi".
  By default Firefox only allows install attempts from http://update.mozilla.org,
  a user would need to explicitly allow the spoofing host to initiate
  installs before it could try this trick.
