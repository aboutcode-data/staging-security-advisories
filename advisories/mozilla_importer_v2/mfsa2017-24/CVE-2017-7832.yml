aliases:
  - CVE-2017-7832
summary: The combined, single character, version of the letter 'i' with any of the potential
  accents in unicode, such as acute or grave, can be spoofed in the addressbar by the dotless
  version of 'i' followed by the same accent as a second character with most font sets. This
  allows for domain spoofing attacks because these combined domain names do not display as punycode.
