aliases:
  - CVE-2017-7833
summary: Some Arabic and Indic vowel marker characters can be combined with Latin characters
  in a domain name to eclipse the non-Latin character with some font sets on the addressbar.
  The non-Latin character will not be visible to most viewers. This allows for domain spoofing
  attacks because these combined domain names do not display as punycode.
