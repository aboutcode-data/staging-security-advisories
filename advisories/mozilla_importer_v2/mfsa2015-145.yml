summary: |
  Security researcher Ronald Crane reported an underflow found through
  code inspection. This does not all have a clear mechanism to be exploited through web
  content but could be vulnerable if a means can be found to trigger it.
  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
