summary: |
  Google security researcher Michal Zalewski
  reported that focus() could be used to change a user's
  cursor focus while they are typing, potentially directing their
  keyboard input to an unintended location.  This behavior was also
  present across origins when content from one domain was embedded
  within another via an iframe.  A malicious web page could use this
  behavior to steal keystrokes from a victim while they were typing
  sensitive information such as a password.
