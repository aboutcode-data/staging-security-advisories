summary: |
  Mozilla researcher moz_bug_r_a4 demonstrated that javascript run via
  EvalInSandbox can escape the sandbox and gain elevated privilege by
  calling valueOf() on objects created outside the sandbox and inserted
  into it. Malicious scripts could use these privileges to compromise
  your computer or data.
  In Mozilla clients the primary use for EvalInSandbox is to run the
  Proxy Autoconfig script should one be specified by your network
  administrator. This is a rare option for home users, it is primarily
  used by institutional networks which have a need for remote configuration.
  The popular Greasemonkey extension uses EvalInSandbox to run userscripts
  which manipulate the web pages you visit on your behalf. Using this
  vulnerability a malicious userscript could gain enough privilege to
  install malware, but even when Greasemonkey is working as designed
  a malicious userscript can make life miserable. Only install userscripts
  from sources you can trust.
