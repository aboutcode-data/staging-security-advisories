summary: |
  Mozilla developer Jesse Ruderman demonstrated that
  by tampering with the window.__proto__.__proto__ object,
  one can cause the browser to place a lock on a non-native object,
  leading to a crash. Although we have not demonstrated such control, a
  determined attacker might be able to exploit this crash to run
  arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and
  could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is
  not the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
  JavaScript in mail.
