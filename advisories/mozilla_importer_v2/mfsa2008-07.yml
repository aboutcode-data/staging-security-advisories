summary: |
  Security researcher Gynvael Coldwind of Vexillium
  (crediting help from udevd and porneL)
  demonstrated that BMP images
  could be used to reveal small chunks of uninitialized memory
  that might contain sensitive data from other pages or other
  programs, and that this data could be extracted from the
  image using methods associated with the <canvas>
  feature.

  Because this flaw also affected products from other vendors disclosure
  was delayed until they could release a fix.
  Update: Thunderbird was incorrectly listed as affected by this
  vulnerability. The maliciously formed BMP images would contain
  noise influenced by uninitialized memory as in Firefox, but Thunderbird
  lacks the <canvas> feature necessary for an attacker
  to extract the data from the image.
