summary: |
  Security researcher Armin Ebert reported that the
  location.host property can be set to an arbitrary string after creating an
  invalid data: URI. This allows for a bypass of some same-origin policy
  protections. This issue is mitigated by the data: URI in use and any
  same-origin checks for http: or https: are still enforced
  correctly. As a result cookie stealing and other common same-origin bypass attacks are not
  possible.
