summary: |
  Mozilla developers and community members Andrew McCreight, Randell Jesup,
  and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in
  Firefox 113. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption
  and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been
  exploited to run arbitrary code.
