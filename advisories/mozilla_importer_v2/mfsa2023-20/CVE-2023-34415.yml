aliases:
  - CVE-2023-34415
summary: |
  When choosing a site-isolated process for a document loaded from a
  data: URL that was the result of a redirect, Firefox would load that
  document in the same process as the site that issued the redirect. This
  bypassed the site-isolation protections against Spectre-like attacks
  on sites that host an "open redirect". Firefox no longer follows HTTP
  redirects to data: URLs.
