summary: "Security researcher Holger Fuhrmannek previously reported CVE-2015-0833, which was\
  \ fixed in \nMFSA2015-12. That flaw allowed for the updater to load binary DLL format files\
  \ from\nthe local working directory or from the Windows temporary directories.  During\nthe\
  \ fixing of CVE-2015-0833, the need to ensure that updates use the updater.exe\nfrom the application\
  \ directory was identified to mitigate the potential for\nfurther similar vulnerabilities.\
  \ This change to updater.exe for Windows systems\nhas been made in this release.\n\nThis issue\
  \ is specific to Windows and does not affect Linux or\nOS X systems."
