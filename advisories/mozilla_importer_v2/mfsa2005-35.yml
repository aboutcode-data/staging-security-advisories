summary: |
  When a popup is blocked the user is given the ability to open that one popup
  through the popup-blocking status bar icon and, in Firefox, through
  the infobar. If the popup URL were javascript: selecting "Show javascript:..."
  from the infobar or popup blocking status bar icon menus would run the
  javascript with elevated privileges which could be used to install malicious
  software.
