summary: |
  Security researcher Looben Yang reported a use-after-free error in
  WebRTC that occurs due to timing issues in WebRTC when closing channels. WebRTC may still
  believe is has a datachannel open after another WebRTC function has closed it. This
  results in attempts to use the now destroyed datachannel, leading to a potentially
  exploitable crash.
