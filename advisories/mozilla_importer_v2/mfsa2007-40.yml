summary: |
  Mozilla tester Stephen Donner reported that only users
  who installed Thunderbird 1.5.0.13 using the install package received
  the fix for MFSA 2007-23. Users who upgraded
  to Thunderbird 1.5.0.13 from an earlier version using the automatic update
  mechanism were not protected. If those users browsed the internet using
  Internet Explorer or another similarly affected program and clicked on a
  malicious mailto: link the attacker could potentially execute
  arbitrary code.
