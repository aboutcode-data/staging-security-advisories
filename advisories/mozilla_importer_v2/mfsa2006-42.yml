summary: |
  Masatoshi Kimura reports that the Unicode Byte-order-Mark (BOM) is
  stripped from UTF-8 pages during the conversion to Unicode before
  the parser sees the web page. As a result the parser will see and
  process script tags that web input sanitizers may miss
  because they appear as "scr[BOM]ipt" or similar in the comment code
  on the web site.
  Although Firefox 1.5.0.4 and later will be fixed and no longer
  accept such script tags, web sites will continue to be visited by
  older versions of Firefox and Mozilla browsers. Web sites can protect
  themselves by explicitly setting the character encoding to something other
  than UTF-8, or by adding the Unicode byte-order marks to the repertoire
  of the site's input sanitizer.
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
  and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
  the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
  JavaScript in mail.
