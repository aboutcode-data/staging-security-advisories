summary: |
  A user on the Sla.ckers.org forums named hong reported
  that a file upload control could be filled programmatically by
  switching page focus to the label before a file upload form control
  for selected keyboard events. An attacker could use this trick to steal files
  from the users' computer if the attacker knew the full pathnames to the desired
  fileis and could create a pretext that would convince the user to type
  long enough to produce all the necessary characters.
  This is a variant on a similar problem reported by Charles
  McAuley and independently rediscovered by Michal
  Zalewski that was fixed in Firefox 2.0.0.4.
