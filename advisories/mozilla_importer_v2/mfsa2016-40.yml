summary: |
  Security researcher Holger Fuhrmannek reported an issue where the
  Mozilla Maintenance Service updater on Windows can delete arbitrary files because of its
  privileged system access. This file deletion can then potentially be used for further
  privilege escalation. This flaw requires users to execute a locally saved file in order
  for it to be triggered.

  This issue does not affect non-Windows operating systems.
