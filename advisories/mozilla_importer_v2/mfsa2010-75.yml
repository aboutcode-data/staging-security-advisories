summary: |
  Dirk Heinrich reported that on Windows platforms
  when document.write() was called with a very long string
  a buffer overflow was caused in line breaking routines attempting to
  process the string for display.  Such cases triggered an invalid read
  past the end of an array causing a crash which an attacker could
  potentially use to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
