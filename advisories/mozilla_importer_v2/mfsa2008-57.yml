summary: |
  Security researcher Collin Jackson reported that
  the -moz-binding CSS property can be used to bypass security checks
  which validate codebase principals. Similar to the issue reported
  in MFSA 2008-23, Jackson demonstrated
  that an attacker can replace a stylesheet in a signed JAR which uses
  relative paths, and can then use the -moz-binding property to inject
  malicious script into the JAR.  The injected script will be executed
  with the privileges of the signed JAR.  This vulnerability can thus
  allow an attacker to run arbitrary JavaScript within the context of
  another site.
