summary: |
  Morten Kråkvik of Telenor SOC reported an exploit
  targeting particular versions of Firefox 3.6 on Windows XP that
  Telenor found while investigating an intrusion attempt on a customer
  network. The underlying vulnerability, however, was present on both
  the Firefox 3.5 and Firefox 3.6 development branches and affected all
  supported platforms.
  Reading mail in Thunderbird does not pose a risk to
  users, however the vulnerability is present and could be triggered in
  RSS feeds if JavaScript is enabled or by an add-on that enables
  browser-like functionality.
