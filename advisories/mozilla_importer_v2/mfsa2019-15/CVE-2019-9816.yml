summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  A possible vulnerability exists where type confusion can occur when manipulating JavaScript objects in object groups, allowing for the bypassing of security checks within these groups. *Note: this vulnerability has only been demonstrated with UnboxedObjects, which are disabled by default on all supported releases.*
