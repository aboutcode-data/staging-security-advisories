  - CVE-2019-11694
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  A vulnerability exists in the Windows sandbox where an uninitialized value in memory can be leaked to a renderer from a broker when making a call to access an otherwise unavailable file. This results in the potential leaking of information stored at that memory location. *Note: this issue only occurs on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*
