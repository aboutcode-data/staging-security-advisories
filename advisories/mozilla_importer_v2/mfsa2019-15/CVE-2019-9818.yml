summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  A race condition is present in the crash generation server used to generate data for the crash reporter. This issue can lead to a use-after-free in the main process, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash and a sandbox escape. *Note: this vulnerability only affects Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*
