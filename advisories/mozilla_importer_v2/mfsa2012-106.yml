summary: "Security researcher miaubiz used the Address Sanitizer tool\nto discover a series\
  \ critically rated of use-after-free, buffer overflow, and memory corruption issues in shipped\
  \ software. These issues are potentially exploitable, allowing for remote code execution.\
  \ We would also like to thank miaubiz for reporting two additional use-after-free and memory\
  \ corruption issues introduced during Firefox development that were fixed before general release.\
  \ \n\nIn general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the\nThunderbird and SeaMonkey\
  \ products because scripting is disabled, but are\npotentially a risk in browser or browser-like\
  \ contexts in those products."
