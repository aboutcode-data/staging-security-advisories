summary: |
  Security researcher Takehiro Takahashi of the IBM
  X-Force reported that Mozilla's NTLM implementation was vulnerable to
  reflection attacks in which NTLM credentials from one application
  could be forwarded to another arbitrary application via the browser.
  If an attacker could get a user to visit a web page he controlled he
  could force NTLM authenticated requests to be forwarded to another
  application on behalf of the user.
