summary: |
  Security researcher Holger Fuhrmannek reported that when the
  Mozilla updater is run, the updater can be manipulated to load the updated files from a
  working directory under user control in concert with junctions. When the updates are run
  by the Mozilla Maintenance Service on Windows, these malicious files can be run with
  elevated privileges and be used to replace arbitrary files on the system. This could allow
  for arbitrary code execution by a malicious user with local system access but does not
  allow for exploitation by web content.

  This issue is specific to Windows and does not affect Linux or OS X
  systems.
