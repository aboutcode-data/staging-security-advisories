summary: |
  The HTTP authentication prompt appears above the currently open tab
  regardless of which tab triggered it. A spoofer who could get a user
  to open a high value target in another tab might be able to capture the
  user's ID and password. HTTP auth dialogs are visually distinct from the
  web form logins used by most commercial sites, and the HTTP auth dialog
  clearly states which host it's for. Exploitation of this seems unlikely.
