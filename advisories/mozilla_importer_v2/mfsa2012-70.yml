summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported that
  certain security checks in the location object can be bypassed if chrome code is
  called content in a specific manner. This allowed for the loading of restricted
  content. This can be combined with other issues to become potentially
  exploitable.
