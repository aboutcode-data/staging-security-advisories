summary: |
  Security researcher Gustavo Grieco reported a heap overflow
  in gdk-pixbuf affecting Linux systems using Gnome. This issue is
  triggered by the scaling of a malformed bitmap format image and results in a
  potentially exploitable crash.

  This issue only affects Linux systems running Gnome. Windows and
  OS X operating systems are unaffected.
