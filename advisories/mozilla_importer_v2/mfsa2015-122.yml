summary: |
  Security researcher Michał Bentkowski reported that adding white-space
  characters to hostnames that are IP addresses can bypass same-origin policy. This flaw was
  caused by trailing whitespaces being evaluated differently when parsing IP addresses
  instead of alphanumeric hostnames. This could lead to a cross-site script (XSS) attack.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
