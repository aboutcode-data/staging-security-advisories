summary: |
  Security researcher Armin Ebert reported a flaw in
  Reader mode on Firefox for Android. Reader mode reformats web
  content for easy readability and operates as unprivileged content that is the
  equivalent of the formatted content. When Reader mode is unable to process
  content, it displays the original web pages. Since it is unprivileged, there are
  no restrictions on pages linking to or framing Reader mode content. The reported
  flaw is that privileged URLs can be passed to Reader mode and bypass the normal
  restrictions that prevent web pages from obtaining references to privileged
  contexts. If this issue was combined with another flaw that allowed for a
  violation of the same-origin policy, then the resulting combination could lead
  to arbitrary code execution.

  This flaw only affects Firefox for Android and pre-release
  versions of Desktop Firefox. The released version of desktop Firefox does not
  have reader mode and is not affected.
