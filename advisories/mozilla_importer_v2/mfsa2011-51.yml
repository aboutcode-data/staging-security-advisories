summary: |
  Claus Wahlers reported that random images from GPU memory
  were showing up in WebGL textures. Once incorporated into the WebGL graphics it
  is possible for a site to programmatically read the image data and potentially
  gain sensitive data from other things that had been displayed earlier. This
  problem is due to a bug in the driver for Intel integrated GPUs on recent
  Mac OS X hardware, and the problem can be seen in WebGL implementations from
  other vendors. Mozilla has implemented a work-around to prevent this from
  happening with this hardware-driver combination.
