summary: |
  Images dragged and dropped from a webpage to the desktop preserved
  their original name and extension. If this were an executable extension
  then the file would be executed rather than opened in a media application.
  In order to exploit this the attacker would have to construct a valid
  image that was also a valid executable. On windows this can be done
  using a GIF image concatenated with a batch file. The attacker must
  convince the user to drag the image to their desktop and sometime later
  double click on it without noticing it has an executable icon rather than
  the expected media type image.
