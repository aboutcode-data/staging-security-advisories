summary: |
  Security researcher Soroush Dalili reported that
  the resource: protocol could be exploited to allow directory traversal
  on Windows and the potential loading of resources from non-permitted
  locations. The impact would depend on whether interesting files existed
  in predictable locations in a useful format. For example, the existence
  or non-existence of particular images might indicate whether certain
  software was installed.
