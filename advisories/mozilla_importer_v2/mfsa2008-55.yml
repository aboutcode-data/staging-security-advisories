summary: |
  ling and wushi of team509, via
  TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative program, reported a flaw in part of
  Mozilla's DOM constructing code.  This vulnerability can be exploited
  by modifying certain properties of a file input element before it has
  finished initializing.  When the blur method of the
  modified input element is called, uninitialized memory is accessed by
  the browser, resulting in a crash.  This crash may be used by an
  attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and
  could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is
  not the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
  JavaScript in mail.
