summary: |
  Andrej Andolsek reported that when Firefox
  receives a reply from a SOCKS5 proxy which contains a DNS name longer
  than 15 characters, the subsequent data stream in the response can
  become corrupted.  There was no evidence of memory corruption,
  however, and the severity of the issue was determined to be low.
