summary: |
  Security researcher Nicolas Golubovic reported that the
  Content Security Policy (CSP) of data: documents was not saved as
  part of session restore. If an attacker convinced a victim to open a document
  from a data: URL injected onto a page, this can lead to a
  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. The target page may have a strict CSP that
  protects against this XSS attack, but if the attacker induces a browser crash
  with another bug, an XSS attack would occur during session restoration,
  bypassing the CSP on the site.
