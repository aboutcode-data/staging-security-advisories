summary: |
  Security researcher Cody Crews reported a method to bypass
  System Only Wrappers (SOW) by using XML Binding Language (XBL) content scopes to
  clone protected XUL elements. This could be used to clone anonymous nodes,
  making trusted XUL content web accessible.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled in mail, but is
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
