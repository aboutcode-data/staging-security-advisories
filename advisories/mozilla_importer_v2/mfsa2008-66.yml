summary: |
  Perl developer Chip Salzenberg reported that
  certain control characters, when placed at the beginning of a URL,
  would lead to incorrect parsing resulting in a malformed URL being
  output by the parser.  IBM researchers Justin Schuh,
  Tom Cross, and Peter William also
  reported a related symptom as part of their research that resulted in
  MFSA 2008-37.


  There was no direct security impact from this issue and its effect
  was limited to the improper rendering of hyperlinks containing
  specific characters.  The severity of this issue was determined to be
  low.
