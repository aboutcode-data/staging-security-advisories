summary: |
  Mozilla engineers Tyson Smith and David Keeler
  reported a use-after-poison and buffer overflow in the ASN.1 decoder in Network Security
  Services (NSS). These issues were in octet string parsing and were found through fuzzing
  and code inspection. If these issues were triggered, they would lead to a potentially
  exploitable crash. These issues were fixed in NSS version 3.19.2.1 and 3.19.4, shipped in
  Firefox and Firefox ESR, respectively, as well as NSS 3.20.1.
  Google security engineer Ryan Sleevi reported an integer overflow in
  the Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) due to a lack of checks during memory allocation.
  This leads to a potentially exploitable crash. This issue is fixed in NSPR 4.10.10. The NSPR library is a required component of NSS.
