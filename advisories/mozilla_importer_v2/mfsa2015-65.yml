summary: |
  Security researcher Looben Yang used the Address Sanitizer
  tool to discover two related use-after-free vulnerabilities that occur when
  using XMLHttpRequest in concert with either shared or dedicated workers. These
  errors occur when the XMLHttpRequest object is attached to a worker but that
  object is incorrectly deleted while still in use. This results in exploitable
  crashes.
