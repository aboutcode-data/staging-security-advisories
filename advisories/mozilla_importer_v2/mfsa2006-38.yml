summary: |
  Mikolaj Habryn discovered an array index bug in crypto.signText() that
  results in overflowing an allocated array of pointers by two when optional
  Certificate Authority name arguments are passed in.
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
  and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
  the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
  JavaScript in mail.
