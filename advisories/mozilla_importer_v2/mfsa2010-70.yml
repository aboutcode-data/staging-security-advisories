summary: |
  Security researcher Richard Moore reported that
  when an SSL certificate was created with a common name containing a
  wildcard followed by a partial IP address a valid SSL connection could be
  established with a server whose IP address matched the wildcard range
  by browsing directly to the IP address. It is extremely unlikely that
  such a certificate would be issued by a Certificate Authority.
