summary: |
  Mozilla developer Vladimir Vukicevic reported that
  a canvas element can be used to read data from another site, violating
  the same-origin policy.  The read restriction placed on a canvas
  element which has had cross-origin data rendered into it can be
  bypassed by retaining a reference to the canvas element's context and
  deleting the associated canvas node from the DOM.
