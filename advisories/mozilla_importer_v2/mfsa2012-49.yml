summary: |
  Mozilla developer Bobby Holley found that same-compartment
  security wrappers (SCSW) can be bypassed by passing them to another compartment.
  Cross-compartment wrappers often do not go through SCSW, but have a filtering
  policy built into them. When an object is wrapped cross-compartment, the SCSW is
  stripped off and, when the object is read read back, it is not known that SCSW
  was previously present, resulting in a bypassing of SCSW. This could result in
  untrusted content having access to the XBL that implements browser
  functionality.
