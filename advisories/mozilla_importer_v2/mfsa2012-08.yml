summary: |
  Security researchers Nicolas Grégoire and Aki
  Helin independently reported that when processing a malformed
  embedded XSLT stylesheet, Firefox can crash due to a memory corruption.
  While there is no evidence that this is directly exploitable, there is
  a possibility of remote code execution.
