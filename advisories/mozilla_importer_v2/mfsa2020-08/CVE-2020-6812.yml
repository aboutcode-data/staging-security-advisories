  - CVE-2020-6812
summary: The first time AirPods are connected to an iPhone, they become named after the user's
  name by default (e.g. Jane Doe's AirPods.)  Websites with camera or microphone permission
  are able to enumerate device names, disclosing the user's name. To resolve this issue, Firefox
  added a special case that renames devices containing the substring 'AirPods' to simply 'AirPods'.
