summary: "Mozilla developer Daniel Holbert reported that the\nfix to the plugin parameter array\
  \ crash that was fixed in Firefox\n3.6.7 caused a crash showing signs of memory corruption.\
  \  In certain\ncircumstances, properties in the plugin instance's parameter array\ncould be\
  \ freed prematurely leaving a dangling pointer that the plugin\ncould execute, potentially\
  \ calling into attacker-controlled\nmemory.\nFirefox 3.5.11 was also affected by the regression\n\
  but the equivalent pointer was always initialized to NULL and \nnot exploitable."
