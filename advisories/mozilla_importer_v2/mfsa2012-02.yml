summary: |
  For historical reasons Firefox has been generous in its interpretation of web
  addresses containing square brackets around the host. If this host was not a
  valid IPv6 literal address, Firefox attempted to interpret the host as a regular
  domain name. Gregory Fleischer reported that requests made
  using IPv6 syntax using XMLHttpRequest objects through a proxy may generate
  errors depending on proxy configuration for IPv6. The resulting error messages
  from the proxy may disclose sensitive data because Same-Origin Policy (SOP) will
  allow the XMLHttpRequest object to read these error messages, allowing user
  privacy to be eroded. Firefox now enforces RFC 3986 IPv6 literal syntax and that
  may break links written using the non-standard Firefox-only forms that were
  previously accepted.

  This was fixed previously for Firefox 7.0, Thunderbird 7.0, and
  SeaMonkey 2.4 but only fixed in Firefox 3.6.26 and Thunderbird 3.1.18 during
  2012.
