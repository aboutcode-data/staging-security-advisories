summary: |
  The implementation of E4X introduced an internal "AnyName" object which
  was unintentionally exposed to web content. This singleton object could
  be used by two cooperating domains as a communication channel to get
  around same-origin restrictions that prevent direct access from one
  window or frame to another. This could not be used to violate
  same-origin protection of another window's content, it was simply a
  mutually accessible storage spot. E4X was not supported in Firefox 1.0
  or Mozilla 1.7
  Thunderbird 1.5 could be vulnerable if JavaScript is
  enabled in mail. This is not the default setting and we strongly
  discourage users from turning on JavaScript in mail. Thunderbird
  is not vulnerable in its default configuration.
  Update (13 April 2006)
  This flaw has been fixed in Thunderbird 1.5.0.2
