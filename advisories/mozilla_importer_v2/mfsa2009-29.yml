summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported
  that the owner document of an element can become null after garbage
  collection.  In such cases, event listeners may be executed within the
  wrong JavaScript context.  An attacker could potentially use this
  vulnerability to have a malicious event handler execute arbitrary
  JavaScript with chrome privileges.
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and
  could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is
  not the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
  JavaScript in mail.
