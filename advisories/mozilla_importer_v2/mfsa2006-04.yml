summary: |
  Calling the QueryInterface method of the built-in
  Location and Navigator objects causes memory corruption
  that might be exploitable to run arbitrary code.
  This flaw appears to have been introduced during development
  of Firefox 1.5/SeaMonkey 1.0 -- Firefox 1.0 and the older
  Mozilla Suite 1.7 do not appear to be vulnerable.
  Thunderbird 1.5 could be vulnerable if JavaScript is
  enabled in mail. This is not the default setting and we strongly
  discourage users from turning on JavaScript in mail. Thunderbird
  is not vulnerable in its default configuration.
  Update (7 February 2006)
  H D Moore of the Metasploit Project published a working exploit on milw0rm
  for the Linux and Mac OS X versions of Firefox 1.5. Severity upgraded
  to critical.
  Update (13 April 2006)
  This flaw has been fixed in Thunderbird 1.5.0.2
