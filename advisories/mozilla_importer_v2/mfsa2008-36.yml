summary: |
  Drew Yao of Apple Product Security reported a
  vulnerability in Mozilla graphics code which handles GIF rendering in Mac
  OS X. He demonstrated that a GIF file could be specially crafted to cause
  the browser to free an uninitialized pointer. An attacker could use this
  vulnerability to crash the browser and potentially execute arbitrary code
  on the victim's computer.
  Firefox 2 is not affected by this issue.
