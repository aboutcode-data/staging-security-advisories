summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  During the initialization of a new content process, a race condition occurs that can allow a content process to disclose heap addresses from the parent process. *Note: this issue only occurs on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*
