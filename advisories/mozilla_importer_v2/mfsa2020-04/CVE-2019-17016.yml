aliases:
  - CVE-2019-17016
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  When pasting a <style> tag from the clipboard into a rich text editor, the CSS sanitizer incorrectly rewrites a @namespace rule. This could allow for injection into certain types of websites resulting in data exfiltration.
