summary: |
  Jann Horn of Google Project Zero Security reported that
  speculative execution performed by modern CPUs could leak information through
  a timing side-channel attack. Microsoft Vulnerability Research extended this attack
  to browser JavaScript engines and demonstrated that code on a malicious web
  page could read data from other web sites (violating the same-origin policy) or
  private data from the browser itself.

  Since this new class of attacks involves measuring precise time intervals,
  as a partial, short-term, mitigation we are disabling or reducing the precision of
  several time sources in Firefox. The precision of performance.now()
  has been reduced from 5μs to 20μs, and the SharedArrayBuffer
  feature has been disabled because it can be used to construct a high-resolution
  timer.
  SharedArrayBuffer is already disabled in
  Firefox 52 ESR.
