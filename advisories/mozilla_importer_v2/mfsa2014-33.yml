summary: |
  Security researcher Roee Hay reported that a hyperlink using
  the file: protocol on Firefox for Android could link to a local
  file in the Firefox profile directory. If a user selected this link on their
  device, the linked file would be copied to the SD card without prompting.
  This SD card location is world readable leading to a potential information
  disclosure of files in the Firefox profile through a malicious application.
