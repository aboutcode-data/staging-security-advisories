summary: |
  Security researcher Collin Jackson reported a violation of
  the HTML5 specifications for document.domain behavior. Specified
  behavior requires pages to only have access to windows in a new
  document.domain but the observed violation allowed pages to retain
  access to windows from the page's initial origin in addition to the new
  document.domain. This could potentially lead to cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attacks.

  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
