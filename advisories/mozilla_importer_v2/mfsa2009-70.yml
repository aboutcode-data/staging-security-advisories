summary: "Security researcher David James reported that a\ncontent window which is opened by\
  \ a chrome window retains a reference\nto the chrome window via the window.opener property.\
  \  Using\nthis reference, content in the new window can access functions \ninside the chrome\
  \ window, such as eval, and use these\nfunctions to run arbitrary JavaScript code with chrome\
  \ privileges. In\na stock Mozilla browser a remote attacker can not cause these application\n\
  dialogs to appear nor to automatically load the attack code that takes advantage\nof this\
  \ flaw in window.opener. There may be add-ons which open\npotentially hostile web-content\
  \ in this way, and combined with such an add-on the\nseverity of this flaw could be upgraded\
  \ to Critical."
