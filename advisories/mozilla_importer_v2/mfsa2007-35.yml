summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported that
  it was possible to use the Script object to modify
  XPCNativeWrappers in such a way that subsequent access by the browser
  chrome--such as by right-clicking to open a context menu--can cause
  attacker-supplied javascript to run with the same privileges as the user.
  This is similar to MFSA 2007-25 fixed in
  Firefox 2.0.0.5
