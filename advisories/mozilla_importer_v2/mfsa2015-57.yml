summary: "Mozilla Developer Jed Davis and Mozilla security engineer\nChristoph Diehl reported\
  \ that Mozilla had inherited a\nInter-process Communication (IPC) vulnerability when IPC was\
  \ introduced into\nMozilla products through third-party code. This could allow for privilege\n\
  escalation through IPC channels due to lack of message validation in the\nlistener process.\
  \ \n\nThis issue only affects systems running Windows, leaving Linux\nand OS X unaffected."
