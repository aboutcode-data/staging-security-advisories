summary: |
  Mozilla contributor Masahiro Yamada reported that
  certain invisible control characters were being decoded when displayed
  in the location bar, resulting in fewer visible characters than were
  present in the actual location.  An attacker could use this
  vulnerability to spoof the location bar and display a misleading URL
  for their malicious web page.
  The initial version of this advisory incorrectly listed
  Thunderbird and SeaMonkey as affected products. Firefox is the only
  product affected by this vulnerability.
