summary: "Security researcher regenrecht reported, via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative, a\
  \ use-after-free using the domDoc pointer within Vibrate library. This can lead to arbitrary\
  \ code execution when exploited. \n\nIn general these flaws cannot be exploited through email\
  \ in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially\
  \ a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products."
