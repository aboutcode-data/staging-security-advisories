summary: |
  Security researcher Alex Inführ reported that on
  Firefox for Android it is possible to open links to local files from web content
  by selecting "Open Link in New Tab" from the context menu using the
  file: protocol. The web content would have to know the precise
  location of a malicious local file in order to exploit this issue. This issue
  does not affect Firefox on non-Android systems.
