  - CVE-2024-50336
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  The Matrix specification demands homeservers to perform validation of the server-name and media-id components of MXC URIs with the intent to prevent path traversal. However, it is not mentioned that a similar check must also be performed on the client to prevent client-side path traversal. matrix-js-sdk fails to perform this validation.
