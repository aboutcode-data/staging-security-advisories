summary: |
  Mozilla developer Boris Zbarsky reported that a frame
  named "location" could shadow the window.location object unless a
  script in a page grabbed a reference to the true object before the frame
  was created. Because some plugins use the value of window.location to determine
  the page origin this could fool the plugin into granting the plugin content
  access to another site or the local file system in violation of the Same Origin
  Policy. This flaw allows circumvention of the fix added for
  MFSA 2010-10.
