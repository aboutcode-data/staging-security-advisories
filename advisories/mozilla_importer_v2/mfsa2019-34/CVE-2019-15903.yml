summary: |
  Note: We have updated this advisory on June 26, 2020 to include CVE-2020-12412 and on March 20, 2023 to include CVE-2019-25136, which were fixed in Firefox 70 but not recognized or acknowledged immediately.
  In libexpat before 2.2.8, crafted XML input could fool the parser into changing from DTD parsing to document parsing too early. A subsequent call to XML_GetCurrentLineNumber or XML_GetCurrentColumnNumber then resulted in a heap-based buffer over-read.
