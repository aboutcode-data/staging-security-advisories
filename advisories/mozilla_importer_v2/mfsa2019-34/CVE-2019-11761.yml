  Note: We have updated this advisory on June 26, 2020 to include CVE-2020-12412 and on March 20, 2023 to include CVE-2019-25136, which were fixed in Firefox 70 but not recognized or acknowledged immediately.
  By using a form with a data URI it was possible to gain access to the privileged JSONView object that had been cloned into content. Impact from exposing this object appears to be minimal, however it was a bypass of existing defense in depth mechanisms.
