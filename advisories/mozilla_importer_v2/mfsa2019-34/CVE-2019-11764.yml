summary: |
  Note: We have updated this advisory on June 26, 2020 to include CVE-2020-12412 and on March 20, 2023 to include CVE-2019-25136, which were fixed in Firefox 70 but not recognized or acknowledged immediately.
  Mozilla developers and community members Bob Clary, Jason Kratzer, Aaron Klotz, Iain Ireland, Tyson Smith, Christian Holler, Steve Fink, Honza Bambas, Byron Campen, and Cristian Brindusan reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 69 and Firefox ESR 68.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
