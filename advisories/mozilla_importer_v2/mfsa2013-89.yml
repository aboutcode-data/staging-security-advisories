summary: |
  Security researcher Aki Helin reported that combining
  lists, floats, and multiple columns could trigger a potentially
  exploitable buffer overflow.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
