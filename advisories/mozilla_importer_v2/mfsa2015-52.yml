summary: |
  Security researcher Muneaki Nishimura reported that Firefox
  for Android would write potentially sensitive data to the Android
  logcat that was encoded as part of logged URL strings. On Android
  4.0 or earlier systems, logcat data is available to any application
  having READ_LOGS permission, leading to potential privacy
  violations.

  This does not affect non-Android versions of Firefox and is
  mitigated in versions of Android higher than 4.0.
