summary: Georgi Guninski reported a buffer overflow in the handling of cancelled newsgroup messages.  The
  error was caused by too small a heap buffer being allocated to store message header information.  This
  buffer could be overrun by an attacker using a specially crafted message which could crash
  the mail reader and potentially be used to run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.
