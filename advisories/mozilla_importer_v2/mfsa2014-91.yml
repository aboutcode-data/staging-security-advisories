summary: |
  Mozilla developer Bobby Holley discovered two issues
  involving security wrappers.
  The first of these issues occurs when XrayWrappers filter object properties.
  When validation of the object initially occurs, one set of object properties
  will appear to be available. Later, when the XrayWrappers are removed, a more
  expansive set of properties is available. These are then stored without further
  validation, making these properties available and bypassing security protections
  that would normally protect them from access.

  The second issue occurs when chrome objects are protected by Chrome Object
  Wrappers (COW) and are passed as native interfaces. If this is done with some
  methods, normally protected objects may be accessible to native methods exposed
  to web content.

  Both of these issues could allow web content to access DOM objects that are
  intended to be chrome-only.
