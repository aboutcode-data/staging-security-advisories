summary: |
  Security researcher Simone Fabiano reported that if a
  cross-site XHR or WebSocket is opened on a web server on a non-standard port for
  web traffic while using an IPv6 address, the browser will send an ambiguous
  origin headers if the IPv6 address contains at least 2 consecutive 16-bit fields
  of zeroes. If there is an origin access control list that uses IPv6 literals,
  this issue could be used to bypass these access controls on the server.
