summary: |
  Google security researcher Michal Zalewski
  reported that when a window was opened to a site resulting in a
  network or certificate error page, the opening site could access the
  document inside the opened window and inject arbitrary content.  An
  attacker could use this bug to spoof the location bar and trick a user
  into thinking they were on a different site than they actually
  were.
