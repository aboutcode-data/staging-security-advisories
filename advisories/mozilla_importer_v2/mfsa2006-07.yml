summary: |
  An upgrade in the XML parser introduced a bug that could read
  beyond the end of the buffer, often causing a crash. We don't know if
  this could be exploited to incorporate private data into the DOM of an
  XML document, but could be a privacy risk if so. Firefox 1.0, Thunderbird 1.0
  and Mozilla Suite 1.7 are not affected.
  Update (13 April 2006)
  This flaw has been fixed in Thunderbird 1.5.0.2
