summary: |
  Security researcher Holger Fuhrmannek reported that if the
  Updater opens a MAR
  format file with a specially crafted name, an out-of-bounds write will occur.
  This can lead to a potentially exploitable crash but requires that the malicious
  MAR format file be present on the local system and the Updater to be
  run to use it.
