summary: |
  Security researcher regenrecht reported via
  TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an integer overflow vulnerability
  in the implementation of the XUL <tree>
  element's selection attribute.  When the size of a new
  selection is sufficiently large the integer used in calculating the
  length of the selection can overflow, resulting in a bogus range being
  marked selected.  When adjustSelection is then called on
  the bogus range the range is deleted leaving dangling references to
  the ranges which could be used by an attacker to call into deleted
  memory and run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
