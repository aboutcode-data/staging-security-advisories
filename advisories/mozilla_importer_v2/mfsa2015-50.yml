summary: |
  Security researcher Dougall Johnson reported an
  out-of-bounds read and write in asm.js during JavaScript validation
  due to an error in how heap lengths are defined. This results in a potentially
  exploitable crash and could allow for the reading of random memory which may
  contain sensitive data.
