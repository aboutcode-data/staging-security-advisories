summary: |
  Mozilla developer Tim Taubert used the Address Sanitizer tool and
  software fuzzing to discover a use-after-free vulnerability while processing DER encoded
  keys in the Network Security Services (NSS) libraries. The vulnerability overwrites the
  freed memory with zeroes. This issue has been addressed in NSS 3.21.1, shipping in Firefox
  45.
