summary: |
  The Firefox 2.0.0.10 update contains fixes for three bugs
  that improve the stability of the product. These crashes showed
  some evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances
  and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these
  could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
