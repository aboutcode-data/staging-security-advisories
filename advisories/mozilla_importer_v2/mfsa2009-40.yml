summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported
  a series of vulnerabilities in which objects that normally receive
  a XPCCrossOriginWrapper are constructed without the
  wrapper.  This can lead to cases where JavaScript from one website may
  unsafely access properties of such an object which had been set by a
  different website.  A malicious website could use this vulnerability
  to launch a XSS attack and run arbitrary JavaScript within the context
  of another site.
