summary: |
  An interaction between XUL content windows and the new faster history
  mechanism in Firefox 1.5 caused those windows to become translucent.
  This could be used to construct spoofs that could trick users into
  interacting with browser UI they can't see. It's possible a
  clever game-type presentation could persuade an unsuspicious
  user into some combination of actions that would result in
  running the attacker's code.
  Firefox 1.0 and the Mozilla Suite 1.7 are not vulnerable.
