aliases:
  - CVE-2019-9801
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Firefox will accept any registered Program ID as an external protocol handler and offer to launch this local application when given a matching URL on Windows operating systems. This should only happen if the program has specifically registered itself as a "URL Handler" in the Windows registry.  *Note: This issue only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*
