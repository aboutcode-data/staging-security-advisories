summary: |
  Security researcher Georgi Guninski reported an issue with
  Java applets where in some circumstances the applet could access files on the
  local system when loaded using the a file:/// URI and violate file
  origin policy due to interaction with the codebase parameter. This
  affects applets running on the local file system. Mozilla developer John
  Schoenick later discovered that fixes for this issue were inadequate
  and allowed the invocation of Java applets to bypass security checks in
  additional circumstances. This could lead to untrusted Java applets having
  read-only access on the local files system if used in conjunction with a method
  to download a file to a known or guessable path.
  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
