  Matt Haggard reported that
  the statusText property of an XMLHttpRequest
  object is readable by the requester even when the request is made
  across origins.  This status information reveals the presence of a web
  server and could be used to gather information about servers on
  internal private networks.
  This issue was also independently reported to Mozilla
  by Nicholas Berthaume
