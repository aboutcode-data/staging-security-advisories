summary: |
  Mateusz Jurczyk of the Google Security Team used the Address
  Sanitizer tool to discover a series of memory safety bugs in the FreeType
  library, some of which could cause memory corruption and exploitable crashes
  with certain fonts and font parsing. Firefox Mobile has been upgraded to
  FreeType version 2.4.9 which addresses these issues. Desktop Firefox does not
  use Freetype for fonts and was not affected.

  On Linux systems, Firefox will use the installed system library for FreeType. Linux users should make sure they are current on system security updates.
