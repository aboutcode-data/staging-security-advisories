summary: |
  Google security researcher Michal Zalewski
  reported two methods for spoofing the contents of the location bar.
  The first method works by opening a new window containing a resource
  that responds with an HTTP 204 (no content) and then using the
  reference to the new window to insert HTML content into the blank
  document.  The second location bar spoofing method does not require that the
  resource opened in a new window respond with 204, as long as the
  opener calls window.stop() before the document is loaded.
  In either case a user could be mislead as to the correct location of
  the document they are currently viewing.
  Security researcher Jordi Chancel reported that
  the location bar could be spoofed to look like a secure page when the
  current document was served via plaintext.  The vulnerability is
  triggered by a server by first redirecting a request for a plaintext
  resource to another resource behind a valid SSL/TLS certificate.  A
  second request made to the original plaintext resource which is
  responded to not with a redirect but with JavaScript
  containing history.back()
  and history.forward() will result in the plaintext
  resource being displayed with valid SSL/TLS badging in the location
  bar.
