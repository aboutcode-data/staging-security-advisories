summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher Frederik Braun discovered that
  since Firefox 15 the file system location of the active browser profile was
  available to JavaScript workers. While not dangerous by itself, this could
  potentially be combined with other vulnerabilities to target the profile in an
  attack.

  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
