summary: "Compiler Engineer Dan Gohman of Google reported that binary\nsearch algorithms in\
  \ the SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine were prone to overflow\nin several places, leading to\
  \ potential out-of-bounds array access. While none\nof these are known to be directly exploitable,\
  \ they are unsafe in theory and\nhave been changed as part of general security improvements.\
  \ \n\nIn general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the\nThunderbird and Seamonkey\
  \ products because scripting is disabled, but are\npotentially a risk in browser or browser-like\
  \ contexts."
