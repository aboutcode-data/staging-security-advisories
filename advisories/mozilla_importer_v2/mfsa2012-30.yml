summary: |
  Mozilla community member Ms2ger found an image rendering
  issue with WebGL when texImage2D uses use JSVAL_TO_OBJECT on arbitrary objects.
  This can lead to a crash on a maliciously crafted web page. While there is no
  evidence that this is directly exploitable, there is a possibility of remote
  code execution.
