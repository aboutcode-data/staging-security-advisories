summary: |
  Security researcher Mario Heiderich reported an issue where the
  security protections of Reader mode in Firefox can be bypassed, allowing scripts to be
  run. Mozilla developer Frederik Braun independently discovered and
  reported this same issue as well. This issue happens even though Reader View explicitly
  disables script for rendered pages through a whitelist of allowed HTML content. Mario
  discovered that the whitelist was too permissive and a malicious site could manipulate
  content to bypass CSP protections, allowing for possible cross-site scripting (XSS)
  attacks.
