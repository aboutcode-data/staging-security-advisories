aliases:
  - CVE-2025-5986
summary: |
  A crafted HTML email using mailbox:/// links can trigger automatic,
  unsolicited downloads of .pdf files to the user's desktop or home
  directory without prompting, even if auto-saving is disabled. This
  behavior can be abused to fill the disk with garbage data (e.g. using
  /dev/urandom on Linux) or to leak Windows credentials via SMB links
  when the email is viewed in HTML mode. While user interaction is
  required to download the .pdf file, visual obfuscation can conceal
  the download trigger. Viewing the email in HTML mode is enough to
  load external content.
