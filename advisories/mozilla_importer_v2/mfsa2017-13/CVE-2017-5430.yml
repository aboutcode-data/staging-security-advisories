  - CVE-2017-5430
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Jon Coppeard, Milan Sreckovic, Tyson Smith, Ronald Crane, Randell Jesup, Philipp, Tooru Fujisawa, and Kan-Ru Chen reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 52, Firefox ESR 52, and Thunderbird 52. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
