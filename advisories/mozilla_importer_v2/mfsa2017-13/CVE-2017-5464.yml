summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  During DOM manipulations of the accessibility tree through script, the DOM tree can become out of sync with the accessibility tree, leading to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.
