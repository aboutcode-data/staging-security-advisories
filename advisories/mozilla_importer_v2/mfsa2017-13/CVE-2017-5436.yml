summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  An out-of-bounds write in the Graphite 2 library triggered with a maliciously crafted Graphite font. This results in a potentially exploitable crash. This issue was fixed in the Graphite 2 library as well as Mozilla products.
