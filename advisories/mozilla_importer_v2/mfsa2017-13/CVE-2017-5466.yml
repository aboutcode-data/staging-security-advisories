aliases:
  - CVE-2017-5466
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  If a page is loaded from an original site through a hyperlink and contains a redirect to a data:text/html URL, triggering a reload will run the reloaded data:text/html page with its origin set incorrectly. This allows for a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.
