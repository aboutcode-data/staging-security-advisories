  - CVE-2023-34414
summary: "The error page for sites with invalid TLS certificates was missing the\nactivation-delay\
  \ Firefox uses to protect prompts and permission dialogs\nfrom attacks that exploit human\
  \ response time delays. If a malicious\npage elicited user clicks in precise locations immediately\
  \ before\nnavigating to a site with a certificate error and made the renderer\nextremely busy\
  \ at the same time, it could create a gap between when\nthe error page was loaded and when\
  \ the display actually refreshed.\nWith the right timing the elicited clicks could land in\
  \ that gap and \nactivate the button that overrides the certificate error for that site."
