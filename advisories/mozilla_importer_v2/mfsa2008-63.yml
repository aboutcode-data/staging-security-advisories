summary: |
  Security researcher Hish reported that
  the persist attribute in XUL elements can be used to
  store cookie-like information on a user's computer which could later
  be read by a website.  This creates a privacy issue for users who have
  a non-standard cookie preference and wish to prevent sites from
  setting cookies on their machine.  Even with cookies turned off, this
  issue could be used by a website to write persistent data in a user's
  browser and track the user across browsing sessions.  Additionally,
  this issue could allow a website to bypass the limits normally placed
  on cookie size and number.
