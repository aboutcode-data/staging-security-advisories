summary: |
  Security researcher wushi of team509 reported a
  heap buffer overflow in code routines responsible for transforming
  text runs.  A page could be constructed with a bidirectional text run
  which upon reflow could result in an incorrect length being calculated
  for the run of text.  When this value is subsequently used to allocate
  memory for the text too small a buffer may be created potentially
  resulting in a buffer overflow and the execution of attacker
  controlled memory.
