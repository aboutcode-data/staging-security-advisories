summary: |
  Security researcher Nils reported via
  TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that the XUL tree
  method _moveToEdgeShift was in some cases triggering
  garbage collection routines on objects which were still in use.  In
  such cases, the browser would crash when attempting to access a
  previously destroyed object and this crash could be used by an
  attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
  This vulnerability was used by the reporter to win the
  2009 CanSecWest Pwn2Own contest.
  This vulnerability does not affect Firefox 2,
  Thunderbird 2, or released versions of SeaMonkey.
