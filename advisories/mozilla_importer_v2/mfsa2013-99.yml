summary: |
  Security researcher Cody Crews discovered a method to append
  an iframe into an embedded PDF object rendered with the chrome
  privileged PDF.js. This can used to bypass security restrictions to
  load local or chrome privileged files and objects within the embedded PDF
  object. This can lead to information disclosure of local system files.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but is
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
