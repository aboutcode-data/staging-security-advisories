summary: |
  Security researcher Paul Stone reported an attack where an
  HTML page hosted on a Windows share and then loaded could then load Windows
  shortcut files (.lnk) in the same share. These shortcut files could then link to
  arbitrary locations on the local file system of the individual loading the HTML
  page. That page could show the contents of these linked files or directories
  from the local file system in an iframe, causing information disclosure.

  This issue could potentially affect Linux machines with samba
  shares enabled.
