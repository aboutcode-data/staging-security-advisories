summary: |
  Mozilla engineer Matt Wobensmith discovered that when the
  getUserMedia permission dialog for an iframe appears
  in one domain, it  will display its origin as that of the top-level document and
  not the calling framed page. This could lead to users incorrectly giving camera
  or microphone permissions when confusing the requesting page's location for a
  hosting one's.
