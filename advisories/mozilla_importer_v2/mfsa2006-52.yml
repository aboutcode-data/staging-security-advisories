summary: |
  moz_bug_r_a4 reports that a malicious Proxy AutoConfig (PAC) server could
  serve a PAC script that can execute code with elevated privileges by
  setting the required FindProxyForURL function to the eval method on
  a privileged object that leaked into the PAC sandbox. By redirecting
  the victim to a specially-crafted URL -- easily done since the PAC script
  controls which proxy to use -- the URL "hostname" can be executed as
  privileged script.
  A malicious proxy server can perform spoofing attacks on the user so
  it was already important to use a trustworthy PAC server.
