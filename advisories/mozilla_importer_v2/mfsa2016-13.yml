summary: |
  Jason Pang of OneSignal reported that service workers
  intercept responses to plugin network requests made through the browser.
  Plugins which make security decisions based on the content of network requests
  can have these decisions subverted if a service worker forges responses to those
  requests. For example, a forged crossdomain.xml could allow a
  malicious site to violate the same-origin policy using the Flash plugin.
