summary: |
  Mozilla developer Jeff Walden reported that in Gecko's implementation
  of ECMAScript 5 API's enforces non-configurable properties with logic specific to each API.
  Scripts that do not go through these APIs can bypass these protections and make changes to
  the immutable properties in violation of security protections. This could potentially
  allow for web content to run in a privileged context leading to arbitrary code execution.
