summary: |
  Security researcher Nils reported a potentially exploitable
  use-after-free in an early test version of Firefox 25. Mozilla developer
  Bobby Holley found that the cause was an older garbage collection
  bug that a more recent change made easier to trigger.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
