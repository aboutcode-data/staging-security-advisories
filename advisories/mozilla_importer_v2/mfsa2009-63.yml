summary: |
  Mozilla upgraded several third party libraries used in media
  rendering to address multiple memory safety and stability bugs
  identified by members of the Mozilla community.  Some of the bugs
  discovered could potentially be used by an attacker to crash a
  victim's browser and execute arbitrary code on their
  computer.  liboggz, libvorbis,
  and liboggplay were all upgraded to address these
  issues.
  Audio and video capabilities were added in Firefox 3.5
  so prior releases of Firefox were not affected.
