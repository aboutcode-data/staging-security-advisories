summary: |
  Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski reported that it is
  possible to compile a user-defined function in the XBL scope of a specific
  element and then trigger an event within this scope to run code. In some
  circumstances, when this code is run, it can access content protected by System
  Only Wrappers (SOW) and chrome-privileged pages. This could potentially lead to
  arbitrary code execution. Additionally, Chrome Object Wrappers (COW) can be
  bypassed by web content to access privileged methods, leading to a cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attack from privileged pages.
  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
