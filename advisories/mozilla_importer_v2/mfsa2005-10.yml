summary: |
  Clicking on javascript: links in Thunderbird launched the default
  handler for that scheme registered with the OS. On the Windows operating
  system Internet Explorer is the default handler for the javascript:
  scheme even when Firefox is the default browser.
  The risk associated with this depends on vulnerabilities in the
  installed version of Internet Explorer.
