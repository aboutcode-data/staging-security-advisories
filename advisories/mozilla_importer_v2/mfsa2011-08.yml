summary: |
  Security researcher Roberto Suggi Liverani
  reported that ParanoidFragmentSink, a class used to
  sanitize potentially unsafe HTML for display,
  allows javascript: URLs and other inline JavaScript when
  the embedding document is a chrome document.  While there are no
  unsafe uses of this class in any released products, extension code
  could have potentially used it in an unsafe manner.
