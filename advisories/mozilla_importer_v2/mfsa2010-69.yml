summary: |
  Security researcher Eduardo Vela Nava reported that
  if a web page opened a new window and used a javascript: URL to make a
  modal call, such as alert(), then subsequently navigated
  the page to a different domain, once the modal call returned the
  opener of the window could get access to objects in the navigated
  window.  This is a violation of the same-origin policy and could be
  used by an attacker to steal information from another web site.
