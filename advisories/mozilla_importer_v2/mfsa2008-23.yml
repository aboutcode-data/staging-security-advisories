summary: |
  Security researchers Collin Jackson and
  Adam Barth reported a series of vulnerabilities which
  allow JavaScript to be injected into the context of signed JARs and
  executed under the context of the JAR's signer.  This could allow an
  attacker to run JavaScript in a victim's browser with the privileges
  of a different website, provided the attacker possesses a JAR signed
  by the other website.
  One variant allowed JavaScript to be injected into documents inside
  a signed JAR file.  An additional vulnerability exploited signed JAR files
  which use relative URLs to JavaScript files. An attacker could use this
  vulnerability to trick the browser into treating an attacker-controlled
  JavaScript file as the file the signed JAR intended to reference.
