summary: |
  Firefox user zbyte reported a crash that we determined
  could result in an exploitable memory corruption problem. In certain cases
  after a return from a native function, such as escape(), the
  Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler could get into a corrupt state. This could be
  exploited by an attacker to run arbitrary code such as installing malware.

  We would like to thank community members Lucas
  Kruijswijk and Nochum Sossonko for isolating
  the problematic script from the original crashing site.

  This vulnerability does not affect earlier versions of Firefox which
  do not support the JIT feature.
