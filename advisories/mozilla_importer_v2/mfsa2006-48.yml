summary: |
  H. D. Moore reported a testcase that was able to trigger a race
  condition where JavaScript garbage collection deleted a temporary
  variable still being used in the creation of a new Function object.
  The resulting use of a deleted object may be potentially exploitable
  to run native code provided by the attacker.
  This vulnerability was introduced during Firefox 1.5 development, it does
  not affect Firefox 1.0 or Mozilla Suite 1.7
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
  and would be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
  the default setting and we strongly discourage users from enabling
  JavaScript in mail.
