summary: |
  Mozilla contributor Chris Thomas demonstrated that it was
  possible to have a background tab create a borderless XUL pop-up in front of
  the active tab in the user's browser. This technique could be used by an
  attacker to spoof form elements such as a login prompt for a site opened
  in a different tab and steal the user's login credentials for that site.
