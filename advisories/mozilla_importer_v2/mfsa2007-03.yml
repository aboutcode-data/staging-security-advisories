summary: |
  Aad reported that two web pages can collide in the disk cache
  with the result that depending on order loaded the end of the longer
  document can be appended to the shorter when the shorter is reloaded from
  the cache. It is possible a determined hacker could construct a targeted
  attack to steal some sensitive data from a particular web page (for example,
  transaction history from a financial account). The potential victim would
  have to be already logged into the targeted service (or be fooled into doing
  so) and then visit the malicious site.
  We have not calculated how much effort would be required to compute a colliding
  URL on a different host from the target page.
