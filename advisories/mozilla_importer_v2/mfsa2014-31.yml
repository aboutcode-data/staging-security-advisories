summary: |
  Security researcher Jüri Aedla, via TippingPoint's
  Pwn2Own contest, reported that TypedArrayObject does not handle the
  case where ArrayBuffer objects are neutered, setting their length
  to zero while still in use. This leads to out-of-bounds reads and writes into
  the JavaScript heap, allowing for arbitrary code execution.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but is
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
