summary: |
  Mozilla add-on developer Pavel Cvrcek reported
  that certain invalid unicode characters, when used as part of an IDN,
  are displayed as whitespace in the location bar.  This whitespace
  could be used to force part of the URL out of view in the location
  bar.  An attacker could use this vulnerability to spoof the location
  bar and display a misleading URL for their malicious web page.
