summary: |
  Security researcher Abhishek Arya (Inferno) of the Google
  Chrome Security Team used the Address Sanitizer tool to report an out-of-bounds
  read and an out-of-bounds write when rendering an improperly formatted SVG
  graphic. This could potentially allow the attacker to read uninitialized memory.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
