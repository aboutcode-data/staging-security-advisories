summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher Jesse Ruderman discovered that using the toString function of XBL objects can lead to inappropriate information leakage by revealing the address space layout instead of just the ID of the object. This layout information could potentially be used to bypass ASLR and other security protections.

  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
