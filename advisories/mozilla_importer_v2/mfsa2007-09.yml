summary: |
  moz_bug_r_a4 reports that the fix for

  MFSA 2006-72 in Firefox 1.5.0.9 and Firefox 2.0.0.1
  introduced a regression that allows scripts from web content
  to execute arbitrary code by setting the src
  attribute of an IMG tag to a specially crafted
  javascript: URI.
  The same regression also caused javascript: URIs in
  IMG tags to be executed even if JavaScript
  execution was disabled in the global preferences. This facet was
  noted by moz_bug_r_a4 and reported independently by
  Anbo Motohiko.
  Thunderbird is not affected by this flaw as it will not execute
  javascript: URIs in IMG tags.
