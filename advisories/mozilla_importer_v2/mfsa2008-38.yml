summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported
  that the same-origin check in nsXMLDocument::OnChannelRedirect()
  could be bypassed.  This vulnerability could be used to execute JavaScript
  in the context of a different website.
  Firefox 3 is not affected by this issue
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and
  could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
  the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
  JavaScript in mail.
