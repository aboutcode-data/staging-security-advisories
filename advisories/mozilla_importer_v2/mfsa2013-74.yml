summary: |
  Security researcher Robert Kugler reported
  in 2012 that when a specifically named DLL file on a Windows computer is
  placed in the default downloads directory with the Firefox installer, the
  Firefox installer will load this DLL file when it is launched. Mozilla
  developers Brian Bondy and Robert Strong then
  discovered that the stub installer was vulnerable to this same issue with a
  number of DLL files and there were additionally vulnerable named DLL files with
  the full installer. In circumstances where an installer is run by an
  administrator privileged account, this allows for a downloaded DLL file to be
  run with those administrator privileges.
