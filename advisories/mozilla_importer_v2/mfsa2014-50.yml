summary: |
  Security researcher Jordi Chancel reported a mechanism where
  the cursor can be rendered invisible after it has been used on an embedded flash
  object when used outside of the object. This flaw can be in used in combination
  with an image of the cursor manipulated through JavaScript, leading to
  clickjacking during interactions with HTML content subsequently. This issue only
  affects OS X and is not present on Windows or Linux systems.
