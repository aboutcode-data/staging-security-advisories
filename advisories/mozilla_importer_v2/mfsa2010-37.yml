summary: |
  Security researcher J23 reported via
  TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the code used to store
  the names and values of plugin parameter elements.  A malicious page
  could embed plugin content containing a very large number of parameter
  elements which would cause an overflow in the integer value counting
  them.  This integer is later used in allocating a memory buffer used
  to store the plugin parameters.  Under such conditions, too small a
  buffer would be created and attacker-controlled data could be written
  past the end of the buffer, potentially resulting in code
  execution.
