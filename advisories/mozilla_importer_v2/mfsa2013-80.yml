summary: "Mozilla developer Masayuki Nakano discovered that the\nNativeKey widget continues\
  \ handling key messages even when it is\ndestroyed by dispatched event listeners. This could\
  \ result in some key events\nbeing applied to other objects or plugins if the widget memory\
  \ is reallocated to\nthem, leading to a non-exploitable crash. \n\nIn general this flaw cannot\
  \ be exploited through email in the\nThunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but\
  \ is potentially a risk in\nbrowser or browser-like contexts."
