summary: |
  Security researcher Samuel Groß reported an integer overflow error in
  WebSockets during data buffering on incoming packets when an allocated buffer is resized
  incorrectly. This results in the buffer array holding the data being shrunk, instead of
  grown, resulting in attacker controlled data being written at a known offset from the
  newly allocated buffer. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.
