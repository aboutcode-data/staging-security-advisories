summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported
  that the wrapper class XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper (SJOW) on
  the Mozilla 1.9.1 development branch has a logical error in its
  scripted function implementation that allows the caller to run the
  function within the context of another site.  This is a violation of
  the same-origin policy and could be used to mount an XSS attack.
