summary: |
  Frederik Braun of Mozilla discovered a bug in the
  lockscreen state logic that allows an attacker to bypass the lockscreen
  delay. The delay was introduced to make it harder to brute-force the
  passcode lock of a Firefox OS device when an attacker has gained physical
  access. A successful attack would render that tar-pitting mechanism
  ineffective.
