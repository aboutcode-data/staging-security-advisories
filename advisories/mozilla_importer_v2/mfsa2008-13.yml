summary: "WebKit developer Alexey Proskuryakov reported that \nthe Mozilla HTML parser treated\
  \ the backspace character as whitespace\ncontrary to the HTML specification and different\
  \ from other browsers.\nThis difference might lead to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) risks on\
  \ sites\nwhich filtered input in accordance with the specification.\nYosuke Hasegawa reported\
  \ a flaw in the way Mozilla\nparses the control character 0x80 under Shift_JIS encoding. This\
  \ flaw could\npotentially be used to evade web-site input filters and result in a XSS\nattack\
  \ hazard. While investigating, Mozilla developer Simon\nMontagu discovered several variants\
  \ of this flaw involving zero-length\nnon-ASCII sequences in ISO-2022-JP, ISO-2022-CN, ISO-2022-KR,\
  \ and HZ-GB-2312.\n\nThese flaws were fixed in and prior to Firefox 2.0.0.12\nbut the announcement\
  \ was held until other browser vendors could fix related\nflaws."
