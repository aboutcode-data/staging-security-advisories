summary: |
  Using the Address Sanitizer tool, security researcher Aki
  Helin from OUSPG found that IDBKeyRange of indexedDB remains in the
  XPConnect hashtable instead of being unlinked before being destroyed. When it is
  destroyed, this causes a use-after-free, which is potentially exploitable.
