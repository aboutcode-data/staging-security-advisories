aliases:
  - CVE-2023-50761
summary: The signature of a digitally signed S/MIME email message may optionally specify the
  signature creation date and time. If present, Thunderbird did not compare the signature creation
  date with the message date and time, and displayed a valid signature despite a date or time
  mismatch. This could be used to give recipients the impression that a message was sent at
  a different date or time.
