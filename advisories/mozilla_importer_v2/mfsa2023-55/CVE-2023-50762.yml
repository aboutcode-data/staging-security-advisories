aliases:
  - CVE-2023-50762
summary: When processing a PGP/MIME payload that contains digitally signed text, the first paragraph
  of the text was never shown to the user. This is because the text was interpreted as a MIME
  message and the first paragraph was always treated as an email header section. A digitally
  signed text from a different context, such as a signed GIT commit, could be used to spoof
  an email message.
