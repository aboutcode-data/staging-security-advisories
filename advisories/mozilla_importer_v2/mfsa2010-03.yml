summary: |
  Security researcher Alin Rad Pop of Secunia
  Research reported that the HTML parser incorrectly freed used memory
  when insufficient space was available to process remaining input.
  Under such circumstances, memory occupied by in-use objects was freed
  and could later be filled with attacker-controlled text.  These
  conditions could result in the execution or arbitrary code if methods
  on the freed objects were subsequently called.
