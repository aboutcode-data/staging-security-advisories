  - CVE-2024-11704
summary: |
  *Flaws inherited from the Firefox code base are generally not exploitable through email in Thunderbird, as scripting is disabled when reading mail. However, they may pose a risk in other features that display remote web content.*

  A double-free issue could have occurred in `sec_pkcs7_decoder_start_decrypt()` when handling an error path. Under specific conditions, the same symmetric key could have been freed twice, potentially leading to memory corruption.
