  - CVE-2025-1015
summary: |
  *Flaws inherited from the Firefox code base are generally not exploitable through email in Thunderbird, as scripting is disabled when reading mail. However, they may pose a risk in other features that display remote web content.*

  The Thunderbird Address Book URI fields contained unsanitized links. This could be used by an attacker to create and export an address book containing a malicious payload in a field. For example, in the “Other” field of the Instant Messaging section. If another user imported the address book, clicking on the link could result in opening a web page inside Thunderbird, and that page could execute (unprivileged) JavaScript.
