summary: |
  *Flaws inherited from the Firefox code base are generally not exploitable through email in Thunderbird, as scripting is disabled when reading mail. However, they may pose a risk in other features that display remote web content.*

  Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 134, Thunderbird 134, Firefox ESR 128.6, and Thunderbird 128.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
