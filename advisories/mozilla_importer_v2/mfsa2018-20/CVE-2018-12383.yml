aliases:
  - CVE-2018-12383
summary: If a user saved passwords before Firefox 58 and then later set a master password, an
  unencrypted copy of these passwords is still accessible. This is because the older stored
  password file was not deleted when the data was copied to a new format starting in Firefox
  58. The new master password is added only on the new file. This could allow the exposure of
  stored password data outside of user expectations.
