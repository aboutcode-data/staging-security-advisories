summary: |
  Security researcher Paul Stone of Context Information Security discovered
  that timing differences in the processing of SVG format images with filters
  could allow for pixel values to be read. This could potentially allow for text
  values to be read across domains, leading to information disclosure.
  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
