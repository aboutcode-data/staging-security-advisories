summary: |

  for Android exits fullscreen mode, it can be induce through script to not restore the
  addressbar when the window is redrawn in normal mode. This could allow an attacker to
  spoof the addressbar with their own content.

  This issue only affects Firefox for Android. Firefox on other operating
  systems is not affected.
