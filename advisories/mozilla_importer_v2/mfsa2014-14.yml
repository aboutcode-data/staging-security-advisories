summary: |
  Security researcher Fabián Cuchietti discovered that
  it was possible to bypass the restriction on JavaScript execution in mail by
  embedding an <iframe> with a data: URL within a message. If the victim
  replied or forwarded the mail after receiving it, quoting it "in-line"
  using Thunderbird's HTML mail editor, it would run the attached script. The
  running script would be restricted to the mail composition window where it could
  observe and potentially modify the content of the mail before it was sent.
  Scripts were not executed if the recipient merely viewed the mail, only if it
  was edited as HTML. Turning off HTML composition prevented the vulnerability and
  forwarding the mail "as attachment" prevented the forwarding
  variant.
  Ateeq ur Rehman Khan of Vulnerability Labs reported
  additional variants of this attack involving the use of the <object> tag
  and which could be used to attach object data types such as images, audio, or
  video.
  This affected the Thunderbird 17 branch. It was fixed in all
  versions based on Gecko 23 or later. Thunderbird 24 and later are not affected
  by this vulnerability.
