summary: |
  Security researcher sushi Anton Larsson reported that when paired
  fullscreen and pointerlock requests are done in combination with closing windows, a
  pointerlock can be created within a fullscreen window without user permission. This
  pointerlock cannot then be cancelled without terminating the browser, resulting in a
  persistent denial of service attack. This can also be used for spoofing and clickjacking
  attacks against the browser UI.
