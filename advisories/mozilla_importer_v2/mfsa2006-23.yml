summary: "Claus Jörgensen reports that a text input box can be pre-filled with\na filename and\
  \ then turned into a file-upload control with the \ncontents intact, allowing a malicious\
  \ website the ability to\nsteal any local file whose name they can guess.\nJesse Ruderman\
  \ reports a variation, changing the type of the input\ncontrol in an event handler to work\
  \ around some of the initial\nchecks."
