summary: |
  Security researcher Karthikeyan Bhargavan of Prosecco at
  INRIA reported Content Security Policy (CSP) 1.0 implementation errors. CSP
  violation reports generated by Firefox and sent to the "report-uri" location
  include sensitive data within the "blocked-uri" parameter. These include
  fragment components and query strings even if the "blocked-uri" parameter has a
  different origin than the protected resource. This can be used to retrieve a
  user's OAuth 2.0 access tokens and OpenID credentials by malicious sites.
