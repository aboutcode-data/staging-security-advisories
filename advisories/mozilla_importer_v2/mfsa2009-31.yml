summary: |
  Mozilla add-on developer and community member Wladimir
  Palant reported that content-loading policies were not
  checked before loading external script files into XUL documents.
  The severity of this problem would depend on the reasons behind the
  content policy check, which include privacy from "web bugs" in
  Thunderbird mail messages, blocking of Ads and Ad-server tracking
  in AdBlock Plus.
  The original version of this advisory incorrectly claimed
  that NoScript protection could by bypassed; NoScript was unaffected.
