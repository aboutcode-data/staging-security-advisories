aliases:
  - CVE-2023-5176
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 117, Firefox ESR 115.2, and Thunderbird 115.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
