summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  A compromised content process could have provided malicious data in a PathRecording resulting in an out-of-bounds write, leading to a potentially exploitable crash in a privileged process.
