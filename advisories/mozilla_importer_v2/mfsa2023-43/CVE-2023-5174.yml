aliases:
  - CVE-2023-5174
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  If Windows failed to duplicate a handle during process creation, the sandbox code may have inadvertently freed a pointer twice, resulting in a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash.*This bug only affects Firefox on Windows when run in non-standard configurations (such as using runas). Other operating systems are unaffected.*
