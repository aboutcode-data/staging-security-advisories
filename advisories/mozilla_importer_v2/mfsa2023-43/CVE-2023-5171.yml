  - CVE-2023-5171
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  During Ion compilation, a Garbage Collection could have resulted in a use-after-free condition, allowing an attacker to write two NUL bytes, and cause a potentially exploitable crash.
