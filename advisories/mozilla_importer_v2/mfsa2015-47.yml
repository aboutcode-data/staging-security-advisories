summary: |
  Security researcher Aki Helin used the Address Sanitizer
  tool to find a buffer overflow during video playback on Linux systems. This was
  due to a problem in older versions of the Gstreamer plugin during the parsing of
  H.264 formatted video. This issue could be used to induce a possibly exploitable
  crash.

  This issue does not affect the current 1.0 version of Gstreamer
  and does not affect Windows or OS X systems.
