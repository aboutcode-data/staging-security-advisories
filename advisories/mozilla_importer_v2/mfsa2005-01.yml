summary: "Links with a custom getter and toString method can bypass checks intended to \nprevent\
  \ web content from linking to local files and \"chrome\" URIs if the user \ncan be convinced\
  \ to middle-click (or control-click) to open it in a new tab. \nThe browser's \"same-origin\"\
  \ policy prevents the attacker's content from taking \nadvantage of this flaw to read the\
  \ local file or manipulate privileged chrome."
