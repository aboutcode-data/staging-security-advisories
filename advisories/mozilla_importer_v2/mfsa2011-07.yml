summary: |
  Alex Miller reported that when very long strings
  were constructed and inserted into an HTML document, the browser would
  incorrectly construct the layout objects used to display the text.
  Under such conditions an incorrect length would be calculated for a
  text run resulting in too small of a memory buffer being allocated to
  store the text.  This issue could be used by an attacker to write data
  past the end of the buffer and execute malicious code on a victim's
  computer.
