summary: |
  Security researcher Cody Crews reported on a way to
  violate the same origin policy and inject script into a non-privileged part
  of the built-in PDF Viewer. This would allow an attacker to read and steal
  sensitive local files on the victim's computer.

  Mozilla has received reports that an exploit based on this vulnerability
  has been found in the wild.
