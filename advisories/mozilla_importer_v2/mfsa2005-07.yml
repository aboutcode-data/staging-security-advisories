summary: "Script-generated click events were indistinguishable from true clicks.\nCombined with\
  \ the Firefox Alt+click feature that downloads links to \nthe default location without prompting\
  \ this could be used by malicious\nsites to place executables or other malware onto a windows\
  \ user's desktop\nwithout their knowing, or simply attempt to fill their disk.\nMozilla 1.7.5\
  \ was also fixed to distinguish synthetic from true clicks,\nbut didn't suffer from unprompted\
  \ downloads."
