aliases:
  - CVE-2021-29974
summary: When network partitioning was enabled, e.g. as a result of Enhanced Tracking Protection
  settings, a TLS error page would allow the user to override an error on a domain which had
  specified HTTP Strict Transport Security (which implies that the error should not be override-able.)
  This issue did not affect the network connections, and they were correctly upgraded to HTTPS
  automatically.
