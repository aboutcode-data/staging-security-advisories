summary: |
  shutdown reported that if you could convince a user to
  open a blocked popup you could perform a cross-site scripting attack against
  any site that contains a frame whose source is a data: URL. To accomplish this
  the attacker's site would have to frame the target site plus another frame
  whose source is the exact same data: url as the victim site, and then
  attempt to open a popup with a javascript: url from the data: frame. It is
  unclear whether any high-value target sites that match this description
  actually exist.
  Similarly, Michal Zalewski reported that although pages
  loaded from the web normally cannot open windows containing local files,
  if you could convince a user to open a blocked popup then this restriction
  could be bypassed. In order to take advantage of this flaw the attacker
  would have to know the full path to a locally-saved file containing
  malicious script. He also reported that a flaw in the seeding of the
  pseudo-random number generator resulted in downloaded files being
  saved to temporary files with a reasonably predictable name. The two combined
  could be used to steal information saved on the local disk.
