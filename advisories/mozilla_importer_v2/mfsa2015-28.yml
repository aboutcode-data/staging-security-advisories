summary: |
  Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski reported, through HP
  Zero Day Initiative's Pwn2Own contest, a method to run arbitrary scripts in a
  privileged context. This bypassed the same-origin policy protections by using a
  flaw in the processing of SVG format content navigation.

  An incomplete version of this fix was shipped in Firefox 36.0.3
  and Firefox ESR 31.5.2.
