summary: |
  Several media players, for example Flash and QuickTime, support scripted content
  with the ability to open URLs in the default browser. The default behavior for
  Firefox was to replace the currently open browser window's
  content with the externally opened content. If the external URL was a javascript:
  url it would run as if it came from the site that served the previous content, which
  could be used to steal sensitive information such as login cookies or passwords.
  If the media player content first caused a privileged chrome: url to load then
  the subsequent javascript: url could execute arbitrary code.
  External javascript: urls will now run in a blank context regardless of what
  content it's replacing, and external apps will no longer be able to load
  privileged chrome: urls in a browser window. The -chrome command line option
  to load chrome applications is still supported.
