summary: |
  Mozilla developers Eric Shepherd and Jan-Ivar
  Bruaroey reported issues with privacy and video sharing using WebRTC.
  Once video sharing has started within a WebRTC session running within an
  <iframe>, video will continue to be shared even if the user
  selects the &quote;Stop Sharing" button in the controls. The camera will
  also remain on even if the user navigates to another site and will begin
  streaming again if the user returns to the original site. This is a privacy
  problem and can lead to inadvertent video streaming. This does not affect
  implementations that are not within an <iframe>.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
