summary: |
  This advisory was updated October 24, 2023 to add CVE-2023-5732 which was included in the original release of Firefox 117, but did not appear in the advisory published at that time.

  When creating a callback over IPC for showing the File Picker window, multiple of the same callbacks could have been created at a time and eventually all simultaneously destroyed as soon as one of the callbacks finished. This could have led to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash.
