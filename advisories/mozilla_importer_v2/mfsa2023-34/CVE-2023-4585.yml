summary: |
  This advisory was updated October 24, 2023 to add CVE-2023-5732 which was included in the original release of Firefox 117, but did not appear in the advisory published at that time.

  Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 116, Firefox ESR 115.1, and Thunderbird 115.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
