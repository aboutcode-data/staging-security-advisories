summary: |
  This advisory was updated October 24, 2023 to add CVE-2023-5732 which was included in the original release of Firefox 117, but did not appear in the advisory published at that time.

  When checking if the Browsing Context had been discarded in HttpBaseChannel, if the load group was not available then it was assumed to have already been discarded which was not always the case for private channels after the private session had ended.
