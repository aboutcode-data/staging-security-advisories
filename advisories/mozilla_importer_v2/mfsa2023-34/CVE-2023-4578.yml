summary: |
  This advisory was updated October 24, 2023 to add CVE-2023-5732 which was included in the original release of Firefox 117, but did not appear in the advisory published at that time.

  When calling JS::CheckRegExpSyntax a Syntax Error could have been set which would end in calling convertToRuntimeErrorAndClear. A path in the function could attempt to allocate memory when none is available which would have caused a newly created Out of Memory exception to be mishandled as a Syntax Error.
