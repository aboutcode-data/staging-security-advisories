summary: |
  Security researcher Juan Pablo Lopez Yacubian
  reported that an attacker could call window.open() on an
  invalid URL which looks similar to a legitimate URL and then
  use document.write() to place content within the new
  document, appearing to have come from the spoofed location.
  Additionally, if the spoofed document was created by a document with a
  valid SSL certificate, the SSL indicators would be carried over into
  the spoofed document.  An attacker could use these issues to display
  misleading location and SSL information for a malicious web page.
