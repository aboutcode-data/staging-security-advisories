summary: |
  Mozlla developer Ben Turner discovered that the protection
  against Directory Traversal through the DeviceStorage API was implemented in the
  wrong process on Firefox OS. If a Firefox OS application with any device-storage
  permissions were compromised an attacker could escape the media sandbox and
  potentially read or write any file on the device, depending on the permission
  level of the application
