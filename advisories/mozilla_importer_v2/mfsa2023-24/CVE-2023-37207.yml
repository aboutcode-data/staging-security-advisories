  - CVE-2023-37207
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  A website could have obscured the fullscreen notification by using a URL with a scheme handled by an external program, such as a mailto URL. This could have led to user confusion and possible spoofing attacks.
