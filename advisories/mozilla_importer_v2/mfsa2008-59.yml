summary: |
  Mozilla developer Boris Zbarsky reported that a
  malicious mail message might be able to glean personal information
  about the recipient from the mailbox URI (such as computer account
  name) if the mail recipient has enabled JavaScript in mail.  If a
  malicious mail is forwarded "in-line" to a recipient who has enabled
  JavaScript, then comments added by the forwarder could be accessed by
  scripts in the message and potentially revealed to the original
  malicious author if that message has also been allowed to load remote
  content.
  Scripts in mail messages no longer have access to the DOM properties
  .documentURI and .textContent.
  Thunderbird is only vulnerable to this issue if
  JavaScript is enabled in mail. This is not the default setting and we
  strongly discourage users from running JavaScript in mail.
