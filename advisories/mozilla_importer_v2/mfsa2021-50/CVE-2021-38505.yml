  - CVE-2021-38505
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*This advisory was updated January 17, 2023 to add CVE-2021-43529. This fix was included in the original release of Thunderbird 91.3, but did not appear in the advisory published at that time.

  Microsoft introduced a new feature in Windows 10 known as Cloud Clipboard which, if enabled, will record data copied to the clipboard to the cloud, and make it available on other computers in certain scenarios. Applications that wish to prevent copied data from being recorded in Cloud History must use specific clipboard formats; and Thunderbird before version 91.3 did not implement them. This could have caused sensitive data to be recorded to a user's Microsoft account.*This bug only affects Thunderbird for Windows 10+ with Cloud Clipboard enabled. Other operating systems are unaffected.*
