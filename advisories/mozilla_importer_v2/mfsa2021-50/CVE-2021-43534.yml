  - CVE-2021-43534
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*This advisory was updated January 17, 2023 to add CVE-2021-43529. This fix was included in the original release of Thunderbird 91.3, but did not appear in the advisory published at that time.

  Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Valentin Gosu, and Andrew McCreight reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 91.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
