summary: |
  Benjamin Smedberg discovered that chrome URL's could be made to
  reference remote files, which would run scripts with full privilege.
  There is no known way for web content to successfully load
  a chrome: url, but if a user could be convinced to do so manually
  (perhaps by copying a link and pasting it into the location bar)
  this could be exploited.
  Although Thunderbird shares the browser engine with
  Firefox it supports no way for a mail message to load a chrome: url or
  to cause one to be loaded in the browser. It is thus not vulnerable to
  this flaw. The underlying Thunderbird code has been fixed in 1.5.0.5
