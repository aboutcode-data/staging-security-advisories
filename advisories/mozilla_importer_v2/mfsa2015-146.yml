summary: |
  Security researcher Ronald Crane reported a vulnerability found
  through code inspection. This issue is an integer overflow while processing an MP4 format
  video file when an a erroneously-small buffer is allocated and then overrun, resulting in
  a potentially exploitable crash.

  This issue only affects 64-bit versions with 32-bit versions being
  unaffected.
  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product, but is potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
