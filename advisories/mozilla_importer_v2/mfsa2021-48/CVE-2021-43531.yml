aliases:
  - CVE-2021-43531
summary: When a user loaded a Web Extensions context menu, the Web Extension could access the
  post-redirect URL of the element clicked.  If the Web Extension lacked the WebRequest permission
  for the hosts involved in the redirect, this would be a same-origin-violation leaking data
  the Web Extension should have access to.  This was fixed to provide the pre-redirect URL.
  This is related to CVE-2021-43532 but in the context of Web Extensions.
