  - CVE-2021-43532
summary: The 'Copy Image Link' context menu action would copy the final image URL after redirects.
  By embedding an image that triggered authentication flows - in conjunction with a Content
  Security Policy that stopped a redirection chain in the middle - the final image URL could
  be one that contained an authentication token used to takeover a user account.  If a website
  tricked a user into copy and pasting the image link back to the page, the page would be able
  to steal the authentication tokens.  This was fixed by making the action return the original
  URL, before any redirects.
