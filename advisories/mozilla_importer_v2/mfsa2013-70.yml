summary: "Mozilla Developer Bobby Holley and Mozilla security\nresearcher moz_bug_r_a4 discovered\
  \ a mechanism where XBL scopes\ncan be be used to circumvent XrayWrappers from within the\
  \ Chrome on unprivileged\nobjects. This allows web content to potentially confuse privileged\
  \ code and\nweaken invariants and can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. \n\nIn general\
  \ these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the\nThunderbird and SeaMonkey products\
  \ because scripting is disabled, but are\npotentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts\
  \ in those products."
