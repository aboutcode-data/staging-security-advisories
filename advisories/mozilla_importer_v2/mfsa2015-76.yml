summary: |
  Paul Theriault of Mozilla discovered a privacy issue with a WiFi-related system
  message that wasn't properly restricted to apps with the "wifi-manage" permission. As a result,
  even unprivileged apps could have received those messages, allowing them to extract limited
  information from a vulnerable Firefox OS device under certain rare conditions.
