summary: "Mozilla developer Wesley Johnston reported that when there are two or more iframes\
  \ on the same HTML page, an iframe is able to see the touch events and their targets that\
  \ occur within the other iframes on the page. If the iframes are from the same origin, they\
  \ can also access the properties and methods of the targets of other iframes but same-origin\
  \ policy (SOP) restricts access across domains. This allows for information leakage and possibilities\
  \ for cross-site scripting (XSS) if another vulnerability can be used to get around SOP restrictions.\
  \ \n\nThese touch events are only currently used in Firefox for Android and other products\
  \ should not be exposed these this vulnerability."
