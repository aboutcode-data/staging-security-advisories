summary: |
  Security Researcher Mike Brooks of Sitewatch reported that
  if multiple Content Security Policy (CSP) headers are present on a page, they
  have an additive effect page policy. Using carriage return line feed (CRLF)
  injection, a new CSP rule can be introduced which allows for cross-site
  scripting (XSS) on sites with a separate header injection vulnerability.

  Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by this
  vulnerability.
