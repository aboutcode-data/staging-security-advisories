summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher Christian Holler discovered
  several issues while fuzzing the parsing of SSL certificates. Two of these
  issues were a result of using characters that are not UTF-8 in certificates when
  various functions expected all strings to be UTF-8 format. The third issue was a
  result of using characters that were not ASCII in certificates while a function
  expected only ASCII formatted text. All of these issues causes the certificates
  to be incorrectly parsed, leading to a potential inability to use valid SSL
  certificates.
