aliases:
  - CVE-2017-5425
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  The Gecko Media Plugin sandbox allows access to local files that match specific regular expressions. On OS OX, this matching allows access to some data in subdirectories of /private/var that could expose personal or temporary data. This has been updated to not allow access to /private/var and its subdirectories. *Note: this issue only affects OS X. Other operating systems are not affected.*
