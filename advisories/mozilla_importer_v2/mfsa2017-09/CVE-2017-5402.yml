  - CVE-2017-5402
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  A use-after-free can occur when events are fired for a FontFace object after the object has been already been destroyed while working with fonts. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.
