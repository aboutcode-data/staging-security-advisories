  - CVE-2017-5411
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  A use-after-free can occur during buffer storage operations within the ANGLE graphics library, used for WebGL content. The buffer storage can be freed while still in use in some circumstances, leading to a potentially exploitable crash. *Note: This issue is in libGLES, which is only in use on Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*
