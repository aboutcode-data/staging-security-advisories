  - CVE-2017-5407
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Using SVG filters that don't use the fixed point math implementation on a target iframe, a malicious page can extract pixel values from a targeted user. This can be used to extract history information and read text values across domains. This violates same-origin policy and leads to information disclosure.
