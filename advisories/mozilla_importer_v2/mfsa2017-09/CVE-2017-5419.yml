  - CVE-2017-5419
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  If a malicious site repeatedly triggers a modal authentication prompt, eventually the browser UI will become non-responsive, requiring shutdown through the operating system. This is a denial of service (DOS) attack.
