summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  The file picker dialog can choose and display the wrong local default directory when instantiated. On some operating systems, this can lead to information disclosure, such as the operating system or the local account name.
