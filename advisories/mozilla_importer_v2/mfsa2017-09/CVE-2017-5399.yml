  - CVE-2017-5399
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Mozilla developers and community members Carsten Book, Calixte Denizet, Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, David Bolter, David Keeler, Jon Coppeard, Tyson Smith, Ronald Crane, Tooru Fujisawa, Ben Kelly, Bob Owen, Jed Davis, Julian Seward, Julian Hector, Philipp, Markus Stange, and  André Bargull reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 51. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
