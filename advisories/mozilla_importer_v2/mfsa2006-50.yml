summary: |
  Continuing our security audit of the JavaScript engine, Mozilla developers
  found and fixed several potential vulnerabilities.
  Igor Bukanov and
  shutdown found additional places where an untimely garbage collection
  could delete a temporary object that was in active use (similar to
  MFSA 2006-01 and
  MFSA 2006-10). Some of these may
  allow an attacker to run arbitrary code given the right conditions.
  Georgi Guninski found potential integer overflow issues with
  long strings in the toSource() methods of the Object, Array and String
  objects as well as string function arguments.
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
  and would be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
  the default setting and we strongly discourage users from enabling
  JavaScript in mail.
