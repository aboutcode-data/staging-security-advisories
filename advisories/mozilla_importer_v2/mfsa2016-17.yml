summary: |
  Security researcher Nicolas Golubovic reported that a malicious page
  can overwrite files on the user's machine using Content Security Policy (CSP) violation
  reports. The file contents are restricted to the JSON format of the report. In many cases
  overwriting a local file may simply be destructive, breaking the functionality of that
  file. The CSP error reports can include HTML fragments which could be rendered by
  browsers. If a user has disabled add-on signing and has installed an "unpacked" add-on, a
  malicious page could overwrite one of the add-on resources. Depending on how this resource
  is used, this could lead to privilege escalation.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
