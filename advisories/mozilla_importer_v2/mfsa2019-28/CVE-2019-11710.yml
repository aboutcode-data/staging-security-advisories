  - CVE-2019-11710
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Mozilla developers and community members André Bargull, Christian Holler, Natalia Csoregi, Raul Gurzau, Daniel Varga, Jon Coppeard, Marcia Knous, Gary Kwong, Randell Jesup, David Bolter, Jeff Gilbert, and Deian Stefan reported memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 68 and Thunderbird 68. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
