  - CVE-2019-11720
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Some unicode characters are incorrectly treated as whitespace during the parsing of web content instead of triggering parsing errors. This allows malicious code to then be processed, evading cross-site scripting (XSS) filtering.
