  - CVE-2019-11723
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  A vulnerability exists during the installation of add-ons where the initial fetch ignored the origin attributes of the browsing context. This could leak cookies in private browsing mode or across different "containers" for people who use the Firefox Multi-Account Containers Web Extension.
