aliases:
  - CVE-2019-11725
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  When a user navigates to site marked as unsafe by the Safebrowsing API, warning messages are displayed and navigation is interrupted but resources from the same site loaded through websockets are not blocked, leading to the loading of unsafe resources and bypassing safebrowsing protections.
