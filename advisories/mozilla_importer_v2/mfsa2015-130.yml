summary: |
  Mozilla community member Vytautas Staraitis reported an issue with the
  interaction of Java applets and JavaScript. The Java plugin can deallocate a JavaScript
  wrapper when it is still in use, which leads to a JavaScript garbage collection crash.
  This crash is potentially exploitable.

  This issue only affects systems where Java is installed and enabled as a
  browser plugin. Other systems are unaffected.
