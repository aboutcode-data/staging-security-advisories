summary: |
  The jar: URI scheme was introduced as a mechanism to support
  digitally signed web pages, enabling web sites to load pages packaged
  in zip archives containing signatures in java-archive format.

  Jesse Ruderman and Petko D. Petkov
  point out this means that sites that allow users to upload binary
  content in zip format are effectively allowing users to install
  web pages on their site, and these can be used to perform Cross-Site
  Scripting (XSS) attacks.

  The blogger at beford.org noted that redirects
  confused Mozilla browsers about the true source of the jar:
  content: the content was wrongly considered to originate with the
  redirecting site rather than the actual source. This meant that an XSS
  attack could be mounted against any site with an open redirect even
  if it didn't allow uploads. A published proof-of-concept demonstrates
  stealing the GMail contact list of users logged-in to GMail.

  Support for the jar: URI scheme has been restricted
  to files served with a Content-Type header of
  application/java-archive or application/x-jar.
  Web applications that require signed pages must make sure their .jar
  archives are served with this Content-Type. Sites that allow users
  to upload binary files should make sure they do not allow these files
  to have one of these two MIME types.
