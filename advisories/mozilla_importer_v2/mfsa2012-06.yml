summary: |
  Mozilla developer Tim Abraldes reported that when encoding
  images as image/vnd.microsoft.icon the resulting data was always a
  fixed size, with uninitialized memory appended as padding beyond the size of the
  actual image. This is the result of mImageBufferSize in the encoder being
  initialized with a value different than the size of the source image. There is
  the possibility of sensitive data from uninitialized memory being appended to a
  PNG image when converted from an ICO format image. This sensitive data may then
  be disclosed in the resulting image.

  Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by this
  vulnerability.
