  - CVE-2022-45411
summary: Cross-Site Tracing occurs when a server will echo a request back via the Trace method,
  allowing an XSS attack to access to authorization headers and cookies inaccessible to JavaScript
  (such as cookies protected by HTTPOnly).  To mitigate this attack, browsers placed limits
  on fetch() and XMLHttpRequest; however some webservers have implemented non-standard headers
  such as X-Http-Method-Override that override the HTTP method, and made this attack possible
  again.  Firefox has applied the same mitigations to the use of this and similar headers.
