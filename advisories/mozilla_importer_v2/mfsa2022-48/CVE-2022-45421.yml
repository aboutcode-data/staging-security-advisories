summary: Mozilla developers Andrew McCreight and Gabriele Svelto reported memory safety bugs
  present in Firefox 106 and Firefox ESR 102.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
  corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited
  to run arbitrary code.
