summary: |
  Clement Lefevre reported a bug in USB Mass Storage handling of Firefox OS that
  would allow unauthorized access to device data through the USB interface. The logic error would
  under certain circumstances expose USB media volumes to USB hosts while the device is locked
  with a pass code, for example after a reboot or after certain screen saver state changes.
