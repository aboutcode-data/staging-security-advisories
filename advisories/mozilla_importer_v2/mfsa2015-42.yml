summary: |
  Mozilla developer Bobby Holley reported that windows created
  to hold privileged UI content retained access to privileged internal methods if
  later navigated to unprivileged content. If a separate flaw was found that
  allowed for web content to reference these privileged windows, an attacker could
  use this reference to navigate them to their own content allowing for an
  escalation of privilege and arbitrary code execution. On its own, this flaw does
  not allow for privilege escalation by web content.
