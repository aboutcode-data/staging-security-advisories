summary: |
  Mozilla fixed a bug in the l10n localization of the default homescreen
  app of Firefox OS reported by security researcher Muneaki
  Nishimura. Exploiting this issue requires tricking the user into
  bookmarking a specially crafted web page via the 'Add to home screen'
  functionality. As a result, an iframe controlled by the
  attacker would be executed with homescreen privileges, potentially
  leading to further system compromise.
