summary: |
  Security researcher Orlando Barrera II of SecTheory reported,
  via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative, that Mozilla's implementation
  of Web Workers contained an error in its handling of array data types
  when processing posted messages.  This error could be used by an
  attacker to corrupt heap memory and crash the browser, potentially
  running arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
  Web Workers were introduced in Firefox 3.5; Firefox 3.0
  and earlier versions were not affected.
