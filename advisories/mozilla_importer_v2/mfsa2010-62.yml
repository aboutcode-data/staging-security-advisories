summary: |
  Security researcher Paul Stone reported that when
  an HTML selection containing JavaScript is copy-and-pasted or dropped
  onto a document with designMode enabled the JavaScript will be
  executed within the context of the site where the code was dropped.  A
  malicious site could leverage this issue in an XSS attack by
  persuading a user into taking such an action and in the process
  running malicious JavaScript within the context of another site.
