summary: |
  As part of the Firefox 1.5 release we fixed several crash bugs to
  improve the stability of the product. Some of these crashes showed
  evidence of memory corruption that we presume could be exploited
  to run arbitrary code and have been applied to the Firefox 1.0.x
  and Mozilla Suite 1.7.x releases
  While fixing an unexploitable recursion-induced crash Bernd Mielke
  discovered that the CSS border-rendering code could potentially write
  past the end of an array.
  Alden D'Souza reported a crash when using an extremely large
  regular expression in JavaScript. This was tracked down to a 16-bit
  integer overflow that could potentially cause the browser to interpret
  attacker supplied data as JavaScript bytecode.
  Martijn Wargers found two potentially exploitable crashes when programmatically
  changing the -moz-grid and -moz-grid-group display styles.
  Bob Clary found a memory corruption crash using the InstallTrigger.install()
  method that was introduced in Firefox 1.0.7 by one of the regression
  fixes described in MFSA 2005-58.
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
  and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
  the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
  JavaScript in mail.
