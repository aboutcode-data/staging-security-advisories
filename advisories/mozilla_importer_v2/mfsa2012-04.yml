summary: |
  Security researcher regenrecht reported via
  TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that removed child nodes of nsDOMAttribute
  can be accessed under certain circumstances because of a premature notification
  of AttributeChildRemoved. This use-after-free of the child nodes could possibly
  allow for remote code execution.
