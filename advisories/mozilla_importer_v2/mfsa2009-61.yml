summary: |
  Security researcher Gregory Fleischer reported
  that text within a selection on a web page can be read by JavaScript
  in a different domain using the document.getSelection
  function, violating the same-origin policy.  Since this vulnerability
  requires user interaction to exploit, its severity was determined to
  be moderate.
