summary: |
  Security researcher Maryam Mehrnezhad of Newcastle University, UK
  reported an issue discovered by their research team, which also includes Ehsan Toreini,
  Siamak F. Shahandashti, and Feng Hao. They found vulnerabilities in Firefox for Android
  using orientation data and motion sensors on a mobile device's browser accessible
  through JavaScript. This allows an attacker to infer touch actions on the device through
  these sensors when orientation events are triggered in the browser, compromising user
  privacy and including potentially revealing entered PIN code data along with other user
  activities.

  This issue does not affect desktop versions of Firefox.
