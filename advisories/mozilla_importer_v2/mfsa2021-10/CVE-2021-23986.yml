  - CVE-2021-23986
summary: |
  Note: This advisory was updated May 3, 2021 to include CVE-2021-29951 and again on June 8, 2021 to include CVE-2021-29955 - both were also fixed in this release.

  A malicious extension with the 'search' permission could have installed a new search engine whose favicon referenced a cross-origin URL.  The response to this cross-origin request could have been read by the extension, allowing a same-origin policy bypass by the extension, which should not have cross-origin permissions.  This cross-origin request was made without cookies, so the sensitive information disclosed by the violation was limited to local-network resources or resources that perform IP-based authentication.
