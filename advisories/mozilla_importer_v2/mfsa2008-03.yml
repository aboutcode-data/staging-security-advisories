summary: |
  Mozilla contributors moz_bug_r_a4 and
  Boris Zbarsky submitted a series of vulnerabilities
  which allow scripts from page content to escape from its sandboxed
  context and/or run with chrome privileges. An additional vulnerability
  reported by moz_bug_r_a4 demonstrated that the XMLDocument.load()
  function can be used to inject script into another site, violating the
  browser's same-origin policy.
