summary: |
  Security researcher Looben Yang discovered a use-after-free
  vulnerability when working with nested sync event loops in Service Workers. He discovered
  a mechanism where scripts can close their own worker, which will then trigger a
  synchronization XMLHttpRequest on this now closed and released worker. This results in a
  potentially exploitable crash when triggered.
