summary: |
  Security researcher Abhishek Arya of Google used the Address
  Sanitizer tool to uncover several issues: two heap buffer overflow bugs and a
  use-after-free problem. The first heap buffer overflow was found in conversion
  from unicode to native character sets when the function fails. The
  use-after-free occurs in nsFrameList when working with column layout with
  absolute positioning in a container that changes size. The second buffer
  overflow occurs in nsHTMLReflowState when a window is resized on a page with
  nested columns and a combination of absolute and relative positioning. All three
  of these issues are potentially exploitable.
