summary: |
  Security researchers Tim Philipp Schäfers and
  Sebastian Neef, the team of Internetwache.org, reported a
  mechanism using JavaScript onbeforeunload events with page
  navigation to prevent users from closing a malicious page's tab and causing the
  browser to become unresponsive. This allows for a denial of service (DOS) attack
  due to resource consumption and blocks the ability of users to exit the
  application.
