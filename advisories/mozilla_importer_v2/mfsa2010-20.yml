summary: |
  Security researcher Paul Stone reported that a
  browser applet could be used to turn a simple mouse click into a
  drag-and-drop action, potentially resulting in the unintended loading
  of resources in a user's browser.  This behavior could be used twice
  in succession to first load a privileged chrome: URL in a
  victim's browser, then load a malicious javascript: URL
  on top of the same document resulting in arbitrary script execution
  with chrome privileges.
