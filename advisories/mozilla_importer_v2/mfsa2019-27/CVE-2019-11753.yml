  - CVE-2019-11753
summary: 'The Firefox installer allows Firefox to be installed to a custom user writable location,
  leaving it unprotected from manipulation by unprivileged users or malware. If the Mozilla
  Maintenance Service is manipulated to update this unprotected location and the updated maintenance
  service in the unprotected location has been altered, the altered maintenance service can
  run with elevated privileges during the update process due to a lack of integrity checks.
  This allows for privilege escalation if the executable has been replaced locally. *Note: This
  attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are
  not affected.*'
