summary: |
  Security researcher Armin Ebert reported that opening
  hyperlinks on a page with the mouse and specific keyboard key combinations could
  allow a Chrome privileged URL to be opened without context restrictions being
  preserved. This could also allow for local files or resources from a known
  location to be opened with local privileges, bypassing security
  protections.
