  - CVE-2020-15663
summary: 'If Firefox is installed to a user-writable directory, the Mozilla Maintenance Service
  would execute updater.exe from the install location with administrative privileges. Although
  the Mozilla Maintenance Service does ensure that updater.exe is signed by Mozilla, the version
  could have been rolled back to a previous version which would have allowed exploitation of
  an older bug and arbitrary code execution with system privileges.*Note: This issue only affected
  Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*'
