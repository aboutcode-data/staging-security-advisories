aliases:
  - CVE-2023-0616
summary: |
  *Except for CVE-2023--0616, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  If a MIME email combines OpenPGP and OpenPGP MIME data in a certain way Thunderbird repeatedly attempts to process and display the message, which could cause Thunderbird's user interface to lock up and no longer respond to the user's actions. An attacker could send a crafted message with this structure to attempt a DoS attack.
