aliases:
  - CVE-2023-25730
summary: |
  *Except for CVE-2023--0616, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  A background script invoking requestFullscreen and then blocking the main thread could force the browser into fullscreen mode indefinitely, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks.
