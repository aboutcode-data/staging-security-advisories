summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  When opening a Windows shortcut from the local filesystem, an attacker could supply a remote path that would lead to unexpected network requests from the operating system.This bug only affects Thunderbird for Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*
