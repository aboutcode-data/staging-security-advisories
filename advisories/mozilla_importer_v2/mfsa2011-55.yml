summary: |
  Security researcher regenrecht reported via
  TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that a flaw in the Mozilla SVG
  implementation could result in an out-of-bounds memory access if
  SVG elements were removed during a DOMAttrModified event handler.

  This vulnerability does not affect products prior to Firefox 8
  and SeaMonkey 2.5. Thunderbird 8 users would be vulnerable only if
  using a browser-like feature that allowed scripts to run; users
  are not at risk while reading mail.
