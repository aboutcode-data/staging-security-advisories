summary: |
  Security researcher Nils discovered a use-after-free error
  in which the imgLoader object is freed while an image is being
  resized. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but is
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
