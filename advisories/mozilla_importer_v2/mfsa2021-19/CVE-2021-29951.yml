summary: 'The Maintenance Service granted SERVICE_START access to BUILTIN|Users which, in a
  domain network, grants normal remote users access to start or stop the service. This could
  be used to prevent the browser update service from operating (if an attacker spammed the ''Stop''
  command); but also exposed attack surface in the maintenance service.*Note: This issue only
  affected Windows operating systems older than Win 10 build 1709. Other operating systems are
  unaffected.*'
