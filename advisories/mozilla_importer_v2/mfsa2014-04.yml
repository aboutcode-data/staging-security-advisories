summary: |
  Fredrik 'Flonka' Lönnqvist discovered an issue with image
  decoding in RasterImage caused by continued use of discarded
  images. This could allow for the writing to unowned memory and a potentially
  exploitable crash.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled in mail, but is
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
