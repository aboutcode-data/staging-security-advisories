  - CVE-2022-3033
summary: "If a Thunderbird user replied to a crafted HTML email containing a meta tag, with\
  \ the meta tag\nhaving the http-equiv=\"refresh\" attribute, and the content attribute specifying\
  \ an URL, then\nThunderbird started a network request to that URL, regardless of the configuration\
  \ to block\nremote content. In combination with certain other HTML elements and attributes\
  \ in the email,\nit was possible to execute JavaScript code included in the message in the\
  \ context of the\nmessage compose document. \nThe JavaScript code was able to perform actions\
  \ including, but probably not limited\nto, read and modify the contents of the message compose\
  \ document, including the quoted\noriginal message, which could potentially contain the decrypted\
  \ plaintext of encrypted data \nin the crafted email.\nThe contents could then be transmitted\
  \ to the network, either to the URL specified in the META refresh tag,\nor to a different\
  \ URL, as the JavaScript code could modify the URL specified in the document.\nThis bug doesn't\
  \ affect users who have changed the default Message Body display setting to\n'simple html'\
  \ or 'plain text'."
