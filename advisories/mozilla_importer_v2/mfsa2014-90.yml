summary: |
  Security researcher Kent Howard reported an Apple issue
  present in OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) where log files are created by the
  CoreGraphics framework of OS X in the /tmp local
  directory. These log files contain a record of all inputs into Mozilla programs
  during their operation. In versions of OS X from versions 10.6 through 10.9, the
  CoreGraphics had this logging ability but it was turned off by
  default. In OS X 10.10, this logging was turned on by default for some
  applications that use a custom memory allocator, such as jemalloc,
  because of an initialization bug in the framework. This issue has been addressed
  in Mozilla products by explicitly turning off the framework's logging of input
  events. On vulnerable systems, this issue can result in private data such as
  usernames, passwords, and other inputted data being saved to a log file on the
  local system.

  This issue does not affect OS X users prior to 10.10. Users on
  OS X 10.10 should go to their /tmp folder and delete any files with
  names beginning with "CGLog_" followed by the name of a Mozilla product, such as
  "CGLog_firefox".
