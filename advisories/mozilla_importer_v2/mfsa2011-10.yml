summary: |
  Independent security researcher Kuza55 and
  Microsoft security researcher Tom Gallagher reported
  that when plugin-initiated requests receive a 307 redirect response,
  the plugin is not notified and the request is forwarded to the new
  location.  This is true even for cross-site redirects, so any custom
  headers that were added as part of the initial request would be
  forwarded intact across origins.  This poses a CSRF risk for web
  applications that rely on custom headers only being present in
  requests from their own origin.
