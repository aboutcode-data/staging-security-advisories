summary: |
  Mozilla developer Johnny Stenback discovered that several
  methods of a feature used for testing (DOMWindowUtils) are not protected by
  existing security checks, allowing these methods to be called through script by
  web pages. This was addressed by adding the existing security checks to these
  methods.

  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
