  - CVE-2018-5115
summary: If an HTTP authentication prompt is triggered by a background network request from
  a page or extension, it is displayed over the currently loaded foreground page. Although the
  prompt contains the real domain making the request, this can result in user confusion about
  the originating site of the authentication request and may cause users to mistakenly send
  private credential information to a third party site.
