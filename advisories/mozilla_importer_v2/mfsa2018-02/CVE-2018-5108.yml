aliases:
  - CVE-2018-5108
summary: A Blob URL can violate origin attribute segregation, allowing it to be accessed from
  a private browsing tab and for data to be passed between the private browsing tab and a normal
  tab. This could allow for the leaking of private information specific to the private browsing
  context. This issue is mitigated by the requirement that the user enter the Blob URL manually
  in order for the access violation to occur.
