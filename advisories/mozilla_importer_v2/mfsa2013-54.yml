summary: |
  Security researcher Johnathan Kuskos reported that Firefox
  is sending data in the body of  XMLHttpRequest (XHR) HEAD requests, which goes
  against the XHR specification. This can potentially be used for Cross-Site
  Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks against sites which do not distinguish
  between HEAD and POST requests.
  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
