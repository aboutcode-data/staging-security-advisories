summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher Jesse Ruderman reported
  that when security modules were added or removed
  via pkcs11.addmodule or pkcs11.deletemodule,
  the resulting dialog was not sufficiently informative.  Without
  sufficient warning, an attacker could entice a victim to install a
  malicious PKCS11 module and affect the cryptographic integrity of the
  victim's browser.
  Security researcher Dan Kaminsky reported that
  this issue had not been fixed in Firefox 3.0 and that under certain
  circumstances pkcs11 modules could be installed from a
  remote location.
  Firefox 3.5 releases are not affected.
