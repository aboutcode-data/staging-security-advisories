summary: |
  Security researcher Shuichiro Suzuki of the Fourteenforty
  Research Institute reported the app_tmp directory is set to be
  world readable and writeable by Firefox for Android. This potentially allows for
  third party applications to replace or alter Firefox add-ons when downloaded
  because they are temporarily stored in the app_tmp directory before
  installation.

  This vulnerability only affects Firefox for Android.
