summary: |
  Security researcher  Christian Heimes reported that the Network Security
  Services (NSS) library does not handle IDNA domain prefixes according to RFC 6125 for wildcard
  certificates. This leads to improper wildcard matching of domains when they
  should not be matched in compliance with the specification. This issue was fixed
  in NSS version 3.16.
