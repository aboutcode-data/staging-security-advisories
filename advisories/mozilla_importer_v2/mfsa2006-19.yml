summary: |
  moz_bug_r_a4 discovered that .valueOf.call() and .valueOf.apply()
  when called with no arguments were returning the Object class
  prototype rather than the caller's global window object. When
  called on a reachable property of another window this provides
  a hook to get around the same-origin protection, allowing an
  attacker to inject script into another window.
  Cross-site script injection can be used to steal confidential
  data such as cookies or passwords, or perform actions on
  the user's behalf. It can also be used to alter the content
  of the other window which could be used to fool a user
  into trusting bogus information or downloaded content.
  Thunderbird shares the JavaScript engine with Firefox
  and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
  the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
  JavaScript in mail.
