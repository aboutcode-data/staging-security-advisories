summary: |
  Security researcher Gustavo Grieco reported a buffer underflow in
  libjar triggered through a maliciously crafted ZIP format file. This results
  in a potentially exploitable crash.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
