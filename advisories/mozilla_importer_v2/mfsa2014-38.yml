summary: "Security researcher Abhishek Arya (Inferno) of the Google\nChrome Security Team used\
  \ the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a buffer\noverflow when a script uses a non-XBL object\
  \ as an XBL object because the XBL\nstatus of the object is not properly validated. The resulting\
  \ memory corruption\nis potentially exploitable.  \n\nIn general this flaw cannot be exploited\
  \ through email in the\nThunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled,\
  \ but is\npotentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts."
