summary: |
  Security researcher Abhishek Arya (Inferno) of the Google
  Chrome Security Team used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a buffer
  overflow during the parsing of media content. This leads to a potentially
  exploitable crash.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
