  - CVE-2024-50336
summary: The Matrix specification demands homeservers to perform validation of the server-name
  and media-id components of MXC URIs with the intent to prevent path traversal. However, it
  is not mentioned that a similar check must also be performed on the client to prevent client-side
  path traversal. matrix-js-sdk fails to perform this validation.
