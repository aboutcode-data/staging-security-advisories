summary: "*In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product\
  \ because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or\
  \ browser-like contexts.* \n*Note*: While [Bug 1771084](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1771084)\
  \ does not represent a specific vulnerability that was fixed, we recommend anyone rebasing\
  \ patches to include it. 102 branch: Patch [1](https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/rev/82e3067ad2e7)\
  \ and [2](https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/rev/6e4639dc3614). 91 Branch: Patch\
  \ [1](https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-esr91/rev/72bca7a337e4) and [2](https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-esr91/rev/befef01949f2)\
  \ (Despite saying Parts 2 and 3, there is no Part 1)\n\nAn OpenPGP digital signature includes\
  \ information about the date when the signature was created. When displaying an email that\
  \ contains a digital signature, the email's date will be shown. If the dates were different,\
  \ then Thunderbird didn't report the email as having an invalid signature. If an attacker\
  \ performed a replay attack, in which an old email with old contents are resent at a later\
  \ time, it could lead the victim to believe that the statements in the email are current.\
  \ Fixed versions of Thunderbird will require that the signature's date roughly matches the\
  \ displayed date of the email."
