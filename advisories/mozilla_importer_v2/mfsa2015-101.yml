summary: "Security researcher Khalil Zhani reported that a maliciously crafted\nvp9 format video\
  \ could be used to trigger a buffer overflow while parsing the file. This\nleads to a potentially\
  \ exploitable crash due to a flaw in the libvpx library. \n\nIn general this flaw cannot be\
  \ exploited through email in the\nThunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is\
  \ potentially a risk in\nbrowser or browser-like contexts."
