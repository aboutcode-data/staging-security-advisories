summary: |
  Security researcher Bill Keese reported a memory corruption.
  This is caused by JSDependentString::undepend changing a dependent string into a
  fixed string when there are additional dependent strings relying on the same
  base. When the undepend occurs during conversion, the base data is freed,
  leaving other dependent strings with dangling pointers. This can lead to a
  potentially exploitable crash.
