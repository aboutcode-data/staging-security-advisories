summary: |
  Security researcher Jeremy Brown reported that the
  file naming scheme used for downloading a file which already exists in
  the downloads folder is predictable.  If an attacker had local access
  to a victim's computer and knew the name of a file the victim intended
  to open through the Download Manager, he could use this vulnerability
  to place a malicious file in the world-writable directory used to save
  temporary downloaded files and cause the browser to choose the
  incorrect file when opening it.  Since this attack requires local
  access to the victim's machine, the severity of this vulnerability was
  determined to be low.
