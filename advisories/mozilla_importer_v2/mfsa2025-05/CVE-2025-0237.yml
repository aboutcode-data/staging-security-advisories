  - CVE-2025-0237
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  The WebChannel API, which is used to transport various information across processes, did not check the sending principal but rather accepted the principal being sent. This could have led to privilege escalation attacks.
