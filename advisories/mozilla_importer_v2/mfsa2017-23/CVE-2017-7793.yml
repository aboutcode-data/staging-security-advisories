summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  A use-after-free vulnerability can occur in the Fetch API when the worker or the associated window are freed when still in use, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash.
