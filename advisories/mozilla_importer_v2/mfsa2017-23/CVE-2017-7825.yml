summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Several fonts on OS X display some Tibetan and Arabic characters as whitespace. When used in the addressbar as part of an IDN this can be used for domain name spoofing attacks. *Note: This attack only affects OS X operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*
