aliases:
  - CVE-2017-7823
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  The content security policy (CSP) sandbox directive did not create a unique origin for the document, causing it to behave as if the allow-same-origin keyword were always specified. This could allow a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack to be launched from unsafe content.
