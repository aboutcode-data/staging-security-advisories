summary: |
  Mozilla security engineer Christoph Kerschbaumer reported a
  discrepancy in Mozilla's implementation of Content Security Policy and the CSP specification. The specification
  states that blob:, data:, and filesystem:
  URLs should be excluded in case of a wildcard when matching source expressions
  but Mozilla's implementation allows these in the case of an asterisk wildcard.
  This could allow for more permissive CSP usage than expected by a web developer,
  possibly allowing for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
