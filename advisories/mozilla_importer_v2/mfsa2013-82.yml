summary: "Mozilla community member Ms2ger found a mechanism where a\nnew Javascript object with\
  \ a compartment is uninitialized could be entered\nthrough web content. When the scope for\
  \ this object is called, it leads to a\npotentially exploitable crash. \n\nIn general this\
  \ flaw cannot be exploited through email in the\nThunderbird product because scripting is\
  \ disabled, but is potentially a risk in\nbrowser or browser-like contexts."
