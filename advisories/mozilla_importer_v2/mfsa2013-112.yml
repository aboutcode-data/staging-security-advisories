summary: |
  Mozilla community member Vincent Lefevre reported that on
  Linux systems, web content can access data saved to the clipboard when a user
  attempts to paste a selection with a middle-click instead of pasting the
  selection content. This allows for possibly private data in the clipboard to be
  inadvertently disclosed to web content. Windows and OS X systems are not
  affected by this issue.

  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
