  - CVE-2021-29969
summary: If Thunderbird was configured to use STARTTLS for an IMAP connection, and an attacker
  injected IMAP server responses prior to the completion of the STARTTLS handshake, then Thunderbird
  didn't ignore the injected data. This could have resulted in Thunderbird showing incorrect
  information, for example the attacker could have tricked Thunderbird to show folders that
  didn't exist on the IMAP server.
