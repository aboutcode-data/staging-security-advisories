  - CVE-2021-43527
summary: 'NSS (Network Security Services) versions prior to 3.73 or 3.68.1 ESR are vulnerable
  to a heap overflow when handling DER-encoded DSA or RSA-PSS signatures. Applications using
  NSS for handling signatures encoded within CMS, S/MIME, PKCS \#7, or PKCS \#12 are likely
  to be impacted. Applications using NSS for certificate validation or other TLS, X.509, OCSP
  or CRL functionality may be impacted, depending on how they configure NSS. *Note: This vulnerability
  does NOT impact Mozilla Firefox.* However, email clients and PDF viewers that use NSS for
  signature verification, such as Thunderbird, LibreOffice, Evolution and Evince are believed
  to be impacted.'
