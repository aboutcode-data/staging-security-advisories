summary: |
  Mozilla developer Gerald Squelart fixed an integer underflow in the
  libstagefright library initially reported by Joshua Drake to Google. The issues occurred
  in MP4 format video file while parsing cover metadata, leading  to a buffer overflow. This
  results in a potentially exploitable crash and can be triggered by a malformed MP4
  file served by web content.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product, but is potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
