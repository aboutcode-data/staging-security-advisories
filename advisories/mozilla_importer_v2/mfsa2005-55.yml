summary: "Parts of the browser UI relied too much on DOM node names without taking\ndifferent\
  \ namespaces into account and verifying that nodes really were\nof the expected type. An XHTML\
  \ document could be used to create fake \n<IMG> elements, for example, with content-defined\
  \ properties that the\nbrowser would access as if they were the trusted built-in properties\
  \ of the\nexpected HTML elements.\nThe severity of the vulnerability would depend on what\
  \ the attacker could\nconvince the victim to do, but could result in executing user-supplied\n\
  script with elevated \"chrome\" privileges. This could be used to install\nmalicious software\
  \ on the victim's machine."
