  - CVE-2025-3522
summary: "Thunderbird processes the X-Mozilla-External-Attachment-URL header\nto handle attachments\
  \ which can be hosted externally. When an\nemail is opened, Thunderbird accesses the specified\
  \ URL to \ndetermine file size, and navigates to it when the user clicks the\nattachment.\
  \ Because the URL is not validated or sanitized, it can\nreference internal resources like\
  \ chrome:// or SMB share file:// links,\npotentially leading to hashed Windows credential\
  \ leakage and opening the\ndoor to more serious security issues."
