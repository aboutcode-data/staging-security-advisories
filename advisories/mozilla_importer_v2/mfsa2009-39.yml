summary: |
  Mozilla developer Blake Kaplan reported
  that setTimeout, when called with certain object
  parameters which should be protected with
  a XPCNativeWrapper, will fail to keep the object wrapped
  when compiling the new function to be executed.  If chrome privileged
  code were to call setTimeout using this as
  an argument, the this object will lose its wrapper and
  could be unsafely accessed by chrome code.  An attacker could use such
  vulnerable code to run arbitrary JavaScript with chrome
  privileges.
