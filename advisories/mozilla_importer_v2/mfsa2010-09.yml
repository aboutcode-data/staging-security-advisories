summary: |
  Security researcher regenrecht reported (via TippingPoint's
  Zero Day Initiative) a potential reuse of a deleted image frame in Firefox
  3.6's handling of multipart/x-mixed-replace images. Although
  no exploit was shown, re-use of freed memory has led to exploitable
  vulnerabilities in the past.
