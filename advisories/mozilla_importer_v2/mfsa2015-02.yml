summary: |
  Google security researcher Michal Zalewski reported that
  when a malformed bitmap image is rendered by the bitmap decoder within a
  <canvas> element, memory may not always be properly initialized. The
  resulting image then uses this uninitialized memory during rendering, allowing
  data to potentially leak to web content.
