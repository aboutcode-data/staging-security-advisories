summary: |
  Marcel reported that a malicious web page could
  perform a denial of service attack against the form autocomplete
  feature that would persist from session to session until the malicious
  form data was deleted. Filling a text field with millions of
  characters and submitting the form will cause the victim's browser
  to hang for up to several minutes while the form data is read,
  and this will happen the first time autocomplete is triggered
  after every browser restart.
  No harm is done to the user's computer, but the frustration
  caused by the hang could prevent use of Firefox if users don't
  know how to clear the bad state.
