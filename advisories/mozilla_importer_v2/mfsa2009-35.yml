summary: |
  Security researcher Attila Suszter reported that
  when a page contains a Flash object which presents a slow script
  dialog, and the page is navigated while the dialog is still visible to
  the user, the Flash plugin is unloaded resulting in a crash due to a
  call to the deleted object.  This crash could potentially be used by
  an attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
