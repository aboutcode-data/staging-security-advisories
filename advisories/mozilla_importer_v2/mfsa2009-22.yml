summary: |
  Mozilla community member Michael reported that
  when a server responds with a Refresh header containing a
  javascript: URI, Firefox will redirect to the javascript: URI.  If an
  attacker could inject a Refresh header into a server
  response, or could control the value that a site places in
  the Refresh header, they could use this vulnerability to
  perform an XSS attack and execute arbitrary JavaScript within the
  context of that site.
