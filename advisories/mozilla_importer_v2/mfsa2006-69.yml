summary: |
  Frederik Reiss reported a crash when using the CSS cursor property
  to set the cursor to certain images on Windows. A miscalculated
  size during conversion of the image to a Windows bitmap can result
  in a heap buffer overflow which could be used to compromise
  the victim's computer.
  This flaw affects both Firefox 2 and Firefox 1.5 but not the earlier
  Firefox 1.0 or Mozilla Suite
