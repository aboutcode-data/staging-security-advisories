summary: |
  Security researcher Juho Nurminen reported a mechanism to spoof the
  URL displayed in the addressbar in reader mode by manipulating the loaded URL. This flaw
  allows for the URL displayed to be different than that the web content rendered. This
  allows for potential spoofing but the effects are mitigated due to the restrictions reader
  mode places when rendering content.
