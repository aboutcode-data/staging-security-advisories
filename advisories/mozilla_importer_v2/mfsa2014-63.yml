summary: "Security researchers Tyson Smith and Jesse\nSchwartzentruber used the Address Sanitizer\
  \ tool while fuzzing to\ndiscover a use-after-free error resulting in a crash. This is a result\
  \ of a pair\nof NSSCertificate structures being added to a trust domain and then\none of them\
  \ is removed while they are still in use by the trusted cache. This\ncrash is potentially\
  \ exploitable.\n\nThis issue was addressed in the Network Security Services (NSS) library\
  \ in version 3.16.2, \nshipping on affected platforms.\nIn general this flaw cannot be exploited\
  \ through email in the\nThunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially\
  \ a risk in\nbrowser or browser-like contexts."
