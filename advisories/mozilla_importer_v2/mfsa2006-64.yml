summary: |
  As part of the Firefox 1.5.0.7 release we fixed several bugs to
  improve the stability of the product. Some of these were crashes
  that showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that at
  least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code
  with enough effort.
  We thank Bernd Mielke, Georgi Guninski, Igor Bukanov, Jesse Ruderman,
  Martijn Wargers, Mats Palmgren, Olli Pettay, shutdown, and Weston Carloss
  for discovering and reporting these crashes.
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
  and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in
  mail. This is not the default setting and we strongly discourage users from
  running JavaScript in mail. Without further investigation we cannot rule out
  the possibility that for some of these an attacker might be able to prepare
  memory for exploitation through some means other than JavaScript, such as
  large images or plugin data.
