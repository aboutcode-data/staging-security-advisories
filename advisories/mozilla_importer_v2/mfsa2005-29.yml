summary: |
  Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) allow non-English speakers to use
  domains in their local language. Because many supported characters
  are similar to other (if not identical in some fonts) there is
  the possibility this could be used to construct perfect,
  indistinguishable phishing sites.
  As a temporary measure the Mozilla Foundation has decided
  to turn off IDN
  and instead will display such domains
  in their raw "punycode" form.
  IDN will be re-enabled when the domain registries, standards
  bodies, and browser vendors can agree on a plan to prevent
  the use of IDN
  domains in phishing scams.
