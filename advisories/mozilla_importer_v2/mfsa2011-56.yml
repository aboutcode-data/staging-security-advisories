summary: |
  Security researcher Mario Heiderich reported it was
  possible to use SVG animation accessKey events to detect
  key strokes even when JavaScript was disabled. Since web pages can normally
  detect key events through script and most users have scripting enabled this
  does not present a risk for most users. In contexts where the user knows
  scripting is disabled (reading mail, for example, or NoScript users) this
  could allow a malicious web page to fool a user into interacting with
  a prompt thinking it came from the browser or mail program.


  Accessing remote content is disabled by default When reading mail in
  Thunderbird and SeaMonkey. Successfully capturing keystrokes remotely would
  require some social engineering to convince the user to turn it on.


  SVG animation is not supported in Thunderbird 3.1 or Firefox 3.6.
