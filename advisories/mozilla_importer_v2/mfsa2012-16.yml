summary: |
  Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski reported that an
  attacker able to convince a potential victim to set a new home page by dragging
  a link to the "home" button can set that user's home page to a
  javascript: URL. Once this is done the attacker's page can cause
  repeated crashes of the browser, eventually getting the script URL loaded in the
  privileged about:sessionrestore context.
