summary: |
  An anonymous researcher for TippingPoint and the Zero Day Initiative showed
  that when used in a web page Java would reference properties of the
  window.navigator object as it started up. If the page replaced the
  navigator object before starting Java then the browser would crash in a
  way that could be exploited to run native code supplied by the attacker.
  Firefox 1.0 and Mozilla Suite 1.7 are not vulnerable.
  Thunderbird does not load Java or other plugin content and is thus
  not vulnerable.
