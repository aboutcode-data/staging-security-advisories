summary: |
  As part of the Firefox 2.0.0.8 update releases Mozilla developers fixed
  many bugs to improve the stability of the product. Some of these crashes
  showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances and we
  presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited
  to run arbitrary code.
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and could
  be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not the default
  setting and we strongly discourage users from running JavaScript in mail.
  Without further investigation we cannot rule out the possibility that for some
  of these an attacker might be able to prepare memory for exploitation through
  some means other than JavaScript such as large images.
  Update (December 19, 2007): Some of these bugs
  were patched in Thunderbird 1.5.0.14, please see the links below.
  For complete protection please upgrade to the latest version of
  Thunderbird 2 and do not enable JavaScript in mail.
