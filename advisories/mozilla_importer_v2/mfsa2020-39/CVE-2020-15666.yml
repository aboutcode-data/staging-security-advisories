aliases:
  - CVE-2020-15666
summary: When trying to load a non-video in an audio/video context the exact status code (200,
  302, 404, 500, 412, 403, etc.) was disclosed via the MediaError Message. This level of information
  leakage is inconsistent with the standardized onerror/onsuccess disclosure and can lead to
  inferring login status to services or device discovery on a local network among other attacks.
