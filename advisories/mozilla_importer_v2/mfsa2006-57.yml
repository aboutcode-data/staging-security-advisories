summary: |
  Priit Laes reported a crash due to a heap buffer overflow triggered
  by a JavaScript regular expression containing
  a minimal quantifier. We presume this could be exploited to run
  arbitrary code.
  CanadianGuy, Girts Folkmanis and Catalin Patulea report that a regular
  expression that ends with a backslash inside an unterminated
  character set (e.g. "[\\") will cause the regular expression engine
  to read beyond the end of the buffer, possibly leading to a crash.
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
  and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
  the default setting and we strongly discourage users from enabling
  JavaScript in mail.
