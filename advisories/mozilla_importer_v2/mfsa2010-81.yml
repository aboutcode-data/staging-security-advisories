summary: |
  Security researcher regenrecht reported via
  TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that JavaScript arrays were
  vulnerable to an integer overflow vulnerability. The report
  demonstrated that an array could be constructed containing a very
  large number of items such that when memory was allocated to store the
  array items, the integer value used to calculate the buffer size would
  overflow resulting in too small a buffer being allocated. Subsequent
  use of the array object could then result in data being written past
  the end of the buffer and causing memory corruption.
