  - CVE-2018-12365
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  A compromised IPC child process can escape the content sandbox and list the names of arbitrary files on the file system without user consent or interaction. This could result in exposure of private local files.
