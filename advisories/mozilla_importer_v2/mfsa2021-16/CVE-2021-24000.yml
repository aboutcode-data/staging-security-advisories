summary: A race condition with requestPointerLock() and setTimeout() could have resulted in
  a user interacting with one tab when they believed they were on a separate tab. In conjunction
  with certain elements (such as <input type="file">) this could have led to an attack where
  a user was confused about the origin of the webpage and potentially disclosed information
  they did not intend to.
