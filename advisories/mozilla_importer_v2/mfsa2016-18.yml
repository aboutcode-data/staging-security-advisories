summary: |
  Security researcher Muneaki Nishimura (nishimunea) of Recruit
  Technologies Co.,Ltd. reported that Content Security Policy (CSP) violation reports
  contained full path information for cross-origin iframe navigations in violation of the
  CSP specification. This could result in information disclosure.
  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
