summary: |
  Steven Michaud reported a crash in LiveConnect, the bridge code that allows
  Java applets and web JavaScript to communicate. The crash is due to re-use
  of an already-freed object and we presume this could be exploited with
  enough effort.
  Thunderbird does not load Java applets or other plugins in
  mail messages and is therefore not vulnerable to this flaw unless a user
  has customized their version of Thunderbird to remove this restriction.
