summary: "Security researcher Abhishek Arya (Inferno) of the Google\nChrome Security Team used\
  \ the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a series of\nuse-after-free, out of bounds read,\
  \ and buffer overflow problems rated as low to\ncritical security issues in shipped software.\
  \ Some of these issues are\npotentially exploitable, allowing for remote code execution. We\
  \ would also like\nto thank Abhishek for reporting four additional use-after-free and out\
  \ of bounds\nwrite flaws introduced during Firefox development that were fixed before general\n\
  release. \n\nIn general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the\nThunderbird\
  \ and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are\npotentially a risk in browser\
  \ or browser-like contexts in those products."
