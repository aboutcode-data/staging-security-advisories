summary: |
  Various schemes were reported that could cause the "secure site" lock icon
  to appear and show certificate details for the wrong site. These could be
  used by phishers to make their spoofs look more legitimate, particularly in
  windows that hide the address bar showing the true location.
  Mook reports that opening a spoof site that never finishes loading in a
  window displaying a secure site will continue to show the security indicators
  of the original site. Kohei Yoshino accomplishes the same result using
  document.write() to create the spoof in the secure window.
  Doug Turner demonstrates that faked security indicators can be turned
  on for the current window contents by attempting to load content from a
  non-HTTP server that supports SSL (for example, a mail server). The SSL
  indicator was set based on the successful SSL handshake despite the
  failure to load the requested content.
  Similarly M. Deaudelin demonstrates that a spoofer could use a
  URL that returns an HTTP 204 error to set both the SSL icon and update
  the location while still showing the original content, presumably a spoof.
