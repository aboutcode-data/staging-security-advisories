summary: |
  Security researcher Aki Helin from OUSPG used the Address
  Sanitizer tool to discover a crash during the decoding of WAV format audio files
  in some instances. This crash is not exploitable but could be used for a denial
  of service (DOS) attack by malicious parties.
  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
