summary: "Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reports that\nby using an appropriately wrapped\
  \ object it was possible to bypass the fix\nfor \nMFSA 2007-19. Prior to Firefox 3.6 this\
  \ gives an attacker the ability\nto perform cross-site scripting attacks against arbitrary\
  \ sites as in the\noriginal MFSA 2007-19 attack. Due to unrelated changes in the browser engine\n\
  used by Firefox 3.6, attacks in that version are limited to capturing keystroke\nevents from\
  \ a cross-origin frame or window rather than full DOM access.\nThose events might be sufficient\
  \ to illicitly obtain passwords\nor other sensitive information entered into web forms.\n\n\
  Thunderbird does not allow JavaScript to run in mail\nmessages, but users who open web content\
  \ (such as RSS feeds, or other\ncontent through add-ons) could be at risk."
