summary: |
  Security researcher Alexander Miller reported that
  passing an excessively long string to document.write
  could cause text rendering routines to end up in an inconsistent state
  with sections of stack memory being overwritten with the string data.
  An attacker could use this flaw to crash a victim's browser and
  potentially run arbitrary code on their computer.
