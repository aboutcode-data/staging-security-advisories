summary: |
  Masatoshi Kimura reported a hang caused by a double-free in Thunderbird
  when processing a large VCard with invalid base64 characters in it.
  Since an attacker can supply an arbitrary amount of
  well-formed VCard data before introducing the error we presume this could
  be exploited to run code of the attacker's choosing.
