summary: |
  The Firefox and Thunderbird auto-update mechanism protects itself against
  DNS spoofing using SSL; only a site presenting a valid certificate
  for aus2.mozilla.org will be trusted as a source of update information.
  Jon Oberheide points out, however, that many users accept unverifiable
  self-signed certificates without much thought on "low value" sites,
  and this could be used as the basis of an attack on the update system.
  The attacker would have to be in a position to spoof the victim's
  DNS, causing them to connect to sites of the attacker's choosing
  rather than the sites intended by the victim. If they gained that
  control and the victim accepted the attacker's cert for the Mozilla
  update site, then the next update check could be
  hijacked and redirected to the attacker's site without detection.
  The attacker could then send an "update" that consisted of whatever
  programs they wished.
