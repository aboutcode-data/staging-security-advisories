summary: |
  Microsoft Vulnerability Research reported that two
  plugin instances could interact in a way in which one plugin gets a
  reference to an object owned by a second plugin and continues to hold
  that reference after the second plugin is unloaded and its object is
  destroyed.  In these cases, the first plugin would contain a pointer
  to freed memory which, if accessed, could be used by an attacker to
  execute arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
