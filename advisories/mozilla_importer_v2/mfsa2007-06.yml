summary: "iDefense \nhas informed Mozilla about two potential buffer overflow\nvulnerabilities\
  \ found by researcher regenrecht\nin the Network Security Services (NSS) code for processing\
  \ \nthe SSLv2 protocol.\nSSL clients such as Firefox and Thunderbird can suffer\na buffer\
  \ overflow if a malicious server presents a certificate\nwith a public key that is too small\
  \ to encrypt the entire\n\"Master Secret\". Exploiting this overflow appears to be\nunreliable\
  \ but possible if the SSLv2 protocol is enabled.\nServers that use NSS \nfor the SSLv2 protocol\
  \ can be exploited by\na client that presents a \"Client Master Key\" with invalid length\n\
  values in any of several fields that are used without adequate\nerror checking. This can lead\
  \ to a buffer overflow that\npresumably could be exploitable.\nSupport for SSLv2 is disabled\
  \ in Firefox 2 due to other known\nweaknesses in the protocol; Firefox 2 is not vulnerable\
  \ unless\nthe user has modified hidden internal NSS settings to\nre-enable SSLv2 support."
