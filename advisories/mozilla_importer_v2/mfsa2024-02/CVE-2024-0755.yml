summary: |
  Updated February 8, 2024 to remove CVE-2024-0749 which was inadvertently included in the original advisory.

  Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 121, Firefox ESR 115.6, and Thunderbird 115.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
