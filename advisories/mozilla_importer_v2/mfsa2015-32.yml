summary: |
  Security researcher Armin Ebert discovered that a
  man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker spoofing a Mozilla sub-domain could bypass
  user approval messages to install a Firefox lightweight theme. This was possible
  because add-on installations of the lightweight themes do not require the use of
  HTTP over SSL. Firefox extensions were not directly affected and still required
  user approval for installation.
