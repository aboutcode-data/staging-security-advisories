summary: |
  An anonymous researcher reported, via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative, two integer
  overflows in the libstagefright library that could be triggered by a malicious 'saio'
  chunk in an MPEG4 video. These overflows allowed for potential arbitrary code execution.
  This issue was independently reported by security researcher laf.intel.
  Security researcher Massimiliano Tomassoli also discovered an
  integer overflow issue when parsing an invalid MPEG4 video.
  Mozilla security engineers Tyson Smith and Christoph
  Diehl used the Address Sanitizer to find a buffer overflow when parsing an MPEG4
  video with an invalid size in an ESDS chunk lead to memory corruption.
  Each of these reported issues result in potentially exploitable crashes that
  could allow for remote code execution.
