summary: |
  Mozilla discovered several bugs in liboggplay which posed potential
  memory safety issues.  The bugs which were fixed could potentially be
  used by an attacker to crash a victim's browser and execute arbitrary
  code on their computer.
  Audio and Video capabilities were added to the Mozilla browser
  engine in Firefox 3.5, SeaMonkey 2.0, and Thunderbird 3.0; prior releases of
  these products were not affected.
