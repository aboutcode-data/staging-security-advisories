summary: |
  Bjoern Hoehrmann and security researcher Moxie
  Marlinspike independently reported
  that Unicode box drawing characters were allowed in Internationalized
  Domain Names (IDN) where they could be visually confused with
  punctuation used in valid web addresses.  This could be combined with
  a phishing-type scam to trick a victim into thinking they were on a
  different website than they actually were.
