summary: |
  Security research firm Astabis
  reported a vulnerability in Firefox 2 submitted through the iSIGHT Partners
  GVP Program by Greg McManus, Primary GVP Researcher. The
  reported crash in Mozilla's block reflow code could be used by an attacker
  to crash the browser and run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.
  This vulnerability does not affect Firefox 3.
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and could
  be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not the
  default setting and we strongly discourage users from running JavaScript in
  mail.
