summary: Mozilla developers and community members Gabriele Svelto, Sebastian Hengst, Randell
  Jesup, Luan Herrera, Lars T Hansen, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs
  present in Firefox 96. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume
  that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
