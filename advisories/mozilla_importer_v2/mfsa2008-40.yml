summary: Mozilla developer Paul Nickerson reported a variant of a click-hijacking vulnerability
  discovered in Internet Explorer by Liu Die Yu.  The vulnerability allowed an attacker to move
  the content window while the mouse was being clicked, causing an item to be dragged rather
  than clicked-on.  This issue could potentially be used to force a user to download a file
  or perform other drag-and-drop actions.
