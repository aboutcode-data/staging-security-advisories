summary: |
  Security researcher Sergey Glazunov reported a
  dangling pointer vulnerability in the implementation
  of navigator.plugins in which the navigator
  object could retain a pointer to the plugins array even after it had
  been destroyed.  An attacker could potentially use this issue to crash
  the browser and run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
