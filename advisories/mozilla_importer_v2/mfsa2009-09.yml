summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher Georgi Guninski
  reported that a website could use nsIRDFService and a
  cross-domain redirect to steal arbitrary XML data from another domain,
  a violation of the same-origin policy.  This vulnerability could be
  used by a malicious website to steal private data from users
  authenticated to the redirected website.
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and
  could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is
  not the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
  JavaScript in mail.
