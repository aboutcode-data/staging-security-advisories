summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  When constructing a permission prompt for WebRTC, a URI was supplied from the content process. This URI was untrusted, and could have been the URI of an origin that was previously granted permission; bypassing the prompt.
