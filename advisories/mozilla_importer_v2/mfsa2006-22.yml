summary: |
  An anonymous researcher for TippingPoint and the Zero Day Initiative discovered
  an integer overflow triggered by the CSS letter-spacing property. This results in
  in under-allocating memory and ultimately a heap buffer overflow which could
  be exploited to run code of the attacker's choice.
  The overflow condition itself does not require JavaScript
  and thus could affect Thunderbird via received mail, but without
  scripting to prepare memory it may not be possible to exploit
  this condition in mail.
