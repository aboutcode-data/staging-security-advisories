summary: |
  Developer Patrick Cozzi reported a crash in some
  circumstances when using the Cesium JavaScript library to generate WebGL
  content. Mozilla developers determined that this crash is potentially
  exploitable.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
