summary: |
  Security researchers Jordi Chancel and Eddy
  Bordi reported that they could short-circuit page loads to show the
  address of a different site than what is loaded in the window in the addressbar.
  Security researcher Chris McGowen independently reported the
  same flaw, and further demonstrated that this could lead to loading scripts from
  the attacker's site, leaving users vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS)
  attacks.
