summary: |
  Security researcher Rafael Gieschke reported that file URIs dragged
  from a web page in Firefox to other software do not have their contents properly filtered
  before being passed to other programs, such as the local file manager. This can allow for
  the theft or manipulation of arbitrary local files if a user can be convinced to drag
  items from a malicious web page to other programs.
