summary: |
  Security researchers Tyson Smith and Jesse
  Schwartzentruber of the BlackBerry Security Automated Analysis Team
  used the Address Sanitizer tool while fuzzing to discover a use-after-free in
  the event listener manager. This can be triggered by web content and leads to a
  potentially exploitable crash. This issue was introduced in Firefox 29 and does
  not affect earlier versions.
