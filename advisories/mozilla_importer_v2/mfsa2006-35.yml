summary: |
  In certain circumstances persisted XUL attributes are associated with the
  wrong URL. If an attacker can get a persisted string associated with an
  URL that will later eval or execute that attribute in a privileged
  context then the attacker's code will run with the full permissions
  of the browser.
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
  and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
  the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
  JavaScript in mail.
