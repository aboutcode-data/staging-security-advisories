summary: |
  Security researcher Liu Die Yu of
  TopsecTianRongXin reported that locally saved .url shortcut files
  could be used to read information stored in the local cache.  An
  attacker could use this vulnerability to steal information from a
  victim's browser cache if they were able to get the victim to download
  two separate files, a .url shortcut and a HTML file.  Given the
  relative complexity of this attack, the severity of the issue was
  determined to be moderate.
