summary: |
  Paul Nickerson demonstrated that if an attacker could convince a user
  to right-click on a broken image and choose "View Image" from the context
  menu then he could get javascript to run on a site of the attacker's choosing
  by making the image src attribute a javascript: URL and loading the target
  site on mousedown. This could be used to steal login cookies or other
  confidential information from the target site.
  Similarly, if a user could be convinced to right-click and choose
  "Show only this frame" on a frame whose src attribute is a javascript: URL
  then that script would run in the context of the framing site. In order
  for this variant to be effective not only would you have to convince the
  user to view the frame, you would have to find an interesting target
  site that can be made to host a frame of the attacker's choosing.
