summary: "Mozilla developer Olli Pettay reported that while\ninvestigating Mozilla\nFoundation\
  \ Security Advisory 2015-28, he and Mozilla developer Boris\nZbarsky found an alternate way\
  \ to trigger a similar vulnerability. The\npreviously reported flaw used an issue with SVG\
  \ content navigation to bypass\nsame-origin policy protections to run scripts in a privileged\
  \ context. This\nnewer variant found that the same flaw could be used during anchor navigation\
  \ of\na page, allowing bypassing of same-origin policy protections. \n\nIn general this flaw\
  \ cannot be exploited through email in the\nThunderbird product because scripting is disabled,\
  \ but is potentially a risk in\nbrowser or browser-like contexts."
