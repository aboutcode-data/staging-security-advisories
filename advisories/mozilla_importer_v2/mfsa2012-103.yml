summary: "Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski reported that the location property can be accessed\
  \ by binary plugins through top.location with a frame whose name attribute's value is set\
  \ to \"top\". This can allow for possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks through plugins.\
  \ \n\nIn general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the\nThunderbird and SeaMonkey\
  \ products because scripting is disabled, but are\npotentially a risk in browser or browser-like\
  \ contexts in those products."
