summary: |
  Security researcher Frédéric Hoguin discovered
  that the Mozilla Maintenance Service on Windows was vulnerable to a buffer
  overflow. This system is used to update software without invoking the User
  Account Control (UAC) prompt. The Mozilla Maintenance Service is configured to
  allow unprivileged users to start it with arbitrary arguments. By manipulating
  the data passed in these arguments, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with
  the system privileges used by the service. This issue requires local file system
  access to be exploitable.
