summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher David Chan reported
  that cookies set for example.com. (note the trailing dot)
  and example.com were treated as interchangeable.  This is
  a violation of same-origin conventions and could potentially lead to
  leakage of cookie data to the wrong party.
  This issue did not affect Firefox 4, SeaMonkey 2.1, or newer
  Mozilla-based products.
