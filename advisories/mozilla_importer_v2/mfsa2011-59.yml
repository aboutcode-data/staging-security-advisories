summary: "Part of the fix for \nMFSA 2011-40, reported by Mariusz Mlynski, was to treat .jar\n\
  files as executables. This is necessary because Java treats downloaded .jar\nfiles as fully-featured\
  \ \"Applications\" rather than restricting them to the\nlimited privileges of in-browser \"\
  Applets\". The fix taken in Firefox 3.6\nwas discovered to be incorrect for the Mac OS X version."
