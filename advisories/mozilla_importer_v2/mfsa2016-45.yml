summary: |
  Security researcher Muneaki Nishimura (nishimunea) of Recruit
  Technologies Co., Ltd. reported that Content Security Policy (CSP) is not applied
  correctly to web content sent with the multipart/x-mixed-replace MIME type.
  This allows for script to run in instances where CSP should block it, leading to a failure
  to prevent potential cross-site scripting (XSS) and other attacks against the web page.
