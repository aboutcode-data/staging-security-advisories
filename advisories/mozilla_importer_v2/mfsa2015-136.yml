summary: "Security researcher cgvwzq reported that it is possible to read\ncross-origin URLs\
  \ following a redirect if performance.getEntries() is used\nalong with an iframe to host a\
  \ page. Navigating back in history through script, content is\npulled from the browser cache\
  \ for the redirected location instead of going to the original\nlocation. This is a same-origin\
  \ policy violation and could allow for data theft. \n\nThis issue affects other browsers as\
  \ well and is not limited to Mozilla products."
