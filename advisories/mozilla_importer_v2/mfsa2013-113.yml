summary: |
  Firefox user Sijie Xia reported that if a user
  explicitly removes the trust for extended validation (EV) capable root
  certificates in the certificate manager, the change is not properly used when
  validating EV certificates, causing the setting to be ignored. This removes the
  ability of users to explicitly untrust root certificates from specific
  certificate authorities.

  This flaw does not affect certificates that are not extended
  validation certificates. All other certificate validation checks do occur, the
  error is the assumption that if Mozilla trusted the certificate, the user would
  also.
