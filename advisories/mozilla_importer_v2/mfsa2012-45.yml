summary: |
  Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski reported an issue with
  spoofing of the location property. In this issue, calls to history.forward and
  history.back are used to navigate to a site while displaying the previous site
  in the addressbar but changing the baseURI to the newer site. This can be used
  for phishing by allowing the user to input form or other data on the newer,
  attacking, site while appearing to be on the older, displayed site.
