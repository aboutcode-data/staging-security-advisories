summary: |
  Security researcher Joe Vennix from Rapid7 reported that passing a JavaScript object to XMLHttpRequest that mimics an input stream will a crash. This crash is not exploitable and can only be used for denial of service attacks.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
