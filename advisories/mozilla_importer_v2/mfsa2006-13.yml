summary: |
  By layering a transparent image link to an executable on top of a
  visible (and presumably desirable) image
  a malicious site might be able to convince some visitors to
  right-click and choose "Save image as..." from the context menu
  and fool them by giving them the executable instead. When the users
  later double-click on the saved "image" to view or edit it
  the attacker's malware would be run.
  The attacker could put a lot of spaces before the extension to hide it
  by pushing it out of the standard file-saving dialog, and once downloaded
  the default Windows behavior of hiding the extension could make a filename
  such as "bikini.jpg        .exe"
  look like a legitimate image. The attacker
  could further this illusion by embedding a common image icon into
  the executable.
