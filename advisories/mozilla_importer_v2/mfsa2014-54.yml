summary: |
  Security researcher Looben Yang reported a buffer overflow
  in Gamepad API when it is exercised with a gamepad device with non-contiguous
  axes. This can be either an actual physical device or by the installation of a
  virtual gamepad. This results in a potentially exploitable crash. The Gamepad API
  was introduced in Firefox 29 and this issue does not affect earlier versions.

  This issue occurs only on Windows 8 with a gamepad or virtual gamepad
  attached.
