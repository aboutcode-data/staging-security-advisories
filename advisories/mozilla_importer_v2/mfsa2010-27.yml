summary: |
  Security researcher wushi of team509 reported that
  the frame construction process for certain types of menus could result
  in a menu containing a pointer to a previously freed menu item.
  During the cycle collection process, this freed item could be accessed,
  resulting in the execution of a section of code potentially controlled
  by an attacker.
