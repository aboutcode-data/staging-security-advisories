summary: |
  Security researcher Muneaki Nishimura discovered a flaw in
  the Mozilla's HTTP
  Alternative Services implementation. If an Alt-Svc header is
  specified in the HTTP/2 response, SSL certificate verification can be bypassed
  for the specified alternate server. As a result of this, warnings of invalid SSL
  certificates will not be displayed and an attacker could potentially impersonate
  another site through a man-in-the-middle (MTIM), replacing the original
  certificate with their own.
