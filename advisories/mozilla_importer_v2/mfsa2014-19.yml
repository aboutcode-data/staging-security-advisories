summary: |
  Mozilla developer Ehsan Akhgari reported a spoofing attack
  where the permission prompt for a WebRTC session can appear to be from a
  different site than its actual originating site if a timed navigation occurs
  during the prompt generation. This allows an attacker to potentially gain access
  to the webcam or microphone by masquerading as another site and gaining user
  permission through spoofing.
