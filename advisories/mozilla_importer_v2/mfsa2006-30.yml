summary: |
  Martijn Wargers and Nick Mott each described crashes that were discovered
  to ultimately stem from the same root cause: attempting to use a deleted
  controller context when designMode was turned on. This generally
  results in crashing the browser, but in theory references to deleted objects
  can be abused to run malicious code.
  "splices" reported the same crash at the fan site MozillaZine
  and on Bugtraq, incorrectly describing it as a buffer overflow.
  Update (31 July 2006)
  The advisory originally stated that older clients (Firefox 1.0.x and the Mozilla
  Suite 1.7.x) were unaffected. This is incorrect as demonstrated by the testcase
  MoBB#4 at the Browser Fun Blog. Those clients were already at risk from
  many other published vulnerabilities and should no longer be used.
