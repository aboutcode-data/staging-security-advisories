summary: |
  Security researcher Warren He reported that when a page is
  transitioned into Reader Mode in Firefox for Android, the resulting page has
  chrome privileges and its content is not thoroughly sanitized. A successful
  attack requires user enabling of reader mode for a malicious page, which could
  then perform an attack similar to cross-site scripting (XSS) to gain the
  privileges allowed to Firefox on an Android device. This has been fixed by
  changing the Reader Mode page into an unprivileged page.

  This vulnerability only affects Firefox for Android.
