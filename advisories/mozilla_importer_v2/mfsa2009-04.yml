summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher Georgi Guninski reported
  that the fix for an earlier vulnerability reported by Liu Die Yu using local
  internet shortcut files to access other sites
  (MFSA 2008-47) could be bypassed
  by redirecting to a privileged about: URI such as
  about:plugins.
  If an attacker could get a victim to
  download two files, a malicious HTML file and a .desktop shortcut
  file, they could have the HTML document load a privileged chrome document
  via the shortcut and both documents would be treated as same origin.
  This vulnerability could potentially be used by an attacker to inject
  arbitrary code into the chrome document and execute with chrome
  privileges.  Because this attack has relatively high complexity, the
  severity of this issue was determined to be moderate.
