aliases:
  - CVE-2022-22764
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Mozilla developers and community members Paul Adenot and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 91.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
