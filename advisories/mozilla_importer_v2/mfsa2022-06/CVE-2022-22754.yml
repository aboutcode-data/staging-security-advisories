  - CVE-2022-22754
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  If a user installed an extension of a particular type, the extension could have auto-updated itself and while doing so, bypass the prompt which grants the new version the new requested permissions.
