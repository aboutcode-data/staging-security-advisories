summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  If a document created a sandboxed iframe without allow-scripts, and subsequently appended an element to the iframe's document that e.g. had a JavaScript event handler - the event handler would have run despite the iframe's sandbox.
