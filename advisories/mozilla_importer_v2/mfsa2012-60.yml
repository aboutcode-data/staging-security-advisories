summary: |
  Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski reported that when a
  page opens a new tab, a subsequent window can then be opened that can be
  navigated to about:newtab, a chrome privileged page. Once
  about:newtab is loaded, the special context can potentially be used
  to escalate privilege, allowing for arbitrary code execution on the local system
  in a maliciously crafted attack.
