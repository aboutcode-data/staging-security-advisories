aliases:
  - CVE-2024-1554
summary: The fetch() API and navigation incorrectly shared the same cache, as the cache key
  did not include the optional headers fetch() may contain.  Under the correct circumstances,
  an attacker may have been able to poison the local browser cache by priming it with a fetch()
  response controlled by the additional headers. Upon navigation to the same URL, the user would
  see the cached response instead of the expected response.
