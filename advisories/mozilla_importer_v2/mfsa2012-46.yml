summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack through the context menu using a
  data: URL. In this issue, context menu functionality ("View Image", "Show only this frame", and "View background image") are disallowed in a javascript: URL but allowed in a data: URL, allowing for XSS. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.
