summary: |
  A bug in javascript's regular expression string replacement when using an
  anonymous function as the replacement argument allows a malicious script
  to capture blocks of memory allocated to the browser. A web site could
  capture data and transmit it to a server without user interaction or
  knowledge.
  The attacker cannot control what will be captured, but the data returned
  sometimes contains bits of websites the user has recently visited and
  their addresses. The data could be sifted to find the occasional valuable
  bits of information.
