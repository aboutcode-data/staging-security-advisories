summary: "Using the Address Sanitizer tool, security researcher Atte\nKettunen from OUSPG discovered\
  \ a use-after-free in Web Audio due to an\nissue with how control messages for Web Audio are\
  \ ordered and processed. This\nleads to a potentially exploitable crash. \n\nIn general this\
  \ flaw cannot be exploited through email in the\nThunderbird product because scripting is\
  \ disabled, but is potentially a risk in\nbrowser or browser-like contexts."
