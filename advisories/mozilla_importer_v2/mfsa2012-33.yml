summary: |
  Security researcher Jeroen van der Gun reported that if RSS
  or Atom XML invalid content is loaded over HTTPS, the addressbar updates to
  display the new location of the loaded resource, including SSL indicators, while
  the main window still displays the previously loaded content. This allows for
  phishing attacks where a malicious page can spoof the identify of another
  seemingly secure site.
