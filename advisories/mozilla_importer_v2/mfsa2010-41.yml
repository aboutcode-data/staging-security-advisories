summary: |
  OUSPG researcher Aki Helin reported a buffer
  overflow in Mozilla graphics code which consumes image data processed
  by libpng.  A malformed PNG file could be created which would cause
  libpng to incorrectly report the size of the image to downstream
  consumers.  When the dimensions of such images are underreported, the
  Mozilla code responsible for displaying the graphic will allocate too
  small a memory buffer to contain the image data and will wind up
  writing data past the end of the buffer.  This could result in the
  execution of attacker-controlled memory.
