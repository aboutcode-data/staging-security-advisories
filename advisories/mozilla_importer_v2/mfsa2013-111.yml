summary: "Security researchers Tyson Smith and Jesse\nSchwartzentruber of the BlackBerry Security\
  \ Automated Analysis Team\nused the Address Sanitizer tool while fuzzing to discover a mechanism\
  \ where\ninserting an ordered list into a document through script could lead to a\npotentially\
  \ exploitable crash that can be triggered by web content. \n\nIn general these flaws cannot\
  \ be exploited through email in the\nThunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting\
  \ is disabled, but are\npotentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts."
