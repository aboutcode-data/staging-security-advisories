  - CVE-2020-16048
summary: 'In the Angle graphics library, depth pitch computations did not take into account
  the block size and simply multiplied the row pitch with the pixel height.  This caused the
  load functions to use a very high depth pitch, reading past the end of the user-supplied buffer.*Note:
  This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*'
