summary: "Mozilla developer Boris Zbarsky reported an inconsistency\nwith the different JavaScript\
  \ engines in how JavaScript native getters on\nwindow objects are handled by these engines.\
  \ This inconsistency can\nlead to different behaviors in JavaScript code, allowing for a potential\n\
  security issue with window handling by bypassing of some security checks. \n\nIn general this\
  \ flaw cannot be exploited through email in the\nThunderbird and Seamonkey products because\
  \ scripting is disabled in mail, but is\npotentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts."
