summary: |
  Security researcher Looben Yang reported a buffer overflow in the
  JPEGEncoder function during script interactions with a canvas
  element. This is caused by a race condition and incorrectly matched sizes following image
  interactions. This leads to a potentially exploitable crash.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
