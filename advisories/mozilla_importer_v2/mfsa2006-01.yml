summary: |
  Garbage collection hazards have been found in the JavaScript
  engine where some routines used temporary variables
  that were not properly protected (rooted). Specially crafted objects
  could contain a user-defined method that would be called during
  the lifetime of these temporaries. If this method triggered
  garbage collection the engine would operate on the unexpectedly freed
  temporary object when it returned from the user-defined routine.
  The risk appears remote, but this type of memory corruption could
  potentially be used by an attacker to run arbitrary code.
  CVE-2006-0293 was introduced during Firefox 1.5 development and does not
  affect Firefox 1.0. CVE-2006-0292 affects all versions of Firefox.
  Thunderbird shares the JavaScript engine with Firefox
  and could be vulnerable if JavaScript is enabled in mail. This is not
  the default setting; we strongly discourage users from running
  JavaScript in mail.
  Update (13 April 2006)
  This flaw has been fixed in Thunderbird 1.5.0.2
  Updated versions of Firefox 1.0, Thunderbird 1.0, and the Mozilla Suite 1.7
  have been released containing this fix.
