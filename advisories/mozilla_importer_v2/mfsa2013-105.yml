summary: |
  Mozilla developer Myk Melez reported that with specifically
  timed page navigation, the doorhanger notification for Web App installation
  could persist from one site to another without being dismissed by the
  navigation. This could be used by a malicious site to trick a user into
  installing an application from one site while making it appear to come from
  another.
