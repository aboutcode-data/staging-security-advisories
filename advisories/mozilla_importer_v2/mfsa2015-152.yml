summary: |
  Shally Li was first to report a race condition
  in the lockscreen of Firefox OS that can be used to bypass the passcode
  lock of a Firefox OS device. Under certain circumstances on a locked
  device, the user will be dropped directly to the homescreen instead of
  being presented with the passcode input dialog.
