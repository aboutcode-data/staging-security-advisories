summary: |
  Security researcher Muneaki Nishimura discovered that Content Security Policy (CSP) violation reports triggered by a redirect did not remove path information as required by the CSP specification. This potentially reveals information about the redirect that would not otherwise be known to the original site. This could be used by a malicious site to obtain sensitive information such as usernames or single-sign-on tokens encoded within the target URLs.

  This issue did not affect versions prior to Firefox 33.
