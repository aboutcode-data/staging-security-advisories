aliases:
  - CVE-2024-5692
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  On Windows 10, when using the 'Save As' functionality, an attacker could have tricked the browser into saving the file with a disallowed extension such as .url by including an invalid character in the extension. *Note:* This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.
