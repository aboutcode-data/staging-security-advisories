summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  By tricking the browser with a X-Frame-Options header, a sandboxed iframe could have presented a button that, if clicked by a user, would bypass restrictions to open a new window.
