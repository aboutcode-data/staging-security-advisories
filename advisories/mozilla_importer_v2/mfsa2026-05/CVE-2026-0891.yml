aliases:
  - CVE-2026-0891
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Memory safety bugs present in Firefox ESR 140.6, Thunderbird ESR 140.6, Firefox 146 and Thunderbird 146. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
