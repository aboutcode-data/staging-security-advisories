summary: |
  Security researcher Francis Gabriel of Quarkslab reported a heap-based
  buffer overflow in the way the Network Security Services (NSS) libraries parsed certain
  ASN.1 structures. An attacker could create a specially-crafted certificate which, when
  parsed by NSS, would cause it to crash or execute arbitrary code with the permissions of
  the user.

  This issue has been addressed in the NSS releases shipping on affected Mozilla
  products:
