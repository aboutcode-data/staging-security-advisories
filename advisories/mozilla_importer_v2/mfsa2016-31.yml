summary: |
  The CESG, the Information Security Arm of GCHQ, reported a dangling
  pointer dereference within the Netscape Plugin Application Programming Interface (NPAPI)
  that could lead to the NPAPI subsystem crashing. This issue requires a maliciously crafted
  NPAPI plugin in concert with scripted web content, resulting in a potentially exploitable
  crash when triggered.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
