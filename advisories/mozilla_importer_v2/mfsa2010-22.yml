summary: |
  Mozilla developers added support in the Network Security Services
  module for preventing a type of man-in-the-middle attack against TLS
  using forced renegotiation.
  Note that to benefit from the fix, Firefox 3.6 and
  Firefox 3.5 users will need to set
  their security.ssl.require_safe_negotiation preference to
  true.  Firefox 3 does not contain the fix for this issue.
