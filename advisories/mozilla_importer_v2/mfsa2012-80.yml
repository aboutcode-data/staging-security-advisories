summary: |
  Mozilla community member Ms2ger reported a crash due to an
  invalid cast when using the instanceof operator on certain types of JavaScript
  objects. This can lead to a potentially exploitable crash.

  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
