summary: |
  Security researcher regenrecht reported via
  TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that
  when window.__lookupGetter__ is called with no arguments
  the code assumes the top JavaScript stack value is a property name.
  Since there were no arguments passed into the function, the top value
  could represent uninitialized memory or a pointer to a previously
  freed JavaScript object.  Under such circumstances the value is passed
  to another subroutine which calls through the dangling pointer,
  potentially executing attacker-controlled memory.
