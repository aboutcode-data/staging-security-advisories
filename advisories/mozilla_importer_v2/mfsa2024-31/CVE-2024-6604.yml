aliases:
  - CVE-2024-6604
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potential risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*Updated Sept 6, 2024 to add CVE-2024-7652 which was embargoed in the original advisory due affecting multiple organizations.

  Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 127, Firefox ESR 115.12, and Thunderbird 115.12. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
