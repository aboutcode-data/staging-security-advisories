summary: |
  Security researcher Karthikeyan Bhargavan reported an issue
  in Network Security Services (NSS) where the client allows for a ECDHE_ECDSA
  exchange where the server does not send its ServerKeyExchange
  message instead of aborting the handshake. Instead, the NSS client will take the
  EC key from the ECDSA certificate. This violates the TLS protocol and also has
  some security implications for forward secrecy. In this situation, the browser
  thinks it is engaged in an ECDHE exchange, but has been silently downgraded to a
  non-forward secret mixed-ECDH exchange instead. As a result, if False
  Start is enabled, the browser will start sending data encrypted under
  these non-forward-secret connection keys. This issue was fixed in NSS version
  3.19.1.
