summary: |
  shutdown reports that scripts granted the UniversalBrowserRead privilege
  can leverage that into the equivalent of the far more powerful
  UniversalXPConnect since they are allowed to "read" into a privileged
  context. This allows the attacker the ability to run scripts with the
  full privilege of the user running the browser, possibly installing
  malware or snooping on private data. This has been fixed so that
  UniversalBrowserRead and UniversalBrowserWrite are limited to
  reading from and writing into only normally-privileged browser
  windows and frames.
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
  and would be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
  the default setting and we strongly discourage users from enabling
  JavaScript in mail.
