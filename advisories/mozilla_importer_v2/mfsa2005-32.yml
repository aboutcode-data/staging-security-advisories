summary: |
  A malicious page that could lure a user into dragging something (such as a
  fake scrollbar) can bypass the restriction on opening privileged XUL. The
  startup scripts in the XUL will run with enhanced privilege, though the
  actions taken upon merely opening most XUL are benign. So far no way to
  run arbitrary code supplied by the attacker has been found, but this
  could be a stepping-stone to future attacks.
