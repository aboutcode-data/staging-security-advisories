summary: |
  Mozilla community member Tobias Schula reported that if
  gfx.color_management.enablev4 preference is enabled manually in
  about:config, some grayscale PNG images will be rendered
  incorrectly and cause memory corruption during PNG decoding when certain color
  profiles are in use. A crafted PNG image could use this flaw to leak data
  through rendered images drawing from random memory. By default, this preference
  is not enabled.
