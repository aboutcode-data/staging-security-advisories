summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported
  that the BrowserFeedWriter could be leveraged to run
  JavaScript code from web content with elevated privileges.  Using this
  vulnerability, an attacker could construct an object containing
  malicious JavaScript and cause the FeedWriter to process the object,
  running the malicious code with chrome privileges.
  Thunderbird does not support
  the BrowserFeedWriter object and is not vulnerable in its
  default configuration. Thunderbird might be vulnerable if the user has
  installed any add-on which adds a similarly implemented feature and
  then enables JavaScript in mail messages.  This is not the default
  setting and we strongly discourage users from running JavaScript in
  mail.
