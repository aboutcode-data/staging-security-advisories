summary: Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Jon Coppeard, Marcia Knous,
  David Baron, Mats Palmgren, Ronald Crane, Bob Clary, and Chris Peterson reported memory safety
  bugs present in Firefox 52, Firefox ESR 45.8, and Firefox ESR 52. Some of these bugs showed

  be exploited to run arbitrary code.
