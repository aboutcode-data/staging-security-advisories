summary: |
  Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski reported that when a
  user examines the profiler output on a malicious website containing specially
  crafted code, it is possible for arbitrary code execution to occur. This occurs
  because the profiler user interface runs in a special iframe that
  parses data from the profiler to render the UI, leaving it susceptible to
  manipulation.
