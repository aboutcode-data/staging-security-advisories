summary: |
  Following the recent Chrome sandbox escape (CVE-2025-2783), various Firefox
  developers identified a similar pattern in our IPC code. A compromised child
  process could cause the parent process to return an unintentionally
  powerful handle, leading to a sandbox escape.
  The original vulnerability was being exploited in the wild.
  *This only affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*
