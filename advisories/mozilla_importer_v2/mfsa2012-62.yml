summary: |
  Security researcher miaubiz used the Address Sanitizer tool
  to discover two WebGL issues. The first issue is a use-after-free when WebGL
  shaders are called after being destroyed. The second issue exposes a problem
  with Mesa drivers on Linux, leading to a potentially exploitable crash.
