summary: |
  Mozilla add-on developer and community member Wladimir
  Palant reported broken functionality on pages that had a
  Link: HTTP header when an add-on was installed
  which implemented a Content Policy in JavaScript, such
  as AdBlock Plus or NoScript.  Mozilla security
  researcher moz_bug_r_a4 demonstrated that the broken
  functionality was due to the window's global object
  receiving an incorrect security wrapper and that this issue could be
  used to execute arbitrary JavaScript with chrome privileges.
