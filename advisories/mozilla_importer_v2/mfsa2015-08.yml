summary: |
  Brian Smith reported that delegated Online Certificate
  Status Protocol (OCSP) responder certificates fail to recognize the
  id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck extension. If this extension is present in a
  delegated OCSP response signing certificate, it will be discarded if it is
  signed by such a certificate. This could result in a user connecting to a site
  with a revoked certificate.
