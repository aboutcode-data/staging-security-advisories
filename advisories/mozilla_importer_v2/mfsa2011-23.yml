summary: |
  Security researcher regenrecht reported via
  TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative two instances of code which
  modifies SVG element lists failed to account for changes made to the
  list by user-supplied callbacks before accessing list elements.  If a
  user-supplied callback deleted such an object, the element-modifying
  code could wind up accessing deleted memory and potentially executing
  attacker-controlled memory.
  regenrecht also reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative
  that a XUL document could force the nsXULCommandDispatcher to remove
  all command updaters from the queue, including the one currently in
  use.  This could result in the execution of deleted memory which an
  attacker could use to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
  Firefox 4 and SeaMonkey 2.1 and newer were not affected by
  these issues.
