  - CVE-2022-45406
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  If an out-of-memory condition occurred when creating a JavaScript global, a JavaScript realm may be deleted while references to it lived on in a BaseShape. This could lead to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash.
