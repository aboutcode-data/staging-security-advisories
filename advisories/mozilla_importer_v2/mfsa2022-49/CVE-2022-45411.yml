summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Cross-Site Tracing occurs when a server will echo a request back via the Trace method, allowing an XSS attack to access to authorization headers and cookies inaccessible to JavaScript (such as cookies protected by HTTPOnly).  To mitigate this attack, browsers placed limits on fetch() and XMLHttpRequest; however some webservers have implemented non-standard headers such as X-Http-Method-Override that override the HTTP method, and made this attack possible again.  Thunderbird has applied the same mitigations to the use of this and similar headers.
