aliases:
  - CVE-2017-7804
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  The destructor function for the WindowsDllDetourPatcher class can be re-purposed by malicious code in concert with another vulnerability to write arbitrary data to an attacker controlled location in memory. This can be used to bypass existing memory protections in this situation. *Note: This attack only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are not affected.*
