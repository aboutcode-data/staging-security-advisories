  - CVE-2017-7787
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Same-origin policy protections can be bypassed on pages with embedded iframes during page reloads, allowing the iframes to access content on the top level page, leading to information disclosure.
