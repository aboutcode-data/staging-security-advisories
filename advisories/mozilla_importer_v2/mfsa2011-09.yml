summary: |
  Security researcher Jordi Chancel reported that a
  JPEG image could be constructed that would be decoded incorrectly,
  causing data to be written past the end of a buffer created to store
  the image.  An attacker could potentially craft such an image that
  would cause malicious code to be stored in memory and then later
  executed on a victim's computer.
  Firefox 3.5 was not affected by this issue.
