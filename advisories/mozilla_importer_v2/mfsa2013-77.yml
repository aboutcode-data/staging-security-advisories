summary: |
  Using the Address Sanitizer tool, security researcher Atte
  Kettunen from OUSPG found that the HTML5 Tree Builder does not properly
  store state when interacting with template elements. Because some
  stack information is incorrectly stored, the template insertion mode stack can
  be used when it is empty. This could possibly lead to code execution in some
  circumstances.
  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
