summary: |
  Security researcher Amit Klein reported that it
  was possible to reverse engineer the value used to
  seed Math.random().  Since the pseudo-random number
  generator was only seeded once per browsing session, this seed value
  could be used as a unique token to identify and track users across
  different web sites.
  Update (October 27, 2010): After the Firefox 3.6.4
  and Firefox 3.5.10 releases, Amit Klein reported that there was an
  additional unfixed case where user tracking could occur using the
  above-mentioned technique and a pop-up window or iframe that was
  subsequently navigated by the user.  This additional variant is
  identified as CVE-2010-3171.
