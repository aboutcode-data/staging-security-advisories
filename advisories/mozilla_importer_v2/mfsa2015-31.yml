summary: |
  Security researcher Aki Helin reported a use-after-free when
  playing certain MP3 format audio files on the web using the Fluendo MP3 plugin
  for GStreamer on Linux. This is due to a flaw in handling certain MP3 files by
  the plugin and its interaction with Mozilla code. This can lead to a potentially
  exploitable crash.

  This flaw only affects Linux installations. Windows and OS X
  users are unaffected by it.
