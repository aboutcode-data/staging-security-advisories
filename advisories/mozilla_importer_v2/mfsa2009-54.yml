summary: |
  Security researcher Orlando Berrera of Sec Theory
  reported that recursive creation of JavaScript web-workers can be used
  to create a set of objects whose memory could be freed prior to their
  use.  These conditions often result in a crash which could potentially
  be used by an attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's
  computer.
  Web Workers were introduced in Firefox 3.5 so this
  vulnerability did not affect earlier releases such as Firefox 3.
