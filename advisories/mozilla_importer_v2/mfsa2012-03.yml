summary: |
  Vitaly Nevgen reported that an attacker could replace a
  sub-frame in another domain's document by using the name attribute of the
  sub-frame as a form submission target. This can potentially allow for phishing
  attacks against users and violates the HTML5 frame navigation policy.

  Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by this
  vulnerability.
