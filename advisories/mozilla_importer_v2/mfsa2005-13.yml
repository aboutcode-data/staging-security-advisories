summary: |
  A website can inject content into a popup opened by another site if the
  target name of the popup window is known. An attacker who knows you are
  going to visit that other site could spoof the contents of the popup.
  Open windows can now be targeted by name only by the site whose content
  is in the window and the site which opened the window if different.
  Other sites attempting to target the same named window will instead
  get a new unnamed window.
