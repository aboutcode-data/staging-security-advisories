summary: |
  Security researcher Christian Holler reported that
  the JavaScript engine's internal mapping of string values contained an
  error in cases where the number of values being stored was above 64K.
  In such cases an offset pointer was manually moved forwards and
  backwards to access the larger address space.  If an exception was
  thrown between the time that the offset pointer was moved forward and
  the time it was reset, then the exception object would be read from an
  invalid memory address, potentially executing attacker-controlled
  memory.
