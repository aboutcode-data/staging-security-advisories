summary: |
  Security researcher Seb Patane reported that the Mozilla
  Updater does not write-lock the MAR update file when it is in use by the
  Updater. This leaves open the possibility of altering the contents of the MAR
  file after the signature on the file has been verified as valid but before it
  has been used. This could allow an attacker with access to the local system to
  silently replace the contents of the update MAR file and either replace the
  installed software with their own or extract and run executables files with the
  same privileges as that of the Mozilla Updater.
