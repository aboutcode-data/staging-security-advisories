summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher Jesse Ruderman reported that events in the plugin handler can be manipulated by web content to bypass same-origin policy (SOP) restrictions. This can allow for clickjacking on malicious web pages.

  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
