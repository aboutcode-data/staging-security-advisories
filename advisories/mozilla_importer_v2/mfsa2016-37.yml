summary: "Security researcher Holger Fuhrmannek and Mozilla security engineer\nTyson Smith reported\
  \ a number of security vulnerabilities in the Graphite\n2 library affecting version 1.3.5.\n\
  \nThe issue reported by Holger Fuhrmannek is a mechanism to induce\nstack corruption with\
  \ a malicious graphite font. This leads to a potentially exploitable\ncrash when the font\
  \ is loaded.\n\nTyson Smith used the Address Sanitizer tool in concert with a custom\nsoftware\
  \ fuzzer to find a series of uninitialized memory, out-of-bounds read, and\nout-of-bounds\
  \ write errors when working with fuzzed graphite fonts. \n\n\nTo address these security vulnerabilities,\
  \ Firefox 45 and Firefox ESR 38.7 have been\nupdated to Graphite 2 version 1.3.6."
