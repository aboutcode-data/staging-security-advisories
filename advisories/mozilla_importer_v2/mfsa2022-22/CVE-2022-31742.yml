aliases:
  - CVE-2022-31742
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  An attacker could have exploited a timing attack by sending a large number of allowCredential entries and detecting the difference between invalid key handles and cross-origin key handles.  This could have led to cross-origin account linking in violation of WebAuthn goals.
