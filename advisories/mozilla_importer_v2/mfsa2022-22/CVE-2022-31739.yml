aliases:
  - CVE-2022-31739
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  When downloading files on Windows, the % character was not escaped, which could have lead to a download incorrectly being saved to attacker-influenced paths that used variables such as %HOMEPATH% or %APPDATA%.*This bug only affects Thunderbird for Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*
