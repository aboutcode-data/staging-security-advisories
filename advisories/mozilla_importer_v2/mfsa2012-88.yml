summary: |
  Mozilla developers identified and fixed two top crashing bugs in the
  browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. These bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances, and we
  presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
  arbitrary code.
  The first of these bugs, a FreeType issue, is a mobile only issue which happens on custom kernels like Cyanogenmod, not on standard Android installations. The second bug is a websockets crash affecting Firefox 16 but not Firefox ESR.
