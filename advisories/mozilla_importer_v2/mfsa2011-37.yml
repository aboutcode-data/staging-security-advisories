summary: |
  Mark Kaplan reported a potentially exploitable crash due to
  integer underflow when using a large JavaScript RegExp expression.
  We would also like to thank Mark for contributing the fix for this problem.

  The Regular Expression engine was replaced in Firefox 4 and
  the newer engine does not suffer from this bug.
