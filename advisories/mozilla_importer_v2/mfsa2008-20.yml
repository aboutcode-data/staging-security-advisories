summary: "Fixes for security problems in the JavaScript engine described in \n\nMFSA 2008-15\
  \ (CVE-2008-1237) introduced a stability problem, where some\nusers experienced crashes during\
  \ JavaScript garbage collection. This is being\nfixed primarily to address stability concerns.\
  \ We have no demonstration that\nthis particular crash is exploitable but are issuing this\
  \ advisory because\nsome crashes of this type have been shown to be exploitable in the past.\n\
  This regression was introduced in Firefox 2.0.0.13 and does\nnot affect any shipping version\
  \ of Thunderbird. Thunderbird 2.0.0.14 contains\nthe correct fix for MFSA 2008-15, although\
  \ as noted in that advisory\nThunderbird users would be vulnerable only if they had enabled\
  \ JavaScript."
