summary: |
  Security researchers David Huang
  and Collin Jackson of Carnegie Mellon University
  CyLab (Silicon Valley campus) reported that the type
  attribute of an <object> tag can override the charset of a
  framed HTML document, even when the document is included across
  origins.  A page could be constructed containing such an
  <object> tag which sets the charset of the framed document to
  UTF-7.  This could potentially allow an attacker to inject UTF-7
  encoded JavaScript into a site, bypassing the site's XSS filters, and
  then executing the code using the above technique.
