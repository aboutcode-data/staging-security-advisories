summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported
  that when content script which is running in a chrome context accesses
  a content object via SJOW, the content code can gain access to an
  object from the chrome scope and use that object to run arbitrary
  JavaScript with chrome privileges.
  Firefox 3.5 and other Mozilla products built from
  Gecko 1.9.1 were not affected by this issue.
