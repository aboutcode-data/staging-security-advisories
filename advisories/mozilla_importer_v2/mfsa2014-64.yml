summary: "Mozilla community member John reported a crash in the Skia\nlibrary when scaling high\
  \ quality images if the scaling operation takes too\nlong. This is caused by the image data\
  \ being discarded while still in use by the\nscaling operation. This crash is potentially\
  \ exploitable on some systems. \n\nIn general this flaw cannot be exploited through email\
  \ in the\nThunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in\n\
  browser or browser-like contexts."
