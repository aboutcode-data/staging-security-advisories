summary: "moz_bug_r_a4 discovered that named JavaScript functions have a parent object\ncreated\
  \ using the standard Object() constructor (ECMA-specified behavior)\nand that this constructor\
  \ can be redefined by script (also ECMA-specified\nbehavior). If the Object() constructor\
  \ is changed to return a reference\nto a privileged object with useful properties it is possible\
  \ to have\nattacker-supplied script executed with elevated privileges by calling\nthe function.\
  \ This could be used to install malware or take other malicious \nactions.\nOur fix involves\
  \ calling the internal Object constructor which\nappears to be what other ECMA-compatible\
  \ interpreters do.\nThunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox\nand would be vulnerable\
  \ if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not\nthe default setting and we strongly\
  \ discourage users from enabling\nJavaScript in mail."
