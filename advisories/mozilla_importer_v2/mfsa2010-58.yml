summary: |
  Security researcher Marc Schoenefeld reported that
  a specially crafted font could be applied to a document and cause a
  crash on Mac systems.  The crash showed signs of memory corruption and
  presumably could be used by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a
  victim's computer.
