summary: |
  Security researcher regenrecht reported via
  TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that the implementation of XUL
  <tree>'s content view contains a dangling pointer vulnerability.
  One of the content view's methods for accessing the internal structure
  of the tree could be manipulated into removing a node prior to
  accessing it, resulting in the accessing of deleted memory.  If an
  attacker can control the contents of the deleted memory prior to its
  access they could use this vulnerability to run arbitrary code on a
  victim's machine.
