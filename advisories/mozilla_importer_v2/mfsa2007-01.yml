summary: |
  As part of the Firefox 2.0.0.2  and 1.5.0.10 update releases we fixed
  several bugs to improve the stability of the product. Some of these were
  crashes that showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that
  with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
  arbitrary code.
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
  and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in
  mail. This is not the default setting and we strongly discourage users from
  running JavaScript in mail. Without further investigation we cannot rule out
  the possibility that for some of these an attacker might be able to prepare
  memory for exploitation through some means other than JavaScript, such as
  large images.
