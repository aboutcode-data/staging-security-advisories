summary: |
  *Updated June 10, 2025 to remove CVE-2025-3877 which was mistakenly marked as fixed. This vulnerability was fixed in Thunderbird 128.11.1/139.0.2 under the identifier CVE-2025-5986.*

  It was possible to craft an email that showed a tracking link as an
  attachment. If the user attempted to open the attachment, Thunderbird
  automatically accessed the link. The configuration to block remote content
  did not prevent that. Thunderbird has been fixed to no longer allow access
  to web pages listed in the X-Mozilla-External-Attachment-URL header of an
  email.
