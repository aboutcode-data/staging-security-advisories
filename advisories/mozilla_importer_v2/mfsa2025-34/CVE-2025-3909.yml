summary: |
  *Updated June 10, 2025 to remove CVE-2025-3877 which was mistakenly marked as fixed. This vulnerability was fixed in Thunderbird 128.11.1/139.0.2 under the identifier CVE-2025-5986.*

  Thunderbird's handling of the X-Mozilla-External-Attachment-URL header
  can be exploited to execute JavaScript in the file:/// context. By crafting a
  nested email attachment (message/rfc822) and setting its content type to
  application/pdf, Thunderbird may incorrectly render it as HTML when
  opened, allowing the embedded JavaScript to run without requiring a file
  download. This behavior relies on Thunderbird auto-saving the attachment
  to /tmp and linking to it via the file:/// protocol, potentially enabling
  JavaScript execution as part of the HTML.
