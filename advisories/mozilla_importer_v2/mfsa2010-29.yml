summary: |
  Security researcher Nils of MWR InfoSecurity
  reported that the routine for setting the text value for certain types
  of DOM nodes contained an integer overflow vulnerability.  When a very
  long string was passed to this routine, the integer value used in
  creating a new memory buffer to hold the string would overflow,
  resulting in too small a buffer being allocated.  An attacker could
  use this vulnerability to write data past the end of the buffer,
  causing a crash and potentially running arbitrary code on a victim's
  computer.
