summary: |
  When a user explicitly requested Thunderbird to decrypt an inline
  OpenPGP message that was embedded in a text section of an email
  that was formatted and styled with HTML and CSS, then the
  decrypted contents were rendered in a context in which the CSS
  styles from the outer messages were active. If the user had
  additionally allowed loading of the remote content referenced by
  the outer email message, and the email was crafted by the sender
  using a combination of CSS rules and fonts and animations, then
  it was possible to extract the secret contents of the email.
