  - CVE-2025-6434
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  The exception page for the HTTPS-Only feature, displayed when a website is opened via HTTP, lacked an anti-clickjacking delay, potentially allowing an attacker to trick a user into granting an exception and loading a webpage over HTTP.
