aliases:
  - CVE-2025-6429
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Thunderbird could have incorrectly parsed a URL and rewritten it to the youtube.com domain when parsing the URL specified in an embed tag.  This could have bypassed website security checks that restricted which domains users were allowed to embed.
