  - CVE-2025-6425
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  An attacker who enumerated resources from the WebCompat extension could have obtained a persistent UUID that identified the browser, and persisted between containers and normal/private browsing mode, but not profiles.
