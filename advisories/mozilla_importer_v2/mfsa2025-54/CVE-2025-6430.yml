aliases:
  - CVE-2025-6430
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  When a file download is specified via the Content-Disposition header, that directive would be ignored if the file was included via a <embed> or <object> tag, potentially making a website vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack.
