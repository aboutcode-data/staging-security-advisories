summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher Christoph Diehl reported two
  crashes in WebGL code. One crash was the result of an out-of-bounds
  read and could be used to read data from other processes who had
  stored data in the GPU. The severity of this issue was determined to
  be high. The second crash was the result of an invalid write and could
  be used to execute arbitrary code. The severity of this issue was
  determined to be critical.
  The WebGL functionality was introduced in the browser engine used
  by Firefox 4 and SeaMonkey 2.1; the vulnerability does not affect earlier versions.
