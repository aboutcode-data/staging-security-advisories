summary: |
  Security researchers Byoungyoung Lee, Chengyu Song, and Taesoo
  Kim at the Georgia Tech Information Security Center (GTISC) reported a
  bad casting from the BasicThebesLayer to
  BasicContainerLayer, resulting in undefined behavior. This behavior
  is potentially exploitable with some compilers but no clear mechanism to trigger
  it through web content was identified.
