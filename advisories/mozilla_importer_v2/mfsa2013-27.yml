summary: |
  Google security researcher Michal Zalewski reported an issue
  where the browser displayed the content of a proxy's 407 response if a user
  canceled the proxy's authentication prompt. In this circumstance, the addressbar
  will continue to show the requested site's address, including HTTPS addresses
  that appear to be secure. This spoofing of addresses can be used for phishing
  attacks by fooling users into entering credentials, for example.

  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
