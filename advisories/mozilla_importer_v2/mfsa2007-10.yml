summary: |
  Georgi Guninski discovered a potential integer overflow in the code
  that handles mail formatted as text/enhanced or text/richtext. This
  could in turn lead to a buffer overflow and potential code execution.
  To exploit this flaw a malicious mail message would have to include
  a line more than 400 megabytes long. Many mail systems have storage
  quotas and transport filters that would prevent a message of that size
  from reaching its destination, but should the message get through
  its size would provide more than sufficient space for a payload.
