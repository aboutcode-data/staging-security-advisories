summary: |
  Add-on authors Jason Hamilton and Peter Arremann with
  AMO editor Sylvain Giroux reported a vulnerability when a
  panel is created using the Add-on SDK in a browser extension. Defining a
  panel with script: false is supposed to disable script execution but it was
  found that inline script would still execute. This flaw allows for the potential execution
  of script content in an extension when it was been explicitly disallowed.
  The potential impact of this flaw would depend on whether the add-on was relying on
  script: false as a security mechanism and from location the panel content was
  loaded. No add-ons served from addons.mozilla.org
  are vulnerable to this flaw but add-ons installed from third party sites may be.
