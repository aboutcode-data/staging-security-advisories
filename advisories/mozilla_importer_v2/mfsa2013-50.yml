summary: |
  Security researcher Abhishek Arya (Inferno) of the Google
  Chrome Security Team used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a series of
  use-after-free problems rated critical as security issues in shipped software.
  Some of these issues are potentially exploitable, allowing for remote code
  execution. We would also like to thank Abhishek for reporting additional
  use-after-free and buffer overflow flaws in code introduced during Firefox
  development. These were fixed before general release.
  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
