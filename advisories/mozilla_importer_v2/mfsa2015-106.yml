summary: |
  An anonymous researcher reported, via HP's Zero Day Initiative, a use-after-free
  vulnerability with HTML media elements on a page during script manipulation of the URI
  table of these elements. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
