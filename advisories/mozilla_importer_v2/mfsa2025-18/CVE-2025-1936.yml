  - CVE-2025-1936
summary: |
  *Many of these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  jar: URLs retrieve local file content packaged in a ZIP archive. The null and everything after it was ignored when retrieving the content from the archive, but the fake extension after the null was used to determine the type of content. This could have been used to hide code in a web extension disguised as something else like an image.
