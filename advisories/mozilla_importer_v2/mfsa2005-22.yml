summary: |
  Andreas Sandblad of Secunia Research demonstrated a method to spoof the
  download dialog for saving files by supplying a Content-Disposition header
  with a different extension than the extension visible in the link and
  download dialog. Users could be tricked into downloading a safe-looking file
  such as a JPEG image and have it actually be saved with
  an executable extension.
  Windows hides file extensions by default. If the user did not notice the
  incorrect icon they might at some later time double-click on the saved
  file and execute it instead of having it open in the expected media
  application.
