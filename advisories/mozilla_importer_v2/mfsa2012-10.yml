summary: "Mozilla developers Andrew McCreight and Olli Pettay found that ReadPrototypeBindings\
  \ will leave a XBL binding in a hash table even when the function fails. If this occurs, when\
  \ the cycle collector reads this hash table and attempts to do a virtual method on this binding\
  \ a crash will occur. This crash may be potentially exploitable. \n\nFirefox 9 and earlier\
  \ are not affected by this vulnerability."
