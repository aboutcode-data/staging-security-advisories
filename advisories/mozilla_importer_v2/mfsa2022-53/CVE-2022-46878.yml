  - CVE-2022-46878
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.**Note*: CVE-2022-46874 was originally included in these advisories for Thunderbird 102.6, but a patch (specific to Thunderbird) was omitted, resulting in it actually being fixed in Thunderbird 102.6.1

  Mozilla developers Randell Jesup, Valentin Gosu, Olli Pettay, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 102.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
