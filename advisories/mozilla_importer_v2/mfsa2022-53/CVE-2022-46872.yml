  - CVE-2022-46872
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.**Note*: CVE-2022-46874 was originally included in these advisories for Thunderbird 102.6, but a patch (specific to Thunderbird) was omitted, resulting in it actually being fixed in Thunderbird 102.6.1

  An attacker who compromised a content process could have partially escaped the sandbox to read arbitrary files via clipboard-related IPC messages.*This bug only affects Thunderbird for Linux. Other operating systems are unaffected.*
