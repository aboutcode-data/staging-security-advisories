summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.**Note*: CVE-2022-46874 was originally included in these advisories for Thunderbird 102.6, but a patch (specific to Thunderbird) was omitted, resulting in it actually being fixed in Thunderbird 102.6.1

  The executable file warning was not presented when downloading .atloc and .ftploc files, which can run commands on a user's computer. *Note: This issue only affected Mac OS operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*
