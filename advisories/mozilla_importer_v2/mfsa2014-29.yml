summary: |
  Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski, via TippingPoint's
  Pwn2Own contest, reported that it is possible for untrusted web content to load
  a chrome-privileged page by getting JavaScript-implemented WebIDL to call
  window.open(). A second bug allowed the bypassing of the
  popup-blocker without user interaction. Combined these two bugs allow an
  attacker to load a JavaScript URL that is executed with the full privileges of
  the browser, which allows arbitrary code execution.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but is
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
