summary: |
  Mozilla developer Mark Hammond reported a flaw in how
  WebChannel.jsm handles message traffic. He found that
  when a trusted page is hosted within an <iframe> on an
  untrusted third-party untrusted framing page, the untrusted page could intercept webchannel responses meant for the trusted page, bypassing origin restrictions.
