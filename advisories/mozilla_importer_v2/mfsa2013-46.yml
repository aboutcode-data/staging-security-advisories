summary: |
  Security researcher Nils reported a use-after-free when
  resizing video while playing. This could allow for arbitrary code execution.

  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but are
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
