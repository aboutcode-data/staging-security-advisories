summary: 'If hyperthreading is not disabled, a timing attack vulnerability exists, similar to
  previous Spectre attacks. Apple has shipped macOS 10.14.5 with an option to disable hyperthreading
  in applications running untrusted code in a thread through a new sysctl. Firefox now makes
  use of it on the main thread and any worker threads. *Note: users need to update to macOS
  10.14.5 in order to take advantage of this change.*'
