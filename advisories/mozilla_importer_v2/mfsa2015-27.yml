summary: |
  Mozilla developer Jan de Mooij reported an issue that
  affects web content that relies on the Caja Compiler for
  protection, or other similar sandboxing libraries. He found that some JavaScript
  objects marked as non-extensible within Caja and Secure EcmaScript could be made
  extensible again, bypassing the Caja sandboxing security measures, when the
  JavaScript code should not be allowed to run.

  Firefox users are not directly impacted by this issue. This
  issue affects code running in Caja within loaded web content that should run
  within its protections.
