summary: |
  Security researcher Georgi Guninski
  reported that scriptable plugin content, such as Flash objects, could
  be loaded and executed in SeaMonkey mail messages by embedding the
  content in an iframe inside the message.  If a user were to reply to
  or forward such a message, malicious JavaScript embedded in the plugin
  content could potentially steal the contents of the message or files
  from the local filesystem.
  Thunderbird was not affected by this issue.
