summary: "Security researcher miaubiz used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a buffer overflow\
  \ in Canvas when specific bad height and width values were given through HTML. This could\
  \ lead to a potentially exploitable crash. \n\nMiaubiz also found a potentially exploitable\
  \ crash when 2D and 3D content was mixed which was introduced during Firefox development and\
  \ fixed before general release.\n\nIn general these flaws cannot be exploited through email\
  \ in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially\
  \ a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products."
