summary: |
  Security researcher Martin Barbella reported that
  under certain conditions, viewing a XUL document while JavaScript was
  disabled caused deleted memory to be accessed.  This flaw could
  potentially be used by an attacker to crash a victim's browser and run
  arbitrary code on their computer.
  XUL document support was disabled by default in
  Firefox 4 and SeaMonkey 2.1 and users of those versions are not generally
  at risk. It is possible for add-ons to re-enable the feature for specific
  sites (for example, to support a legacy intranet XUL application) which would
  have introduced this vulnerability while browsing those sites.
