  - CVE-2019-11748
summary: WebRTC in Firefox will honor persisted permissions given to sites for access to microphone
  and camera resources even when in a third-party context. In light of recent high profile vulnerabilities
  in other software, a decision was made to no longer persist these permissions. This avoids
  the possibility of trusted WebRTC resources being invisibly embedded in web content and abusing
  permissions previously given by users. Users will now be prompted for permissions on each
  use.
