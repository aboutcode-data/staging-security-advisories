aliases:
  - CVE-2019-11744
summary: Some HTML elements, such as <title> and <textarea>, can contain literal angle brackets
  without treating them as markup. It is possible to pass a literal closing tag to .innerHTML
  on these elements, and subsequent content after that will be parsed as if it were outside
  the tag. This can lead to XSS if a site does not filter user input as strictly for these elements
  as it does for other elements.
