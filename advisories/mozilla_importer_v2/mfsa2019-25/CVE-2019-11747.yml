summary: 'The "Forget about this site" feature in the History pane is intended to remove all
  saved user data that indicates a user has visited a site. This includes removing any HTTP
  Strict Transport Security (HSTS) settings received from sites that use it. Due to a bug, sites
  on the pre-load list also have their HSTS setting removed. On the next visit to that site
  if the user specifies an http: URL rather than secure https: they will not be protected by
  the pre-loaded HSTS setting. After that visit the site''s HSTS setting will be restored.'
