summary: Google reported to Mozilla that TURKTRUST, a certificate authority in Mozilla’s root
  program, had mis-issued two intermediate certificates to customers. The issue was not specific
  to Firefox but there was evidence that one of the certificates was used for man-in-the-middle
  (MITM) traffic management of domain names that the customer did not legitimately own or control.
  This issue was resolved by revoking the trust for these specific mis-issued certificates.
