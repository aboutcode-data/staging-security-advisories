summary: |
  This advisory was updated December 13, 2022 to add CVE-2022-46881 and CVE-2022-46885. Both fixes were included in the original release of Firefox 106, but did not appear in the advisory published at that time.

  Mozilla developers Timothy Nikkel, Ashley Hale, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 105. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
