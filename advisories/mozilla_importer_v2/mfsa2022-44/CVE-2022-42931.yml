summary: |
  This advisory was updated December 13, 2022 to add CVE-2022-46881 and CVE-2022-46885. Both fixes were included in the original release of Firefox 106, but did not appear in the advisory published at that time.

  Logins saved by Firefox should be managed by the Password Manager component which uses encryption to save files on-disk. Instead, the username (not password) was saved by the Form Manager to an unencrypted file on disk.
