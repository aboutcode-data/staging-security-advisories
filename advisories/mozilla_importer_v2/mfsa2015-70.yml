summary: |
  Security researcher Matthew Green reported a Diffie–Hellman
  (DHE) key processing issue in Network Security Services (NSS) where a
  man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker can force a server to downgrade TLS
  connections to 512-bit export-grade cryptography by modifying client
  requests to include only export-grade cipher suites. The resulting
  weak key can then be leveraged to impersonate the server. This attack
  is detailed in the "Imperfect Forward
  Secrecy: How Diffie-Hellman Fails in Practice" paper and is known as the
  "Logjam Attack."
  This issue was fixed in NSS version 3.19.1 by limiting the lower strength of
  supported DHE keys to use 1023 bit primes.
