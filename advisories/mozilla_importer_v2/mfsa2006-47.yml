aliases: []
summary: |
  A malicious page can hijack native DOM methods on a document object in another
  domain, which will run the attacker's script when called by the victim page.
  This could be used to steal login cookies, password, or other sensitive data
  on the target page, or to perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user.
  Access checks on all other properties and document nodes are performed
  correctly. This cross-site scripting (XSS) attack is limited to pages which
  use standard DOM methods of the top-level document object, such as
  document.getElementById(). This includes many popular sites, especially
  the newer ones that offer rich interaction to the user.
  This vulnerability was introduced during Firefox 1.5 development, it does
  not affect Firefox 1.0 or Mozilla Suite 1.7
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
  and would be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
  the default setting and we strongly discourage users from enabling
  JavaScript in mail.
