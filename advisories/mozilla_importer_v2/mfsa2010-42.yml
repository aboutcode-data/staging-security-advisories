summary: |
  Security researcher Yosuke Hasegawa reported that
  the Web Worker method importScripts can read and parse
  resources from other domains even when the content is not valid
  JavaScript.  This is a violation of the same-origin policy and could
  be used by an attacker to steal information from other sites.
