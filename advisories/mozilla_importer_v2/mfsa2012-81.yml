summary: "Mozilla community member Alice White reported that when the\nGetProperty function\
  \ is invoked through JSAPI, security checking\ncan be bypassed when getting cross-origin properties.\
  \ This potentially allowed\nfor arbitrary code execution. \n\nIn general these flaws cannot\
  \ be exploited through email in the\nThunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting\
  \ is disabled, but are\npotentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products."
