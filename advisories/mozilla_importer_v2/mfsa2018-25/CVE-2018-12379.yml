aliases:
  - CVE-2018-12379
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  When the Mozilla Updater opens a MAR format file which contains a very long item filename, an out-of-bounds write can be triggered, leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This requires running the Mozilla Updater manually on the local system with the malicious MAR file in order to occur.
