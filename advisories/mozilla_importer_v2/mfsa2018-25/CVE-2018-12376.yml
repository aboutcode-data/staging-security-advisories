  - CVE-2018-12376
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Mozilla developers and community members Alex Gaynor, Boris Zbarsky, Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Jed Davis, Tyson Smith, Bogdan Tara, Karl Tomlinson, Mats Palmgren, Nika Layzell, Ted Campbell, and Andrei Cristian Petcu reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 61 and Firefox ESR 60.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
