  - CVE-2017-16541
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Browser proxy settings can be bypassed by using the automount feature with autofs to create a mount point on the local file system. Content can be loaded from this mounted file system directly using a file: URI, bypassing configured proxy settings. *Note: this issue only affects OS X in default configurations. On Linux systems, autofs must be installed for the vulnerability to occur and Windows is not affected.*
