summary: "Tom Ferris reported a Firefox crash when processing a domain name\nconsisting solely\
  \ of soft-hyphen characters. This is due to a heap\noverrun triggered when Internationalized\
  \ Domain Name (IDN) processing\nresults in an empty string after removing non-mapping characters\n\
  such as soft-hyphens. This overrun could be exploited to run or install\nmalware on a user's\
  \ computer.\nMozilla Thunderbird does not process \nIDN host names and \nis thus not affected\
  \ by this vulnerability."
