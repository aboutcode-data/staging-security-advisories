aliases:
  - CVE-2024-9393
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  An attacker could, via a specially crafted multipart response, execute arbitrary JavaScript under the `resource://pdf.js` origin.  This could allow them to access cross-origin PDF content. This access is limited to "same site" documents by the Site Isolation feature on desktop clients, but full cross-origin access is possible on Android versions.
