summary: |
  Kohei Yoshino reports the secure site lock icon can be spoofed by using
  a view-source: URL targeted at the secure site whose credentials you want
  to appropriate. An insecure page of the attackers choice can then be loaded
  while the lock icon shows the previous secure state.
  This could potentially be abused by phishers to make their fake login sites
  appear more authentic.
