summary: "Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported a regression where security wrappers\
  \ are unwrapped without doing a security check in defaultValue(). This can allow for improper\
  \ access to the Location object. In versions 15 and earlier of affected products, there was\
  \ also the potential for arbitrary code execution. \n\nSecurity researcher Gareth Heyes also\
  \ blogged about a Firefox 16 only symptom that is fixed in the updated versions."
