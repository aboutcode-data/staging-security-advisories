summary: |
  Security researcher musicDespiteEverything previously reported
  an issue where illegal control characters were stored in as cookie values in violation of
  RFC6265. While fixing this
  issue, Mozilla developer Nicholas Hurley realized that the same issue
  applied to the names of cookies. These characters have now been disallowed in cookie
  names. This issue could result in incorrect cookie handling by web servers.
