summary: |
  Security researcher Luke Bryan reported that file:
  URIs are given chrome privileges when opened in the same tab as a
  chrome page or privileged about: page.  This vulnerability could be
  used by an attacker to run arbitrary JavaScript with chrome
  privileges.  The severity of this issue was determined to be moderate
  as it requires an attacker to have malicious code saved locally, then
  have a user open a chrome: document or privileged about: URI, and then
  open the malicious file in the same privileged tab.
  Firefox 2 is not affected by this issue.
