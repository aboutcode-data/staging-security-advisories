  - CVE-2022-38472
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  An attacker could have abused XSLT error handling to associate attacker-controlled content with another origin which was displayed in the address bar. This could have been used to fool the user into submitting data intended for the spoofed origin.
