summary: Security researcher Seb Patane reported an issue with the Mozilla Maintenance Service
  on Windows. He discovered that when the Mozilla Updater executable was inaccessible, the Maintenance
  Service will behave incorrectly and can be made to use an updater at an arbitrary location.
  This updater will run with the system privileges used by the Maintenance Service, allowing
  for local privilege escalation. Local file system access is necessary in order for this issue
  to be exploitable and it cannot be triggered through web content.
