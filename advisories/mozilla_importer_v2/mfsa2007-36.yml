summary: |
  On Windows XP with Internet Explorer 7 installed several "web related"
  URI schemes do not launch the registered protocol-handler if the URI contains
  an invalid %-encoded sequence. This was initially reported by
  Billy Rios and Nate McFeters
  with additional investigation by Secunia. A patch
  that mitigated the known exploits was shipped with Firefox 2.0.0.6
  as described at MFSA 2007-27.
  That mitigation did not prevent the incorrect file-handling programs
  from launching which left some risk. An additional fix has been
  applied to Firefox 2.0.0.8 that detects when Windows would mishandle
  these URIs so that the wrong program does not get launched.
