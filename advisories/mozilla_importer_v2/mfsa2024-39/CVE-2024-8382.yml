  - CVE-2024-8382
summary: Internal browser event interfaces were exposed to web content when privileged EventHandler
  listener callbacks ran for those events. Web content that tried to use those interfaces would
  not be able to use them with elevated privileges, but their presence would indicate certain
  browser features had been used, such as when a user opened the Dev Tools console.
