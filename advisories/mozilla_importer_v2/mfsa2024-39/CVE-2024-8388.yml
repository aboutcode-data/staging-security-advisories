aliases:
  - CVE-2024-8388
summary: Multiple prompts and panels from both Firefox and the Android OS could be used to obscure
  the notification announcing the transition to fullscreen mode after the fix for CVE-2023-6870
  in Firefox 121. This could lead to spoofing the browser UI if the sudden appearance of the
  prompt distracted the user from noticing the visual transition happening behind the prompt.
  These notifications now use the Android Toast feature. *This bug only affects Firefox on Android.
  Other operating systems are unaffected.*
