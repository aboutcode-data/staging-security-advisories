aliases:
  - CVE-2018-18513
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  A crash can occur when processing a crafted S/MIME message or an XPI package containing a crafted signature. This can be used as a denial-of-service (DOS) attack because Thunderbird reopens the last seen message on restart, triggering the crash again.
