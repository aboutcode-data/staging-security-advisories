summary: |
  Security researcher Zach Hoffman reported that a
  recursive call to eval() wrapped in
  a try/catch statement places the browser into a
  inconsistent state.  Any dialog box opened in this state is displayed
  without text and with non-functioning buttons.  Closing the window
  causes the dialog to evaluate to true.  An attacker could use this
  issue to force a user into accepting any dialog, such as one granting
  elevated privileges to the page presenting the dialog.
