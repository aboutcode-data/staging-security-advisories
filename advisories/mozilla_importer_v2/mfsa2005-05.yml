summary: |
  Jakob Balle of Secunia reported two vulnerabilities in windows with multiple
  tabs. Malicious content in a background tab can attempt to steal information
  intended for the topmost tab by popping up prompt dialog that appears to come
  from the trusted site, or by silently redirecting input focus to a background
  tab hoping to catch the user inputting something sensitive.
  Jesse Ruderman and Martin Wargers discovered variants
