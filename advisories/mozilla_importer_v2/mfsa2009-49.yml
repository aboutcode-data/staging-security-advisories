summary: |
  An anonymous security researcher, via TippingPoint's Zero Day
  Initiative, reported that the columns of a XUL tree element could be
  manipulated in a particular way which would leave a pointer owned by
  the column pointing to freed memory.  An attacker could potentially
  use this vulnerability to crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary
  code on the victim's computer.
