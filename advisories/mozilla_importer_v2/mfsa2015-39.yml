summary: |
  Security researcher Nils used the Address Sanitizer tool to
  discover two type confusion flaws. The first of these occurs while setting
  specific attributes of a source element resulting in incorrect
  object casting. The second flaw occurs when binding a source to a
  tree when the function fails to validate the namespace. These flaws lead to
  use-after-free errors, resulting in potentially exploitable crashes.
