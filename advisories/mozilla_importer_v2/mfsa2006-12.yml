summary: |
  Tristor reports that it was possible to spoof the browser's secure-site
  indicators (the lock icon, the site name in the URL field, the gold URL
  field background in Firefox) by first loading the target secure site
  in a pop-up window, then changing its location to a different site.
  If the user has turned on the "Entering secure site" modal warning dialog
  then the window location can be changed while that dialog is displayed
  and the secure-browsing indicators from the original site will remain.
  These dialogs are turned off by default in Firefox, and most Suite users
  click the checkbox to turn them off.
