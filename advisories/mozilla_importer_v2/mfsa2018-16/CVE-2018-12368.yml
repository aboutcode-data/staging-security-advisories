  Web." Without the warning, unsuspecting users unfamiliar with this new file type might run
  an unwanted executable. This also allows a WebExtension with the limited downloads.open permission
  to execute arbitrary code without user interaction on Windows 10 systems *Note: this issue
  only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*'
