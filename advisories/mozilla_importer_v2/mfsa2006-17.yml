summary: |
  shutdown demonstrated how to use the window.controllers array
  to bypass same-origin protections, allowing a malicious site to
  inject script into content from another site. This could allow
  the malicious page to steal information such as cookies or
  passwords from the other site, or perform transactions on the user's
  behalf if the user were already logged in.
  Thunderbird shares the JavaScript engine with Firefox
  and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
  the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
  JavaScript in mail.
