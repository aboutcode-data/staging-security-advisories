summary: |
  Using the Address Sanitizer tool, security researcher Atte
  Kettunen discovered a buffer overflow in the nestegg library when decoding a WebM
  format video with maliciously formatted headers. This leads to a potentially exploitable
  crash.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
