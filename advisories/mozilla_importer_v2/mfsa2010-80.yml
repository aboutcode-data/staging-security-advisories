summary: |
  Security researcher regenrecht reported via
  TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that a nsDOMAttribute
  node can be modified without informing the iterator object responsible
  for various DOM traversals.  This flaw could lead to a inconsistent
  state where the iterator points to an object it believes is part of
  the DOM but actually points to some other object.  If such an object
  had been deleted and its memory reclaimed by the system, then the
  iterator could be used to call into attacker-controlled memory.
