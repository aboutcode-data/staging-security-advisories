summary: |
  Security researcher Mario Gomes andresearch firm
  Code Audit Labs reported a mechanism to short-circuit page
  loads through drag and drop to the addressbar by canceling the page load. This
  causes the address of the previously site entered to be displayed in the
  addressbar instead of the currently loaded page. This could lead to potential
  phishing attacks on users.
