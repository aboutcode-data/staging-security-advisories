  Security researcher Hidetake Jo of Microsoft
  Vulnerability Research reported that the properties set on an object
  passed to showModalDialog were readable by the document
  contained in the dialog, even when the document was from a different
  domain.  This is a violation of the same-origin policy and could
  result in a website running untrusted JavaScript if it assumed
  the dialogArguments could not be initialized by another
  site.
  An anonymous security researcher, via TippingPoint's Zero Day
  Initiative, also independently reported this issue to Mozilla.
