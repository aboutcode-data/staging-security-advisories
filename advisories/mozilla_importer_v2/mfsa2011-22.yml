summary: |
  Security researchers Chris Rohlf and Yan
  Ivnitskiy of Matasano Security reported that when a
  JavaScript Array object had its length set to an
  extremely large value, the iteration of array elements that occurs
  when its reduceRight method was subsequently called could
  result in the execution of attacker controlled memory due to an
  invalid index value being used to access element properties.
