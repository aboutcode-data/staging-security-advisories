summary: Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Jon Coppeard, Marcia Knous,
  David Baron, Mats Palmgren, Ronald Crane, Bob Clary, and Chris Peterson reported memory safety
  bugs present in Firefox 52, Firefox ESR 45.8, and Firefox ESR 52. Some of these bugs showed
  evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could
  be exploited to run arbitrary code.
