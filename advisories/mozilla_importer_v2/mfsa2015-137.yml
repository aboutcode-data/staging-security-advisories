summary: |
  Security researcher musicDespiteEverything reported an issue when ASCII code 11 for vertical tab is stored in a cookie in violation of RFC6265. This may result in
  incorrect cookie handling by servers, resulting in the potential ability to set cookie
  values and read cookie data from users in concert with some web servers if the vertical
  tab character is mishandled during parsing.
