summary: |
  Two vulnerabilities found in Mozilla Firefox 1.0.3 when combined allow
  an attacker to run arbitrary code. The Mozilla Suite version 1.7.7
  is only partially vulnerable.
  A vulnerability in the Firefox install confirmation dialog
  allows an attacker to supply a javascript: URL as
  the IconURL property, which will execute code.
  By using an eval() call in that URL arbitrary code can be
  executed with elevated privilege.
  By default only the Mozilla Update site is allowed
  to attempt software installation but users can allow other sites.
  A second flaw in Firefox 1.0.3 and the Mozilla Suite 1.7.7 allows
  an attacker to inject script into any site by loading it in a frame
  and navigating back to a previous javascript: URL
  containing an eval() call. This can be used to steal cookies or
  other confidential data from the target site. If the target site
  is allowed to raise the install confirmation dialog in Firefox
  then this attack can be combined with the first to execute
  arbitrary code.
  The default Mozilla Update site has been modified to prevent
  its use in this attack.
