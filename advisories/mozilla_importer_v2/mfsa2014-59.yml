summary: "Mozilla community member James Kitchener reported a crash in\nDirectWrite when rendering\
  \ MathML content with specific fonts due to an error in\nhow font resources and tables are\
  \ handled. This leads to use-after-free of a\nDirectWrite font-face object, resulting in a\
  \ potentially exploitable crash.\n\nThis issue is limited to the Windows platform and does\
  \ not\naffect OS X or Linux systems. In general this flaw cannot be exploited through \nemail\
  \ in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially \na risk in\
  \ browser or browser-like contexts."
