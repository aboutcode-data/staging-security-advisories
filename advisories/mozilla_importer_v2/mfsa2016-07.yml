summary: |
  Security researcher Hanno Böck reported that calculations with
  mp_div and mp_exptmod in Network Security Services (NSS) can
  produce wrong results in some circumstances. These functions are used within NSS for a
  variety of cryptographic division functions, leading to potential cryptographic
  weaknesses.
