summary: |
  Security researcher Ronald Crane reported eight
  vulnerabilities affecting released code that were found through code inspection. These
  included several potential memory safety issues resulting from the use of
  snprintf, one use of unowned memory, one use of a string without overflow
  checks, and five memory safety bugs. These do not all have clear mechanisms to be
  exploited through web content but are vulnerable if a mechanism can be found to trigger
  them.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
