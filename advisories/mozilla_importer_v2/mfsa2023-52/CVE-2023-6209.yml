  - CVE-2023-6209
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Relative URLs starting with three slashes were incorrectly parsed, and a
  path-traversal "/../" part in the path could be used to override the
  specified host. This could contribute to security problems in web sites.
