summary: |
  Microsoft security researchers Shuo
  Chen, Ziqing Mao, Yi-Min
  Wang, and Ming Zhang reported that when a
  CONNECT request is sent to a proxy server and a non-200 response is
  returned, then the body of the response is incorrectly rendered
  within the context of the request Host: header.  An
  active network attacker could use this vulnerability to intercept a
  CONNECT request and reply with a non-200 response containing malicious
  code which would be executed within the context of the victim's
  requested SSL-protected domain.  Since this attack requires the victim
  to have a proxy configured, the severity of this issue was determined
  to be high.
  Thunderbird mail messages are not vulnerable to this flaw,
  but if Thunderbird were being used in a browser-like manner (through Add-ons,
  perhaps) and JavaScript were enabled (not the default setting) then users could
  be vulnerable to this flaw in older versions.
