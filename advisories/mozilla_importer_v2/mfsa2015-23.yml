summary: |
  Using the Address Sanitizer tool, security researcher Atte
  Kettunen found a problem with OpenType Sanitiser (OTS) that resulted in
  a use-after-free while expanding macros in some circumstances. This
  use-after-free was only used for information displayed in the developer console
  and was not exploitable.
