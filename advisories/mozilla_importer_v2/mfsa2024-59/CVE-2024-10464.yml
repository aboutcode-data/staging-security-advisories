  - CVE-2024-10464
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Repeated writes to history interface attributes could have been used to cause a Denial of Service condition in the browser. This was addressed by introducing rate-limiting to this API.
