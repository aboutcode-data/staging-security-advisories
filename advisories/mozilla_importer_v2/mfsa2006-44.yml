summary: |
  Thilo Girmann discovered that in certain circumstances a JavaScript
  reference to a frame or window was not properly cleared when the
  referenced content went away, and he demonstrated that this pointer
  to a deleted object could be used to execute native code supplied
  by the attacker.
  This vulnerability was introduced during Firefox 1.5 development, it does
  not affect Firefox 1.0 or Mozilla Suite 1.7
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
  and would be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
  the default setting and we strongly discourage users from enabling
  JavaScript in mail.
