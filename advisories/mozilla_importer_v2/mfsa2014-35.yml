summary: "Security researcher Ash reported an issue affected the\nMozilla Maintenance Service\
  \ on Windows systems. The Mozilla Maintenance Service\ninstaller writes to a temporary directory\
  \ created during the update process\nwhich is writable by users. If malicious DLL files are\
  \ placed within this\ndirectory during the update process, these DLL files can run in a privileged\n\
  context through the Mozilla Maintenance Service's privileges, allowing for local\nprivilege\
  \ escalation. \n\nThis issue does not affect Linux or OS X users and is confined\nto Windows."
