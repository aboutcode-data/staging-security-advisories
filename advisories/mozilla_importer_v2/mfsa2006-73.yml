summary: |
  Appending an SVG comment DOM node from one document into
  another type of document such as HTML in some cases results in a crash due to
  memory corruption that can be exploited to run arbitrary code.
  This flaw was introduced in the Firefox 1.5.0.4 release, prior versions are unaffected.
  Mozilla would like to thank an anonymous researcher working with
  TippingPoint and the
  Zero Day Initiative
  for reporting this issue.
