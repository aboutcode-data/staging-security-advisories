aliases:
  - CVE-2018-5174
summary: 'In the Windows 10 April 2018 Update, Windows Defender SmartScreen honors the SEE_MASK_FLAG_NO_UI
  flag associated with downloaded files and will not show any UI. Files that are unknown and
  potentially dangerous will be allowed to run because SmartScreen will not prompt the user
  for a decision, and if the user is offline all files will be allowed to be opened because
  Windows won’t prompt the user to ask what to do. Firefox incorrectly sets this flag when downloading
  files, leading to less secure behavior from SmartScreen. *Note: this issue only affects Windows
  10 users running the April 2018 update or later. It does not affect other Windows users or
  other operating systems.*'
