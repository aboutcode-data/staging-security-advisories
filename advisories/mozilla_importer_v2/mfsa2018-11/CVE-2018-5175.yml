  - CVE-2018-5175
summary: A mechanism to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) protections on sites that have
  a script-src policy of 'strict-dynamic'. If a target website contains an HTML injection flaw
  an attacker could inject a reference to a copy of the require.js library that is part of Firefox’s
  Developer Tools, and then use a known technique using that library to bypass the CSP restrictions
  on executing injected scripts.
