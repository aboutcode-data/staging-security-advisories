summary: The Live Bookmarks page and the PDF viewer can run injected script content if a user
  pastes script from the clipboard into them while viewing RSS feeds or PDF files. This could
  allow a malicious site to socially engineer a user to copy and paste malicious script content
  that could then run with the context of either page but does not allow for privilege escalation.
