summary: |
  Mozilla contributor moz_bug_r_a4 submitted a set of
  vulnerabilities which allow scripts from one document to be executed in
  the context of a different document.  These vulnerabilities could be
  used by an attacker to violate the same-origin policy and perform an XSS
  attack against arbitrary sites, potentially stealing or manipulating
  the user's private information on the victim site.
