summary: |
  Google security researcher Chris Evans reported that a
  website could access a limited amount of data from a different domain by
  loading a same-domain JavaScript URL which redirects to an off-domain
  target  resource containing data
  which is not parsable as JavaScript.  Upon attempting to load the data as
  JavaScript a syntax error is generated that can reveal some of the file
  context via the window.onerror DOM API.
  This issue could be used by a malicious website to steal private data
  from users who are authenticated on the redirected website. How much
  data could be at risk would depend on the format of the data and how
  the JavaScript parser attempts to interpret it. For most files the
  amount of data that can be recovered would be limited to the first
  word or two. Some data files might allow deeper probing with
  repeated loads.
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and
  could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is
  not the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
  JavaScript in mail.
  Update December 18, 2008: The Windows version of Firefox
  2.0.0.19 was shipped without the fix for this issue (other platforms
  were correctly patched). Firefox 2.0.0.20 has been released on Windows
  to correct this oversight.
