summary: |
  Security researcher Holger Fuhrmannek reported that a malicious
  Graphite "smart font" could circumvent the validation of internal instruction parameters
  in the Graphite 2 library using special CNTXT_ITEM instructions. This could result in
  arbitrary code execution.

   This issue affected Graphite 2 version 1.3.4, which was used in the Firefox ESR branch. To address this issue and other security vulnerabilities recently disclosed by Cisco Talos affecting this version of the library, Firefox ESR has been updated to version 1.3.5, the same one used in Firefox 44.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product, but is potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
