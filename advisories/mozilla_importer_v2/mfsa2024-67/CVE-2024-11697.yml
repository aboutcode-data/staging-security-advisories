  - CVE-2024-11697
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  When handling keypress events, an attacker may have been able to trick a user into bypassing the "Open Executable File?" confirmation dialog. This could have led to malicious code execution.
