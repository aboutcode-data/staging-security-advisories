  - CVE-2024-11704
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  A double-free issue could have occurred in `sec_pkcs7_decoder_start_decrypt()` when handling an error path. Under specific conditions, the same symmetric key could have been freed twice, potentially leading to memory corruption.
