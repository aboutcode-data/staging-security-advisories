summary: |
  Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory safety bugs in the
  browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
  bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances, and we
  presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
  arbitrary code.
  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
