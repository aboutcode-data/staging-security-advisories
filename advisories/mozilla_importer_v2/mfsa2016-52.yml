summary: |
  Security researcher Jordi Chancel reported a method to spoof the
  contents of the addressbar. This uses a persistent menu within a
  <select> element, which acts as a container for HTML content and can be
  placed in an arbitrary location.  When placed over the addressbar, this can mask the true
  site URL, allowing for spoofing by a malicious site.
