summary: "Security researcher Abhishek Arya (Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team discovered\
  \ a series critically rated of use-after-free and buffer overflow issues using the Address\
  \ Sanitizer tool in shipped software. These issues are potentially exploitable, allowing for\
  \ remote code execution. We would also like to thank Abhishek for reporting five additional\
  \ use-after-free, out of bounds read, and buffer overflow flaws introduced during Firefox\
  \ development that were fixed before general release. \n\nIn general these flaws cannot be\
  \ exploited through email in the\nThunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is\
  \ disabled, but are\npotentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products."
