summary: |
  Security researcher Abdulrahman Alqabandi reported an issue where an
  attacker can load an arbitrary web page but the addressbar's displayed URL will be blank
  or filled with page defined content. This can be used to obfuscate which page is currently
  loaded and allows for an attacker to spoof an existing page without the malicious page's
  address being displayed correctly.
