summary: |
  Moxie Marlinspike reported a heap overflow vulnerability
  in the code that handles regular expressions in certificate names. This
  vulnerability could be used to compromise the browser and run arbitrary code
  by presenting a specially crafted certificate to the client. This code
  provided compatibility with the non-standard regular expression syntax
  historically supported by Netscape clients and servers. With version 3.5
  Firefox switched to the more limited industry-standard wildcard syntax
  instead and is not vulnerable to this flaw.
