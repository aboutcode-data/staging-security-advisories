summary: "Security researcher Ronald Crane reported an out-of-bounds read\nfollowing a failed\
  \ allocation in the HTML parser while working with unicode strings. This\ncan also affect\
  \ the parsing of XML and SVG format data. This leads to a potentially\nexploitable crash.\
  \ \n\nIn general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the\nThunderbird product because\
  \ scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in\nbrowser or browser-like contexts."
