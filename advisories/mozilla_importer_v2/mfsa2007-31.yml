summary: |
  Security researcher Stefano Di Paola reported
  that Firefox did not properly validate the user ID when making
  an HTTP request using Digest Authentication to log into a web site.
  A malicious page could abuse this to inject arbitrary HTTP headers
  by including a newline character in the user ID followed by
  the injected header data. If the user were connecting through a proxy
  the attacker could inject headers that a proxy would interpret as
  two separate requests for different hosts.
