summary: "Security researcher Arthur Gerkis, via TippingPoint's Zero\nDay Initiative, reported\
  \ a use-after-free during image processing from sites\nwith specific content types in concert\
  \ with the imgRequestProxy\nfunction. This causes a potentially exploitable crash. \n\nIn\
  \ general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the\nThunderbird and Seamonkey products\
  \ because scripting is disabled in mail, but is\npotentially a risk in browser or browser-like\
  \ contexts."
