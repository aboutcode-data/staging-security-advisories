summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported a
  arbitrary code execution attack using a javascript: URL. The Gecko
  engine features a JavaScript sandbox utility that allows the browser or add-ons
  to safely execute script in the context of a web page. In certain cases,
  javascript: URLs are executed in such a sandbox with insufficient
  context that can allow those scripts to escape from the sandbox and run with
  elevated privilege. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.
