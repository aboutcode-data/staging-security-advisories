summary: |
  Security researcher 3ric Johanson reported in discussions
  with Richard Newman and Holt Sorenson that
  Verisign's prevention measures for homograph attacks using Internationalized
  Domain Names (IDN) were insufficiently rigorous, and this led to a limited
  possibility for domain spoofing in Firefox.
  IDN allows non-English speakers to use domains in their local language. Many
  supported characters are similar or identical to others in English, allowing for
  the potential spoofing of domain names and for phishing attacks when not
  blocked. In consultation with Verisign, Mozilla had added .com, .net, and .name
  top-level domains to its IDN whitelist, allowing for IDN use in those top-level
  domains without restrictions. However, it became clear that a number of
  historical dangerous registrations continued to be valid.
  This issue has been fixed by removing the .com, .net, and .name top-level
  domains from the IDN whitelist, and supplementing the whitelist implementation
  with technical restrictions against script-mixing in domain labels. These
  restrictions apply to all non-whitelisted top-level domains. More information on
  the exact algorithm used can be found here.
