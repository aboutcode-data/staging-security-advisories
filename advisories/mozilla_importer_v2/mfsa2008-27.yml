summary: |
  Opera Software reported a vulnerability which allows malicious content to force the browser into uploading local files to the remote server. This could be used by an attacker to steal files from known locations on a victim's computer.
  Firefox 3 is not vulnerable to this attack due to the changed
  design of the file upload form element.
