summary: |
  Jonathan Watt and Michal Zalewski independently reported timing dependent
  testcases that trigger crashes at the same place during text display.
  We have seen no demonstration that these crashes could be reliably
  exploited, but they do show evidence of memory corruption so we presume
  they could be.
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
  and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
  the default setting and we strongly discourage users from enabling
  JavaScript in mail.
