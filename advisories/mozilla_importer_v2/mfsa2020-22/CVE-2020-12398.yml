  - CVE-2020-12398
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  If Thunderbird is configured to use STARTTLS for an IMAP
  server, and the server sends a PREAUTH response, then
  Thunderbird will continue with an unencrypted connection,
  causing email data to be sent without protection.
