summary: |
  The FTP protocol includes the PASV (passive) command which is
  used by Firefox to request an alternate data port. The specification
  of the FTP protocol allows the server response to include an alternate
  server address as well, although this is rarely used in practice.
  mark@bindshell.net reported that a malicious web page hosted on
  a specially-coded FTP server could use this feature to perform a
  rudimentary port-scan of machines inside the firewall of the victim.
  By itself this causes no harm, but information about an internal
  network may be useful to an attacker should there be other vulnerabilities
  present on the network.
  Mozilla clients will now ignore the alternate server address.
