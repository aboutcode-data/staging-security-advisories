summary: |
  Security researcher Ash reported an issue with the Mozilla
  Updater. The Mozilla Updater can be made to load a malicious local DLL file in a
  privileged context through either the Mozilla Maintenance Service or
  independently on systems that do not use the service. This occurs when the DLL
  file is placed in a specific location on the local system before the Mozilla
  Updater is run. Local file system access is necessary in order for this issue to
  be exploitable.
