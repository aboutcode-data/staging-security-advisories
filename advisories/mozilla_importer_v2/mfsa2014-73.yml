summary: |
  Antoine Delignat-Lavaud, security researcher at Inria Paris
  in team Prosecco, reported an issue in Network Security Services (NSS) libraries
  affecting all versions. He discovered that NSS is vulnerable to a variant of a
  signature forgery attack previously published by Daniel Bleichenbacher. This is
  due to lenient parsing of ASN.1 values involved in a signature and could lead to
  the forging of RSA certificates.
  The Advanced Threat Research team at Intel Security also independently
  discovered and reported this issue.
  These have been addressed in the NSS releases shipping on affected Mozilla
  products:
