summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  A suspected race condition when calling getaddrinfo led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. *Note: This issue only affected Linux operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*
