summary: "Mozilla developer Ehsan Akhgari reported two issues with Cross-origin\nresource sharing\
  \ (CORS) \"preflight\" requests.\nThe first issue is that in some circumstances the same cache\
  \ key can be generated for\ntwo preflight requests on a site. As a result, if a second request\
  \ is made that will match\nthe cached key generated by an earlier request, CORS checks will\
  \ be bypassed because the\nsystem will see the previously cached request as applicable.\n\
  In the second issue, when some Access-Control- headers are missing from\nCORS responses, the\
  \ values from different Access-Control- headers can be used\nthat present in the same response.\
  \ \nIn general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the\nThunderbird product because\
  \ scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in\nbrowser or browser-like contexts."
