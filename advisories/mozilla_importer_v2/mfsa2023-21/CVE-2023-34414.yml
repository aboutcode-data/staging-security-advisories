  - CVE-2023-34414
summary: "*In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product\
  \ because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or\
  \ browser-like contexts.*\n\nThe error page for sites with invalid TLS certificates was missing\
  \ the\nactivation-delay Thunderbird uses to protect prompts and permission dialogs\nfrom attacks\
  \ that exploit human response time delays. If a malicious\npage elicited user clicks in precise\
  \ locations immediately before\nnavigating to a site with a certificate error and made the\
  \ renderer\nextremely busy at the same time, it could create a gap between when\nthe error\
  \ page was loaded and when the display actually refreshed.\nWith the right timing the elicited\
  \ clicks could land in that gap and \nactivate the button that overrides the certificate error\
  \ for that site."
