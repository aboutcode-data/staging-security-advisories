summary: |
  Security researcher Abdulrahman Alqabandi reported that when a
  data: URI is parsed, the hash ('#') symbol is incorrectly handled, allowing
  for spoofing attacks. This issue could result in the wrong URI being displayed as a
  location, which can mislead users to believe they are on a different site than the one
  loaded.
