summary: |
  Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox 1.5
  branch, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a
  user's system.
  The vulnerability is caused due to an memory corruption error within
  the handling of simultaneously happening XPCOM events, which leads to
  use of a deleted timer object. This generally results in a crash but
  potentially could be exploited to execute arbitrary code on a user's
  system when a malicious website is visited.
  This vulnerability was introduced during Firefox 1.5 development, it does
  not affect Firefox 1.0 or Mozilla Suite 1.7
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
  and would be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
  the default setting and we strongly discourage users from enabling
  JavaScript in mail.
