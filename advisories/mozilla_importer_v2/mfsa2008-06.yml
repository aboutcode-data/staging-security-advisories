summary: |
  Mozilla contributor David Bloom reported a
  vulnerability in the way images are treated by the browser when a
  user leaves a page which utilizes designMode frames.
  The reported issue can be used to steal a user's navigation history,
  forward navigation information, and crash the user's browser.
  The crash showed evidence of memory corruption and might be exploitable
  to run arbitrary code.
