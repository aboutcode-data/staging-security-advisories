summary: |
  Security researcher regenrecht reported via
  TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the DOM attribute
  cloning routine where under certain circumstances an event attribute
  node can be deleted while another object still contains a reference to
  it.  This reference could subsequently be accessed, potentially
  causing the execution of attacker controlled memory.
