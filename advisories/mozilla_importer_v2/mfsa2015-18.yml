summary: |
  Security researcher Abhishek Arya (Inferno) of the Google
  Chrome Security Team and Mozilla security developer Gary Kwong
  used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a double-free error when sending a
  zero-length XmlHttpRequest (XHR). This was due to errors in memory allocation
  when using different memory allocator libraries than jemalloc used
  by Mozilla builds. When those other memory allocators are used for build
  compilation, this could cause a potentially exploitable crash during some XHR
  actions.

  This vulnerability does not happen in Firefox as built by
  Mozilla, but can occur when Firefox is built using a memory allocator that
  follows older pre-standard behaviors.
