summary: |
  Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski reported, through HP
  Zero Day Initiative's Pwn2Own contest, that documents loaded though a
  resource: URL, such as Mozilla's PDF.js PDF file
  viewer, were able to subsequently load privileged chrome pages. The privilege
  restrictions on resource: URLs was handled incorrectly and these
  restrictions could be bypassed if this flaw was combined with a separate
  vulnerability allowing for same-origin policy violation, it could be used to run
  arbitrary code.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
