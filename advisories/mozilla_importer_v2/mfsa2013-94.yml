summary: |
  Security researcher Jordi Chancel discovered a method to put
  arbitrary HTML content within <select> elements and place it in arbitrary
  locations. This can be used to spoof the displayed addressbar, leading to
  clickjacking and other spoofing attacks.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but is
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
