summary: |
  Security researcher James Forshaw, security researcher with
  Google Project Zero, reported that the Mozilla Maintenance Service on Windows
  can be made to write its log file in a restricted location with an arbitrary
  file name through the use of a hard link by means of a race condition. This can
  allow the log file to overwrite another named file that a user would not have
  the privileges to change. If the overwritten file is used as source input or
  script by a program with elevated privileges, it could allow for an escalation
  of privilege attack. This requires local file system access and the ability to
  execute local programs to be exploitable.

  This issue only affects Windows systems. OS X and Linux
  operating systems are unaffected.
