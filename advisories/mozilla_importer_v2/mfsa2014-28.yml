summary: |
  Mozilla developer Robert O'Callahan reported a mechanism for
  timing attacks involving SVG filters and displacements input to
  feDisplacementMap. This allows displacements to potentially be
  correlated with values derived from content. This is similar to the previously
  reported techniques used for SVG timing attacks and could allow for text values
  to be read across domains, leading to information disclosure.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but is
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
