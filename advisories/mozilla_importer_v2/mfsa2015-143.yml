summary: |
  Security researcher Gustavo Grieco reported that on Linux Gnome
  systems the dialog for choosing local files uses the operating system's
  gdk-pixbuf library to render thumbnails for image file types. This
  library supports various image decoders, and Grieco reported that the Jasper and TGA
  decoders were unmaintained and have several known vulnerabilities. Firefox has
  disabled the use of those decoders in gdk-pixbuf.
  This issue only affects Linux systems running Gnome. Windows,
  OS X, and Android operating systems are unaffected.
