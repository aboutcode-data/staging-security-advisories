summary: |
  Mozilla developer Margaret Leibovic reported when Firefox for
  Android installs lightweight themes, it does not check to verify that they are served over
  an HTTPS connection. Instead, themes can be installed over an unencrypted connection,
  which could allow for a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack by third parties replacing the
  theme content, which consists of images and toolbar text colors.

  This issue only affects Firefox for Android. Firefox on other operating
  systems is not affected.
