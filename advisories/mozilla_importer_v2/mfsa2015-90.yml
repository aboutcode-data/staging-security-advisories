summary: |
  Security researcher Ronald Crane reported three
  vulnerabilities affecting released code that were found through code inspection.
  These included one use of unowned memory, one use of a deleted object, and one
  memory safety bug. These do not all have clear mechanisms to be exploited
  through web content but are vulnerable if a mechanism can be found to trigger
  them.
