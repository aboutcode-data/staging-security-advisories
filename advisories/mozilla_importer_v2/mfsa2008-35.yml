summary: "Security researcher Billy Rios reported that if Firefox\nis not already running, passing\
  \ it a command-line URI with pipe (\"|\") symbols\nwill open multiple tabs. This URI splitting\
  \ could be used to launch \nchrome: URIs from the command-line, a partial bypass of the fix\
  \ for\nMFSA 2005-53 which was intended to\nblock external applications from loading such URIs\
  \ (that vulnerability\nremains fixed, however).\nThis vulnerability could also be used by\
  \ an attacker to pass URIs to\nFirefox that would normally be handled by a vector application\
  \ by appending it\nto a URI not handled by the vector application. For example, web browsers\n\
  normally handle file: URIs themselves, or block them from web\ncontent altogether, but this\
  \ flaw enabled attackers to pass them from another\nbrowser into Firefox. In Firefox 2 scripts\
  \ running from file: URIs can read\ndata from a user's entire disk, a risk if the attacker\
  \ could first place a\nmalicious file in a guessable location on the local disk. Rios demonstrated\
  \ that\nthe so-called \"Safari Carpet-bombing vulnerability\" could be used for this,\nas\
  \ well as another technique that does not rely on that now-fixed Safari\nvulnerability.\n\
  In Firefox 3 scripts running in local files have limited access to\nother files, almost entirely\
  \ mitigating the file: attack.\nHowever, combined with a vulnerability which allows an attacker\
  \ to inject\nscript into a chrome document the above issue could be used to run\narbitrary\
  \ code on a victim's computer. Such a chrome injection vulnerability\nwas discovered in Firefox\
  \ 3 by Mozilla developers Ben Turner\nand Dan Veditz. In the absence of the attack described\n\
  by Billy Rios this injection attack would not run with any special privilege\nand would be\
  \ at best a spoofing vulnerability."
