summary: |
  Mozilla community member jomo reported a use-after-free crash when
  processing WebGL content. This issue was caused by the use of a texture after its recycle
  pool has been destroyed during WebGL operations, which frees the memory associated with
  the texture. This results in a potentially exploitable crash when the texture is later
  called.
