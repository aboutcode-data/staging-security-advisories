summary: |
  Mozilla developer Matthew Noorenberghe reported that
  whitelisted Mozilla domains could make UITour API calls while the
  UI Tour pages for Firefox are present in background tabs. If one of these
  Mozilla domains was compromised and open in another tab, an attacker could then
  use that tab to engage in spoofing and clickjacking in any foreground tab.
