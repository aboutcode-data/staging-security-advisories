  - CVE-2022-22744
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  The constructed curl command from the "Copy as curl" feature in DevTools was not properly escaped for PowerShell.  This could have lead to command injection if pasted into a Powershell prompt.*This bug only affects Thunderbird for Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*
