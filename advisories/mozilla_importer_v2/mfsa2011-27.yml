summary: |
  Security researcher Mario Heiderich reported that
  HTML-encoded entities were being improperly decoded when displayed
  inside SVG elements.  This could lead to XSS attacks on sites relying
  on HTML encoding of user-supplied content.
  The inline SVG feature was introduced in the browser engine used
  by Firefox 4 and SeaMonkey 2.1; the vulnerability does not affect earlier versions.
