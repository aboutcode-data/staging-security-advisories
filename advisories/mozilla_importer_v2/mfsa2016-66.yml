summary: |
  Security researcher Firas Salem reported that decoding url-encoded
  values in data: urls for display leads to potential spoofing in the Location
  bar by using non-ASCII and emoji characters in a data: url's mediatype. This
  issue could result in the wrong URL being displayed as a location, which can mislead users
  to believe they are on a different site than the one loaded.
