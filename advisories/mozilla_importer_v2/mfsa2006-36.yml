summary: |
  Paul Nickerson reports that the fix for

  MFSA 2005-34 can be bypassed using nested javascript:  URLs, again allowing
  the attacker to execute privileged code. The attacker must first convince the
  user to first click on the missing-plugin icon in the page or the
  "Install Missing Plugins..." button in the infobar, and then click on the
  "Manual Install" button on the plugin-finder dialog.
  Note that the "Manual Install" button is a mechanism for installing
  software from a site specified by the web page. Many potential victims who have
  come this far might be convinced to go ahead and install arbitrary software from
  the attacker's site even without this vulnerability.
