summary: |
  Security researcher Nils reported that specially crafted web
  content using the onreadystatechange event and reloading of pages
  could sometimes cause a crash when unmapped memory is executed. This crash is
  potentially exploitable.
  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
