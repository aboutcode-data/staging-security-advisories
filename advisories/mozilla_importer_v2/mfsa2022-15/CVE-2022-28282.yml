summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  By using a link with rel="localization" a use-after-free could have been triggered by destroying an object during JavaScript execution and then referencing the object through a freed pointer, leading to a potential exploitable crash.
