  - CVE-2022-1197
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  When importing a revoked key that specified key compromise as the revocation reason, Thunderbird did not update the existing copy of the key that was not yet revoked, and the existing key was kept as non-revoked. Revocation statements that used another revocation reason, or that didn't specify a revocation reason, were unaffected.
