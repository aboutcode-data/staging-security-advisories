summary: |
  Security researcher Jordi Chancel reported that the dialog
  for saving downloaded files did not implement a security timeout before button
  selections were processed. This could be used in concert with spoofing to
  convince users to select a different option than intended, causing downloaded
  files to be potentially opened instead of only saved in some circumstances.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Seamonkey product because scripting is disabled in mail, but is potentially a
  risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
