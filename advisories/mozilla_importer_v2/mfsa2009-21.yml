summary: |
  Developer and Mozilla community member Paolo
  Amadini reported that when saving the inner frame of a web
  page as a file when the outer page has POST data associated with it,
  the POST data will be incorrectly sent to the URL of the inner frame.
  This could potentially result in a user's sensitive data being sent to
  a site for which it was not intended.
