aliases:
  - CVE-2016-5257
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Mozilla developers and community members Christoph Diehl, Andrew McCreight, Dan Minor, Byron Campen, Jon Coppeard, Steve Fink, Tyson Smith, Philipp, and Carsten Book reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird ESR 45.3. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
