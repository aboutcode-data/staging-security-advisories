  - CVE-2019-13722
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  When setting a thread name on Windows in WebRTC, an incorrect number of arguments could have been supplied, leading to stack corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. *Note: this issue only occurs on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*
