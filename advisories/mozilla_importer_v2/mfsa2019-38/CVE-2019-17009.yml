summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  When running, the updater service wrote status and log files to an unrestricted location; potentially allowing an unprivileged process to locate and exploit a vulnerability in file handling in the updater service. *Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*
