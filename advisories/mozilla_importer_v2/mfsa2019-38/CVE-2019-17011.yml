summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Under certain conditions, when retrieving a document from a DocShell in the antitracking code, a race condition could cause a use-after-free condition and a potentially exploitable crash.
