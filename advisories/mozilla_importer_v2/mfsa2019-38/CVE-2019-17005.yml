summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  The plain text serializer used a fixed-size array for the number of  elements it could process; however it was possible to overflow the static-sized array leading to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.
