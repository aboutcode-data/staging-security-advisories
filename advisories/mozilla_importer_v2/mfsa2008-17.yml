summary: |
  Peter Brodersen and Alexander Klink
  independently reported that the default setting for SSL Client Authentication,
  automatically selecting a client certificate on behalf of the user, creates
  a potential privacy issue for users by allowing tracking through client
  certificates. For users who already have certificates some real-world
  identity information such as an email address or name may be available
  to web sites depending on the purpose of the certificate and its issuer.
  The default preference has been changed to prompt the user each time
  a website requests a client certificate.
