summary: |
  Security researchers Jose Martinez and Romina
  Santillan reported a memory leak in the libstagefright library when array
  destruction occurs during MPEG4 video file processing.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
