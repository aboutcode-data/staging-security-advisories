summary: |
  Mozilla developer Daniel Stenberg reported that the DNS
  resolver in Firefox for Android uses an insufficiently random algorithm when
  generating random numbers for the unique identifier. This was derived from an
  old version of the Bionic libc library and suffered from
  insufficient randomness in the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) as described by Roee
  Hay and Roi Saltzman.

  This leaves Firefox on Android potentially vulnerable to DNS poisoning
  attacks because an attacker may be able to predict the identifier used, allowing
  for the spoofing of web sites and cookie theft.

  This flaw did not affect desktop versions of Mozilla products
  and only Firefox for Android was affected.
