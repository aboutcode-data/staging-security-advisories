summary: |
  Security researcher Nils reported two potentially
  exploitable memory corruption bugs involving scrolling. The first was a
  use-after-free condition due to scrolling an image document. The second
  was due to nodes in a range request being added as children of two
  different parents.

  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
