  - CVE-2023-4052
summary: The Firefox updater created a directory writable by non-privileged users. When uninstalling
  Firefox, any files in that directory would be recursively deleted with the permissions of
  the uninstalling user account. This could be combined with creation of a junction (a form
  of symbolic link) to allow arbitrary file deletion controlled by the non-privileged user.
  *This bug only affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*
