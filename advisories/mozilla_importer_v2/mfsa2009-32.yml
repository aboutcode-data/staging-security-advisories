summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported
  a vulnerability which allows scripts from page content to run with
  elevated privileges.  Using this vulnerability, an attacker could
  cause a chrome privileged object, such as the browser sidebar or the
  FeedWriter, to interact with web content in such a way that attacker
  controlled code may be executed with the object's chrome
  privileges.
  Thunderbird supports neither the sidebar nor
  BrowserFeedWriter objects and is not vulnerable in its default
  configuration. Thunderbird might be vulnerable if the user has installed
  any add-on which adds a similarly implemented feature and then enables
  JavaScript in mail messages.  This is not the default setting and we
  strongly discourage users from running JavaScript in mail.
