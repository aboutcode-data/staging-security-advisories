summary: |
  Security researcher regenrecht reported via
  TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in Mozilla's
  implementation of NodeIterator in which a
  malicious NodeFilter could be created which would detach
  nodes from the DOM tree while it was being traversed.  The use of a
  detached and subsequently deleted node could result in the execution
  of attacker-controlled memory.
