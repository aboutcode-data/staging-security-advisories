summary: |
  phpBB developer Henry Sudhof reported that when an
  image tag points to a resource that redirects to
  a mailto: URL, the external mail handler application is
  launched.  This issue poses no security threat to users but could
  create an annoyance when browsing a site that allows users to post
  arbitrary images.
  This issue has not been fixed in Firefox 3.0
