summary: "Security researcher Robert Kugler reported that when a specifically named DLL file\
  \ on a Windows computer is placed in the default downloads directory with the Firefox installer,\
  \ the Firefox installer will load this DLL when it is launched. In circumstances where the\
  \ installer is run by an administrator privileged account, this allows for the downloaded\
  \ DLL file to be run with administrator privileges. This can lead to arbitrary code execution\
  \ from a privileged account. \n\nAdditional vulnerable DLL file names were found and fixed\
  \ in Firefox 18.0, Firefox ESR 17.0.1, and Firefox ESR 10.0.12 releases."
