summary: |
  Security Researcher Matt McCutchen reported that a
  clickjacking attack using the certificate warning page. A man-in-the-middle
  (MITM) attacker can use an iframe to display its own certificate error warning
  page (about:certerror) with the "Add Exception" button of a real warning page
  from a malicious site. This can mislead users to adding a certificate exception
  for a different site than the perceived one. This can lead to compromised
  communications with the user perceived site through the MITM attack once the
  certificate exception has been added.
