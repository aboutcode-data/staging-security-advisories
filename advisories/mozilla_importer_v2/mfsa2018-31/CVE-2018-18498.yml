  - CVE-2018-18498
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  A potential vulnerability leading to an integer overflow can occur during buffer size calculations for images when a raw value is used instead of the checked value. This leads to a possible out-of-bounds write.
