summary: |
  On his blog Petko D. Petkov reported that QuickTime Media-Link files contain a qtnext
  attribute that could be used on Windows systems to launch the default browser
  with arbitrary command-line options. When the default browser is
  Firefox 2.0.0.6 or earlier use of the -chrome option allowed a remote
  attacker to run script commands with the full privileges of the user. This
  could be used to install malware, steal local data, or otherwise corrupt
  the victim's computer.
  The fix for MFSA 2007-23 was intended
  to prevent this type of attack but QuickTime calls the browser in an
  unexpected way that bypasses that fix. To protect Firefox users from
  this problem we have now eliminated the ability to run arbitrary script
  from the command-line. Other command-line options remain, however,
  and QuickTime Media-link files could still be used to annoy users
  with popup windows and dialogs until this issue is fixed
  in QuickTime.
  This QuickTime issue appears to be the one described by

  CVE-2006-4965 but the fix Apple applied in QuickTime 7.1.5
  does not prevent this version of the problem.
  Gran Paradiso Alpha 8 does not contain the fix
  for this vulnerability.
