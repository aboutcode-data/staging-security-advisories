summary: |
  Security researcher Alex Verstak reported that <meta
  name="referrer"> is ignored when a link is opened through the
  context menu or a middle-click by mouse. This means that, in some situations,
  the referrer policy is ignored when opening links in new tabs and may cause
  some pages to open without an HTTP Referer header being set according to
  the author's intended policy.
