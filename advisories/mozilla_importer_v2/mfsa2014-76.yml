summary: |
  Security researcher Holger Fuhrmannek used the used the
  Address Sanitizer tool to discover an out-of-bounds read issue with Web Audio
  when interacting with custom waveforms with invalid values. This results in a
  crash and could allow for the reading of random memory which may contain
  sensitive data, or of memory addresses that could be used in combination with
  another bug.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
