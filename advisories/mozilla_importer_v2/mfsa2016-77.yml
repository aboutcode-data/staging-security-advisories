summary: |
  An anonymous security researcher working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative
  reported a buffer overflow in the ClearKey Content Decryption Module (CDM) used by the
  Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) API. This vulnerability can be triggered using a
  malformed video file due to incorrect error handling. This could allow arbitrary code
  execution if combined with a second vulnerability that allows an escape from the Gecko
  Media Plugin (GMP) sandbox. Without such a vulnerability, the buffer overflow is contained
  within the GMP sandbox and cannot be exploited.
