summary: |
  Mozilla contributors moz_bug_r_a4, Boris
  Zbarsky, and Johnny Stenback reported a series of
  vulnerabilities which allow scripts from page content to run with elevated
  privileges. moz_bug_r_a4 demonstrated additional variants of MFSA 2007-25
  and MFSA2007-35 (arbitrary code execution through XPCNativeWrapper pollution).
  Additional vulnerabilities reported separately by Boris Zbarsky, Johnny
  Stenback, and moz_bug_r_a4 showed that the browser could be forced to run
  JavaScript code using the wrong principal leading to universal XSS and
  arbitrary code execution.
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and could
  be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not the
  default setting and we strongly discourage users from running JavaScript in
  mail.
