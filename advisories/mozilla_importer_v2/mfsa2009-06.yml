summary: |
  Paul Nel reported that certain HTTP directives to
  not cache web pages, Cache-Control: no-store and Cache-Control:
  no-cache for HTTPS pages, were being ignored by Firefox 3.  On a
  shared system, applications relying upon these HTTP directives could
  potentially expose private data.  Another user on the system could use
  this vulnerability to view improperly cached pages containing private
  data by navigating the browser back.
  Firefox 2 releases are not affected.
