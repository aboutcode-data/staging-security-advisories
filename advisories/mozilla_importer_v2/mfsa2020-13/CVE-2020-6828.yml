aliases:
  - CVE-2020-6828
summary: 'A malicious Android application could craft an Intent that would have been processed
  by Firefox for Android and potentially result in a file overwrite in the user''s profile directory.
  One exploitation vector for this would be to supply a user.js file providing arbitrary malicious
  preference values. Control of arbitrary preferences can lead to sufficient compromise such
  that it is generally equivalent to arbitrary code execution. *Note: This issue only affects
  Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*'
