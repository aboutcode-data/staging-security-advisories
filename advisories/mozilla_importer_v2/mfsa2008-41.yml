summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported a
  series of vulnerabilities by which page content can pollute
  XPCNativeWrappers and have arbitrary code run with chrome privileges.
  One variant reported by moz_bug_r_a4 only affected Firefox 2.
  Mozilla developer Olli Pettay reported that XSLT can
  create documents which do not have script handling objects.  moz_bug_r_a4
  also reported that document.loadBindingDocument() returns a
  document that does not have a script handling object.  These issues could
  also be used by an attacker to run arbitrary script with chrome privileges.
  Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and
  could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
  the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
  JavaScript in mail.
