  - CVE-2023-4583
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  When checking if the Browsing Context had been discarded in HttpBaseChannel, if the load group was not available then it was assumed to have already been discarded which was not always the case for private channels after the private session had ended.
