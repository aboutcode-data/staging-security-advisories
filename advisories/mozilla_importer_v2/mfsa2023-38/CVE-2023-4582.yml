aliases:
  - CVE-2023-4582
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Due to large allocation checks in Angle for glsl shaders being too lenient a buffer overflow could have occurred when allocating too much private shader memory on mac OS. *This bug only affects Firefox on macOS. Other operating systems are unaffected.*
