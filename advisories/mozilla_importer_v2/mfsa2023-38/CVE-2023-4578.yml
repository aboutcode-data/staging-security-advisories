aliases:
  - CVE-2023-4578
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  When calling JS::CheckRegExpSyntax a Syntax Error could have been set which would end in calling convertToRuntimeErrorAndClear. A path in the function could attempt to allocate memory when none is available which would have caused a newly created Out of Memory exception to be mishandled as a Syntax Error.
