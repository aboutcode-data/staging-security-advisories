summary: |
  Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported that
  when non-privileged XUL documents include scripts from chrome:
  URIs used in the browser it was possible to take advantage of the privilege
  level stored in the pre-compiled "fastload" file. This could allow an
  attacker to run arbitrary JavaScript code with chrome privileges.
  Thunderbird users are not at risk when JavaScript is
  disabled in mail. This is the default setting and we strongly discourage
  users from enabling JavaScript in mail.
