summary: |
  Security researcher Arthur Gerkis used the Address Sanitizer
  tool to find two issues involving Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files. The
  first issue is a buffer overflow in Gecko's SVG filter code when the sum of two
  values is too large to be stored as a signed 32-bit integer, causing the
  function to write past the end of an array. The second issue is a use-after-free
  when an element with a "requiredFeatures" attribute is moved between documents.
  In that situation, the internal representation of the "requiredFeatures" value
  could be freed prematurely. Both issues are potentially exploitable.
