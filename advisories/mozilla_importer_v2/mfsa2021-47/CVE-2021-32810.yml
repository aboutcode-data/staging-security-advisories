  - CVE-2021-32810
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  In the crossbeam crate, one or more tasks in the worker queue could have been be popped twice instead of other tasks that are forgotten and never popped. If tasks are allocated on the heap, this could have caused a double free and a memory leak.
