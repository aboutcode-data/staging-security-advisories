summary: |
  Security researcher Tim Brown reported that Firefox discloses the
  hostname and possibly the Windows domain through NTLM-based HTTP authentication when
  sending type 3 messages as part of the authentication exchange. This is because the
  Workstation field is populated with the hostname of the system making the
  request. An attacker can craft a malicious page to send a silent NTLM request that will
  disclose the information without visibility in the client, leading to information
  disclosure. This is mitigated because NTLM v1 is disabled by default configurations.
