summary: |
  moz_bug_r_a4 discovered that the compilation scope of privileged
  built-in XBL bindings was not fully protected from web content and
  could be accessed by calling valueOf.call()
  and valueOf.apply() on a method of that binding. This could then
  be used to compile and run attacker-supplied JavaScript, giving it
  the privileges of the binding which would allow an attacker
  to install malware such as viruses and password sniffers.
  shutdown reported an alternate way to get to XBL compilation scope
  by inserting an XBL method into the DOM's document.body
  prototype chain.
  Thunderbird shares the JavaScript engine with Firefox
  and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
  the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
  JavaScript in mail.
