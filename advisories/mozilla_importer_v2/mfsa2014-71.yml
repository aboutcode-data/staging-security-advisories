summary: |
  Security researcher Yu Dongsong reported on Firefox for
  Android that a file: protocol hyperlink could link to a local file
  in the Firefox profile directory, bypassing access restrictions. This issue was
  previously addressed in Mozilla
  Foundation Security Advisory 2014-33 but not completely.
  This problem allows for profile data, such as cookies, to be copied to the SD
  card without prompting to the use. This SD card location is world readable
  leading to a potential information disclosure of files in the Firefox profile
  through a malicious application.

  This issue only affects Firefox for Android.
