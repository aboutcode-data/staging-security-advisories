summary: |
  FireBreath developer Richard Bateman reported a crash
  on Mac OS X that occurred when a plugin deletes its containing DOM frame
  during a call from that frame. The observed symptom is a null dereference
  but we cannot rule out the possibility that content from a scriptable plugin
  such as Flash could find a way to dereference a more useful address
  and exploit it.
