summary: |
  Georgi Guninski reports that forwarding mail in-line while
  using the default HTML "rich mail" editor will execute
  JavaScript embedded in the e-mail message. Forwarding mail
  in-line is not the default setting but it is easily accessed
  through the "Forward As" menu item.
  This JavaScript runs with the full privileges of the client
  and could be used to install malware or send spam.
  In Thunderbird 1.0.7 and below and Mozilla Suite 1.7.12 and below
  JavaScript is also executed when you reply to a mail, though
  limited to the sandbox of the message. This script could
  spy on or alter the message you are composing.
