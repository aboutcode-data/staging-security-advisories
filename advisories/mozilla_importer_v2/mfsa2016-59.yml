summary: |
  Mozilla developer John Schoenick reported that CSS pseudo-classes can
  be used by web content to leak information on plugins that are installed but disabled.
  This can be used for information disclosure through a fingerprinting attack that lists all
  of the plugins installed by a user on a system, even when they are disabled.
