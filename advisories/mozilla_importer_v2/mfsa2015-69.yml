summary: Mozilla community member Jonas Jenwald reported broken behavior in Mozilla's PDF.js
  PDF file viewer which led to the discovery that internal Workers were incorrectly executed
  with high privilege. If this flaw were combined with a separate vulnerability allowing for
  same-origin policy violation, it could be used to run arbitrary code.
