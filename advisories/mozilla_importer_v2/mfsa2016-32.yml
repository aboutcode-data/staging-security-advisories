summary: |
  Security researcher Ronald Crane reported five "moderate" rated
  vulnerabilities affecting released code that were found through code inspection. These
  included the following issues in WebRTC: an integer underflow, a missing status check,
  race condition, and a use of deleted pointers to create new object. A race condition in
  LibVPX was also identified. These do not all have clear mechanisms to be exploited through
  web content but are vulnerable if a mechanism can be found to trigger them.
  This issue only affects Windows systems. Linux, OS X, and Android systems are unaffected.
