summary: |
  Security researcher Alex Chapman reported that the Almost
  Native Graphics Layer Engine (ANGLE) library used by Mozilla is vulnerable to an
  integer overflow. This vulnerability is present because of insufficient bounds
  checking in the drawLineLoop function, which can be driven by web
  content to overflow allocated memory, leading to a potentially exploitable
  crash.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
  browser or browser-like contexts.
