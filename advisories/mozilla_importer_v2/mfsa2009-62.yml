summary: |
  Mozilla security researchers Jesse Ruderman
  and Sid Stamm reported that when downloading a file
  containing a right-to-left override character (RTL) in the filename,
  the name displayed in the dialog title bar conflicts with the name of
  the file shown in the dialog body.  An attacker could use this
  vulnerability to obfuscate the name and file extension of a file to be
  downloaded and opened, potentially causing a user to run an executable
  file when they expected to open a non-executable file.
