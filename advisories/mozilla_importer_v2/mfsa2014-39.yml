summary: |
  Using the Address Sanitizer tool, security researcher Abhishek
  Arya (Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team found a
  use-after-free  in the Text Track Manager while processing HTML video. This was
  caused by inconsistent garbage collection of Text Track Manager variables and
  results in a potentially exploitable crash.

  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
  Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but is
  potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.
