aliases:
  - CVE-2024-1936
summary: The encrypted subject of an email message could be incorrectly and permanently assigned
  to an arbitrary other email message in Thunderbird's local cache. Consequently, when replying
  to the contaminated email message, the user might accidentally leak the confidential subject
  to a third-party. While this update fixes the bug and avoids future message contamination,
  it does not automatically repair existing contaminations. Users are advised to use the repair
  folder functionality, which is available from the context menu of email folders, which will
  erase incorrect subject assignments.
