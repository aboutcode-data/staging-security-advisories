summary: "The security check in js_ValueToFunctionObject() can be bypassed\nby clever use of\
  \ setTimeout() and the new Firefox 1.5 array method ForEach.\nshutdown demonstrated how to\
  \ leverage this into a privilege escalation\nvulnerability that would allow the installation\
  \ of malware.\nThis vulnerability was introduced during Firefox 1.5 development, \nFirefox\
  \ 1.0 and Mozilla Suite 1.7 are not affected.\nThunderbird shares the browser engine with\
  \ Firefox\nand could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not\n\
  the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running\nJavaScript in mail."
