summary: |
  Security researcher regenrecht reported via
  TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that XUL <tree> objects could
  be manipulated such that the setting of certain properties on the
  object would trigger the removal of the tree from the DOM and cause
  certain sections of deleted memory to be accessed.  In products based on
  Gecko version 1.9.2 (Firefox 3.6, Thunderbird 3.1) and newer
  this memory has been overwritten by a value that will cause an
  unexploitable crash. In products based on Gecko version 1.9.1 (Firefox 3.5,
  Thunderbird 3.0, and SeaMonkey 2.0) and older an attacker could
  potentially use this vulnerability to crash a victim's browser and run
  arbitrary code on their computer.
