summary: |
  Security researcher Dan Kaminsky reported an
  integer overflow in the Theora video library.  A video's dimensions
  were being multiplied together and used in particular memory
  allocations.  When the video dimensions were sufficiently large, the
  multiplication could overflow a 32-bit integer resulting in too small
  a memory buffer being allocated for the video.  An attacker could use
  a specially crafted video to write data past the bounds of this
  buffer, causing a crash and potentially running arbitrary code on a
  victim's computer.
  Mozilla intern David Keeler also independently
  reported this issue as well as an additional crash which was
  determined to be a denial-of-service.
  Video capabilities were added to the Mozilla browser engine
  in Firefox 3.5, SeaMonkey 2.0, and Thunderbird 3.0; prior releases of these
  products were not affected.
  These bugs were fixed upstream in Theora version 1.1
  ("Thusnelda") but the older version used in Firefox 3.5 needed this
  patch.
