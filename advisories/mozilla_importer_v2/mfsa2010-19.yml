summary: |
  Security researcher regenrecht reported via
  TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the implementation of
  the window.navigator.plugins object.  When a page
  reloads, the plugins array would reallocate all of its members without
  checking for existing references to each member.  This could result in
  the deletion of objects for which valid pointers still exist.  An
  attacker could use this vulnerability to crash a victim's browser and
  run arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
