aliases:
  - CVE-2024-4769
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  When importing resources using Web Workers, error messages would distinguish the difference between application/javascript responses and non-script responses.  This could have been abused to learn information cross-origin.
