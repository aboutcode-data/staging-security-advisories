summary: |
  Security researcher Paul Stone reported that a
  user's form history, both from web content as well as the smart
  location bar, was vulnerable to theft.  A malicious web page could
  synthesize events such as mouse focus and key presses on behalf of the
  victim and trick the browser into auto-filling the form fields with
  history entries and then reading the entries.
