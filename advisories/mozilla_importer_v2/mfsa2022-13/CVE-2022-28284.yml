  - CVE-2022-28284
summary: SVG's <use> element could have been used to load unexpected content that could have
  executed script in certain circumstances. While the specification seems to allow this, other
  browsers do not, and web developers relied on this property for script security so gecko's
  implementation was aligned with theirs.
