  - CVE-2016-9904
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  An attacker could use a JavaScript Map/Set timing attack to determine whether an atom is used by another compartment/zone in specific contexts. This could be used to leak information, such as usernames embedded in JavaScript code, across websites.
