aliases:
  - CVE-2016-9893
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  Mozilla developers and community members Jan de Mooij, Iris Hsiao, Christian Holler, Carsten Book, Timothy Nikkel, Christoph Diehl, Olli Pettay, Raymond Forbes, and Boris Zbarsky reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 45.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
