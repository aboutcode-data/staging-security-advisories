  - CVE-2016-9900
summary: |
  *In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

  External resources that should be blocked when loaded by SVG images can bypass security restrictions through the use of data: URLs. This could allow for cross-domain data leakage.
