summary: |
  Security researcher Jordi Chancel reported a mechanism that
  made cursor invisible through flash content and then replaced it through the
  layering of HTML content. This flaw can be in used in combination with an image
  of the cursor manipulated through JavaScript, leading to clickjacking during
  subsequent interactions with HTML content.

  This flaw only affects OS X systems. Windows and Linux
  installations are unaffected.
