summary: |
  Jared Breland reported on LEGROOM.net that when the new "Feed Preview" feature
  in Firefox 2.0 retrieves the icons of the installed web-based feed viewers it
  is potentially informing those services of your feed-browsing habits by
  sending the URL of the feed in a referrer header with each icon request.
  This was an oversight and has been fixed in Firefox 2.0.0.1
