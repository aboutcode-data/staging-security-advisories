summary: |
  Daniel de Wildt discovered a memory handling flaw in Mozilla string
  classes that could overwrite memory at a fixed location if
  reallocation fails during string growth. This could theoretically
  lead to arbitrary code execution. Creating the exact conditions
  for exploitation--including running out of memory at just the right
  moment--is unlikely.
  This flaw was independently discovered by Gaël Delalleau and
  reported by iDEFENSE
