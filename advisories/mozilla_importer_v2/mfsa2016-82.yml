summary: "Security researcher Rafay Baloch reported a mechanism to spoof the\naddressbar in\
  \ Firefox for Android using right-to-left character sets when combined with\nleft-to-right\
  \ characters. This can be used to cause only certain portions of the loaded\nleft-to-right\
  \ character portion of the URL to be displayed, misleading users as to what\nsite is loaded,\
  \ possibly leading to phishing attacks. \n\nThis vulnerability does not affect the desktop\
  \ version of Firefox."
