summary: |
  Google security researcher Chris Evans reported
  that data can be read across domains by injecting bogus CSS selectors
  into a target site and then retrieving the data using JavaScript APIs.
  If an attacker can inject opening and closing portions of a CSS
  selector into points A and B of a target page, then the region between
  the two injection points becomes readable to JavaScript through, for
  example, the getComputedStyle() API.
