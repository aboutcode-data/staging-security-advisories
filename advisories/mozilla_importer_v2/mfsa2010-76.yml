summary: |
  Security researcher echo reported that a web page
  could open a window with an about:blank location and then inject an
  <isindex> element into that page which upon submission would
  redirect to a chrome: document.  The effect of this defect was that
  the original page would wind up with a reference to a
  chrome-privileged object, the opened window, which could be leveraged
  for privilege escalation attacks.
  Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 provided
  proof-of-concept code demonstrating how the above vulnerability could
  be used to run arbitrary code with chrome privileges.
