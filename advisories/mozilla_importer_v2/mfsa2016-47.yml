summary: |
  The CESG, the Information Security Arm of GCHQ, reported that the
  JavaScript .watch() method could be used to overflow the 32-bit generation
  count of the underlying HashMap, resulting in a write to an invalid entry. Under the right
  conditions this write could lead to arbitrary code execution. The overflow takes
  considerable time and a malicious page would require a user to keep it open for the
  duration of the attack.
