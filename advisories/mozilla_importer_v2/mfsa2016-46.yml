summary: |
  Security researcher Muneaki Nishimura (nishimunea) of Recruit
  Technologies Co., Ltd. reported that the chrome.tabs.update API for web
  extensions allows for navigation to javascript: URLs without additional
  permissions. This can used to elevate privilege for a universal cross-site scripting (XSS)
  attack by a malicious web extension. It can also be used to inject content into other
  extensions if they load content within browser tabs.
