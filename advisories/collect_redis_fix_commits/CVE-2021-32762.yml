summary: "04ba485042c65e18a294a13202769cfa1f6714a3:Fix redis-cli / redis-sential overflow on\
  \ some platforms (CVE-2021-32762)\n\nThe redis-cli command line tool and redis-sentinel service\
  \ may be vulnerable\nto integer overflow when parsing specially crafted large multi-bulk network\n\
  replies. This is a result of a vulnerability in the underlying hiredis\nlibrary which does\
  \ not perform an overflow check before calling the calloc()\nheap allocation function.\n\n\
  This issue only impacts systems with heap allocators that do not perform their\nown overflow\
  \ checks. Most modern systems do and are therefore not likely to\nbe affected. Furthermore,\
  \ by default redis-sentinel uses the jemalloc allocator\nwhich is also not vulnerable.\nbb7597f46ee7798531e236a20f41729d5a056050:Fix\
