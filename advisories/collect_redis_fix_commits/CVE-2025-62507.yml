  7f1bafc9225f210317070d8716756032a53f6d20:Fix XACKDEL stack overflow when IDs exceed STREAMID_STATIC_VECTOR_LEN (CVE-2025-62507)

  This issue was introduced by redis/redis#14130.
  The problem is that when the number of IDs exceeds STREAMID_STATIC_VECTOR_LEN (8), the code forgot to reallocate memory for the IDs array, which causes a stack overflow.
