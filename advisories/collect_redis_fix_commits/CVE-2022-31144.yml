summary: "15ae4e29e537e7ec37f0df1825d9fb2beea67124:Fix heap overflow corruption in XAUTOCLAIM\
  \ (CVE-2022-31144) (#11002)\n\nThe temporary array for deleted entries reply of XAUTOCLAIM\
  \ was\r\ninsufficient, but also in fact the COUNT argument should be used to\r\ncontrol the\
  \ size of the reply, so instead of terminating the loop by\r\nonly counting the claimed entries,\
  \ we'll count deleted entries as well.\r\n\r\nFix #10968\r\nAddresses CVE-2022-31144\n\n(cherry\
  \ picked from commit 2825b6057bee911e69b6fd30eb338d02e9d7ff90)\n15ae4e29e537e7ec37f0df1825d9fb2beea67124:Fix\
