  3680a5230c386602ebc82700fe3031960d0479fd:Bump docker/distribution to 2.8.2

  k/k doesn't use much code from docker/distribution so this doesn't
  change anything that's actually relevant, but 2.8.1 is identified as
  affected by CVE-2022-28391 and CVE-2023-2253; bumping to 2.8.2 avoids
  k/k triggering scanners on those CVEs.
