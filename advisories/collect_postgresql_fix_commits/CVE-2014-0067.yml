  6d45ee572d0f698c91495e458b52be35c2b3cae5:Lock down regression testing temporary clusters on Windows.

  Use SSPI authentication to allow connections exclusively from the OS
  user that launched the test suite.  This closes on Windows the
  vulnerability that commit be76a6d39e2832d4b88c0e1cc381aa44a7f86881
  closed on other platforms.  Users of "make installcheck" or custom test
  harnesses can run "pg_regress --config-auth=DATADIR" to activate the
  same authentication configuration that "make check" would use.
  Back-patch to 9.0 (all supported versions).

  95cefd30e190019127fdbf9fdaa9f26cc36e0ca6:Secure Unix-domain sockets of "make check" temporary clusters.

  Any OS user able to access the socket can connect as the bootstrap
  superuser and proceed to execute arbitrary code as the OS user running
  the test.  Protect against that by placing the socket in a temporary,
  mode-0700 subdirectory of /tmp.  The pg_regress-based test suites and
  the pg_upgrade test suite were vulnerable; the $(prove_check)-based test
  suites were already secure.  Back-patch to 8.4 (all supported versions).
  The hazard remains wherever the temporary cluster accepts TCP
  connections, notably on Windows.

  As a convenient side effect, this lets testing proceed smoothly in
  builds that override DEFAULT_PGSOCKET_DIR.  Popular non-default values
  like /var/run/postgresql are often unwritable to the build user.

  f58663ab1aa229e690daa84448776468673dad21:Document risks of "make check" in the regression testing instructions.

  Since the temporary server started by "make check" uses "trust"
  authentication, another user on the same machine could connect to it
  as database superuser, and then potentially exploit the privileges of
  the operating-system user who started the tests.  We should change
  the testing procedures to prevent this risk; but discussion is required
  about the best way to do that, as well as more testing than is practical
  for an undisclosed security problem.  Besides, the same issue probably
  affects some user-written test harnesses.  So for the moment, we'll just
  warn people against using "make check" when there are untrusted users on
  the same machine.

  In passing, remove some ancient advice that suggested making the
  regression testing subtree world-writable if you'd built as root.
  That looks dangerously insecure in modern contexts, and anyway we
  should not be encouraging people to build Postgres as root.
