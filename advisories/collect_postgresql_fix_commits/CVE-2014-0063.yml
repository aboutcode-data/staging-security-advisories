  d0ed1a6c044452a529c1d544647ea1fcb90dcb81:Fix handling of wide datetime input/output.

  Many server functions use the MAXDATELEN constant to size a buffer for
  parsing or displaying a datetime value.  It was much too small for the
  longest possible interval output and slightly too small for certain
  valid timestamp input, particularly input with a long timezone name.
  The long input was rejected needlessly; the long output caused
  interval_out() to overrun its buffer.  ECPG's pgtypes library has a copy
  of the vulnerable functions, which bore the same vulnerabilities along
  with some of its own.  In contrast to the server, certain long inputs
  caused stack overflow rather than failing cleanly.  Back-patch to 8.4
  (all supported versions).

  Reported by Daniel Schüssler, reviewed by Tom Lane.
