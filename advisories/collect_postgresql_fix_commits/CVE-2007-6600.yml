  fd28d83bdc1d357d2e21e416cf52c0e20ab6da16:Disallow RESET ROLE and RESET SESSION AUTHORIZATION inside security-definer
  functions.

  This extends the previous patch that forbade SETting these variables inside
  security-definer functions.  RESET is equally a security hole, since it
  would allow regaining privileges of the caller; furthermore it can trigger
  Assert failures and perhaps other internal errors, since the code is not
  expecting these variables to change in such contexts.  The previous patch
  did not cover this case because assign hooks don't really have enough
  information, so move the responsibility for preventing this into guc.c.

  Problem discovered by Heikki Linnakangas.

  218cf59b60c526258f14e672000f59496b227639:Make standard maintenance operations (including VACUUM, ANALYZE, REINDEX,
  and CLUSTER) execute as the table owner rather than the calling user, using
  the same privilege-switching mechanism already used for SECURITY DEFINER
  functions.  The purpose of this change is to ensure that user-defined
  functions used in index definitions cannot acquire the privileges of a
  superuser account that is performing routine maintenance.  While a function
  used in an index is supposed to be IMMUTABLE and thus not able to do anything
  very interesting, there are several easy ways around that restriction; and
  even if we could plug them all, there would remain a risk of reading sensitive
  information and broadcasting it through a covert channel such as CPU usage.

  To prevent bypassing this security measure, execution of SET SESSION
  AUTHORIZATION and SET ROLE is now forbidden within a SECURITY DEFINER context.

  Thanks to Itagaki Takahiro for reporting this vulnerability.
