  27ac667cfd94f7f8ce41efb93962e9deb818a47f:Prevent access to external files/URLs via contrib/xml2's xslt_process().

  libxslt offers the ability to read and write both files and URLs through
  stylesheet commands, thus allowing unprivileged database users to both read
  and write data with the privileges of the database server.  Disable that
  through proper use of libxslt's security options.

  Also, remove xslt_process()'s ability to fetch documents and stylesheets
  from external files/URLs.  While this was a documented "feature", it was
  long regarded as a terrible idea.  The fix for CVE-2012-3489 broke that
  capability, and rather than expend effort on trying to fix it, we're just
  going to summarily remove it.

  While the ability to write as well as read makes this security hole
  considerably worse than CVE-2012-3489, the problem is mitigated by the fact
  that xslt_process() is not available unless contrib/xml2 is installed,
  and the longstanding warnings about security risks from that should have
  discouraged prudent DBAs from installing it in security-exposed databases.

  Reported and fixed by Peter Eisentraut.

  a4b0c0aaf093a015bebe83a24c183e10a66c8c39:Prevent access to external files/URLs via XML entity references.

  xml_parse() would attempt to fetch external files or URLs as needed to
  resolve DTD and entity references in an XML value, thus allowing
  unprivileged database users to attempt to fetch data with the privileges
  of the database server.  While the external data wouldn't get returned
  directly to the user, portions of it could be exposed in error messages
  if the data didn't parse as valid XML; and in any case the mere ability
  to check existence of a file might be useful to an attacker.

  The ideal solution to this would still allow fetching of references that
  are listed in the host system's XML catalogs, so that documents can be
  validated according to installed DTDs.  However, doing that with the
  available libxml2 APIs appears complex and error-prone, so we're not going
  to risk it in a security patch that necessarily hasn't gotten wide review.
  So this patch merely shuts off all access, causing any external fetch to
  silently expand to an empty string.  A future patch may improve this.

  In HEAD and 9.2, also suppress warnings about undefined entities, which
  would otherwise occur as a result of not loading referenced DTDs.  Previous
  branches don't show such warnings anyway, due to different error handling
  arrangements.

  Credit to Noah Misch for first reporting the problem, and for much work
  towards a solution, though this simplistic approach was not his preference.
  Also thanks to Daniel Veillard for consultation.
