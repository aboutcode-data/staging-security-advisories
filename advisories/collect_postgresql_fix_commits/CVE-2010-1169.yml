  60028fda9f1009fdc76b6d011b1830b99ae6422c:Abandon the use of Perl's Safe.pm to enforce restrictions in plperl, as it is
  fundamentally insecure. Instead apply an opmask to the whole interpreter that
  imposes restrictions on unsafe operations. These restrictions are much harder
  to subvert than is Safe.pm, since there is no container to be broken out of.
  Backported to release 7.4.

  In releases 7.4, 8.0 and 8.1 this also includes the necessary backporting of
  the two interpreters model for plperl and plperlu adopted in release 8.2.

  In versions 8.0 and up, the use of Perl's POSIX module to undo its locale
  mangling on Windows has become insecure with these changes, so it is
  replaced by our own routine, which is also faster.

  Nice side effects of the changes include that it is now possible to use perl's
  "strict" pragma in a natural way in plperl, and that perl's $a and
  $b variables now work as expected in sort routines, and that function
  compilation is significantly faster.

  Tim Bunce and Andrew Dunstan, with reviews from Alex Hunsaker and
  Alexey Klyukin.
