  c6eced09b25d12d73b93a740f2d81c22bb7e3d1f:Remove xmlparse(document '') test

  This one test was behaving differently between the ubuntu fix for
  CVE-2015-7499 and the base "expected" file.  It's not worth having
  yet another version of the expected file for this test, so drop it.
  Perhaps at some point when all distros have settled down to the
  same behavior on this test, it can be restored.

  Problem found by me on libxml2 (2.9.1+dfsg1-3ubuntu4.6).
  Solution suggested by Tom Lane.
  Backpatch to 9.5, where the test was added.

  085423e3e326da1b52f41aa86126f2a064a7db25:Add an expected-file to match behavior of latest libxml2.

  Recent releases of libxml2 do not provide error context reports for errors
  detected at the very end of the input string.  This appears to be a bug, or
  at least an infelicity, introduced by the fix for libxml2's CVE-2015-7499.
  We can hope that this behavioral change will get undone before too long;
  but the security patch is likely to spread a lot faster/further than any
  follow-on cleanup, which means this behavior is likely to be present in the
  wild for some time to come.  As a stopgap, add a variant regression test
  expected-file that matches what you get with a libxml2 that acts this way.
