  8d412e02ebfb106aedc2edef8e3b26e802311151:Cherry-pick security-relevant fixes from upstream imath library.

  This covers alterations to buffer sizing and zeroing made between imath
  1.3 and imath 1.20.  Valgrind Memcheck identified the buffer overruns
  and reliance on uninitialized data; their exploit potential is unknown.
  Builds specifying --with-openssl are unaffected, because they use the
  OpenSSL BIGNUM facility instead of imath.  Back-patch to 9.0 (all
  supported versions).

  ce6f261cd2df5f166ee21d54c4ad13f535193035:Fix buffer overrun after incomplete read in pullf_read_max().

  Most callers pass a stack buffer.  The ensuing stack smash can crash the
  server, and we have not ruled out the viability of attacks that lead to
  privilege escalation.  Back-patch to 9.0 (all supported versions).
