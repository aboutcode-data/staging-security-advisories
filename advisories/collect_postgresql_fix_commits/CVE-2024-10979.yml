  9fc1c3a02ddc4cf2a34550c0f985288cea7094bd:Fix cross-version upgrade tests.

  TestUpgradeXversion knows how to make the main regression database's
  references to pg_regress.so be version-independent.  But it doesn't
  do that for plperl's database, so that the C function added by
  commit b7e3a52a8 is causing cross-version upgrade test failures.
  Path of least resistance is to just drop the function at the end
  of the new test.

  In <= v14, also take the opportunity to clean up the generated
  test files.

  168579e23bdbeda1a140440c0272b335d53ad061:Avoid bizarre meson behavior with backslashes in command arguments.

  a34c33fd2278157de140608523598567bfb7a32f:Avoid bizarre meson behavior with backslashes in command arguments.

  meson makes the backslashes in text2macro.pl's --strip argument
  into forward slashes, effectively disabling comment stripping.
  That hasn't caused us issues before, but it breaks the test case
  for b7e3a52a8.  We don't really need the pattern to be adjustable,
  so just hard-wire it into the script instead.

  2ab12d860e51e468703a2777b3759b7a61639df2:Block environment variable mutations from trusted PL/Perl.

  Many process environment variables (e.g. PATH), bypass the containment
  expected of a trusted PL.  Hence, trusted PLs must not offer features
  that achieve setenv().  Otherwise, an attacker having USAGE privilege on
  the language often can achieve arbitrary code execution, even if the
  attacker lacks a database server operating system user.

  To fix PL/Perl, replace trusted PL/Perl %ENV with a tied hash that just
  replaces each modification attempt with a warning.  Sites that reach
  these warnings should evaluate the application-specific implications of
  proceeding without the environment modification:

    Can the application reasonably proceed without the modification?

      If no, switch to plperlu or another approach.

      If yes, the application should change the code to stop attempting
      environment modifications.  If that's too difficult, add "untie
      %main::ENV" in any code executed before the warning.  For example,
      one might add it to the start of the affected function or even to
      the plperl.on_plperl_init setting.

  In passing, link to Perl's guidance about the Perl features behind the
  security posture of PL/Perl.

  Back-patch to v12 (all supported versions).
