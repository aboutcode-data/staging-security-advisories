  600086f471a3bb57ff4953accf1d3f8d2efe0201:libpq: Prevent some overflows of int/size_t

  Several functions could overflow their size calculations, when presented
  with very large inputs from remote and/or untrusted locations, and then
  allocate buffers that were too small to hold the intended contents.

  Switch from int to size_t where appropriate, and check for overflow
  conditions when the inputs could have plausibly originated outside of
  the libpq trust boundary. (Overflows from within the trust boundary are
  still possible, but these will be fixed separately.) A version of
  add_size() is ported from the backend to assist with code that performs
  more complicated concatenation.
