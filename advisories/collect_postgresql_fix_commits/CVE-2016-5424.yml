  8b845520fb0aa50fea7aae44a45cee1b6d87845d:Add tests for various connection string issues

  Add tests for consistent support of connection strings in frontend
  programs as well as proper handling of unusual characters in database
  and user names.  These tests were developed for the issues of
  CVE-2016-5424.

  To allow testing of names with spaces, change the pg_regress
  command-line options --create-role and --dbname to split their arguments
  by comma only, not space or comma as before.  Only commas were actually
  used in existing uses.

  Continue to print the full conninfo string when reporting a connection
  failure.  It is informative there, and if the database name is the sole
  problem, the server-side error message will include the name.  Beyond
  those user-visible fixes, this allows a subsequent commit to synthesize

  6655c07574f2c966ad17e8cc21e9d399f07266f7:Introduce a psql "\connect -reuse-previous=on|off" option.

  The decision to reuse values of parameters from a previous connection

  means of overriding that default.  This feature arose as one component
  of a fix for security vulnerabilities in pg_dump, pg_dumpall, and

  fcd15f13581f6d75c63d213220d5a94889206c1b:Obstruct shell, SQL, and conninfo injection via database and role names.

  Due to simplistic quoting and confusion of database names with conninfo
  strings, roles with the CREATEDB or CREATEROLE option could escalate to
  superuser privileges when a superuser next ran certain maintenance
  commands.  The new coding rule for PQconnectdbParams() calls, documented
  at conninfo_array_parse(), is to pass expand_dbname=true and wrap
  literal database names in a trivial connection string.  Escape
  zero-length values in appendConnStrVal().  Back-patch to 9.1 (all

  142c24c23447f212e642a0ffac9af878b93f490d:Reject, in pg_dumpall, names containing CR or LF.

  These characters prematurely terminate Windows shell command processing,
  causing the shell to execute a prefix of the intended command.  The
  chief alternative to rejecting these characters was to bypass the
  Windows shell with CreateProcess(), but the ability to use such names
  has little value.  Back-patch to 9.1 (all supported versions).

  This change formally revokes support for these characters in database
  names and roles names.  Don't document this; the error message is
  self-explanatory, and too few users would benefit.  A future major
  release may forbid creation of databases and roles so named.  For now,
  check only at known weak points in pg_dumpall.  Future commits will,
  without notice, reject affected names from other frontend programs.

  Also extend the restriction to pg_dumpall --dbname=CONNSTR arguments and
  --file arguments.  Unlike the effects on role name arguments and
  database names, this does not reflect a broad policy change.  A
  migration to CreateProcess() could lift these two restrictions.
