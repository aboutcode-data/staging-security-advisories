  6be54294cbfb548a4d0ba1284dc83d2a0c88ca3e:Repair insufficiently careful type checking for SQL-language functions:
  we should check that the function code returns the claimed result datatype
  every time we parse the function for execution.  Formerly, for simple
  scalar result types we assumed the creation-time check was sufficient, but
  this fails if the function selects from a table that's been redefined since
  then, and even more obviously fails if check_function_bodies had been OFF.

  This is a significant security hole: not only can one trivially crash the
  backend, but with appropriate misuse of pass-by-reference datatypes it is
  possible to read out arbitrary locations in the server process's memory,
  which could allow retrieving database content the user should not be able
  to see.  Our thanks to Jeff Trout for the initial report.
