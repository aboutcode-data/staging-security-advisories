  99cbb0bd9abc4c3b85a2de2f2e83b5ddc5d38d35:Match pg_user_mappings limits to information_schema.user_mapping_options.

  Both views replace the umoptions field with NULL when the user does not
  meet qualifications to see it.  They used different qualifications, and
  pg_user_mappings documented qualifications did not match its implemented
  qualifications.  Make its documentation and implementation match those
  of user_mapping_options.  One might argue for stronger qualifications,
  but these have long, documented tenure.  pg_user_mappings has always
  exhibited this problem, so back-patch to 9.2 (all supported versions).
