  473626cf00babd829eb15c36b51dfb358d32bc95:Handle RLS dependencies in inlined set-returning functions properly.

  If an SRF in the FROM clause references a table having row-level
  security policies, and we inline that SRF into the calling query,
  we neglected to mark the plan as potentially dependent on which
  role is executing it.  This could lead to later executions in the
  same session returning or hiding rows that should have been hidden
  or returned instead.

  Our thanks to Wolfgang Walther for reporting this problem.
