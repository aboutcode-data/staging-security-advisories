  6db5ea8de8ce15897b706009aaf701d23bd65b23:Ensure cached plans are correctly marked as dependent on role.

  If a CTE, subquery, sublink, security invoker view, or coercion
  projection references a table with row-level security policies, we
  neglected to mark the plan as potentially dependent on which role
  is executing it.  This could lead to later executions in the same
  session returning or hiding rows that should have been hidden or
  returned instead.
