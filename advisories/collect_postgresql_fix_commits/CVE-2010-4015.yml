  Security: CVE-2010-4015
  e11349fdbae7295b91699a70a791c093fc6d254e:Prevent buffer overrun while parsing an integer in a "query_int" value.

  contrib/intarray's gettoken() uses a fixed-size buffer to collect an
  integer's digits, and did not guard against overrunning the buffer.
  This is at least a backend crash risk, and in principle might allow
  arbitrary code execution.  The code didn't check for overflow of the
  integer value either, which while not presenting a crash risk was still
  bad.

  Thanks to Apple Inc's security team for reporting this issue and supplying
  the fix.
