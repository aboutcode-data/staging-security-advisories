  98be8a6eaa9fe917f6be9e121187b912e19ab484:Predict integer overflow to avoid buffer overruns.

  Several functions, mostly type input functions, calculated an allocation
  size such that the calculation wrapped to a small positive value when
  arguments implied a sufficiently-large requirement.  Writes past the end
  of the inadvertent small allocation followed shortly thereafter.
  Coverity identified the path_in() vulnerability; code inspection led to
  the rest.  In passing, add check_stack_depth() to prevent stack overflow
  in related functions.

  Back-patch to 8.4 (all supported versions).  The non-comment hstore
  changes touch code that did not exist in 8.4, so that part stops at 9.0.
