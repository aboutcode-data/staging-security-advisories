  8373ed09440f0f20582da3e4b95e6d2eb76e99bb:Require PGP-decrypted text to pass encoding validation.

  pgp_sym_decrypt() and pgp_pub_decrypt() will raise such errors, while
  bytea variants will not.  The existing "dat3" test decrypted to non-UTF8
  text, so switch that query to bytea.

  The long-term intent is for type "text" to always be valid in the
  database encoding.  pgcrypto has long been known as a source of
  exceptions to that intent, but a report about exploiting invalid values
  of type "text" brought this module to the forefront.  This particular
  exception is straightforward to fix, with reasonable effect on user
  queries.  Back-patch to v14 (all supported versions).

  1e7fe06c10c0a8da9dd6261a6be8d405dc17c728:Replace pg_mblen() with bounds-checked versions.

  A corrupted string could cause code that iterates with pg_mblen() to
  overrun its buffer.  Fix, by converting all callers to one of the
  following:

  1. Callers with a null-terminated string now use pg_mblen_cstr(), which
  raises an "illegal byte sequence" error if it finds a terminator in the
  middle of the sequence.

  2. Callers with a length or end pointer now use either
  pg_mblen_with_len() or pg_mblen_range(), for the same effect, depending
  on which of the two seems more convenient at each site.

  3. A small number of cases pre-validate a string, and can use
  pg_mblen_unbounded().

  The traditional pg_mblen() function and COPYCHAR macro still exist for
  backward compatibility, but are no longer used by core code and are
  hereby deprecated.  The same applies to the t_isXXX() functions.

  6ed116046dcfaca5ee1684a0ef0c7c98a345c3b9:Fix mb2wchar functions on short input.

  When converting multibyte to pg_wchar, the UTF-8 implementation would
  silently ignore an incomplete final character, while the other
  implementations would cast a single byte to pg_wchar, and then repeat
  for the remaining byte sequence.  While it didn't overrun the buffer, it
  was surely garbage output.

  Make all encodings behave like the UTF-8 implementation.  A later change
  for master only will convert this to an error, but we choose not to
  back-patch that behavior change on the off-chance that someone is
  relying on the existing UTF-8 behavior.

  Also change pg_euccn_mblen() to report SS2 and SS3 characters as having

  4c08960d97e950b00a4f6bf255d5409da98c6032:Code coverage for most pg_mblen* calls.

  A security patch changed them today, so close the coverage gap now.
  Test that buffer overrun is avoided when pg_mblen*() requires more
  than the number of bytes remaining.

  This does not cover the calls in dict_thesaurus.c or in dict_synonym.c.
  That code is straightforward.  To change that code's input, one must
  have access to modify installed OS files, so low-privilege users are not
  a threat.  Testing this would likewise require changing installed
  share/postgresql/tsearch_data, which was enough of an obstacle to not
  bother.

  d837fb02925561091a70c5a6a74f42da57a022f9:Replace pg_mblen() with bounds-checked versions.

  A corrupted string could cause code that iterates with pg_mblen() to
  overrun its buffer.  Fix, by converting all callers to one of the
  following:

  1. Callers with a null-terminated string now use pg_mblen_cstr(), which
  raises an "illegal byte sequence" error if it finds a terminator in the
  middle of the sequence.

  2. Callers with a length or end pointer now use either
  pg_mblen_with_len() or pg_mblen_range(), for the same effect, depending
  on which of the two seems more convenient at each site.

  3. A small number of cases pre-validate a string, and can use
  pg_mblen_unbounded().

  The traditional pg_mblen() function and COPYCHAR macro still exist for
  backward compatibility, but are no longer used by core code and are
  hereby deprecated.  The same applies to the t_isXXX() functions.

  b0e3f5cf94086baa3b3b13630db333be3e525f27:Fix mb2wchar functions on short input.

  When converting multibyte to pg_wchar, the UTF-8 implementation would
  silently ignore an incomplete final character, while the other
  implementations would cast a single byte to pg_wchar, and then repeat
  for the remaining byte sequence.  While it didn't overrun the buffer, it
  was surely garbage output.

  Make all encodings behave like the UTF-8 implementation.  A later change
  for master only will convert this to an error, but we choose not to
  back-patch that behavior change on the off-chance that someone is
  relying on the existing UTF-8 behavior.

  70ff9ede5ad7a2636bc15b03373535ab990fd254:Fix encoding length for EUC_CN.

  While EUC_CN supports only 1- and 2-byte sequences (CS0, CS1), the
  mb<->wchar conversion functions allow 3-byte sequences beginning SS2,
  SS3.

  Change pg_encoding_max_length() to return 3, not 2, to close a
  hypothesized buffer overrun if a corrupted string is converted to wchar
  and back again in a newly allocated buffer.  We might reconsider that in
  master (ie harmonizing in a different direction), but this change seems
  better for the back-branches.

  Also change pg_euccn_mblen() to report SS2 and SS3 characters as having
  length 3 (following the example of EUC_KR).  Even though such characters
  would not pass verification, it's remotely possible that invalid bytes
  could be used to compute a buffer size for use in wchar conversion.
