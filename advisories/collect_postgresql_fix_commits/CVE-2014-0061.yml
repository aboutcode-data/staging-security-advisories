summary: |
  823b9dc2566dbdbdab3c08b83adb64eb428b8ca5:Prevent privilege escalation in explicit calls to PL validators.

  The primary role of PL validators is to be called implicitly during
  CREATE FUNCTION, but they are also normal functions that a user can call
  explicitly.  Add a permissions check to each validator to ensure that a
  user cannot use explicit validator calls to achieve things he could not
  otherwise achieve.  Back-patch to 8.4 (all supported versions).
  Non-core procedural language extensions ought to make the same two-line
  change to their own validators.
