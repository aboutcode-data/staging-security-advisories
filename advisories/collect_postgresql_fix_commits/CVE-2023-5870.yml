  e082734c8e78e6622a0422e612a870278721e83f:Ban role pg_signal_backend from more superuser backend types.

  Documentation says it cannot signal "a backend owned by a superuser".
  On the contrary, it could signal background workers, including the
  logical replication launcher.  It could signal autovacuum workers and
  the autovacuum launcher.  Block all that.  Signaling autovacuum workers
  and those two launchers doesn't stall progress beyond what one could
  achieve other ways.  If a cluster uses a non-core extension with a
  background worker that does not auto-restart, this could create a denial
  of service with respect to that background worker.  A background worker
  with bugs in its code for responding to terminations or cancellations
  could experience those bugs at a time the pg_signal_backend member
  chooses.  Back-patch to v11 (all supported versions).
