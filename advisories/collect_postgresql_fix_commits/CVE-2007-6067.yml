  0776cb2116f4eaec743f1e304c1255c318a20d1f:Fix assorted security-grade bugs in the regex engine.  All of these problems
  are shared with Tcl, since it's their code to begin with, and the patches
  have been copied from Tcl 8.5.0.  Problems:

  CVE-2007-4769: Inadequate check on the range of backref numbers allows
  crash due to out-of-bounds read.
  CVE-2007-4772: Infinite loop in regex optimizer for pattern '($|^)*'.
  CVE-2007-6067: Very slow optimizer cleanup for regex with a large NFA
  representation, as well as crash if we encounter an out-of-memory condition
  during NFA construction.

  Part of the response to CVE-2007-6067 is to put a limit on the number of
  states in the NFA representation of a regex.  This seems needed even though
  the within-the-code problems have been corrected, since otherwise the code
  could try to use very large amounts of memory for a suitably-crafted regex,
  leading to potential DOS by driving the system into swap, activating a kernel
  OOM killer, etc.

  Although there are certainly plenty of ways to drive the system into effective
  DOS with poorly-written SQL queries, these problems seem worth treating as
  security issues because many applications might accept regex search patterns
  from untrustworthy sources.

  Thanks to Will Drewry of Google for reporting these problems.  Patches by Will
  Drewry and Tom Lane.
