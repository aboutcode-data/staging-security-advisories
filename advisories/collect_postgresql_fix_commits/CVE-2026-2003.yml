  3b6588cd902faa967f61f539f057f9b7643cf6a5:Guard against unexpected dimensions of oidvector/int2vector.

  These data types are represented like full-fledged arrays, but
  functions that deal specifically with these types assume that the
  array is 1-dimensional and contains no nulls.  However, there are
  cast pathways that allow general oid[] or int2[] arrays to be cast
  to these types, allowing these expectations to be violated.  This
  can be exploited to cause server memory disclosure or SIGSEGV.
  Fix by installing explicit checks in functions that accept these
  types.
