  2699fc035a75d0774c1f013e9320882287f78adb:Run REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY in right security context

  The internal commands in REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY are
  correctly executed in SECURITY_RESTRICTED_OPERATION mode, except for
  creating the temporary "diff" table, because you cannot create
  temporary tables in SRO mode. But creating the temporary "diff" table
  is a pretty complex CTAS command that selects from another temporary
  table created earlier in the command. If you can cajole that CTAS
  command to execute code defined by the table owner, the table owner
  can run code with the privileges of the user running the REFRESH
  command.

  The proof-of-concept reported to the security team relied on CREATE
  RULE to convert the internally-built temp table to a view. That's not
  possible since commit b23cd185fd, and I was not able to find a
  different way to turn the SELECT on the temp table into code
  execution, so as far as I know this is only exploitable in v15 and
  below. That's a fiddly assumption though, so apply this patch to
  master and all stable versions.

  Thanks to Pedro Gallegos for the report.

  18b585155a891784ca8985f595ebc0dde94e0d43:Detect integer overflow while computing new array dimensions.

  array_set_element() and related functions allow an array to be
  enlarged by assigning to subscripts outside the current array bounds.
  While these places were careful to check that the new bounds are
  allowable, they neglected to consider the risk of integer overflow
  in computing the new bounds.  In edge cases, we could compute new
  bounds that are invalid but get past the subsequent checks,
  allowing bad things to happen.  Memory stomps that are potentially
  exploitable for arbitrary code execution are possible, and so is
  disclosure of server memory.

  To fix, perform the hazardous computations using overflow-detecting
  arithmetic routines, which fortunately exist in all still-supported
  branches.

  The test cases added for this generate (after patching) errors that
  mention the value of MaxArraySize, which is platform-dependent.
  Rather than introduce multiple expected-files, use psql's VERBOSITY
  parameter to suppress the printing of the message text.  v11 psql
  lacks that parameter, so omit the tests in that branch.
