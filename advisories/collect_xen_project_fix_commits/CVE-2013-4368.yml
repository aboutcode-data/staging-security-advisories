  5ceec62beb350d37515341f400b170c5425d065f:x86: check segment descriptor read result in 64-bit OUTS emulation

  When emulating such an operation from a 64-bit context (CS has long
  mode set), and the data segment is overridden to FS/GS, the result of
  reading the overridden segment's descriptor (read_descriptor) is not
  checked. If it fails, data_base is left uninitialized.

  This can lead to 8 bytes of Xen's stack being leaked to the guest
  (implicitly, i.e. via the address given in a #PF).

  Coverity-ID: 1055116

  This is CVE-2013-4368 / XSA-67.
