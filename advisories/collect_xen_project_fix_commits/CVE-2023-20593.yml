  64b40594f589c9069fb8cf3899d4aac59c86d4f1:x86/amd: Mitigations for Zenbleed

  Zenbleed is a malfunction on AMD Zen2 uarch parts which results in corruption
  of the vector registers.  An attacker can trigger this bug deliberately in
  order to access stale data in the physical vector register file.  This can
  include data from sibling threads, or a higher-privilege context.

  Microcode is the preferred mitigation but in the case that's not available use
  the chickenbit as instructed by AMD.  Re-evaluate the mitigation on late
  microcode load too.

  This is XSA-433 / CVE-2023-20593.
