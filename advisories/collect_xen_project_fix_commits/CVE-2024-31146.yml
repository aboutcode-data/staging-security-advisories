  638f21616a7a9e94ebae134573ca42d977a65063:x86/pass-through: documents as security-unsupported when sharing resources

  When multiple devices share resources and one of them is to be passed
  through to a guest, security of the entire system and of respective
  guests individually cannot really be guaranteed without knowing
  internals of any of the involved guests.  Therefore such a configuration
  cannot really be security-supported, yet making that explicit was so far
  missing.

  This is XSA-461 / CVE-2024-31146.
