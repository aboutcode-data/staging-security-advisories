  8b4c96f62222a7a4a61e0ab8c6171f968af7b665:VT-d: suppress UR signaling for further desktop chipsets

  This extends commit d6cb14b34f ("VT-d: suppress UR signaling for
  desktop chipsets") as per the finally obtained list of affected
  chipsets from Intel.

  Also pad the IDs we had listed there before to full 4 hex digits.

  This is CVE-2013-3495 / XSA-59.

  269b6538fadb56161c39b398118a0682d25a7071:VT-d: extend error report masking workaround to newer chipsets

  Add two more PCI IDs to the set that has been taken care of with a
  different workaround long before XSA-59, and (for constency with the
  newer workarounds) log a message here too.

  Also move the function wide comment to the cases it applies to; this
  should really have been done by d061d200 ("VT-d: suppress UR signaling
  for server chipsets").

  This is CVE-2013-3495 / XSA-59.

  917614a82e7c0eeb14acc035ad20aa65c5ca85e7:VT-d: apply quirks at device setup time rather than only at boot

  Accessing extended config space may not be possible at boot time, e.g.
  when the memory space used by MMCFG is reserved only via ACPI tables,
  but not in the E820/UEFI memory maps (which we need Dom0 to tell us
  about). Consequently the change here still leaves the issue unaddressed
  for systems where the extended config space remains inaccessible (due
  to firmware bugs, i.e. not properly reserving the address space of
  those regions).

  With the respective messages now potentially getting logged more than
  once, we ought to consider whether we should issue them only if we in
  fact were required to do any masking (i.e. if the relevant mask bits
  weren't already set).

  This is CVE-2013-3495 / XSA-59.

  b9aea2a228b614fdb3aa9e143bf329ef71352b4d:VT-d: suppress UR signaling for desktop chipsets

  Unsupported Requests can be signaled for malformed writes to the MSI
  address region, e.g. due to buggy or malicious DMA set up to that
  region. These should normally result in IOMMU faults, but don't on
  the desktop chipsets dealt with here.

  This is CVE-2013-3495 / XSA-59.

  Note that in the backported version the clearing of the fixmap entry
  is commented out - it's not strictly needed, as we don't re-use the
  fixmap slot (and if we did it would still caue no problems), but causes
  a problem in map_pages_to_xen(), which wants to flush the cache for the
  page in question, but that works only when the page is still mapped.
  Fixing this will need to be a separate patch (coming through -unstable)
  though.
