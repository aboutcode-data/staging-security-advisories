  3e41893507b563c15b8d46a4717d2b7e92622502:VCPU/timers: Prevent overflow in calculations, leading to DoS vulnerability

  The timer action for a vcpu periodic timer is to calculate the next
  expiry time, and to reinsert itself into the timer queue.  If the
  deadline ends up in the past, Xen never leaves __do_softirq().  The
  affected PCPU will stay in an infinite loop until Xen is killed by the
  watchdog (if enabled).

  This is a security problem, XSA-20 / CVE-2012-4535.
