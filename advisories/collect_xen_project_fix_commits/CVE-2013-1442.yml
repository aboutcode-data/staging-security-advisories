  5238678b8fec15a90460378fc8c67362f73f6fdc:x86/xsave: initialize unused register state when restoring for guest

  In order to avoid leaking register contents from the prior use of the
  registers restored through xrstor due to a guest enabling certain xcr0
  bits late (particularly after the context restor in question), force
  restoring of all known registers (the ones that never got saved would
  be forced to their init state).

  This is CVE-2013-1442 / XSA-62.

  12b0ee04a16194f064d5b895a844fcdc6414bfc0:x86/xsave: initialize extended register state when guests enable it

  Till now, when setting previously unset bits in XCR0 we wouldn't touch
  the active register state, thus leaving in the newly enabled registers
  whatever a prior user of it left there, i.e. potentially leaking
  information between guests.

  This is CVE-2013-1442 / XSA-62.
