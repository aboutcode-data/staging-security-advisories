  95b7af4f967a64bfe46e007fef1d15076290961a:libxc: [CVE-2011-1583] pv kernel image validation

  The functions which interpret the kernel image supplied for a
  paravirtualised guest, and decompress it into memory when booting the
  domain, are incautious.  Specifically:

   (i) Integer overflow in the decompression loop memory allocator might
      result in overrunning the buffer used for the decompressed image;
   (ii) Integer overflows and lack of checking of certain length fields
      can result in the loader reading its own address space beyond the
      size of the supplied kernel image file.
   (iii) Lack of error checking in the decompression loop can lead to an
      infinite loop.

  This patch fixes these problems.
