  5849504a03725f553195c8d80b0d595ef8334e2a:x86/xsave: recover from faults on XRSTOR

  Just like FXRSTOR, XRSTOR can raise #GP if bad content is being passed
  to it in the memory block (i.e. aspects not under the control of the
  hypervisor, other than e.g. proper alignment of the block).

  Also correct the comment explaining why FXRSTOR needs exception
  recovery code to not wrongly state that this can only be a result of
  the control tools passing a bad image.

  This is CVE-2013-2077 / XSA-53.
