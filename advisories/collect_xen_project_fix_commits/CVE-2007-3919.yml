  86d019205b87aa53a739d2c8a25de56335949091:xenmon: Fix security vulnerability CVE-2007-3919.

  The xenbaked daemon and xenmon utility communicate via a mmap'ed
  shared file. Since this file is located in /tmp, unprivileged users
  can cause arbitrary files to be truncated by creating a symlink from
  the well-known /tmp filename to e.g., /etc/passwd.

  The fix is to place the shared file in a directory to which only root
  should have access (in this case /var/run/).

  This bug was reported, and the fix suggested, by Steve Kemp
  <skx@debian.org>. Thanks!
