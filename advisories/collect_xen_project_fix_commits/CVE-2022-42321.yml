  8c8a5b3905d4bd6d2646ddaf00a424bde62289ef:tools/xenstore: use treewalk for deleting nodes

  Instead of doing an open tree walk using call recursion, use
  walk_node_tree() when deleting a sub-tree of nodes.

  This will reduce code size and avoid many nesting levels of function
  calls which could potentially exhaust the stack.

  This is part of XSA-418 / CVE-2022-42321.
