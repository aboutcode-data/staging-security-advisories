  3c31a87bcbdf04fda9019d46236436ead53b0c1e:x86/thunk: Build Xen with Return Thunks

  The Indirect Target Selection speculative vulnerability means that indirect
  branches (including RETs) are unsafe when in the first half of a cacheline.

  In order to mitigate this, build with return thunks and arrange for
  __x86_return_thunk to be (mis)aligned in the same manner as
  __x86_indirect_thunk_* so the RET instruction is placed in a safe location.

  place_ret() needs to conditionally emit JMP __x86_return_thunk instead of RET.

  ddc5c1e0aafb9b21faa6da94d74be89bc0158ed8:x86/stubs: Introduce place_ret() to abstract away raw 0xc3's

  The Indirect Target Selection speculative vulnerability means that indirect
  branches (including RETs) are unsafe when in the first half of a cacheline.
  This means it's not safe for logic using the stubs to write raw 0xc3's.

  Introduce place_ret() which, for now, writes a raw 0xc3 but will contain
  additional logic when return thunks are in use.

  stub_selftest() doesn't strictly need to be converted as they only run on
  boot, but doing so gets us a partial test of place_ret() too.

  No functional change.

  15bb4cccf50dbba738d158c01b0bd48ab5d75ce6:x86/guest: Remove use of the Xen hypercall_page

  In order to protect against ITS, Xen needs to start using return thunks.
  Therefore the advice in XSA-466 becomes relevant, and the hypercall_page needs
  to be removed.

  Implement early_hypercall(), with infrastructure to figure out the correct
  instruction on first use.  Use ALTERNATIVE()s to result in inline hypercalls,
  including the ALT_NOT() form so we only need a single synthetic feature bit.
