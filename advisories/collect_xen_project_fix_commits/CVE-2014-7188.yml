  fad105dd0ac1a224d91757afee01acd4566f7e82:x86/HVM: properly bound x2APIC MSR range

  While the write path change appears to be purely cosmetic (but still
  gets done here for consistency), the read side mistake permitted
  accesses beyond the virtual APIC page.

  Note that while this isn't fully in line with the specification
  (digesting MSRs 0x800-0xBFF for the x2APIC), this is the minimal
  possible fix addressing the security issue and getting x2APIC related
  code into a consistent shape (elsewhere a 256 rather than 1024 wide
  window is being used too). This will be dealt with subsequently.

  This is CVE-2014-7188 / XSA-108.
