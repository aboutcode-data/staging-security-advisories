  358ee1ae1b89e586721ca442bcab708dd4b7922d:x86/HVM: range check xen_hvm_set_mem_access.hvmmem_access before use

  Otherwise an out of bounds array access can happen if changing the
  default access is being requested, which - if it doesn't crash Xen -
  would subsequently allow reading arbitrary memory through
  HVMOP_get_mem_access (again, unless that operation crashes Xen).

  This is XSA-28 / CVE-2012-5512.
