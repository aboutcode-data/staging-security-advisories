  0fb100a94d0127910fe1dfa253cb759f6bc11174:x86: protect conditional lock taking from speculative execution

  Conditionally taken locks that use the pattern:

  if ( lock )
      spin_lock(...);

  Need an else branch in order to issue an speculation barrier in the else case,
  just like it's done in case the lock needs to be acquired.

  eval_nospec() could be used on the condition itself, but that would result in a
  double barrier on the branch where the lock is taken.

  Introduce a new pair of helpers, {gfn,spin}_lock_if() that can be used to
  conditionally take a lock in a speculation safe way.

  9c7cdd55dc05b9500792e3ea1ad4bf88470190ed:x86/mm: add speculation barriers to open coded locks

  Add a speculation barrier to the clearly identified open-coded lock taking
  functions.

  Note that the memory sharing page_lock() replacement (_page_lock()) is left
  as-is, as the code is experimental and not security supported.

  1b2cc8f9c09696b34d9d985525afa8010a8daa90:x86/spinlock: introduce support for blocking speculation into critical regions

  Introduce a new Kconfig option to block speculation into lock protected
  critical regions.  The Kconfig option is enabled by default, but the mitigation
  won't be engaged unless it's explicitly enabled in the command line using
  `spec-ctrl=lock-harden`.

  Convert the spinlock acquire macros into always-inline functions, and introduce
  a speculation barrier after the lock has been taken.  Note the speculation
  barrier is not placed inside the implementation of the spin lock functions, as
  to prevent speculation from falling through the call to the lock functions
  resulting in the barrier also being skipped.

  trylock variants are protected using a construct akin to the existing
  evaluate_nospec().

  This patch only implements the speculation barrier for x86.

  Note spin locks are the only locking primitive taken care in this change,
  further locking primitives will be adjusted by separate changes.

  7ef0084418e188d05f338c3e028fbbe8b6924afa:x86/spinlock: introduce support for blocking speculation into critical regions

  Introduce a new Kconfig option to block speculation into lock protected
  critical regions.  The Kconfig option is enabled by default, but the mitigation
  won't be engaged unless it's explicitly enabled in the command line using
  `spec-ctrl=lock-harden`.

  Convert the spinlock acquire macros into always-inline functions, and introduce
  a speculation barrier after the lock has been taken.  Note the speculation
  barrier is not placed inside the implementation of the spin lock functions, as
  to prevent speculation from falling through the call to the lock functions
  resulting in the barrier also being skipped.

  trylock variants are protected using a construct akin to the existing
  evaluate_nospec().

  This patch only implements the speculation barrier for x86.

  Note spin locks are the only locking primitive taken care in this change,
  further locking primitives will be adjusted by separate changes.
