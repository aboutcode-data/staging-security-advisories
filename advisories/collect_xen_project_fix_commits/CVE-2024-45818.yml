  1eb843cd2401ea8c228d8e9061521751d5c7df44:x86/HVM: drop stdvga's "lock" struct member

  No state is left to protect. It being the last field, drop the struct
  itself as well. Similarly for then ending up empty, drop the .complete
  handler.

  A number of other static items (and a macro) are then unreferenced and

  of the questionable conditional from which the field's value was
  established (afaict 551ceee97513 ["x86, hvm: stdvga cache always on"]
  had dropped too much of the earlier extra check that was there, and
  quite likely further checks were missing).

  ed8105c364224f370fab6acc64051da6b11778d6:x86/HVM: drop stdvga's "cache" struct member

  Since 68e1183411be ("libxc: introduce a xc_dom_arch for hvm-3.0-x86_32
  guests"), HVM guests are built using XEN_DOMCTL_sethvmcontext, which
  ends up disabling stdvga caching because of arch_hvm_load() being
  involved in the processing of the request. With that the field is
  useless, and can be dropped. Drop the helper functions manipulating /
  checking as well right away, but leave the use sites of
  stdvga_cache_is_enabled() with the hard-coded result the function would
  have produced, to aid validation of subsequent dropping of further code.
