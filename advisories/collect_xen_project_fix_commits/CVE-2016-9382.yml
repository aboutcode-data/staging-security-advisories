  e8a46a210442acc7897d02857d4b77c750b02041:x86/HVM: don't load LDTR with VM86 mode attrs during task switch

  Just like TR, LDTR is purely a protected mode facility and hence needs
  to be loaded accordingly. Also move its loading to where it
  architecurally belongs.

  This is CVE-2016-9382 / XSA-192.
