  155d38c76c3f04a20f7603e533a5ab247dd6d3ea:x86: Expose more MSR_ARCH_CAPS to hwdom

  commit e46474278a0e ("x86/intel: Expose MSR_ARCH_CAPS to dom0") started
  exposing MSR_ARCH_CAPS to dom0.  More bits in MSR_ARCH_CAPS have since
  been defined, but they haven't been exposed.  Update the list to allow
  them through.

  As one example, this allows a Linux Dom0 to know that it has the
  appropriate microcode via FB_CLEAR.  Notably, and with the updated
  microcode, this changes dom0's
  /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/mmio_stale_data changes from:

    "Vulnerable: Clear CPU buffers attempted, no microcode; SMT Host state unknown"

  to:

    "Mitigation: Clear CPU buffers; SMT Host state unknown"

  This exposes the MMIO Stale Data and Intel Branch History Injection
  (BHI) controls as well as the page size change MCE issue bit.

  Fixes: commit 2ebe8fe9b7e0 ("x86/spec-ctrl: Enumeration for MMIO Stale Data controls")
  Fixes: commit cea9ae062295 ("x86/spec-ctrl: Enumeration for new Intel BHI controls")

  1486caf8a0cf30f93c12c098c28681e4713d0aa0:x86/vvmx: Fix livelock with XSA-304 fix

  It turns out that the XSA-304 / CVE-2018-12207 fix of disabling executable
  superpages doesn't work well with the nested p2m code.

  Nested virt is experimental and not security supported, but is useful for
  development purposes.  In order to not regress the status quo, disable the
  XSA-304 workaround until the nested p2m code can be improved.

  Introduce a per-domain exec_sp control and set it based on the current
  opt_ept_exec_sp setting.  Take the oppotunity to omit a PVH hardware domain
  from the performance hit, because it is already permitted to DoS the system in
  such ways as issuing a reboot.

  When nested virt is enabled on a domain, force it to using executable
  superpages and rebuild the p2m.

  Having the setting per-domain involves rearranging the internals of
  parse_ept_param_runtime() but it still retains the same overall semantics -
  for each applicable domain whose setting needs to change, rebuild the p2m.

  6082eac3ddbdc914c535bd94dfdb35292db53584:x86/vtx: Disable executable EPT superpages to work around CVE-2018-12207

  CVE-2018-12207 covers a set of errata on various Intel processors, whereby a
  machine check exception can be generated in a corner case when an executable
  mapping changes size or cacheability without TLB invalidation.  HVM guest
  kernels can trigger this to DoS the host.

  To mitigate, in affected hardware, all EPT superpages are marked NX.  When an
  instruction fetch violation is observed against the superpage, the superpage
  is shattered to 4k and has execute permissions restored.  This prevents the
  guest kernel from being able to create the necessary preconditions in the iTLB
  to exploit the vulnerability.

  This does come with a workload-dependent performance overhead, caused by
  increased TLB pressure.  Performance can be restored, if guest kernels are
  trusted not to mount an attack, by specifying ept=exec-sp on the command line.

  a8c4293b1244ddf9ee08dd39b3323569385c6213:x86/vtx: Disable executable EPT superpages to work around CVE-2018-12207

  CVE-2018-12207 covers a set of errata on various Intel processors, whereby a
  machine check exception can be generated in a corner case when an executable
  mapping changes size or cacheability without TLB invalidation.  HVM guest
  kernels can trigger this to DoS the host.

  To mitigate, in affected hardware, all EPT superpages are marked NX.  When an
  instruction fetch violation is observed against the superpage, the superpage
  is shattered to 4k and has execute permissions restored.  This prevents the
  guest kernel from being able to create the necessary preconditions in the iTLB
  to exploit the vulnerability.

  This does come with a workload-dependent performance overhead, caused by
  increased TLB pressure.  Performance can be restored, if guest kernels are
  trusted not to mount an attack, by specifying ept=exec-sp on the command line.
