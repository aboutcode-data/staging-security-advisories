  fbe0fb4b522a1879a47d80cc7f039c3cb354b636:x86/32on64: don't allow recursive page tables from L3

  L3 entries are special in PAE mode, and hence can't reasonably be used
  for setting up recursive (and hence linear) page table mappings. Since
  abuse is possible when the guest in fact gets run on 4-level page
  tables, this needs to be excluded explicitly.

  This is XSA-185 / CVE-2016-7092.
