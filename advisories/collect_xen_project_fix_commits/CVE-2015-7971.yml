  9f359c61e3927f94bb280ffb200155dd20465fda:x86: rate-limit logging in do_xen{oprof,pmu}_op()

  Some of the sub-ops are acessible to all guests, and hence should be
  rate-limited. In the xenoprof case, just like for XSA-146, include them
  only in debug builds. Since the vPMU code is rather new, allow them to
  be always present, but downgrade them to (rate limited) guest messages.

  This is CVE-2015-7971 / XSA-152.
