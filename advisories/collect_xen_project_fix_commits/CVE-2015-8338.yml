  3278c1d066c56076307a5766d9dd788e46e46421:memory: split and tighten maximum order permitted in memops

  Introduce and enforce separate limits for ordinary DomU, DomU with
  pass-through device(s), control domain, and hardware domain.

  The DomU defaults were determined based on what so far was allowed by
  multipage_allocation_permitted().

  The x86 hwdom default was chosen based on linux-2.6.18-xen.hg c/s
  1102:82782f1361a9 indicating 2Mb is not enough, plus some slack.

  The ARM hwdom default was chosen to allow 2Mb (order-9) mappings, plus
  a little bit of slack.

  This is CVE-2015-8338 / XSA-158.
