  3b9667632d52995bdf576e627bc8ea994d6941ee:x86/traps: Fix handling of #DB exceptions in hypervisor context

  The WARN_ON() can be triggered by guest activities, and emits a full stack
  trace without rate limiting.  Swap it out for a ratelimited printk with just
  enough information to work out what is going on.

  Not all #DB exceptions are traps, so blindly continuing is not a safe action
  to take.  We don't let PV guests select these settings in the real %dr7 to
  begin with, but for added safety against unexpected situations, detect the
  fault cases and crash in an obvious manner.

  This is part of XSA-260 / CVE-2018-8897.

  2f3cde33049e159b334cbdbea4e59a486138edea:x86/traps: Use an Interrupt Stack Table for #DB

  PV guests can use architectural corner cases to cause #DB to be raised after
  transitioning into supervisor mode.

  Use an interrupt stack table for #DB to prevent the exception being taken with
  a guest controlled stack pointer.

  acd86611dc7d2cf8fc9ff66067341f3591ad31fe:x86/pv: Move exception injection into {,compat_}test_all_events()

  This allows paths to jump straight to {,compat_}test_all_events() and have
  injection of pending exceptions happen automatically, rather than requiring
  all calling paths to handle exceptions themselves.

  The normal exception path is simplified as a result, and
  compat_post_handle_exception() is removed entirely.
