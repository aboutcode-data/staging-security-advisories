  2dfa064a2f302030d5ac29c06381091b01d58eb0:Change ActiveRecord::Coders::YAMLColumn default to safe_load

  In Psych >= 4.0.0, load defaults to safe_load. This commit
  makes the ActiveRecord::Coders::YAMLColum class use Psych safe_load
  as the Rails default.

  This default is configurable via ActiveRecord::Base.use_yaml_unsafe_load

  We conditionally fallback to the correct unsafe load if use_yaml_unsafe_load
  is set to true. unsafe_load was introduced in Psych >= 4.0.0

  The list of safe_load permitted classes is configurable via
  ActiveRecord::Base.yaml_column_permitted_classes
