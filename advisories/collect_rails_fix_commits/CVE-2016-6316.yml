  4394e9075189ee6031944491aecd64fb269cdf54:ensure tag/content_tag escapes " in attribute vals

  Many helpers mark content as HTML-safe without escaping double quotes -- including `sanitize`. Regardless of whether or not the attribute values are HTML-escaped, we want to be sure they don't include double quotes, as that can cause XSS issues. For example: `content_tag(:div, "foo", title: sanitize('" onmouseover="alert(1);//'))`
