  3338621efa699fe8eda94b62f328a1472ac02002:Use a temporary file for storing unencrypted files while editing

  When we're editing the contents of encrypted files, we should use the
  `Tempfile` class because it creates temporary files with restrictive
  permissions.  This prevents other users on the same system from reading
  the contents of those files while the user is editing them.
