  1b58c536ab22dd0b4c4957316bcd31262b824deb:Merge pull request from GHSA-cfjv-5498-mph5

  Prior to this commit, when a translation key indicated that the
  translation text was HTML, the value returned by `I18n.translate` would
  always be marked as `html_safe`.  However, the value returned by
  `I18n.translate` could be an untrusted value directly from
  `options[:default]`.

  This commit ensures values directly from `options[:default]` are not
  marked as `html_safe`.
