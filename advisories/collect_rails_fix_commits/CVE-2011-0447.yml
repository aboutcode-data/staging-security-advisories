  ae19e4141f27f80013c11e8b1da68e5c52c779ea:Change the CSRF whitelisting to only apply to get requests

  Unfortunately the previous method of browser detection and XHR whitelisting is unable to prevent requests issued from some Flash animations and Java applets.  To ease the work required to include the CSRF token in ajax requests rails now supports providing the token in a custom http header:

   X-CSRF-Token: ...

  This fixes CVE-2011-0447
