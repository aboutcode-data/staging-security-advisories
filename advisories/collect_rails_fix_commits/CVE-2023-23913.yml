  8e3449908c59858384ae230d1416c7dcabc8c2dc:Ignore certain data-* attributes in rails-ujs when element is contenteditable

  There is a potential DOM based cross-site scripting issue in rails-ujs
  which leverages the Clipboard API to target HTML elements that are
  assigned the contenteditable attribute. This has the potential to occur
  when pasting malicious HTML content from the clipboard that includes
  a data-method, data-disable-with or data-remote attribute.
