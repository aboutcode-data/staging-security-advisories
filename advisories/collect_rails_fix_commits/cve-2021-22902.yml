  ba0d473ed955a099ed329bb11fc4b05ca9498bd1:Remove redundant \s* in mime type regexp

  * There is already \s* at the start of MIME_PARAMETER, and we only need a \s* at the end.
  * This on its own already fixes the excessive backtracking for the example in
    https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/t/cve-2021-22902-possible-denial-of-service-vulnerability-in-action-dispatch/77866
  * The atomic group is kept because we never need to backtrack there and it's more future-proof.
