  4c743587ad6a31908503ab317e37d70361d49e66:Fix possible dev mode RCE

  If the secret_key_base is nil in dev or test generate a key from random
  bytes and store it in a tmp file. This prevents the app developers from
  having to share / checkin the secret key for dev / test but also
  maintains a key between app restarts in dev/test.
