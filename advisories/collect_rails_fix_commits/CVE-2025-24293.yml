  1ca278a6a7a05f9ec8b72bcafc3f935d65059232:Active Storage: Remove dangerous transformations

  [CVE-2025-24293]

  A subset of transformation methods included in the default allowed list
  still present potential command injection risk to applications accepting
  arbitrary user input for transformations or their parameters.

  Doing so is unsupported behavior and should be considered dangerous.
