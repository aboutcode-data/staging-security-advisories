  fcf0f42494634861a648276ba7acab6b9b123257:Don't allow render(params) on views.

  If `render(params)` is called in a view it should be protected the same
   way it is in the controllers. We should raise an error if thats happens.

  Fix CVE-2016-2098.

  769b4d3f6638f8871bb7ca7ad3d076a3dcc9e1a9:Don't allow render(params) in view/controller

  `render(params)` is dangerous and could be a vector for attackers.

  Don't allow calls to render passing params on views or controllers.

  On a controller or view, we should not allow something like `render
  params[:id]` or `render params`.
  That could be problematic, because an attacker could pass input that
  could lead to a remote code execution attack.

  This patch is also compatible when using strong parameters.
