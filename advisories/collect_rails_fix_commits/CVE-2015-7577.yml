  cdabc95608336dbea7b6a3a3e925de5bbd5313ba:Don't short-circuit reject_if proc

  When updating an associated record via nested attribute hashes the
  reject_if proc could be bypassed if the _destroy flag was set in the
  attribute hash and allow_destroy was set to false.

  The fix is to only short-circuit if the _destroy flag is set and the
  option allow_destroy is set to true. It also fixes an issue where
  a new record wasn't created if _destroy was set and the option
  allow_destroy was set to false.
