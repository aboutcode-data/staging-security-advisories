  1ec23950d15d51c23195d67a00786538901dbc52:go.mod: go get google.golang.org/grpc@v1.53.0

  This is to upgrade past the vulnerability described here:
      https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cfgp-2977-2fmm

  Terraform does not seem to be significantly affected by it since our use
  is primarily between Terraform Core and provider plugins where at worst
  a provider could just make its own connection to Terraform malfunction.
  However, this also appears to be a relatively low-risk upgrade.

  This does force upgrading some of the Google Cloud Platform dependencies,
  which the "gcs" (Google Cloud Storage) backend depends on, so there is
  some minor risk to that backend but the upstream changes to those
  dependencies do not seem to be significant.
