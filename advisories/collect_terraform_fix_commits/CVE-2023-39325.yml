summary: |
  0e6f2767e6d61e4b663001d304b1ac79ad8214b5:go.mod: Use Go v1.21.3, and newer golang.org/x/* releases

  This update is primarily motivated by removing our exposure to versions
  affected by the security advisories CVE-2023-44487 and CVE-2023-39325.

  Terraform has no practical exposure to the denial of service vulnerability
  described in these advisories, because its only HTTP2 server is the
  temporary endpoint used by "terraform login" to receive the final redirect
  of an OAuth2 transaction.

  However, these updates appear to be low-risk and will avoid creating noise
  for people running imprecise security scanning tools.
