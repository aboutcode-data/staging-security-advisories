  02ca4e970c44e2ec6cbe7dab6ab90f7866aacb38:go.mod: replace github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go with .../golang-jwt/jwt

  CVE-2020-26160 is a high-severity advisory reported against this module.

  The dgrijalva package is no longer maintained but our legacy etcv2 backend
  depends on it indirectly, via go.etcd.io/etcd/client. The golang-jwt
  package is the blessed successor of the original, and has a v3 line which
  is compatible with the v3 line of dgrijalva, and so through this replace
  we can get a fix for the advisory without other significant behavior
  change.

  We've preserved the etcdv2 backend as-is on a best-effort basis in order
  to support anyone who is already using it, but recommend that users switch
  to etcdv3 or to some other backend for ongoing use.

  We also have future plans to make state storage be a matter for provider
  plugins rather than built in to Terraform CLI, at which point this backend
  will either become obsolete or be factored out into its own plugin, at
  which point we can remove this "replace" directive and the associated
  dependency altogether.
