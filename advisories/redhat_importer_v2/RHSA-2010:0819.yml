summary: |
  Updated pam packages that fix three security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) provide a system whereby
  administrators can set up authentication policies without having to
  recompile programs that handle authentication.

  It was discovered that the pam_namespace module executed the external
  script namespace.init with an unchanged environment inherited from an
  application calling PAM. In cases where such an environment was untrusted
  (for example, when pam_namespace was configured for setuid applications
  such as su or sudo), a local, unprivileged user could possibly use this
  flaw to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2010-3853)

  It was discovered that the pam_mail module used root privileges while
  accessing users' files. In certain configurations, a local, unprivileged
  user could use this flaw to obtain limited information about files or
  directories that they do not have access to. (CVE-2010-3435)

  It was discovered that the pam_xauth module did not verify the return
  values of the setuid() and setgid() system calls. A local, unprivileged
  user could use this flaw to execute the xauth command with root privileges
  and make it read an arbitrary input file. (CVE-2010-3316)

  Red Hat would like to thank Sebastian Krahmer of the SuSE Security Team for
  reporting the CVE-2010-3435 issue.

  All pam users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues.
