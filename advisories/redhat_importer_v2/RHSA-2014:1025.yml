  - CVE-2014-4943
summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix one security issue and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Advanced Update Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * A flaw was found in the way the pppol2tp_setsockopt() and
  pppol2tp_getsockopt() functions in the Linux kernel's PPP over L2TP
  implementation handled requests with a non-SOL_PPPOL2TP socket option
  level. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to escalate their
  privileges on the system. (CVE-2014-4943, Important)

  Red Hat would like to thank Sasha Levin for reporting this issue.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * When a device was registered to a bus, a race condition could occur
  between the device being added to the list of devices of the bus and
  binding the device to a driver. As a result, the device could already be
  bound to a driver which led to a warning and incorrect reference counting,
  and consequently to a kernel panic on device removal. To avoid the race
  condition, this update adds a check to identify an already bound device.
  (BZ#1114409)

  All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
  rebooted for this update to take effect.
