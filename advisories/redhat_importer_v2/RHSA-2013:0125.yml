summary: |
  Updated wireshark packages that fix several security issues, three bugs,
  and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Wireshark, previously known as Ethereal, is a network protocol analyzer. It
  is used to capture and browse the traffic running on a computer network.

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Wireshark handled
  Endace ERF (Extensible Record Format) capture files. If Wireshark opened a
  specially-crafted ERF capture file, it could crash or, possibly, execute
  arbitrary code as the user running Wireshark. (CVE-2011-4102)

  Several denial of service flaws were found in Wireshark. Wireshark could
  crash or stop responding if it read a malformed packet off a network, or
  opened a malicious dump file. (CVE-2011-1958, CVE-2011-1959, CVE-2011-2175,
  CVE-2011-2698, CVE-2012-0041, CVE-2012-0042, CVE-2012-0066, CVE-2012-0067,
  CVE-2012-4285, CVE-2012-4289, CVE-2012-4290, CVE-2012-4291)

  The CVE-2011-1958, CVE-2011-1959, CVE-2011-2175, and CVE-2011-4102 issues
  were discovered by Huzaifa Sidhpurwala of the Red Hat Security Response
  Team.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * When Wireshark starts with the X11 protocol being tunneled through an SSH
  connection, it automatically prepares its capture filter to omit the SSH
  packets. If the SSH connection was to a link-local IPv6 address including
  an interface name (for example ssh -X [ipv6addr]%eth0), Wireshark parsed
  this address erroneously, constructed an incorrect capture filter and
  refused to capture packets. The "Invalid capture filter" message was
  displayed. With this update, parsing of link-local IPv6 addresses is fixed
  and Wireshark correctly prepares a capture filter to omit SSH packets over
  a link-local IPv6 connection. (BZ#438473)

  * Previously, Wireshark's column editing dialog malformed column names when
  they were selected. With this update, the dialog is fixed and no longer
  breaks column names. (BZ#493693)

  * Previously, TShark, the console packet analyzer, did not properly analyze
  the exit code of Dumpcap, Wireshark's packet capturing back end. As a
  result, TShark returned exit code 0 when Dumpcap failed to parse its
  command-line arguments. In this update, TShark correctly propagates the
  Dumpcap exit code and returns a non-zero exit code when Dumpcap fails.
  (BZ#580510)

  * Previously, the TShark "-s" (snapshot length) option worked only for a
  value greater than 68 bytes. If a lower value was specified, TShark
  captured just 68 bytes of incoming packets. With this update, the "-s"
  option is fixed and sizes lower than 68 bytes work as expected. (BZ#580513)

  This update also adds the following enhancement:

  * In this update, support for the "NetDump" protocol was added. (BZ#484999)

  All users of Wireshark are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues and add this
  enhancement. All running instances of Wireshark must be restarted for the
  update to take effect.
