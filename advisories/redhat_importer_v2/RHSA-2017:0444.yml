  - CVE-2017-2623
summary: |
  An update for rpm-ostree and rpm-ostree-client is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The rpm-ostree tool binds together the RPM packaging model with the OSTree model of bootable file system trees. It provides commands which can be used both on client systems as well as server-side composes. The rpm-ostree-client package provides commands usable on client systems to upgrade and rollback.

  The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: rpm-ostree (2017.1), rpm-ostree-client (2017.1). (BZ#1416089)

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was discovered that rpm-ostree and rpm-ostree-client fail to properly check GPG signatures on packages when doing layering. Packages with unsigned or badly signed content could fail to be rejected as expected. This issue is partially mitigated on RHEL Atomic Host, where certificate pinning is used by default. (CVE-2017-2623)

  This issue was discovered by Colin Walters (Red Hat).
