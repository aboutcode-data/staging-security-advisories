summary: |
  Updated httpd22 packages that fix multiple security issues are now
  available for JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.0 for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 4.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The Apache HTTP Server is a popular Web server. The httpd22 packages
  shipped with JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  4 contain an embedded copy of the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) utility
  library, a free library of C data structures and routines, which includes
  interfaces to support XML parsing, LDAP connections, database interfaces,
  URI parsing, and more.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the Apache mod_proxy module when it
  was used as a reverse proxy. A remote attacker could use this flaw to force
  a proxy process to consume large amounts of CPU time. (CVE-2009-1890)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the apr-util Extensible Markup
  Language (XML) parser. A remote attacker could create a specially-crafted
  XML document that would cause excessive memory consumption when processed
  by the XML decoding engine. (CVE-2009-1955)

  A heap-based underwrite flaw was found in the way apr-util created compiled
  forms of particular search patterns. An attacker could formulate a
  specially-crafted search keyword, that would overwrite arbitrary heap
  memory locations when processed by the pattern preparation engine.
  (CVE-2009-0023)

  A flaw was found in the handling of the "Options" and "AllowOverride"
  directives used by the Apache HTTP Server. In configurations using the
  "AllowOverride" directive with certain "Options=" arguments, local users
  were not restricted from executing commands from a Server-Side-Include
  script as intended. (CVE-2009-1195)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the Apache mod_deflate module. This
  module continued to compress large files until compression was complete,
  even if the network connection that requested the content was closed before
  compression completed. This would cause mod_deflate to consume large
  amounts of CPU if mod_deflate was enabled for a large file. (CVE-2009-1891)

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.0 should upgrade to these
  updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.
  After installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted
  for the update to take effect.
