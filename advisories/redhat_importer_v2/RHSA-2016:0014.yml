  - CVE-2015-3223
  - CVE-2015-5330
summary: |
  Updated libldb packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.1.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The libldb packages provide an extensible library that implements an
  LDAP-like API to access remote LDAP servers, or use local TDB databases.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the ldb_wildcard_compare() function
  of libldb. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted packet that,
  when processed by an application using libldb (for example the AD LDAP
  server in Samba), would cause that application to consume an excessive
  amount of memory and crash. (CVE-2015-3223)

  A memory-read flaw was found in the way the libldb library processed LDB DN
  records with a null byte. An authenticated, remote attacker could use this
  flaw to read heap-memory pages from the server. (CVE-2015-5330)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Samba project for reporting these issues.
  Upstream acknowledges Thilo Uttendorfer as the original reporter of
  CVE-2015-3223, and Douglas Bagnall as the original reporter of
  CVE-2015-5330.

  All libldb users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
