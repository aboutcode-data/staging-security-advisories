  Red Hat JBoss A-MQ, based on Apache ActiveMQ, is a standards-compliant
  messaging system that is tailored for use in mission critical applications.

  Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.2.0 is a minor product release that updates Red Hat
  JBoss A-MQ 6.1.0 and includes several bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to
  the Release Notes document, available from the link in the References
  section, for a list of changes.

  The following security issues are resolved with this update:

  It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-6153 was incomplete: the code added to check that the server hostname matches the domain name in a subject's Common Name (CN) field in X.509 certificates was flawed. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server using a specially crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2014-3577)

  It was found that JBoss Fuse would allow any user defined in the users.properties file to access the HawtIO console without having a valid admin role. This could allow a remote attacker to bypass intended authentication HawtIO console access restrictions. (CVE-2014-8175)

  It was found that a prior countermeasure in Apache WSS4J for Bleichenbacher's attack on XML Encryption (CVE-2011-2487) threw an exception that permitted an attacker to determine the failure of the attempted attack, thereby leaving WSS4J vulnerable to the attack. The original flaw allowed a remote attacker to recover the entire plain text form of a symmetric key. (CVE-2015-0226)

  It was found that Apache WSS4J permitted bypass of the requireSignedEncryptedDataElements configuration property via XML Signature wrapping attacks. A remote attacker could use this flaw to modify the contents of a signed request. (CVE-2015-0227)

  It was found that PKIX trust components allowed an X509 credential to be trusted if no trusted names were available for the entityID. An attacker could use a certificate issued by a shibmd:KeyAuthority trust anchor to impersonate an entity within the scope of that keyAuthority. (CVE-2015-1796)

  The CVE-2014-8175 issue was reported by Jay Kumar SenSharma of Red Hat.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.1.0 as provided from the Red Hat Customer
  Portal are advised to apply this update.
