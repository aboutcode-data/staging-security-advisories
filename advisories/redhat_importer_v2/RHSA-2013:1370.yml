  - CVE-2013-4210
summary: |
  An updated jboss-remoting package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for Red Hat JBoss Web Platform 5.2.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  4, 5, and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  JBoss Remoting is a framework for building distributed applications in
  Java.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the implementation of the
  org.jboss.remoting.transport.socket.ServerThread class in JBoss Remoting.
  An attacker could use this flaw to exhaust all available file descriptors
  on the target server, preventing legitimate connections. Note that to
  exploit this flaw remotely, the remoting port must be exposed directly or
  indirectly (for example, deploying a public facing application that uses
  JBoss Remoting could indirectly expose this flaw). (CVE-2013-4210)

  This issue was discovered by James Livingston of the Red Hat Support
  Engineering Group.

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss
  Web Platform installation (including all applications and configuration
  files).

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Web Platform 5.2.0 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  4, 5, and 6 are advised to upgrade to this updated package. The JBoss
  server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.
