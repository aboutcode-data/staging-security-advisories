aliases:
  - CVE-2013-6858
summary: |
  Updated python-django-horizon packages that fix one security issue and
  several bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack
  Platform 3.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  OpenStack Dashboard (horizon) provides administrators and users a graphical
  interface to access, provision and automate cloud-based resources.
  The dashboard allows cloud administrators to get an overall view of the
  size and state of the cloud and it provides end-users a self-service portal
  to provision their own resources within the limits set by administrators.

  A flaw was found in the way OpenStack Dashboard sanitized the Instance Name
  string. By embedding HTML tags in an Instance Name, a remote attacker could
  use this flaw to execute a script within a victim's browser, resulting in a
  cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. Note that only setups using OpenStack
  Dashboard were affected. (CVE-2013-6858)

  The python-django-horizon packages have been upgraded to upstream version
  2013.1.5, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.
  (BZ#1080584)

  All python-django-horizon users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues.
