summary: |
  Updated qpid-cpp packages that fix multiple security issues and one bug are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG Messaging 2.5 for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a next-generation
  IT infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG offers increased
  performance, reliability, interoperability, and faster computing for
  enterprise customers.

  The Qpid packages provide a message broker daemon that receives, stores and
  routes messages using the open AMQP messaging protocol along with run-time
  libraries for AMQP client applications developed using Qpid C++. Clients
  exchange messages with an AMQP message broker using the AMQP protocol.

  It was discovered that the Qpid daemon (qpidd) did not restrict access to
  anonymous users when the ANONYMOUS mechanism was disallowed.
  (CVE-2015-0223)

  Multiple flaws were found in the way the Qpid daemon (qpidd) processed
  certain protocol sequences. An unauthenticated attacker able to send a
  specially crafted protocol sequence set could use these flaws to crash
  qpidd. (CVE-2015-0203, CVE-2015-0224)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Apache Software Foundation for reporting
  the CVE-2015-0203 issue. Upstream acknowledges G. Geshev from MWR Labs as
  the original reporter.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * Prior to this update, because message purging was performed on a timer
  thread, large purge events could have caused all other timer tasks to be
  delayed. Because heartbeats were also driven by a timer on this thread,
  this could have resulted in clients timing out because they were not
  receiving heartbeats. The fix moves expired message purging from the timer
  thread to a worker thread, which allow long-running expired message purges
  to not affect timer tasks such as the heartbeat timer. (BZ#1142833)

  All users of Red Hat Enterprise MRG Messaging 2.5 for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 6 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
  these issues.
