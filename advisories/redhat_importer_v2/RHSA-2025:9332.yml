summary: |
  An update for mpfr is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extended Lifecycle Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision floating-point computations with "correct rounding". The MPFR is efficient and also has a well-defined semantics. It copies the good ideas from the ANSI/IEEE-754 standard for double-precision floating-point arithmetic (53-bit mantissa). MPFR is based on the GMP multiple-precision library.

  Security Fix(es):

  * mpfr: buffer overflow in mpfr_strtofr (CVE-2014-9474)
