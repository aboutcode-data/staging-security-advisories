  - CVE-2006-1168
  - CVE-2011-2716
summary: |
  Updated busybox packages that fix two security issues and two bugs are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  BusyBox provides a single binary that includes versions of a large number
  of system commands, including a shell. This can be very useful for
  recovering from certain types of system failures, particularly those
  involving broken shared libraries.

  A buffer underflow flaw was found in the way the uncompress utility of
  BusyBox expanded certain archive files compressed using Lempel-Ziv
  compression. If a user were tricked into expanding a specially-crafted
  archive file with uncompress, it could cause BusyBox to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  BusyBox. (CVE-2006-1168)

  The BusyBox DHCP client, udhcpc, did not sufficiently sanitize certain
  options provided in DHCP server replies, such as the client hostname. A
  malicious DHCP server could send such an option with a specially-crafted
  value to a DHCP client. If this option's value was saved on the client
  system, and then later insecurely evaluated by a process that assumes the
  option is trusted, it could lead to arbitrary code execution with the
  privileges of that process. Note: udhcpc is not used on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux by default, and no DHCP client script is provided with the busybox
  packages. (CVE-2011-2716)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Prior to this update, the cp command wrongly returned the exit code 0 to
  indicate success if a device ran out of space while attempting to copy
  files of more than 4 gigabytes. This update modifies BusyBox, so that in
  such situations, the exit code 1 is returned. Now, the cp command shows
  correctly whether a process failed. (BZ#689659)

  * Prior to this update, the findfs command failed to check all existing
  block devices on a system with thousands of block device nodes in "/dev/".
  This update modifies BusyBox so that findfs checks all block devices even
  in this case. (BZ#756723)

  All users of busybox are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which correct these issues.
