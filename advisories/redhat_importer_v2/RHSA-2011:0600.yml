  - CVE-2010-3780
summary: |
  Updated dovecot packages that fix two security issues and add one
  enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Dovecot is an IMAP server for Linux, UNIX, and similar operating systems,
  primarily written with security in mind.

  A flaw was found in the way Dovecot handled SIGCHLD signals. If a large
  amount of IMAP or POP3 session disconnects caused the Dovecot master
  process to receive these signals rapidly, it could cause the master process
  to crash. (CVE-2010-3780)

  A flaw was found in the way Dovecot processed multiple Access Control Lists
  (ACL) defined for a mailbox. In some cases, Dovecot could fail to apply the
  more specific ACL entry, possibly resulting in more access being granted to
  the user than intended. (CVE-2010-3707)

  This update also adds the following enhancement:

  * This erratum upgrades Dovecot to upstream version 2.0.9, providing
  multiple fixes for the "dsync" utility and improving overall performance.
  Refer to the "/usr/share/doc/dovecot-2.0.9/ChangeLog" file after installing
  this update for further information about the changes. (BZ#637056)

  Users of dovecot are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  resolve these issues and add this enhancement. After installing the updated
  packages, the dovecot service will be restarted automatically.
