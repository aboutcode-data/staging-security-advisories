summary: |
  Updated libyaml packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Software Collections 1.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  YAML is a data serialization format designed for human readability and
  interaction with scripting languages. LibYAML is a YAML parser and emitter
  written in C.

  An assertion failure was found in the way the libyaml library parsed
  wrapped strings. An attacker able to load specially crafted YAML input into
  an application using libyaml could cause the application to crash.
  (CVE-2014-9130)

  All libyaml users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. All running applications
  linked against the libyaml library must be restarted for this update to
  take effect.
