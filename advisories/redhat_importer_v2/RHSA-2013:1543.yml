  - CVE-2013-4124
summary: "Updated samba4 packages that fix one security issue and two bugs are now\navailable\
  \ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.\n\nThe Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update\
  \ as having \nmoderate security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base \n\
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each \nvulnerability from\
  \ the CVE links in the References section.\n\nSamba is an open-source implementation of the\
  \ Server Message Block (SMB) or\nCommon Internet File System (CIFS) protocol, which allows\
  \ PC-compatible\nmachines to share files, printers, and other information.\n\nAn integer overflow\
  \ flaw was found in the way Samba handled an Extended\nAttribute (EA) list provided by a client.\
  \ A malicious client could send a\nspecially crafted EA list that triggered an overflow, causing\
  \ the server to\nloop and reprocess the list using an excessive amount of memory.\n(CVE-2013-4124)\n\
  \nNote: This issue did not affect the default configuration of the\nSamba server.\n\nThis\
  \ update fixes the following bugs:\n\n* When Samba was installed in the build root directory,\
  \ the RPM target\nmight not have existed. Consequently, the find-debuginfo.sh script did not\n\
  create symbolic links for the libwbclient.so.debug module associated with\nthe target. With\
  \ this update, the paths to the symbolic links are relative\nso that the symbolic links are\
  \ now created correctly. (BZ#882338)\n\n* Previously, the samba4 packages were missing a dependency\
  \ for the\nlibreplace.so module which could lead to installation failures. With this\nupdate,\
  \ the missing dependency has been added to the dependency list of the\nsamba4 packages and\
  \ installation now proceeds as expected. (BZ#911264)\n\nAll samba4 users are advised to upgrade\
  \ to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch to correct these issues."
