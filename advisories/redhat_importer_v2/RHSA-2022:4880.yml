  - CVE-2021-41190
summary: "Updated images are now available for Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for\nKubernetes\
  \ (RHACS). The updated image includes bug fixes and feature\nimprovements.\n\nRed Hat Product\
  \ Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability\
  \ Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for\
  \ each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.\n\nNew features and enhancements\n\
  \n1. Verifying image signatures against Cosign public keys: You can use RHACS to ensure the\
  \ integrity of the container images in your clusters by verifying image signatures against\
  \ preconfigured keys. You can also create policies to block unsigned images and images that\
  \ do not have a verified signature and enforce the policy by using an admission controller\
  \ to stop unauthorized deployment creation. \n\n2. Registry integrations for Amazon Elastic\
  \ Container Registry (ECR) are now automatically generated for Amazon Web Services (AWS) clusters.\
  \ This feature requires that the nodes' Instance Identity and Access Management (IAM) Role\
  \ has been granted access to ECR. You can turn off this feature by disabling the EC2 instance\
  \ metadata service in your nodes. \n\n3. Identifying missing Kubernetes network policies:\
  \ RHACS 3.70 ships with a new default policy that allows you to easily identify deployments\
  \ that are not restricted by any ingress network policy and to trigger violation alerts accordingly.\
  \ The default policy is named Deployments should have at least one ingress Network Policy.\
  \ It is disabled by default. This default policy uses a new policy criterion called \"Alert\
  \ on missing ingress Network Policy.\" To identify pod isolation gaps, you can clone this\
  \ default policy or create a new one by using the policy criterion and enabling it on selected\
  \ resources.\n\n4. A policy to detect the Spring Cloud Function RCE vulnerability [CVE-2022-22963]\
  \ and the Spring Framework Spring4Shell RCE vulnerability [CVE-2022-22965] has been added.\
  \ It has a severity level of Critical and is enabled by default.\n\n5. A new policy criterion\
  \ has been added to validate the value of allowPrivilegeEscalation within the Kubernetes security\
  \ context. You can use this policy criterion to provide alerts when a deployment is configured\
  \ to allow a container process to gain more privileges than its parent process.\n\n6. Customers\
  \ using the recommended Operator method to deploy RHACS on OpenShift Container Platform can\
  \ now view the credentials for the admin user in the OpenShift Container Platform console.\
  \ When viewing the Central object, the Details tab provides a clickable link to the credentials\
  \ under Admin Password Secret Reference. The displayed credentials are the default generated\
  \ password or a previously configured and stored custom secret.\n\n7. Previously, RHACS limited\
  \ the number of allowed inclusion and exclusion scopes within a scope to ten each. This restriction\
  \ has been removed.\n\nNotable technical changes\n\n1. Vulnerability scanning and reporting\
  \ for RHCOS nodes: Vulnerability scanning and reporting for Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS\
  \ (RHCOS) nodes has been disabled until scanning improvements are made for improved accuracy\
  \ and to support full host-level scanning beyond just Kubernetes components. Currently, RHCOS\
  \ uses National Vulnerability Database (NVD) vulnerability data for reporting vulnerabilities\
  \ for Kubernetes components from RHCOS. In the enhanced version, vulnerability reporting will\
  \ be based on Red Hat published security data. (ROX-10662)\n\nDeprecated Features:\n\n- Ability\
  \ to add comments to alerts and processes\n- Anchore, Tenable, and Docker Trusted registry\
  \ integrations\n- External authorization plug-in for scoped access control\n- FROM option\
  \ in the Disallowed Dockerfile line policy field\n- RenamePolicyCategory and DeletePolicyCategory\
  \ API endpoints\n- --rhacs option for the roxctl helm output command\n\nRemoved Features:\n\
  \n- Ability to delete default policies\n- Security policies without a policyVersion\n- /v1/policies\
  \ API endpoint response: field response body parameter\n\nSecurity Fixes:\n\n* json-pointer:\
  \ type confusion vulnerability can lead to a bypass of CVE-2020-7709 when the pointer components\
  \ are arrays (CVE-2021-23820)\n* opencontainers: OCI manifest and index parsing confusion\
  \ (CVE-2021-41190)"
