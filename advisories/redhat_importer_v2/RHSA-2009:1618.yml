aliases:
  - CVE-2008-5519
summary: |
  An updated mod_jk package that fixes one security issue is now available
  for Red Hat Network Satellite Server 5.1 and 5.2.

  This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
  Security Response Team.

  mod_jk is an Apache Tomcat connector that allows Apache Tomcat and the
  Apache HTTP Server to communicate with each other.

  An information disclosure flaw was found in mod_jk. In certain situations,
  if a faulty client set the "Content-Length" header without providing data,
  or if a user sent repeated requests very quickly, one user may view a
  response intended for another user. (CVE-2008-5519)

  Note: Red Hat Network Satellite Server is the only client that has access
  to mod_jk on the system, and as such, the exposure and risk of this issue
  is low.

  Users of Red Hat Network Satellite Server 5.1 and 5.2 are advised to
  upgrade to this updated mod_jk package, which contains a backported patch
  to correct this issue.
