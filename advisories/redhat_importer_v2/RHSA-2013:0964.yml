summary: |
  Updated tomcat6 packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Apache Tomcat is a servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer
  Pages (JSP) technologies.

  A session fixation flaw was found in the Tomcat FormAuthenticator module.
  During a narrow window of time, if a remote attacker sent requests while a
  user was logging in, it could possibly result in the attacker's requests
  being processed as if they were sent by the user. (CVE-2013-2067)

  Users of Tomcat are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct this issue. Tomcat must be restarted for this update to take
  effect.
