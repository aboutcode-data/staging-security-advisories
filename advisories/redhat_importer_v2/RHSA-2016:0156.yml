  - CVE-2015-8213
summary: "Updated python-django packages that fix one security issue are now\navailable for\
  \ Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this\
  \ update as having Moderate security\nimpact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\
  \ scores, which give\ndetailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from\
  \ the\nCVE links in the References section.\n\nDjango is a high-level Python Web framework\
  \ that encourages rapid\ndevelopment and a clean, pragmatic design. It focuses on automating\
  \ as much\nas possible and adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.\n\nAn information-exposure\
  \ flaw was found in the Django date filter. If an\napplication allowed users to provide non-validated\
  \ date formats, a\nmalicious end user could expose application-settings data by providing\n\
  the relevant applications-settings key instead of a valid date format. \n(CVE-2015-8213)\n\
  \nRed Hat would like to thank the Django project for reporting this issue.\nUpstream acknowledges\
  \ Ryan Butterfield as the original reporter.\n\nAll python-django users are advised to upgrade\
  \ to these updated packages,\nwhich contain backported patches to correct this issue."
