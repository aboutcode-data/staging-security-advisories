summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.0.1, which fixes multiple security issues and
  several bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, Solaris, and Microsoft Windows.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set of
  components for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the Apache
  HTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat Connector
  (mod_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod_cluster), Hibernate, and the Tomcat
  Native library.

  This release serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.0.0,
  and includes several bug fixes. Refer to the Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.0.1
  Release Notes for information on the most significant of these changes,
  available shortly from https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/

  The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

  Cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the Apache HTTP Server
  mod_proxy_balancer module's manager web interface. If a remote attacker
  could trick a user, who was logged into the manager web interface, into
  visiting a specially-crafted URL, it would lead to arbitrary web script
  execution in the context of the user's manager interface session.
  (CVE-2012-4558)

  Cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the Apache HTTP Server
  mod_info, mod_status, mod_imagemap, mod_ldap, and mod_proxy_ftp modules. An
  attacker could possibly use these flaws to perform XSS attacks if they were
  able to make the victim's browser generate an HTTP request with a
  specially-crafted Host header. (CVE-2012-3499)

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the OCSP response verification
  in OpenSSL. A malicious OCSP server could use this flaw to crash
  applications performing OCSP verification by sending a specially-crafted
  response. (CVE-2013-0166)

  It was discovered that OpenSSL leaked timing information when decrypting
  TLS/SSL and DTLS protocol encrypted records when CBC-mode cipher suites
  were used. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain
  text from the encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL or DTLS server as a
  padding oracle. (CVE-2013-0169)

  Note: CVE-2013-0166 and CVE-2013-0169 were only corrected in the packages
  for Solaris and Windows. Updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux can be
  downloaded from the Red Hat Network.

  A session fixation flaw was found in the Tomcat FormAuthenticator module.
  During a narrow window of time, if a remote attacker sent requests while a
  user was logging in, it could possibly result in the attacker's requests
  being processed as if they were sent by the user. (CVE-2013-2067)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way the Tomcat chunked transfer
  encoding input filter processed CRLF sequences. A remote attacker could
  use this flaw to send an excessively long request, consuming network
  bandwidth, CPU, and memory on the Tomcat server. Chunked transfer encoding
  is enabled by default. (CVE-2012-3544)

  A flaw was found in the way the Tomcat 7 asynchronous context
  implementation performed request management in certain circumstances. If an
  application used AsyncListeners and threw RuntimeExceptions, Tomcat could
  send a reply that contains information from a different user's request,
  possibly leading to the disclosure of sensitive information. This issue
  only affected Tomcat 7. (CVE-2013-2071)

  Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss
  Web Server installation (including all applications and configuration
  files).

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.0.0 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.0.1,
  which corrects these issues.
