  - CVE-2015-5964
summary: |
  Updated python-django packages that fix two security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid
  development and a clean, pragmatic design. It focuses on automating as much
  as possible and adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

  It was found that Django incorrectly handled the session store. A session
  could be created by anonymously accessing the
  django.contrib.auth.views.logout view if it was not decorated correctly
  with django.contrib.auth.decorators.login_required. A remote attacker could
  use this flaw to fill up the session store or cause other users' session
  records to be evicted by requesting a large number of new sessions.
  (CVE-2015-5963)

  It was found that certain Django functions would, in certain circumstances,
  create empty sessions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to fill up the
  session store or cause other users' session records to be evicted by
  requesting a large number of new sessions. (CVE-2015-5964)

  Red Hat would like to thank the upstream Django project for reporting these
  issues. Upstream acknowledges Lin Hua Cheng as the original reporter of
  CVE-2015-5964.

  All python-django users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues.
