  - CVE-2005-3656
summary: |
  Updated mod_auth_pgsql packages that fix format string security issues are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The mod_auth_pgsql package is an httpd module that allows user
  authentication against information stored in a PostgreSQL database.

  Several format string flaws were found in the way mod_auth_pgsql logs
  information.  It may be possible for a remote attacker to execute arbitrary
  code as the 'apache' user if mod_auth_pgsql is used for user
  authentication. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned
  the name CVE-2005-3656 to this issue.

  Please note that this issue only affects servers which have mod_auth_pgsql
  installed and configured to perform user authentication against a
  PostgreSQL database.

  All users of mod_auth_pgsql should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to resolve this issue.

  This issue does not affect the mod_auth_pgsql package supplied with Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 2.1.

  Red Hat would like to thank iDefense for reporting this issue.
