  - CVE-2015-2675
summary: |
  Updated rest packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The rest library was designed to make it easier to access web services that
  claim to be RESTful. A RESTful service should have URLs that represent
  remote objects, which methods can then be called on.

  It was found that the OAuth implementation in librest, a helper library for
  RESTful services, incorrectly truncated the pointer returned by the
  rest_proxy_call_get_url call. An attacker could use this flaw to crash an
  application using the librest library. (CVE-2015-2675)

  All users of rest are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the
  update, all applications using librest must be restarted for the update to
  take effect.
