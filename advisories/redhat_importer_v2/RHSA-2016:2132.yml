  - CVE-2016-5195
summary: |
  An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Advanced Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A race condition was found in the way the Linux kernel's memory subsystem handled the copy-on-write (COW) breakage of private read-only memory mappings. An unprivileged, local user could use this flaw to gain write access to otherwise read-only memory mappings and thus increase their privileges on the system. (CVE-2016-5195, Important)

  Red Hat would like to thank Phil Oester for reporting this issue.

  Bug Fix(es):

  * Previously, the BUG_ON() signal appeared in the fs_clear_inode() function where the nfs_have_writebacks() function reported a positive value for nfs_inode->npages. As a consequence, a kernel panic occurred. The provided patch performs a serialization by holding the inode i_lock over the check of PagePrivate and locking the request, which fixes this bug. (BZ#1365157)
