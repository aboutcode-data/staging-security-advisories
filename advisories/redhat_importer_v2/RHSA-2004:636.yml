aliases:
  - CVE-2004-0827
  - CVE-2004-0981
summary: |
  Updated ImageMagick packages that fixes a buffer overflow are now available.

  ImageMagick(TM) is an image display and manipulation tool for the X Window
  System.

  A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the ImageMagick image handler.
  An attacker could create a carefully crafted image file with an improper
  EXIF information in such a way that it would cause ImageMagick to execute
  arbitrary code when processing the image. The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0981 to
  this issue.

  David Eisenstein has reported that our previous fix for CAN-2004-0827, a
  heap overflow flaw, was incomplete.  An attacker could create a carefully
  crafted BMP file in such a way that it could cause ImageMagick to execute
  arbitrary code when processing the image. The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0827 to
  this issue.

  Users of ImageMagick should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch, and is not vulnerable to this issue.
