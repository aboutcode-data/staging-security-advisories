summary: |
  Updated MySQL packages for the Red Hat Application Stack comprising the v1.1
  release are now available.

  This update also resolves some minor security issues rated as having low
  security impact by the Red Hat Security Response Team.

  Several minor security issues were found in MySQL:

  MySQL allowed remote authenticated users to create or access a database
  when the database name differed only in case from a database for which they
  had permissions. (CVE-2006-4226)

  MySQL evaluated arguments in the wrong security context which allowed
  remote authenticated users to gain privileges through a routine that had
  been made available using GRANT EXECUTE.  (CVE-2006-4227)

  MySQL allowed a local user to access a table through a previously created
  MERGE table, even after the user's privileges were revoked for the original
  table, which might violate intended security policy.  (CVE-2006-4031)

  MySQL allowed authenticated users to cause a denial of service (crash) via
  a NULL second argument to the str_to_date function.  (CVE-2006-3081)

  MySQL allowed local authenticated users to bypass logging mechanisms via
  SQL queries that contain the NULL character, which were not properly
  handled by the mysql_real_query function.  (CVE-2006-0903)

  Users of MySQL should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve
  these issues.
