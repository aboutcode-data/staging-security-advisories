  - CVE-2014-4338
summary: |
  Updated cups-filters packages that fix two security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The cups-filters package contains backends, filters, and other software
  that was once part of the core CUPS distribution but is now maintained
  independently.

  An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the way the process_browse_data()
  function of cups-browsed handled certain browse packets. A remote attacker
  could send a specially crafted browse packet that, when processed by
  cups-browsed, would crash the cups-browsed daemon. (CVE-2014-4337)

  A flaw was found in the way the cups-browsed daemon interpreted the
  "BrowseAllow" directive in the cups-browsed.conf file. An attacker able to
  add a malformed "BrowseAllow" directive to the cups-browsed.conf file could
  use this flaw to bypass intended access restrictions. (CVE-2014-4338)

  All cups-filters users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing
  this update, the cups-browsed daemon will be restarted automatically.
