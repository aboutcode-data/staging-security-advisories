  - CVE-2008-1927
summary: |
  Updated perl packages that fix a security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Application Stack v1.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Perl is a high-level programming language commonly used for system
  administration utilities and Web programming.

  A flaw was found in Perl's regular expression engine. A specially crafted
  regular expression with Unicode characters could trigger a buffer overflow,
  causing Perl to crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running Perl. (CVE-2008-1927)

  Users of perl are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to resolve this issue.
