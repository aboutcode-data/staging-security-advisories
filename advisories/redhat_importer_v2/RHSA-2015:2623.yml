  - CVE-2015-8370
summary: |
  Updated grub2 packages that fix one security issue and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  [Updated 27 January 2016]
  This advisory has been updated to document additional steps that need to be
  performed on BIOS-based systems after installing this update. No changes
  were made to the packages included in the advisory.

  The grub2 packages provide version 2 of the Grand Unified Bootloader
  (GRUB), a highly configurable and customizable bootloader with modular
  architecture. The packages support a variety of kernel formats, file
  systems, computer architectures, and hardware devices.

  A flaw was found in the way the grub2 handled backspace characters entered
  in username and password prompts. An attacker with access to the system
  console could use this flaw to bypass grub2 password protection and gain
  administrative access to the system. (CVE-2015-8370)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * When upgrading from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 and earlier, a
  configured boot password was not correctly migrated to the newly introduced
  user.cfg configuration files. This could possibly prevent system
  administrators from changing grub2 configuration during system boot even if
  they provided the correct password. This update corrects the password
  migration script and the incorrectly generated user.cfg file. (BZ#1290089)

  All grub2 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. For this update to take
  effect on BIOS-based machines, grub2 needs to be reinstalled as documented
  in the "Reinstalling GRUB 2 on BIOS-Based Machines" section of the Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 7 System Administrator's Guide linked to in the References
  section. No manual action is needed on UEFI-based machines.
