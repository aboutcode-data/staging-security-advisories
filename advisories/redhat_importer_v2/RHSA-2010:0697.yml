  - CVE-2010-3069
summary: |
  Updated samba packages that fix one security issue and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5, and Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 4.7, 5.3, and 5.4 Extended Update Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Samba is a suite of programs used by machines to share files, printers, and
  other information.

  A missing array boundary checking flaw was found in the way Samba parsed
  the binary representation of Windows security identifiers (SIDs). A
  malicious client could send a specially-crafted SMB request to the Samba
  server, resulting in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the
  Samba server (smbd). (CVE-2010-3069)

  For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, this update also fixes the following bug:

  * Previously, the restorecon utility was required during the installation
  of the samba-common package. As a result, attempting to update samba
  without this utility installed may have failed with the following error:

  /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.[xxxxx]: line 7: restorecon: command not found

  With this update, the utility is only used when it is already present on
  the system, and the package is now always updated as expected. (BZ#629602)

  Users of Samba are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues. After installing this update, the smb service will be
  restarted automatically.
