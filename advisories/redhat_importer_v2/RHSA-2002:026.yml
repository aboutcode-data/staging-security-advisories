summary: "[Update 20 Mar 2002:\nAdded kernel packages for Red Hat Linux 6.2 on sparc64.  Updated\
  \ VNC\npackages as the previous fix caused another denial of service\nvulnerability; thanks\
  \ to Const Kaplinsky for reporting this]\n\n[Update 14 Mar 2002: \nUpdated kernel packages\
  \ for Red Hat Linux 6.2 and 7.0 which were missing \nthe zlib fix; added missing kernel-headers\
  \ package for 6.2.]\n \nThe zlib library provides in-memory compression/decompression \nfunctions.\
  \ The library is widely used throughout Linux and other \noperating \nsystems. \n \nWhile\
  \ performing tests on the gdk-pixbuf library, Matthias Clasen created \nan invalid PNG image\
  \ that caused libpng to crash. Upon further \ninvestigation, this turned out to be a bug in\
  \ zlib 1.1.3 where certain \ntypes of input will cause zlib to free the same area of memory\
  \ twice \n(called a \"double free\"). \n \nThis bug can be used to crash any program that\
  \ takes untrusted \ncompressed input. Web browsers or email programs that \ndisplay image\
  \ attachments or other programs that uncompress data are \nparticularly affected. This vulnerability\
  \ makes it easy to perform \nvarious \ndenial-of-service attacks against such programs.  \n\
  \ \nIt is also possible that an attacker could manage a more significant \nexploit, since\
  \ the result of a double free is the corruption of the \nmalloc() implementation's data structures.\
  \ This could include running \narbitrary code on local or remote systems. \n \nMost packages\
  \ in Red Hat Linux use the shared zlib library and can be \nprotected against vulnerability\
  \ by updating to the errata zlib \npackage. However, we have identified a number of packages\
  \ in Red Hat \nLinux that either statically link to zlib or contain an internal \nversion\
  \ of zlib code. \n \nAlthough no exploits for this issue or these packages are currently \n\
  known to exist, this is a serious vulnerability which could be \nlocally or remotely exploited.\
  \ All users should upgrade affected packages \nimmediately. \n \nAdditionally, if you have\
  \ any programs that you have compiled yourself, \nyou should check to see if they use zlib.\
  \ If they link to the shared \nzlib library then they will not be vulnerable once the shared\
  \ zlib \nlibrary is updated to the errata package. However, if any programs that \ndecompress\
  \ arbitrary data statically link to zlib or use their own \nversion \nof the zlib code internally,\
  \ then they need to be patched or \nrecompiled.\n\nThe following details apply to the main\
  \ Red Hat Linux distribution\nonly. Please see advisory RHSA-2002:027 for Powertools packages.\n\
  \ncvs: cvs is a version control system. The cvs package has been rebuilt to\nlink against\
  \ the shared system zlib instead of the internal version. \n\nAdditionally, cvs has been updated\
  \ to version 1.11.1p1 for Red Hat Linux\n6.2, 7.0 and 7.1 which also corrects a possible security\
  \ vulnerability due\nto an improperly initialized global variable. (CAN-2002-0092)\n\ndump:\
  \ The dump package contains programs for backing up and restoring\nfilesystems.  It links\
  \ statically to zlib and has been rebuilt\nagainst the errata zlib package.  Red Hat Linux\
  \ 7, 7.1, and 7.2\npackages have also been upgraded to dump-0.4b25, which includes\nmany non-security\
  \ fixes.\n\ngcc3: The gcc3 package contains the GNU Compiler Collection version\n3.0. It has\
  \ been updated to version 3.0.4 and patched to link against\nthe system zlib instead of the\
  \ internal version.\n\nlibgcj: The libgcj package includes the Java runtime library, which\
  \ is\nneeded to run Java programs compiled using the gcc Java compiler\n(gcj).  libgcj has\
  \ been patched to use the shared system zlib.\n\nkernel: The Linux kernel internally contains\
  \ several variants of zlib \ncode. However, ppp compression is the only implementation that\
  \ is used with\nuntrusted data streams.  This issue has been patched.  New kernel errata\n\
  packages are included for Red Hat Linux 6.2 and 7.  \n\nUsers of Red Hat Linux 7.1, or 7.2\
  \ should update to the currently\nreleased kernel errata RHSA-2002-028 (2.4.9-31) which already\
  \ contains this\nfix.\n\nNetscape Navigator: Users are advised to obtain an update from Netscape.\n\
  \nrsync: rsync is a program for synchronizing files over a network.\nrsync uses a modified\
  \ version of zlib internally. These errata\npackages patch this internal version of zlib.\n\
  \nThe rsync update package also fixes another security issue where rsync did\nnot call setgroups()\
  \ before dropping the privileges of the connecting user.\nHence, it is possible for users\
  \ to retain the group IDs of any supplemental\ngroups that rsync was started in (for example,\
  \ supplementary groups of the\nroot user), allowing users to access files they may not otherwise\
  \ be able\nto access.  Thanks to Martin Pool and Andrew Tridgell for alerting us to\nthis\
  \ issue. CAN-2002-0080.\n\nVNC: VNC is a remote display system in Powertools 6.2.  VNC has\
  \ been\npatched to use the system zlib library.  \n\nIn addition, there is a small HTTP server\
  \ implementation in the VNC server\nwhich can be made to wait indefinitely for input, thereby\
  \ freezing an\nactive VNC session. The VNC packages recommended by this advisory have\nbeen\
  \ patched to fix this issue. Users of VNC should be aware that the\nprogram is designed for\
  \ use on a trusted network.\n\nzlib: The zlib library has been updated with a patch to fix\
  \ the\naforementioned vulnerability."
