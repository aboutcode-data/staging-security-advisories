  - CVE-2017-15041
  - CVE-2017-15042
summary: |
  An update for go-toolset-7 and go-toolset-7-golang is now available for Red Hat Developer Tools.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Go Toolset provides the Go programming language tools and libraries. Go is alternatively known as golang.

  Security Fix(es):

  * An arbitrary command execution flaw was found in the way Go's "go get" command handled the checkout of source code repositories. A remote attacker capable of hosting malicious repositories could potentially use this flaw to cause arbitrary command execution on the client side. (CVE-2017-15041)

  * It was found that smtp.PlainAuth authentication scheme in Go did not verify the TLS requirement properly. A remote man-in-the-middle attacker could potentially use this flaw to sniff SMTP credentials sent by a Go application. (CVE-2017-15042)

  Bug Fix(es):

  * Previously, the enable script for the go-toolset-7 Software Collection incorrectly set the GOPATH environment variable to a directory that required root permissions for write operations. As a consequence, the go compiler terminated unexpectedly when performing certain commands. The enable script has been changed to handle GOPATH correctly, and the described problem no longer occurs. (BZ#1512013)
