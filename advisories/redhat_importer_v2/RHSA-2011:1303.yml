  - CVE-2011-1483
summary: |
  An updated jbossws-common package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.1.1 for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 4, 5, and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The jbossws-common package provides JBoss Web Services Native, a web
  service framework included as part of JBoss Enterprise Web Platform. It
  implements the JAX-WS specification.

  It was found that JBoss Web Services Native did not properly protect
  against recursive entity resolution when processing Document Type
  Definitions (DTD). A remote attacker could exploit this flaw by sending a
  specially-crafted HTTP POST request to a deployed web service, causing
  excessive CPU and memory consumption on the system hosting that service. If
  the attack is repeated to consume all available network sockets, the server
  will become unavailable. This flaw did not affect systems using JBoss Web
  Services CXF (provided by jbossas-ws-cxf-ewp). (CVE-2011-1483)

  Warning: Before applying this update, please back up your JBoss Enterprise
  Web Platform's "jboss-as-web/server/[PROFILE]/deploy/" directory, along
  with all other customized configuration files.

  Users of JBoss Web Services Native should upgrade to this updated package,
  which corrects this issue. The JBoss server process must be restarted for
  this update to take effect.
