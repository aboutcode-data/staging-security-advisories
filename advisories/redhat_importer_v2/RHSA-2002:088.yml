summary: |
  Updated ethereal packages are available which fix several security problems.

  Ethereal is a package designed for monitoring network traffic on your
  system.  Several security issues have been found in Ethereal:

  Due to improper string and error handling in Ethereal's ASN.1 parser, it is
  possible for a malformed SNMP or LDAP packet to cause a memory allocation
  or buffer overrun error in Ethereal versions before 0.9.2 (CAN-2002-0013
  CAN-2002-0012)

  The ASN.1 parser in Ethereal 0.9.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to
  cause a denial of service (crash) via a certain malformed packet, which
  causes Ethereal to allocate memory incorrectly, possibly due to zero-length
  fields. (CAN-2002-0353)

  The SMB dissector in Ethereal prior to version 0.9.2 allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code
  via malformed packets that cause Ethereal to dereference a NULL pointer.
  (CAN-2002-0401)

  A buffer overflow in X11 dissector in Ethereal before 0.9.3 allows
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly
  execute arbitrary code while Ethereal is parsing keysyms. (CAN-2002-0402)

  The DNS dissector in Ethereal before 0.9.3 allows remote attackers to
  cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a malformed packet
  that causes Ethereal to enter an infinite loop. (CAN-2002-0403)

  A vulnerability in GIOP dissector in Ethereal before 0.9.3 allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption). (CAN-2002-0404)

  Users of Ethereal should update to the errata packages containing Ethereal
  version 0.9.4 which is not vulnerable to these issues.
