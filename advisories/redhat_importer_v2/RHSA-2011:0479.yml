  - CVE-2011-1486
summary: |
  Updated libvirt packages that fix one security issue and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The libvirt library is a C API for managing and interacting with the
  virtualization capabilities of Linux and other operating systems. In
  addition, libvirt provides tools for remotely managing virtualized systems.

  A flaw was found in the way libvirtd handled error reporting for concurrent
  connections. A remote attacker able to establish read-only connections to
  libvirtd on a server could use this flaw to crash libvirtd. (CVE-2011-1486)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * Previously, running qemu under a different UID prevented it from
  accessing files with mode 0660 permissions that were owned by a different
  user, but by a group that qemu was a member of. (BZ#668692)

  All libvirt users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing the
  updated packages, libvirtd must be restarted ("service libvirtd restart")
  for this update to take effect.
