  - CVE-2022-47950
summary: |
  An update for openstack-swift is now available for Red Hat OpenStack
  Platform 17.0 (Wallaby).

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact
  of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  OpenStack Object Storage (swift) aggregates commodity servers to
   work together in clusters for reliable, redundant, and large-scale storage
  of static objects. Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the
  data center, with the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data
  replication and integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale
  horizontally by adding new nodes, which are automatically configured.
  Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its content from other
  active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to ensure data
  replication and distribution across different devices, inexpensive
  commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more expensive
  equipment.

  Security Fix(es):

  * Arbitrary file access through custom S3 XML entities (CVE-2022-47950)
