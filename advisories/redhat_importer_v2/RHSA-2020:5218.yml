  \ is now available for Red Hat Virtualization 4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.\n\nRed Hat\
  \ Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common\
  \ Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating,\
  \ is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.\n\n\
  The redhat-virtualization-host packages provide the Red Hat Virtualization Host. These packages\
  \ include redhat-release-virtualization-host, ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor. Red Hat Virtualization\
  \ Hosts (RHVH) are installed using a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the\
  \ packages required to host virtual machines. RHVH features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring\
  \ the host's resources and performing administrative tasks.\n\nThe redhat-virtualization-host\
  \ packages provide the Red Hat Virtualization Host. These packages include redhat-release-virtualization-host,\
  \ ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor. Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are installed using\
  \ a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the packages required to host virtual\
  \ machines. RHVH features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host's resources and\
  \ performing administrative tasks. \n\nThe ovirt-node-ng packages provide the Red Hat Virtualization\
  \ Host. These packages include redhat-release-virtualization-host, ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor.\
  \ Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are installed using a special build of Red Hat Enterprise\
  \ Linux with only the packages required to host virtual machines. RHVH features a Cockpit\
  \ user interface for monitoring the host's resources and performing administrative tasks.\n\
  \nThe following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: imgbased (1.2.13),\
  \ redhat-release-virtualization-host (4.4.3), redhat-virtualization-host (4.4.3). (BZ#1814517,\

  \ to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\n* [security] gnutls_set_default_priority()\
  \ (and thus Cockpit logins) fails when selecting VPP profile during RHVH installation (BZ#1835661)\n\
  \n* Unable to upgrade from rhvh 4.4.1 to 4.4.2 as block storage domains are detected as local\
  \ storage domains. (BZ#1886647)\n\n* Failed to install RHVH 4.4.3 due to missing Lvm ThinPool\
  \ (BZ#1886695)"
