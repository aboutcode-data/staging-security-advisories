summary: |
  JBoss Operations Network 3.0.1, which fixes multiple security issues and
  several bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  JBoss Operations Network (JBoss ON) is a middleware management solution
  that provides a single point of control to deploy, manage, and monitor
  JBoss Enterprise Middleware, applications, and services.

  This JBoss ON 3.0.1 release serves as a replacement for JBoss ON 3.0.0, and
  includes several bug fixes. Refer to the JBoss ON 3.0.1 Release Notes for
  information on the most significant of these changes. The Release Notes
  will be available shortly from
  https://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/index.html

  The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

  JBoss ON did not properly verify security tokens, allowing an unapproved
  agent to connect as an approved agent. A remote attacker could use this
  flaw to spoof the identity of an approved agent, allowing them to hijack
  the approved agent's session and steal its security token. As a result,
  the attacker could retrieve sensitive data about the server the hijacked
  agent was running on, including JMX credentials. (CVE-2012-0052)

  JBoss ON sometimes allowed agent registration to succeed when the
  registration request did not include a security token. This is a feature
  designed to add convenience. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  spoof the identity of an approved agent and pass a null security token,
  allowing them to hijack the approved agent's session, and steal its
  security token. As a result, the attacker could retrieve sensitive data
  about the server the hijacked agent was running on, including JMX
  credentials. (CVE-2012-0062)

  A flaw was found in the way LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
  authentication was handled. If the LDAP bind account credentials became
  invalid, subsequent log in attempts with any password for user accounts
  created via LDAP were successful. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  log into LDAP-based JBoss ON accounts without knowing the correct
  passwords. (CVE-2012-1100)

  It was found that the Java hashCode() method implementation was susceptible
  to predictable hash collisions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  cause JBoss Web to use an excessive amount of CPU time by sending an HTTP
  request with a large number of parameters whose names map to the same hash
  value. This update introduces a limit on the number of parameters and
  headers processed per request to mitigate this issue. The default limit is
  512 for parameters and 128 for headers. These defaults can be changed by
  setting the org.apache.tomcat.util.http.Parameters.MAX_COUNT and
  org.apache.tomcat.util.http.MimeHeaders.MAX_COUNT system properties in
  "server/$PROFILE/deploy/properties-service.xml". (CVE-2011-4858)

  It was found that after installing the remote client (by extracting
  rhq-remoting-cli-[version].zip), its root directory had world read, write,
  and execute permissions. This allowed the attributes of the child
  directories and their files to be modified. A local attacker could use this
  flaw to steal the JBoss ON credentials of a user running the remote client,
  or trick them into running arbitrary code. The remote client is typically
  used by privileged JBoss ON users. (CVE-2012-0032)

  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting CVE-2011-4858. oCERT
  acknowledges Julian Wälde and Alexander Klink as the original reporters of
  CVE-2011-4858.

  Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss ON
  installation (including its databases, applications, configuration files,
  the JBoss ON server's file system directory, and so on).

  All users of JBoss Operations Network 3.0.0 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Operations Network 3.0.1.
