summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs,
  and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * A use-after-free flaw was found in the way the ping_init_sock() function
  of the Linux kernel handled the group_info reference counter. A local,
  unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially,
  escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2014-2851, Important)

  * A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the
  futex_wait_requeue_pi() function of the Linux kernel's futex subsystem
  handled the requeuing of certain Priority Inheritance (PI) futexes.
  A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system.
  (CVE-2012-6647, Moderate)

  * A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the rds_ib_laddr_check()
  function in the Linux kernel's implementation of Reliable Datagram Sockets
  (RDS). A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system.
  (CVE-2013-7339, Moderate)

  * It was found that a remote attacker could use a race condition flaw in
  the ath_tx_aggr_sleep() function to crash the system by creating large
  network traffic on the system's Atheros 9k wireless network adapter.
  (CVE-2014-2672, Moderate)

  * A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the rds_iw_laddr_check()
  function in the Linux kernel's implementation of Reliable Datagram Sockets
  (RDS). A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system.
  (CVE-2014-2678, Moderate)

  * A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's mac80211
  subsystem implementation handled synchronization between TX and STA wake-up
  code paths. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system.
  (CVE-2014-2706, Moderate)

  * An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the Netlink Attribute
  extension of the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) interpreter functionality in
  the Linux kernel's networking implementation. A local, unprivileged user
  could use this flaw to crash the system or leak kernel memory to user space
  via a specially crafted socket filter. (CVE-2014-3144, CVE-2014-3145,
  Moderate)

  This update also fixes several bugs and adds one enhancement.
  Documentation for these changes will be available shortly from the
  Technical Notes document linked to in the References section.

  All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues and add this
  enhancement. The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.
