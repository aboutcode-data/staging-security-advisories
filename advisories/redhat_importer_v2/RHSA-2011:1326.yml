  - CVE-2011-3193
summary: |
  Updated pango packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Pango is a library used for the layout and rendering of internationalized
  text.

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in HarfBuzz, an OpenType text shaping
  engine used in Pango. If a user loaded a specially-crafted font file with
  an application that uses Pango, it could cause the application to crash or,
  possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  the application. (CVE-2011-3193)

  Users of pango are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to resolve this issue. After installing this
  update, you must restart your system or restart the X server for the update
  to take effect.
