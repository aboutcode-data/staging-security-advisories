  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 reaches end of Production Phase and transitions
  to Extended Life Phase.

  On March 01, 2012, all Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4-based products listed
  below transition from the Production Phase to the Extended Life Phase:

  Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS 4
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES 4
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux WS 4
  Red Hat Desktop 4
  Red Hat Global File System 4
  Red Hat Cluster Suite 4

  Red Hat offers support and services for each major release of Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux throughout four phases – Production 1, 2, and 3, and
  Extended Life Phase. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, the Production Phase
  spans seven years, followed by a three-year Extended Life Phase. Together,
  these four phases constitute the "life cycle". The specific support and
  services provided during each phase is described in detail at:
  http://redhat.com/rhel/lifecycle

  On March 01, 2012, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 systems continue to be
  subscribed to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 channels on Red Hat Network
  (RHN), continue to require a Red Hat Enterprise Linux entitlement, and
  continue to have access to:

  * Limited technical support for existing Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4
    deployments (for customers with Basic, Premium, or Standard support).

  * Previously released bug fixes (RHBAs), security errata (RHSAs), and
    product enhancements (RHEAs) via RHN. Software maintenance (new bug fix
    and security errata) are no longer provided for the Red Hat Enterprise
    Linux 4 product family.

  * Red Hat Knowledgebase and other content (white papers, reference
    architectures, etc.) found in the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 documentation.

  Please also note that new bug fix, security, or product enhancements
  advisories (RHBAs, RHSAs, and RHEAs) are no longer provided for the Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Add-Ons after March 01.

  After March 01, you have several options. Your Red Hat subscription gives
  you continuous access to all active versions of the Red Hat software in
  both binary and source form, including all security updates and bug fixes.
  As Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 transitions out of the Production Phase, we
  strongly recommend that you take full advantage of your subscription
  services and upgrade to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 or 6, which contain
  compelling new features and enablement for modern hardware platforms and
  ISV applications.

  If you must remain on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, we recommend that you
  add the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Extended Life Cycle Support (ELS) Add-On
  subscription to your current Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription. The
  ELS Add-On complements your Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription and
  provides software maintenance services not otherwise available in the
  Extended Life Phase. Customers who purchase the ELS Add-On continue to
  receive software maintenance (critical impact security and urgent priority
  bug fixes) and technical support as provided in the Production 3 Phase.
  ELS is available for up to three years and requires that you have an
  existing Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription with equivalent
  subscription terms and support level.
