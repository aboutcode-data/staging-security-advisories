  - CVE-2012-3412
summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix one security issue and three bugs are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.1 Extended Update Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issue:

  * A flaw was found in the way socket buffers (skb) requiring TSO (TCP
  segment offloading) were handled by the sfc driver. If the skb did not fit
  within the minimum-size of the transmission queue, the network card could
  repeatedly reset itself. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a
  denial of service. (CVE-2012-3412, Important)

  Red Hat would like to thank Ben Hutchings of Solarflare (tm) for reporting
  this issue.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * In the hpet_next_event() function, an interrupt could have occurred
  between the read and write of the HPET (High Precision Event Timer) and the
  value of HPET_COUNTER was then beyond that being written to the comparator
  (HPET_Tn_CMP). Consequently, the timers were overdue for up to several
  minutes. Now, a comparison is performed between the value of the counter
  and the comparator in the HPET code. If the counter is beyond the
  comparator, the "-ETIME" error code is returned, which fixes this bug.
  (BZ#855280)

  * Traffic to the NFS server could trigger a kernel oops in the
  svc_tcp_clear_pages() function. The source code has been modified, and the
  kernel oops no longer occurs in this scenario. (BZ#856104)

  * A kernel oops occurred in the nf_nat code when a bogus pointer was
  dereferenced in the nf_conn_nat structure. Consequently, if Source Network
  Address Translation (SNAT) was performed, incorrect information could be
  received by other CTS (Clear to Send) signals. A conntrack entry is now
  placed in the source hash after SNAT has been completed, which prevents the
  described problems. (BZ#865714)

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
  patches to resolve these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
  update to take effect.
