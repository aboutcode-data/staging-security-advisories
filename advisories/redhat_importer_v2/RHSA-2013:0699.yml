  - CVE-2013-1854
summary: |
  Updated ruby193-rubygem-activerecord packages that fix one security issue
  are now available for Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.1.3.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Ruby on Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework for web
  application development. Active Record implements object-relational mapping
  for accessing database entries using objects.

  A flaw was found in the way hashes were handled in certain queries. A
  remote attacker could use this flaw to perform a denial of service
  (resource consumption) attack by sending specially-crafted queries that
  would result in the creation of Ruby symbols, which were never garbage
  collected. (CVE-2013-1854)

  Red Hat would like to thank Ruby on Rails upstream for reporting this
  issue. Upstream acknowledges Ben Murphy as the original reporter.

  Users of Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.1.3 are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages, which correct this issue.
