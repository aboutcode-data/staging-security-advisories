  - CVE-2008-3916
summary: |
  An updated ed package that fixes one security issue is now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, 4 and 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  ed is a line-oriented text editor, used to create, display, and modify
  text files (both interactively and via shell scripts).

  A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in the way ed, the GNU line
  editor, processed long file names. An attacker could create a file with a
  specially-crafted name that could possibly execute an arbitrary code when
  opened in the ed editor. (CVE-2008-3916)

  Users of ed should upgrade to this updated package, which contains
  a backported patch to resolve this issue.
