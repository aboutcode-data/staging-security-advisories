summary: |
  Updated php53 and php packages that fix several security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 respectively.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
  HTTP Server.

  A signedness issue was found in the way the PHP crypt() function handled
  8-bit characters in passwords when using Blowfish hashing. Up to three
  characters immediately preceding a non-ASCII character (one with the high
  bit set) had no effect on the hash result, thus shortening the effective
  password length. This made brute-force guessing more efficient as several
  different passwords were hashed to the same value. (CVE-2011-2483)

  Note: Due to the CVE-2011-2483 fix, after installing this update some users
  may not be able to log in to PHP applications that hash passwords with
  Blowfish using the PHP crypt() function. Refer to the upstream
  "CRYPT_BLOWFISH security fix details" document, linked to in the
  References, for details.

  An insufficient input validation flaw, leading to a buffer over-read, was
  found in the PHP exif extension. A specially-crafted image file could cause
  the PHP interpreter to crash when a PHP script tries to extract
  Exchangeable image file format (Exif) metadata from the image file.
  (CVE-2011-0708)

  An integer overflow flaw was found in the PHP calendar extension. A remote
  attacker able to make a PHP script call SdnToJulian() with a large value
  could cause the PHP interpreter to crash. (CVE-2011-1466)

  Multiple memory leak flaws were found in the PHP OpenSSL extension. A
  remote attacker able to make a PHP script use openssl_encrypt() or
  openssl_decrypt() repeatedly could cause the PHP interpreter to use an
  excessive amount of memory. (CVE-2011-1468)

  A use-after-free flaw was found in the PHP substr_replace() function. If a
  PHP script used the same variable as multiple function arguments, a remote
  attacker could possibly use this to crash the PHP interpreter or, possibly,
  execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2011-1148)

  A bug in the PHP Streams component caused the PHP interpreter to crash if
  an FTP wrapper connection was made through an HTTP proxy. A remote attacker
  could possibly trigger this issue if a PHP script accepted an untrusted URL
  to connect to. (CVE-2011-1469)

  An integer signedness issue was found in the PHP zip extension. An attacker
  could use a specially-crafted ZIP archive to cause the PHP interpreter to
  use an excessive amount of CPU time until the script execution time limit
  is reached. (CVE-2011-1471)

  A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the PHP socket
  extension handled long AF_UNIX socket addresses. An attacker able to make a
  PHP script connect to a long AF_UNIX socket address could use this flaw to
  crash the PHP interpreter. (CVE-2011-1938)

  An off-by-one flaw was found in PHP. If an attacker uploaded a file with a
  specially-crafted file name it could cause a PHP script to attempt to write
  a file to the root (/) directory. By default, PHP runs as the "apache"
  user, preventing it from writing to the root directory. (CVE-2011-2202)

  All php53 and php users should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing the
  updated packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to take
  effect.
