aliases:
  - CVE-2009-3608
  - CVE-2009-3609
summary: |
  Updated cups packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) provides a portable printing layer
  for UNIX operating systems. The CUPS "pdftops" filter converts Portable
  Document Format (PDF) files to PostScript.

  Two integer overflow flaws were found in the CUPS "pdftops" filter. An
  attacker could create a malicious PDF file that would cause "pdftops" to
  crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the "lp" user if the file
  was printed. (CVE-2009-3608, CVE-2009-3609)

  Red Hat would like to thank Chris Rohlf for reporting the CVE-2009-3608
  issue.

  Users of cups are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct these issues. After installing the
  update, the cupsd daemon will be restarted automatically.
