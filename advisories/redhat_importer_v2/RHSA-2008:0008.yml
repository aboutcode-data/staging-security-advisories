summary: "Updated Apache httpd packages that fix several security issues are now\navailable\
  \ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security\
  \ impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nThe Apache HTTP Server is a popular Web\
  \ server.\n\nA flaw was found in the mod_imagemap module. On sites where mod_imagemap\nwas\
  \ enabled and an imagemap file was publicly available, a cross-site\nscripting attack was\
  \ possible. (CVE-2007-5000)\n\nA flaw was found in the mod_autoindex module. On sites where\
  \ directory\nlistings are used, and the \"AddDefaultCharset\" directive has been removed\n\
  from the configuration, a cross-site scripting attack might have been\npossible against Web\
  \ browsers which do not correctly derive the response\ncharacter set following the rules in\
  \ RFC 2616. (CVE-2007-4465)\n\nA flaw was found in the mod_status module. On sites where mod_status\
  \ was\nenabled and the status pages were publicly available, a cross-site\nscripting attack\
  \ was possible. (CVE-2007-6388)\n\nA flaw was found in the mod_proxy_balancer module. On sites\
  \ where\nmod_proxy_balancer was enabled, a cross-site scripting attack against an\nauthorized\
  \ user was possible. (CVE-2007-6421)\n\nA flaw was found in the mod_proxy_balancer module.\
  \ On sites where\nmod_proxy_balancer was enabled, an authorized user could send a carefully\n\
  crafted request that would cause the Apache child process handling that\nrequest to crash.\
  \ This could lead to a denial of service if using a\nthreaded Multi-Processing Module. (CVE-2007-6422)\
  \ \n\nA flaw was found in the mod_proxy_ftp module. On sites where mod_proxy_ftp\nwas enabled\
  \ and a forward proxy was configured, a cross-site scripting\nattack was possible against\
  \ Web browsers which do not correctly derive the\nresponse character set following the rules\
  \ in RFC 2616. (CVE-2008-0005)\n\nUsers of Apache httpd should upgrade to these updated packages,\
  \ which\ncontain backported patches to resolve these issues. Users should restart\nhttpd after\
  \ installing this update."
