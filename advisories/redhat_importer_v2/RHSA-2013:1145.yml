summary: |
  This is the final notification for the retirement of Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 5.6 Extended Update Support (EUS).

  In accordance with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Errata Support Policy,
  Extended Update Support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 is retired as of
  August 7, 2013, and support is no longer provided. Accordingly, Red Hat
  will no longer provide updated packages after the final errata release,
  including critical impact security patches or urgent priority bug fixes,
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 EUS after this date. In addition,
  technical support through Red Hat's Global Support Services will no longer
  be provided after August 7, 2013.

  Note: This notification applies only to those customers subscribed to the
  Extended Update Support (EUS) channel for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6.

  We encourage customers to plan their migration from Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 5.6 to a more recent version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 or 6. As
  a benefit of the Red Hat subscription model, customers can use their active
  subscriptions to entitle any system on a currently supported Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 5 release (5.9, for which EUS is available) or Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 6 release (6.2, 6.3, or 6.4, for which EUS is available).
