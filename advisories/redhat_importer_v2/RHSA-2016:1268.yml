  - CVE-2016-4428
summary: |
  An update for python-django-horizon is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 (Icehouse) for RHEL 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon) provides administrators and users with a
  graphical interface to access, provision, and automate cloud-based
  resources.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A DOM-based, cross-site scripting vulnerability was found in the OpenStack dashboard, where user input was not filtered correctly. An authenticated dashboard user could exploit the flaw by injecting an AngularJS template into a dashboard form (for example, using an image's description), triggering the vulnerability when another user browsed the affected page. As a result, this flaw could result in user accounts being compromised (for example, user-access credentials being stolen). (CVE-2016-4428)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Beth Lancaster (Virginia Tech) and Brandon Sawyers (Virginia Tech) as the original reporters.
