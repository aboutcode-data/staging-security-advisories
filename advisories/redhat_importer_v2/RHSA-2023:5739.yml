summary: |
  An update for java-11-openjdk is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 Advanced Update Support, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 Telecommunications Update Service, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 Update Services for SAP Solutions.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The java-11-openjdk packages provide the OpenJDK 11 Java Runtime Environment and the OpenJDK 11 Java Software Development Kit.

  Security Fix(es):

  * OpenJDK: certificate path validation issue during client authentication (8309966) (CVE-2023-22081)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

  Bug Fix(es):

  * Additional validity checks in the handling of Zip64 files, JDK-8302483, were introduced in the 11.0.20 release of OpenJDK, causing the use of some valid zip files to now fail with an error. This release, 11.0.20.1, allows for zero-length headers and additional padding produced by some Zip64 creation tools. With both releases, the checks can be disabled using -Djdk.util.zip.disableZip64ExtraFieldValidation=true. (RHBZ#2237173)

  * A maximum signature file size property, jdk.jar.maxSignatureFileSize, was introduced in the 11.0.20 release of OpenJDK by JDK-8300596, with a default of 8 MB. This default proved to be too small for some JAR files. This release, 11.0.20.1, increases it to 16 MB.

  * The serviceability agent would print an exception when encountering null addresses while producing thread dumps. These null values are now handled appropriately. (JDK-8243210, RHEL-2760)

  * The /usr/bin/jfr alternative is now owned by the java-11-openjdk package (RHEL-13556)

  * The jcmd tool is now provided by the java-11-openjdk-headless package, rather than java-11-openjdk-devel, to make it more accessible (RHEL-13563)
