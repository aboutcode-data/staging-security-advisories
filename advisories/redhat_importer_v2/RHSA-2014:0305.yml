summary: |
  Updated samba packages that fix three security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Samba is an open-source implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) or
  Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol, which allows PC-compatible
  machines to share files, printers, and other information.

  It was discovered that the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) did not
  protect against being opened in a web page frame. A remote attacker could
  possibly use this flaw to conduct a clickjacking attack against SWAT users
  or users with an active SWAT session. (CVE-2013-0213)

  A flaw was found in the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection
  mechanism implemented in SWAT. An attacker with the knowledge of a victim's
  password could use this flaw to bypass CSRF protections and conduct a CSRF
  attack against the victim SWAT user. (CVE-2013-0214)

  An integer overflow flaw was found in the way Samba handled an Extended
  Attribute (EA) list provided by a client. A malicious client could send a
  specially crafted EA list that triggered an overflow, causing the server to
  loop and reprocess the list using an excessive amount of memory.
  (CVE-2013-4124)

  Note: This issue did not affect the default configuration of the Samba
  server.

  Red Hat would like to thank the Samba project for reporting CVE-2013-0213
  and CVE-2013-0214. Upstream acknowledges Jann Horn as the original reporter
  of CVE-2013-0213 and CVE-2013-0214.

  All users of Samba are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing this
  update, the smb service will be restarted automatically.
