summary: |
  Updated packages for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 which fix
  one security issue are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5,
  and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java applications,
  which integrates the JBoss Application Server with JBoss Hibernate and
  JBoss Seam.

  XML encryption backwards compatibility attacks were found against various
  frameworks, including Apache CXF. An attacker could force a server to use
  insecure, legacy cryptosystems, even when secure cryptosystems were enabled
  on endpoints. By forcing the use of legacy cryptosystems, flaws such as
  CVE-2011-1096 and CVE-2011-2487 would be exposed, allowing plain text to be
  recovered from cryptograms and symmetric keys. This issue affected both the
  JBoss Web Services CXF (jbossws-cxf) and JBoss Web Services Native
  (jbossws-native) stacks. (CVE-2012-5575)

  Red Hat would like to thank Tibor Jager, Kenneth G. Paterson and Juraj
  Somorovsky of Ruhr-University Bochum for reporting this issue.

  If you are using jbossws-cxf, then automatic checks to prevent this flaw
  are only run when WS-SecurityPolicy is used to enforce security
  requirements. It is best practice to use WS-SecurityPolicy to enforce
  security requirements.

  If you are using jbossws-native, the fix for this flaw is implemented by
  two new configuration parameters in the 'encryption' element. This element
  can be a child of 'requires' in both client and server wsse configuration
  descriptors (set on a per-application basis via the application's
  jboss-wsse-server.xml and jboss-wsse-client.xml files). The new attributes
  are 'algorithms' and 'keyWrapAlgorithms'. These attributes should contain a
  blank space or comma separated list of algorithm IDs that are allowed for
  the encrypted incoming message, both for encryption and private key
  wrapping. For backwards compatibility, no algorithm checks are performed by
  default for empty lists or missing attributes.

  For example (do not include the line break in your configuration):

  encryption algorithms="aes-192-gcm aes-256-gcm"
  keyWrapAlgorithms="rsa_oaep"

  Specifies that incoming messages are required to be encrypted, and that the
  only permitted encryption algorithms are AES-192 and 256 in GCM mode, and
  RSA-OAEP only for key wrapping.

  Before performing any decryption, the jbossws-native stack will verify that
  each algorithm specified in the incoming messages is included in the
  allowed algorithms lists from these new encryption element attributes. The
  algorithm values to be used for 'algorithms' and 'keyWrapAlgorithms' are
  the same as for 'algorithm' and 'keyWrapAlgorithm' in the 'encrypt'
  element.

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss
  Enterprise Application Platform installation (including all applications
  and configuration files).

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 on Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6 are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages. The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take
  effect.
