  - CVE-2011-1773
summary: |
  An updated virt-v2v package that fixes one security issue and several bugs
  is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  virt-v2v is a tool for converting and importing virtual machines to
  libvirt-managed KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine), or Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization.

  Using virt-v2v to convert a guest that has a password-protected VNC console
  to a KVM guest removed that password protection from the converted guest:
  after conversion, a password was not required to access the converted
  guest's VNC console. Now, converted guests will require the same VNC
  console password as the original guest. Note that when converting a guest
  to run on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization, virt-v2v will display a
  warning that VNC passwords are not supported. (CVE-2011-1773)

  Note: The Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 perl-Sys-Virt update must also be
  installed to correct CVE-2011-1773.

  Bug fixes:

  * When converting a guest virtual machine (VM), whose name contained
  certain characters, virt-v2v would create a converted guest with a
  corrupted name. Now, virt-v2v will not corrupt guest names. (BZ#665883)

  * There were numerous usability issues when running virt-v2v as a non-root
  user. This update makes it simpler to run virt-v2v as a non-root user.
  (BZ#671094)

  * virt-v2v failed to convert a Microsoft Windows guest with Windows
  Recovery Console installed in a separate partition. Now, virt-v2v will
  successfully convert a guest with Windows Recovery Console installed in a
  separate partition by ignoring that partition. (BZ#673066)

  * virt-v2v failed to convert a Red Hat Enterprise Linux guest which did not
  have the symlink "/boot/grub/menu.lst". With this update, virt-v2v can
  select a grub configuration file from several places. (BZ#694364)

  * This update removes information about the usage of deprecated command
  line options in the virt-v2v man page. (BZ#694370)

  * virt-v2v would fail to correctly change the allocation policy, (sparse or
  preallocated) when converting a guest with QCOW2 image format. The error
  message "Cannot import VM, The selected disk configuration is not
  supported" was displayed. With this update, allocation policy changes to a
  guest with QCOW2 storage will work correctly. (BZ#696089)

  * The options "--network" and "--bridge" can not be used in conjunction
  when converting a guest, but no error message was displayed. With this
  update, virt-v2v will now display an error message if the mutually
  exclusive "--network" and "--bridge" command line options are both
  specified. (BZ#700759)

  * virt-v2v failed to convert a multi-boot guest, and did not clean up
  temporary storage and mount points after failure. With this update,
  virt-v2v will prompt for which operating system to convert from a
  multi-boot guest, and will correctly clean up if the process fails.
  (BZ#702007)

  * virt-v2v failed to correctly configure modprobe aliases when converting a
  VMware ESX guest with VMware Tools installed. With this update, modprobe
  aliases will be correctly configured. (BZ#707261)

  * When converting a guest with preallocated raw storage using the
  libvirtxml input method, virt-v2v failed with the erroneous error message
  "size(X) < usage(Y)". This update removes this erroneous error. (BZ#727489)

  * When converting a Red Hat Enterprise Linux guest, virt-v2v did not check
  that the Cirrus X driver was available before configuring it. With this
  update, virt-v2v will attempt to install the Cirrus X driver if it is
  required. (BZ#708961)

  * VirtIO systems do not support the Windows Recovery Console on 32-bit
  Windows XP. The virt-v2v man page has been updated to note this. On Windows
  XP Professional x64 Edition, however, if Windows Recovery Console is
  re-installed after conversion, it will work as expected. (BZ#732421)

  * Placing comments in the guest fstab file by means of the leading "#"
  symbol caused an "unknown filesystem" error after conversion of a guest.
  With this update comments can now be used and error messages will not be
  displayed. (BZ#677870)

  Users of virt-v2v should upgrade to this updated package, which fixes these
  issues and upgrades virt-v2v to version 0.8.3.
