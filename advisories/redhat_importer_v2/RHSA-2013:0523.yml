  - CVE-2010-4530
summary: |
  An updated ccid package that fixes one security issue and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Chip/Smart Card Interface Devices (CCID) is a USB smart card reader
  standard followed by most modern smart card readers. The ccid package
  provides a Generic, USB-based CCID driver for readers, which follow this
  standard.

  An integer overflow, leading to an array index error, was found in the way
  the CCID driver processed a smart card's serial number. A local attacker
  could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  user running the PC/SC Lite pcscd daemon (root, by default), by inserting a
  specially-crafted smart card. (CVE-2010-4530)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * Previously, CCID only recognized smart cards with 5V power supply. With
  this update, CCID also supports smart cards with different power supply.
  (BZ#808115)

  All users of ccid are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains backported patches to correct these issues.
