  - CVE-2006-6899
summary: |
  Updated bluez-utils packages that fix a security flaw are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The bluez-utils package contains Bluetooth daemons and utilities.

  A flaw was found in the Bluetooth HID daemon (hidd). A remote attacker
  would have been able to inject keyboard and mouse events via a Bluetooth
  connection without any authorization. (CVE-2006-6899)

  Note that Red Hat Enterprise Linux does not come with the Bluetooth HID
  daemon enabled by default.

  Users of bluez-utils are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contains a backported patch to correct this issue.
