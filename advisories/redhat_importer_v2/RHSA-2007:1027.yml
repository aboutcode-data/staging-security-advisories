summary: "Updated tetex packages that fix several security issues are now available\nfor Red\
  \ Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.\n\nThis update has been rated as having important security\
  \ impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nTeTeX is an implementation of TeX. TeX\
  \ takes a text file and a set of\nformatting commands as input, and creates a typesetter-independent\
  \ DeVice\nIndependent (dvi) file as output. \n\nAlin Rad Pop discovered several flaws in the\
  \ handling of PDF files. An\nattacker could create a malicious PDF file that would cause TeTeX\
  \ to crash\nor potentially execute arbitrary code when opened. \n(CVE-2007-4352, CVE-2007-5392,\
  \ CVE-2007-5393)\n\nA flaw was found in the t1lib library, used in the handling of Type 1\n\
  fonts. An attacker could create a malicious file that would cause TeTeX to\ncrash, or potentially\
  \ execute arbitrary code when opened. (CVE-2007-4033)\n\nUsers are advised to upgrade to these\
  \ updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to resolve these issues."
