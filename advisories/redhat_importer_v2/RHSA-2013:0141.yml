  Platform 5.2.2 that fixes multiple security issues is now available from
  the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform is the open source implementation of the
  Java EE suite of services and Portal services running atop JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform. It comprises a set of offerings for enterprise
  customers who are looking for pre-configured profiles of JBoss Enterprise
  Middleware components that have been tested and certified together to
  provide an integrated experience.

  Multiple reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in GateIn
  Portal. If a remote attacker could trick a user, who was logged into the
  GateIn Portal interface, into visiting a specially-crafted URL, it would
  lead to arbitrary web script execution in the context of the user's GateIn
  Portal session. (CVE-2012-5531)

  Red Hat would like to thank Hideharu Ohkuma of Ricoh Company for reporting
  these issues.

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up all applications deployed on
  JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform, along with all customized configuration
  files, and any databases and database settings.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.2.2 as provided from the
  Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to install this update.
