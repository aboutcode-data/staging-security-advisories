summary: |
  JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 is now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5 and 6, Solaris, and
  Microsoft Windows.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise Web Server is a fully-integrated and certified set of
  components for hosting Java web applications.

  This is the first release of JBoss Enterprise Web Server for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 6. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5, Solaris, and
  Microsoft Windows, this release serves as a replacement for JBoss
  Enterprise Web Server 1.0.1, and includes a number of bug fixes. Refer to
  the Release Notes, linked in the References, for more information.

  This update corrects security flaws in the following components:

  tomcat6:

  A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the Manager application,
  used for managing web applications on Apache Tomcat. If a remote attacker
  could trick a user who is logged into the Manager application into visiting
  a specially-crafted URL, the attacker could perform Manager application
  tasks with the privileges of the logged in user. (CVE-2010-4172)

  tomcat5 and tomcat6:

  It was found that web applications could modify the location of the Apache
  Tomcat host's work directory. As web applications deployed on Tomcat have
  read and write access to this directory, a malicious web application could
  use this flaw to trick Tomcat into giving it read and write access to an
  arbitrary directory on the file system. (CVE-2010-3718)

  A second cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the Manager
  application. A malicious web application could use this flaw to conduct an
  XSS attack, leading to arbitrary web script execution with the privileges
  of victims who are logged into and viewing Manager application web pages.
  (CVE-2011-0013)

  A possible minor information leak was found in the way Apache Tomcat
  generated HTTP BASIC and DIGEST authentication requests. For configurations
  where a realm name was not specified and Tomcat was accessed via a proxy,
  the default generated realm contained the hostname and port used by the
  proxy to send requests to the Tomcat server. (CVE-2010-1157)

  httpd:

  A flaw was found in the way the mod_dav module of the Apache HTTP Server
  handled certain requests. If a remote attacker were to send a carefully
  crafted request to the server, it could cause the httpd child process to
  crash. (CVE-2010-1452)

  A flaw was discovered in the way the mod_proxy_http module of the Apache
  HTTP Server handled the timeouts of requests forwarded by a reverse proxy
  to the back-end server. In some configurations, the proxy could return
  a response intended for another user under certain timeout conditions,
  possibly leading to information disclosure. Note: This issue only affected
  httpd running on the Windows operating system. (CVE-2010-2068)

  apr:

  It was found that the apr_fnmatch() function used an unconstrained
  recursion when processing patterns with the '*' wildcard. An attacker could
  use this flaw to cause an application using this function, which also
  accepted untrusted input as a pattern for matching (such as an httpd server
  using the mod_autoindex module), to exhaust all stack memory or use an
  excessive amount of CPU time when performing matching. (CVE-2011-0419)

  apr-util:

  It was found that certain input could cause the apr-util library to
  allocate more memory than intended in the apr_brigade_split_line()
  function. An attacker able to provide input in small chunks to an
  application using the apr-util library (such as httpd) could possibly use
  this flaw to trigger high memory consumption. (CVE-2010-1623)

  The following flaws were corrected in the packages for Solaris and Windows.
  Updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux can be downloaded from the Red Hat
  Network.

  Multiple flaws in OpenSSL, which could possibly cause a crash, code
  execution, or a change of session parameters, have been corrected.
  (CVE-2009-3245, CVE-2010-4180, CVE-2008-7270)

  Two denial of service flaws were corrected in Expat. (CVE-2009-3560,
  CVE-2009-3720)

  An X.509 certificate verification flaw was corrected in OpenLDAP.
  (CVE-2009-3767)

  More information about these flaws is available from the CVE links in the
  References.
