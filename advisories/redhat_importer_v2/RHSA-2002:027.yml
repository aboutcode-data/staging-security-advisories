  - CVE-2002-0059
summary: "[Update 20 Mar 2002:\nVNC packages updated to fix another denial of service vulnerability\
  \ caused\nby the previous update. Thanks to Const Kaplinsky for discovering this\nissue.]\n\
  \  \nThe zlib compression library provides in-memory compression and  \ndecompression functions.\
  \ It is widely used throughout Linux  \nand other operating systems.  \n  \nWhile performing\
  \ tests on the gdk-pixbuf library, Matthias Clasen created  \nan invalid PNG image that caused\
  \ libpng to crash.  Upon further  \ninvestigation, this turned out to be a bug in zlib 1.1.3.\
  \ Certain  \ninput will cause zlib to free an area of memory twice (also called a  \n\"double\
  \ free\").  \n  \nThis bug can be used to crash any program that takes untrusted compressed\
  \  \ninput. Web browsers or email programs that display image attachments or  \nother programs\
  \ that uncompress data are particularly affected. This  \nvulnerability makes it easy to perform\
  \ various denial-of-service attacks  \nagainst such programs.   \n  \nHowever, since the result\
  \ of a double free is the corruption of the  \nmalloc implementation's data structures, it\
  \ is possible that an attacker\ncould manage a more significant exploit, such as running arbitrary\
  \ code on\nthe affected system.\n\nMost of the packages in Red Hat Linux use the shared zlib\
  \ library and can\nbe protected against vulnerability by updating to the errata zlib\npackage.\
  \  However, there have been a number of packages identified in Red\nHat Linux that either\
  \ statically link to zlib or contain an internal\nversion of zlib code.\n\nAlthough no exploits\
  \ for this issue or the affected packages are currently\nknown to exist, this is a serious\
  \ vulnerability that could be locally or\nremotely  exploited. All users should upgrade affected\
  \ packages\nimmediately.\n\nAdditionally, if you have any programs that you have compiled\
  \ yourself\nyou should check to see if they use zlib. If they link to the shared\nzlib library\
  \ then they will not be vulnerable once the shared zlib\nlibrary is updated to the errata\
  \ package. If any programs that decompress\narbitrary data either statically link to zlib\
  \ or use their own version of\nthe zlib code internally, then they need to be patched or recompiled.\n\
  \nThe following details apply to the Powertools distribution only;\nfor packages included\
  \ with the main Red Hat Linux distribution\nplease see advisory RHSA-2002:026\n\nabiword:\
  \ Powertools 6.2 shipped with both statically and\ndynamically linked versions of AbiWord.\
  \ The statically linked version\nis linked against the vulnerable zlib. It is recommended\
  \ that users\nonly use the dynamic version.\n\nacroread: The acroread package in Powertools\
  \ 7.0 contains Acrobat\nReader, a PDF viewer. This package contains an internal version of\n\
  zlib which may be vulnerable. An update is not yet available, so users are\nadvised to view\
  \ PDF documents using xpdf or ghostview.\n\namaya: Amaya is a Web browser/authoring tool.\
  \ Amaya in Powertools 7.1\nhas been patched to use the system zlib, libjpeg, and libpng libraries\n\
  instead of the internal static versions.\n\nflash: The flash package in Powertools 6.2 and\
  \ 7.0 contains an\nunofficial Shockwave(TM) Flash2/Flash3 plug-in for Netscape which uses\n\
  an internal version of zlib. This plug-in conflicts with the official\nflash plug-in included\
  \ in the netscape package and should not be used.\n\nfreeamp: Freeamp is an MP3 audio player\
  \ in Powertools 6.2 and 7.0 which\nuses zlib when decompressing themes. Freeamp has been patched\n\
  to use the system zlib library instead of the internal version.\n\nqt-embedded: Qt is a GUI\
  \ toolkit for embedded devices.  qt-embedded has\nbeen updated to version 2.3.2 and recompiled\
  \ against the errata zlib\nlibrary.\n\nvnc: VNC is a remote display system in Powertools 6.2.\
  \ VNC has been\npatched to use the system zlib library.  \n\nIn addition, there is a small\
  \ HTTP server implementation in the VNC server\nwhich can be made to wait indefinitely for\
  \ input, thereby freezing an\nactive VNC session.  The VNC packages recommended by this advisory\
  \ have\nbeen patched to fix this issue, as well. Users of VNC should be aware  the\nprogram\
  \ is designed for use on a trusted network."
