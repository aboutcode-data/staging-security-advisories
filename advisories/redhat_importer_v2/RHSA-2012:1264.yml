  - CVE-2012-3488
summary: |
  Updated postgresql packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system
  (DBMS).

  It was found that the optional PostgreSQL xml2 contrib module allowed local
  files and remote URLs to be read and written to with the privileges of the
  database server when parsing Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations
  (XSLT). An unprivileged database user could use this flaw to read and write
  to local files (such as the database's configuration files) and remote URLs
  they would otherwise not have access to by issuing a specially-crafted SQL
  query. (CVE-2012-3488)

  Red Hat would like to thank the PostgreSQL project for reporting this
  issue. Upstream acknowledges Peter Eisentraut as the original reporter.

  All PostgreSQL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch to correct this issue. If the postgresql
  service is running, it will be automatically restarted after installing
  this update.
