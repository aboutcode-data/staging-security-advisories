summary: |
  Updated JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.0.1 packages that fix
  multiple security issues, various bugs, and add enhancements are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java applications
  based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  This release serves as a replacement for JBoss Enterprise Application
  Platform 6.0.0, and includes bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the 6.0.1
  Release Notes for information on the most significant of these changes,
  available shortly from https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/

  This update removes unused signed JARs; unused SHA1 checksums from JAR
  MANIFEST.MF files to reduce the Server memory footprint; adds MANIFEST.MF
  to JAR files where it was previously missing; and removes redundant Javadoc
  files from the main packages. (BZ#830291)

  Security fixes:

  Apache CXF checked to ensure XML elements were signed or encrypted by a
  Supporting Token, but not whether the correct token was used. A remote
  attacker could transmit confidential information without the appropriate
  security, and potentially circumvent access controls on web services
  exposed via Apache CXF. (CVE-2012-2379)

  When using role-based authorization to configure EJB access, JACC
  permissions should be used to determine access; however, due to a flaw the
  configured authorization modules (JACC, XACML, etc.) were not called, and
  the JACC permissions were not used to determine access to an EJB.
  (CVE-2012-4550)

  A flaw in the way Apache CXF enforced child policies of WS-SecurityPolicy
  1.1 on the client side could, in certain cases, lead to a client failing to
  sign or encrypt certain elements as directed by the security policy,
  leading to information disclosure and insecure information transmission.
  (CVE-2012-2378)

  A flaw was found in the way IronJacamar authenticated credentials and
  returned a valid datasource connection when configured to
  "allow-multiple-users". A remote attacker, provided the correct subject,
  could obtain a datasource connection that might belong to a privileged
  user. (CVE-2012-3428)

  It was found that Apache CXF was vulnerable to SOAPAction spoofing attacks
  under certain conditions. Note that WS-Policy validation is performed
  against the operation being invoked, and an attack must pass validation to
  be successful. (CVE-2012-3451)

  When there are no allowed roles for an EJB method invocation, the
  invocation should be denied for all users. It was found that the
  processInvocation() method in
  org.jboss.as.ejb3.security.AuthorizationInterceptor incorrectly authorizes
  all method invocations to proceed when the list of allowed roles is empty.
  (CVE-2012-4549)

  It was found that in Mojarra, the FacesContext that is made available
  during application startup is held in a ThreadLocal. The reference is not
  properly cleaned up in all cases. As a result, if a JavaServer Faces (JSF)
  WAR calls FacesContext.getCurrentInstance() during application startup,
  another WAR can get access to the leftover context and thus get access to
  the other WAR's resources. A local attacker could use this flaw to access
  another WAR's resources using a crafted, deployed application.
  (CVE-2012-2672)

  An input sanitization flaw was found in the mod_negotiation Apache HTTP
  Server module. A remote attacker able to upload or create files with
  arbitrary names in a directory that has the MultiViews options enabled,
  could use this flaw to conduct cross-site scripting attacks against users
  visiting the site. (CVE-2008-0455, CVE-2012-2687)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Apache CXF project for reporting
  CVE-2012-2379, CVE-2012-2378, and CVE-2012-3451. The CVE-2012-4550 issue
  was discovered by Josef Cacek of the Red Hat JBoss EAP Quality Engineering
  team; CVE-2012-3428 and CVE-2012-4549 were discovered by Arun Neelicattu of
  the Red Hat Security Response Team; and CVE-2012-2672 was discovered by
  Marek Schmidt and Stan Silvert of Red Hat.

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss
  Enterprise Application Platform installation and deployed applications.
