summary: |
  Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 2.2.2 is now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Virtualization.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is a visual tool for centrally
  managing collections of virtual servers running Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  and Microsoft Windows. This package also includes the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Manager API, a set of scriptable commands that give
  administrators the ability to perform queries and operations on Red Hat
  Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

  It was found that the SSL certificate was not verified when using the
  client-side Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager interface (a Windows
  Presentation Foundation (WPF) XAML browser application) to connect to the
  Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager. An attacker on the local network
  could use this flaw to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack, tricking the
  user into thinking they are viewing the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Manager when the content is actually attacker-controlled, or modifying
  actions a user requested Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager to
  perform. (CVE-2009-3552)

  Note: As part of the fix for CVE-2009-3552, this update changes the way the
  client-side Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager interface
  communicates with the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager. After
  installing this update, the following steps must be performed when using
  HTTPS (that is, browsing to "https://localhost/RHEVmanager" or using the
  new "RHEVManager SSL" shortcut):

  1) If you have previously browsed to the administrator portal using HTTP,
  you must remove the "RHEVManager/" cookie from Internet Explorer. After
  removing this cookie, restart Internet Explorer.

  2) Navigate to "https://localhost/RHEVmanager". You will be prompted to
  install the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager CA (Certificate
  Authority) certificate. Once installed, restart Internet Explorer.

  It is recommended that you use the "https://" link or the "RHEVManager SSL"
  shortcut to connect to the administrator portal, and no longer use the
  "http://" link.

  This updated Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager package also fixes
  several bugs. Documentation for these bug fixes will be available shortly
  from
  http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization_for_Servers/2.2/html/Technical_Notes/index.html

  All Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager users are advised to install
  this updated package, which corrects this issue and fixes the bugs noted
  in the Technical Notes document, linked to in the References.
