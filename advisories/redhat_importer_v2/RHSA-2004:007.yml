summary: "Updated tcpdump, libpcap, and arpwatch packages fix vulnerabilities in\nISAKMP and\
  \ RADIUS parsing. \n\n[Updated 15 Jan 2004]\nUpdated the text description to better describe\
  \ the vulnerabilities found\nby Jonathan Heusser and give them CVE names.\n\nTcpdump is a\
  \ command-line tool for monitoring network traffic. \n\nGeorge Bakos discovered flaws in the\
  \ ISAKMP decoding routines of tcpdump\nversions prior to 3.8.1.  The Common Vulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0989 to this issue.\n\
  \nJonathan Heusser discovered an additional flaw in the ISAKMP decoding\nroutines for tcpdump\
  \ 3.8.1 and earlier.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\
  \ assigned the name CAN-2004-0057 to\nthis issue.\n\nJonathan Heusser discovered a flaw in\
  \ the print_attr_string function in the\nRADIUS decoding routines for tcpdump 3.8.1 and earlier.\
  \  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\n\
  CAN-2004-0055 to this issue.\n\nRemote attackers could potentially exploit these issues by\
  \ sending\ncarefully-crafted packets to a victim.  If the victim uses tcpdump, these\npakets\
  \ could result in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode as the 'pcap' user.\n\
  \nUsers of tcpdump are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain backported\
  \ security patches and are not vulnerable to these issues."
