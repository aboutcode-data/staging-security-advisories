  - CVE-2015-5277
summary: |
  Updated glibc packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The glibc packages provide the standard C libraries (libc), POSIX thread
  libraries (libpthread), standard math libraries (libm), and the Name Server
  Caching Daemon (nscd) used by multiple programs on the system. Without
  these libraries, the Linux system cannot function correctly.

  It was discovered that the nss_files backend for the Name Service Switch in
  glibc would return incorrect data to applications or corrupt the heap
  (depending on adjacent heap contents) in certain cases. A local attacker
  could potentially use this flaw to escalate their privileges.
  (CVE-2015-5277)

  This issue was discovered by Sumit Bose and Lukáš Slebodník of Red Hat.

  All glibc users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
