  - CVE-2009-3720
summary: |
  An updated PyXML package that fixes one security issue is now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  PyXML provides XML libraries for Python. The distribution contains a
  validating XML parser, an implementation of the SAX and DOM programming
  interfaces, and an interface to the Expat parser.

  A buffer over-read flaw was found in the way PyXML's Expat parser handled
  malformed UTF-8 sequences when processing XML files. A specially-crafted
  XML file could cause Python applications using PyXML's Expat parser to
  crash while parsing the file. (CVE-2009-3720)

  This update makes PyXML use the system Expat library rather than its own
  internal copy; therefore, users must install the RHSA-2009:1625 expat
  update together with this PyXML update to resolve the CVE-2009-3720 issue.

  All PyXML users should upgrade to this updated package, which changes PyXML
  to use the system Expat library. After installing this update along with
  RHSA-2009:1625, applications using the PyXML library must be restarted for
  the update to take effect.
