aliases:
  - CVE-2007-1349
summary: |
  Updated mod_perl packages that fix a security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Mod_perl incorporates a Perl interpreter into the Apache web server,
  so that the Apache HTTP server can directly execute Perl code.

  The Apache::PerlRun module was found to not properly escape PATH_INFO
  before being used in a regular expression. If a server is configured to
  use Apache::PerlRun, an attacker could request a carefully crafted URI
  causing resource consumption, which could lead to a denial of service
  (CVE-2007-1349).

  Users of mod_perl should update to these erratum packages which contain a
  backported fix to correct this issue.
