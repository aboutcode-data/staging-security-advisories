summary: |
  An update for the OpenSSL component for JBoss Enterprise Application
  Platform 6.0.0 for Solaris and Microsoft Windows that fixes multiple
  security issues is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
  and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
  full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

  Multiple numeric conversion errors, leading to a buffer overflow, were
  found in the way OpenSSL parsed ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) data
  from BIO (OpenSSL's I/O abstraction) inputs. Specially-crafted DER
  (Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoded data read from a file or other BIO
  input could cause an application using the OpenSSL library to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2012-2110)

  A double free flaw was discovered in the policy checking code in OpenSSL.
  A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash an application that uses
  OpenSSL by providing an X.509 certificate that has specially-crafted
  policy extension data. (CVE-2011-4109)

  An information leak flaw was found in the SSL 3.0 protocol implementation
  in OpenSSL. Incorrect initialization of SSL record padding bytes could
  cause an SSL client or server to send a limited amount of possibly
  sensitive data to its SSL peer via the encrypted connection.
  (CVE-2011-4576)

  It was discovered that OpenSSL did not limit the number of TLS/SSL
  handshake restarts required to support Server Gated Cryptography. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server using OpenSSL consume
  an excessive amount of CPU by continuously restarting the handshake.
  (CVE-2011-4619)

  This update also fixes additional security issues in OpenSSL that are not
  exposed in JBoss Enterprise Application Platform: CVE-2011-4108,
  CVE-2012-0884, CVE-2012-1165, and CVE-2012-2333.

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss
  Enterprise Application Platform installation and deployed applications, and
  also back up your existing Apache HTTP Server installation (including all
  applications and configuration files).

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.0.0 for Solaris and
  Microsoft Windows as provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised
  to apply this update.
