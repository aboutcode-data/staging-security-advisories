  - CVE-2015-8629
  - CVE-2015-8631
summary: |
  Updated krb5 packages that fix two security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Kerberos is a networked authentication system which allows clients and
  servers to authenticate to each other with the help of a trusted third
  party, the Kerberos KDC.

  A memory leak flaw was found in the krb5_unparse_name() function of the MIT
  Kerberos kadmind service. An authenticated attacker could repeatedly send
  specially crafted requests to the server, which could cause the server to
  consume large amounts of memory resources, ultimately leading to a denial
  of service due to memory exhaustion. (CVE-2015-8631)

  An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the kadmind service of MIT
  Kerberos. An authenticated attacker could send a maliciously crafted
  message to force kadmind to read beyond the end of allocated memory, and
  write the memory contents to the KDC database if the attacker has write
  permission, leading to information disclosure. (CVE-2015-8629)

  The CVE-2015-8631 issue was discovered by Simo Sorce of Red Hat.

  All krb5 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
  updated packages, running Kerberos services (krb5kdc, kadmin, and kprop)
  will be restarted automatically.
