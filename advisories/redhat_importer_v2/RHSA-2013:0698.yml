aliases:
  - CVE-2013-1855
  - CVE-2013-1857
summary: |
  Updated rubygem-actionpack and ruby193-rubygem-actionpack packages that
  fix two security issues are now available for Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise
  1.1.3.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Ruby on Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework for web
  application development. Action Pack implements the controller and the view
  components.

  Two cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in rubygem-actionpack and
  ruby193-rubygem-actionpack. A remote attacker could use these flaws to
  conduct XSS attacks against users of an application using
  rubygem-actionpack or ruby193-rubygem-actionpack. (CVE-2013-1855,
  CVE-2013-1857)

  Red Hat would like to thank Ruby on Rails upstream for reporting these
  issues. Upstream acknowledges Charlie Somerville as the original reporter
  of CVE-2013-1855, and Alan Jenkins as the original reporter of
  CVE-2013-1857.

  Users of Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.1.3 are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages, which correct these issues.
