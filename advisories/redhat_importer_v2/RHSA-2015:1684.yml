  - CVE-2015-1856
summary: |
  Updated openstack-swift packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  OpenStack Object Storage (swift) provides object storage in virtual
  containers, which allows users to store and retrieve files (arbitrary
  data). The service's distributed architecture supports horizontal scaling;
  redundancy as failure-proofing is provided through software-based data
  replication. Because Object Storage supports asynchronous eventual
  consistency replication, it is well suited to multiple data-center
  deployment.

  A flaw was found in OpenStack Object Storage that could allow an
  authenticated user to delete the most recent version of a versioned object
  regardless of ownership. To exploit this flaw, an attacker must know the
  name of the object and have listing access to the x-versions-location
  container. (CVE-2015-1856)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Clay Gerrard of SwiftStack as the original reporter.

  All users of openstack-swift are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct this issue. After installing this update, the
  OpenStack Object Storage services will be restarted automatically.
