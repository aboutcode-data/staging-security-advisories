  - CVE-2013-1976
summary: |
  Updated tomcat5 and tomcat6 packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Apache Tomcat is a servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer
  Pages (JSP) technologies.

  A flaw was found in the way the tomcat5 and tomcat6 init scripts handled
  the tomcat5-initd.log and tomcat6-initd.log log files. A malicious web
  application deployed on Tomcat could use this flaw to perform a symbolic
  link attack to change the ownership of an arbitrary system file to that of
  the tomcat user, allowing them to escalate their privileges to root.
  (CVE-2013-1976)

  Note: With this update, tomcat5-initd.log and tomcat6-initd.log have been
  moved to the /var/log/ directory.

  Red Hat would like to thank Simon Fayer of Imperial College London for
  reporting this issue.

  Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss Enterprise
  Web Server installation (including all applications and configuration
  files).

  Users of Tomcat should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve
  this issue. Tomcat must be restarted for this update to take effect.
