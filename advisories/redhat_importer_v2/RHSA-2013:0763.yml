summary: |
  JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.2.0, which fixes two security issues, various
  bugs, and adds enhancements is now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The JBoss Web Framework Kit combines popular open source web frameworks
  into a single solution for Java applications.

  This release of JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.2.0 serves as a replacement for
  JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.1.0. It includes various bug fixes and
  enhancements which are detailed in the JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.2.0
  Release Notes. The Release Notes will be available shortly from
  https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/

  This release also fixes the following security issues:

  A flaw was found in the way the Apache Xerces2 Java Parser processed the
  SYSTEM identifier in DTDs. A remote attacker could provide a
  specially-crafted XML file, which once parsed by an application using the
  Apache Xerces2 Java Parser, would lead to a denial of service (application
  hang due to excessive CPU use). (CVE-2009-2625)

  Note: Seam and RichFaces used the xerces:xercesImpl:2.9.1-patch01 artifact,
  which is vulnerable to the CVE-2009-2625 flaw. In this release, the
  artifact has been replaced with xerces:xercesImpl:2.9.1-redhat-3, which is
  not vulnerable.

  The Jakarta Commons HttpClient component did not verify that the server
  hostname matched the domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or
  subjectAltName field in X.509 certificates. This could allow a
  man-in-the-middle attacker to spoof an SSL server if they had a certificate
  that was valid for any domain name. (CVE-2012-5783)

  Note: Jakarta Commons HttpClient 3 is vulnerable to CVE-2012-5783. Jakarta
  Commons HttpClient 3 has reached its end of life as an Apache-maintained
  component, and no upstream build is available that addresses this flaw. The
  version of Jakarta Commons HttpClient 3 that ships with JBoss Web Framework
  Kit 2.2.0 includes a patch for this flaw, which has been built by Red Hat.
  Versions that are consumed from Maven Central do not have this patch
  applied.

  Jakarta Commons HttpClient 3 is a transitive dependency for multiple
  components included in JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.2.0. If this dependency is
  resolved using a build of HttpClient 3 from Maven Central, then this flaw
  may be exposed.

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing installation of
  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform or JBoss Enterprise Web Server, and
  applications deployed to it.

  All users of JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.1.0 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.2.0.
