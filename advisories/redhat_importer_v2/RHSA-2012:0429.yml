  - CVE-2011-4128
  - CVE-2012-1573
summary: |
  Updated gnutls packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The GnuTLS library provides support for cryptographic algorithms and for
  protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).

  A flaw was found in the way GnuTLS decrypted malformed TLS records. This
  could cause a TLS/SSL client or server to crash when processing a
  specially-crafted TLS record from a remote TLS/SSL connection peer.
  (CVE-2012-1573)

  A boundary error was found in the gnutls_session_get_data() function. A
  malicious TLS/SSL server could use this flaw to crash a TLS/SSL client or,
  possibly, execute arbitrary code as the client, if the client passed a
  fixed-sized buffer to gnutls_session_get_data() before checking the real
  size of the session data provided by the server. (CVE-2011-4128)

  Red Hat would like to thank Matthew Hall of Mu Dynamics for reporting
  CVE-2012-1573.

  Users of GnuTLS are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. For the update to take
  effect, all applications linked to the GnuTLS library must be restarted, or
  the system rebooted.
