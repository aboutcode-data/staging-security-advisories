  - CVE-2010-2227
summary: |
  Updated tomcat5 and tomcat6 packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.1 for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 4 and 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Apache Tomcat is a servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer
  Pages (JSP) technologies.

  A flaw was found in the way Tomcat handled the Transfer-Encoding header in
  HTTP requests. A specially-crafted HTTP request could prevent Tomcat from
  sending replies, or cause Tomcat to return truncated replies, or replies
  containing data related to the requests of other users, for all subsequent
  HTTP requests. (CVE-2010-2227)

  Users of Tomcat should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to resolve this issue. Tomcat must be restarted for this
  update to take effect.
