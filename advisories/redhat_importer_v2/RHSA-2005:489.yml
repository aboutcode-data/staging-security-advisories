summary: "An updated squid package that fixes several security issues is now available.\n\n\
  This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat\nSecurity Response\
  \ Team.\n\nSquid is a full-featured Web proxy cache. \n \nA bug was found in the way Squid\
  \ handles PUT and POST requests. It is\npossible for an authorised remote user to cause a\
  \ failed PUT or POST\nrequest which can cause Squid to crash. The Common Vulnerabilities and\n\
  Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0718 to\nthis issue.\n \n\
  A bug was found in the way Squid handles access to the cachemgr.cgi script. \nIt is possible\
  \ for an authorised remote user to bypass access control\nlists with this flaw. The Common\
  \ Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-1999-0710\
  \ to this issue.\n \nA bug was found in the way Squid handles DNS replies.  If the port Squid\n\
  uses for DNS requests is not protected by a firewall, it is possible for a\nremote attacker\
  \ to spoof DNS replies, possibly redirecting a user to\nspoofed or malicious content. The\
  \ Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name  CAN-2005-1519\
  \ to this issue. \n \nAdditionally, this update fixes the following bugs:   \n - squid fails\
  \ in the unpacking of squid-2.4.STABLE7-1.21as.5.src.rpm\n \nUsers of Squid should upgrade\
  \ to this updated package, which contains\nbackported patches to correct these issues."
