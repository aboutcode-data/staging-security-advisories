summary: |
  Updated OpenStack Compute (nova) packages that fix three security issues,
  several bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  OpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual
  machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform.
  Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to
  orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances and
  controlling access through users and projects.

  It was discovered that the OpenStack Compute (nova) console websocket did
  not correctly verify the origin header. An attacker could use this flaw to
  conduct a cross-site websocket hijack attack. Note that only Compute setups
  with VNC or SPICE enabled were affected by this flaw. (CVE-2015-0259)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenStack Compute (nova)
  looked up VM instances based on an IP address filter. An attacker with
  sufficient privileges on an OpenStack installation with a large amount of
  VMs could use this flaw to cause the main nova process to block for an
  extended amount of time. (CVE-2014-3708)

  A flaw was found in the OpenStack Compute (nova) VMWare driver, which could
  allow an authenticated user to delete an instance while it was in the
  resize state, causing the instance to remain on the back end. A malicious
  user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service by exhausting all
  available resources on the system. (CVE-2014-8333)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting the
  CVE-2015-0259 and CVE-2014-3708 issues. Upstream acknowledges Brian
  Manifold of Cisco and Paul McMillan of Nebula as the original reporters of
  CVE-2015-0259, and Mohammed Naser from Vexxhost as the original reporter of
  CVE-2014-3708.

  In addition to the above issues, this update also addresses several bugs
  and adds various enhancements, which are documented in the Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform Technical Notes (see References
  section).

  All openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which correct these issues and add these enhancements.
