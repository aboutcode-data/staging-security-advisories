summary: "An updated version of PHP that addresses several security issues is now\navailable\
  \ for Stronghold 4.0 for Enterprise Linux.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate\
  \ security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nPHP is an HTML-embedded scripting\
  \ language.  Several security issues were\nfound in the PHP package in Stronghold 4.0:\n\n\
  The wordwrap() PHP function did not properly check for integer overflow in\nthe way the \"\
  break\" parameter was handled. An attacker who could control a\nstring passed to the \"break\"\
  \ parameter could cause a heap overflow.\n(CVE-2006-1990)\n\nThe phpinfo() PHP function did\
  \ not properly sanitize long strings. This\ncould allow an attacker to perform cross-site\
  \ scripting attacks against\nsites that had publicly-available PHP scripts that called phpinfo().\n\
  (CVE-2006-0996)\n\nThe error handling output was found to improperly escape HTML output in\n\
  certain cases. This could allow an attacker to perform cross-site\nscripting attacks against\
  \ sites where both display_errors and html_errors\nwere enabled. (CVE-2006-0208) \n\nA flaw\
  \ in the way PHP registered global variables during a file upload\nrequest was discovered.\
  \ A remote attacker could submit a carefully crafted\nmultipart/form-data POST request that\
  \ could overwrite the $GLOBALS array,\nwhich could alter expected script behavior and possibly\
  \ lead to the\nexecution of arbitrary PHP commands. Note that this vulnerability only\naffects\
  \ installations which have register_globals enabled in the PHP\nconfiguration file, which\
  \ is neither a default nor recommended option.\n(CVE-2005-3390)\n\nA flaw in the PHP parse_str()\
  \ function was discovered. If a PHP script\npassed only one argument to the parse_str() function,\
  \ and the script was\nforced to abort execution during operation (for example, due to the\n\
  memory_limit setting), the register_globals may be enabled even if it was\ndisabled in the\
  \ PHP configuration file. This vulnerability only affects\ninstallations that have PHP scripts\
  \ using the parse_str function in this\nway. (CVE-2005-3389) \n\nA Cross-Site Scripting flaw\
  \ in the phpinfo() function was discovered. If a\nvictim was tricked into following a malicious\
  \ URL to a site with a page\ndisplaying the phpinfo() output, it was possible to inject javascript\
  \ or\nHTML content into the displayed page or steal data such as cookies. This\nvulnerability\
  \ only affects installations that allow users to view the\noutput of the phpinfo() function.\
  \ As the phpinfo() function outputs a large\namount of information about the current state\
  \ of PHP, it should only be\nused during debugging or if protected by authentication. (CVE-2005-3388)\
  \ \n\nA buffer overflow flaw was discovered in uw-imap, the University of\nWashington's IMAP\
  \ Server. php-imap is compiled against the static c-client\nlibraries from imap and therefore\
  \ needed to be recompiled against the fixed\nversion. (CVE-2005-2933) \n\nA flaw was found\
  \ in the zend_hash_del() PHP function. For PHP scripts that\nrely on the use of the unset()\
  \ function, a remote attacker could force\nvariable initialization to be bypassed. This would\
  \ be a security issue\nparticularly for installations that enable the \"register_globals\"\
  \ setting.\n\"register_globals\" is disabled by default in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n(CVE-2006-3017)\n\
  \nA directory traversal vulnerability was found in PHP. Local users could\nbypass open_basedir\
  \ restrictions allowing remote attackers to create files\nin arbitrary directories via the\
  \ tempnam() function. (CVE-2006-1494)\n\nUsers of Stronghold are advised to upgrade to this\
  \ update, which\ncontains backported patches to correct these issues."
