  - CVE-2010-4476
summary: |
  Updated tomcat5 packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Apache Tomcat is a servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer
  Pages (JSP) technologies.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way certain strings were
  converted to Double objects. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause
  Tomcat to hang via a specially-crafted HTTP request. (CVE-2010-4476)

  Users of Tomcat should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue. Tomcat must be restarted for this
  update to take effect.
