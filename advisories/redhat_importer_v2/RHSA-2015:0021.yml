  - CVE-2014-3669
  - CVE-2014-3670
summary: |
  Updated php packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Extended Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
  HTTP Server.

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the Exif extension. A specially crafted
  JPEG or TIFF file could cause a PHP application using the exif_thumbnail()
  function to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges
  of the user running that PHP application. (CVE-2014-3670)

  An integer overflow flaw was found in the way custom objects were
  unserialized. Specially crafted input processed by the unserialize()
  function could cause a PHP application to crash. (CVE-2014-3669)

  All php users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
  updated packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to
  take effect.
