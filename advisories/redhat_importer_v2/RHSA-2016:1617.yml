  - CVE-2016-4565
summary: |
  An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Advanced Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A flaw was found in the way certain interfaces of the Linux kernel's Infiniband subsystem used write() as bi-directional ioctl() replacement, which could lead to insufficient memory security checks when being invoked using the splice() system call. A local unprivileged user on a system with either Infiniband hardware present or RDMA Userspace Connection Manager Access module explicitly loaded, could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2016-4565, Important)

  Red Hat would like to thank Jann Horn for reporting this issue.
