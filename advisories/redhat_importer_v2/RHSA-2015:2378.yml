  - CVE-2015-3455
summary: |
  Updated squid packages that fix one security issue and two bugs are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for web clients,
  supporting FTP, Gopher, and HTTP data objects.

  It was found that Squid configured with client-first SSL-bump did not
  correctly validate X.509 server certificate host name fields. A
  man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof a Squid server
  using a specially crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2015-3455)

  This update fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, the squid process did not handle file descriptors correctly
  when receiving Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) requests. As a
  consequence, the process gradually accumulated open file descriptors. This
  bug has been fixed and squid now handles SNMP requests correctly, closing
  file descriptors when necessary. (BZ#1198778)

  * Under high system load, the squid process sometimes terminated
  unexpectedly with a segmentation fault during reboot. This update provides
  better memory handling during reboot, thus fixing this bug. (BZ#1225640)

  Users of squid are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which fix
  these bugs. After installing this update, the squid service will be
  restarted automatically.
