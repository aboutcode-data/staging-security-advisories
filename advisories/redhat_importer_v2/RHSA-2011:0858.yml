  - CVE-2009-2625
summary: |
  Updated xerces-j2 packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The xerces-j2 packages provide the Apache Xerces2 Java Parser, a
  high-performance XML parser. A Document Type Definition (DTD) defines the
  legal syntax (and also which elements can be used) for certain types of
  files, such as XML files.

  A flaw was found in the way the Apache Xerces2 Java Parser processed the
  SYSTEM identifier in DTDs. A remote attacker could provide a
  specially-crafted XML file, which once parsed by an application using the
  Apache Xerces2 Java Parser, would lead to a denial of service (application
  hang due to excessive CPU use). (CVE-2009-2625)

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a backported
  patch to correct this issue. Applications using the Apache Xerces2 Java
  Parser must be restarted for this update to take effect.
