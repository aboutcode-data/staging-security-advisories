  - CVE-2013-1944
summary: |
  Updated curl packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  cURL provides the libcurl library and a command line tool for downloading
  files from servers using various protocols, including HTTP, FTP, and LDAP.

  A flaw was found in the way libcurl matched domains associated with
  cookies. This could lead to cURL or an application linked against libcurl
  sending the wrong cookie if only part of the domain name matched the domain
  associated with the cookie, disclosing the cookie to unrelated hosts.
  (CVE-2013-1944)

  Red Hat would like to thank the cURL project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges YAMADA Yasuharu as the original reporter.

  Users of curl should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue. All running applications using
  libcurl must be restarted for the update to take effect.
