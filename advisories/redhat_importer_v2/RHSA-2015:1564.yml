summary: |
  Updated kernel-rt packages that fix three security issues, several bugs,
  and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG
  2.5.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's
  netfilter connection tracking implementation loaded extensions. An attacker
  on a local network could potentially send a sequence of specially crafted
  packets that would initiate the loading of a large number of extensions,
  causing the targeted system in that network to crash. (CVE-2014-9715,
  Moderate)

  * It was found that the Linux kernel's ping socket implementation did not
  properly handle socket unhashing during spurious disconnects, which could
  lead to a use-after-free flaw. On x86-64 architecture systems, a local user
  able to create ping sockets could use this flaw to crash the system.
  On non-x86-64 architecture systems, a local user able to create ping
  sockets could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system.
  (CVE-2015-3636, Moderate)

  * It was found that the Linux kernel's TCP/IP protocol suite implementation
  for IPv6 allowed the Hop Limit value to be set to a smaller value than the
  default one. An attacker on a local network could use this flaw to prevent
  systems on that network from sending or receiving network packets.
  (CVE-2015-2922, Low)

  Red Hat would like to thank Nathan Hoad for reporting the CVE-2014-9715
  issue.

  This update provides a build of the kernel-rt package for Red Hat
  Enterprise MRG 2.5 that is layered on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and fixes
  the following issues:

  * drbg: Add stdrng alias and increase priority
  * seqiv / eseqiv / chainiv: Move IV seeding into init function
  * ipv4: kABI fix for 0bbf87d backport
  * ipv4: Convert ipv4.ip_local_port_range to be per netns
  * libceph: tcp_nodelay support
  * ipr: Increase default adapter init stage change timeout
  * fix use-after-free bug in usb_hcd_unlink_urb()
  * libceph: fix double __remove_osd() problem
  * ext4: fix data corruption caused by unwritten and delayed extents
  * sunrpc: Add missing support for RPC_CLNT_CREATE_NO_RETRANS_TIMEOUT
  * nfs: Fixing lease renewal (Benjamin Coddington)
  * control hard lockup detection default
  * Fix print-once on enable
  * watchdog: update watchdog_thresh properly and watchdog attributes
    atomically
  * module: Call module notifier on failure after complete_formation()

  (BZ#1230403)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Non-standard usage of the functions write_seqcount_{begin,end}() were
  used in NFSv4, which caused the realtime code to try to sleep while locks
  were held and produced the "scheduling while atomic" messages. The code was
  modified to use the functions __write_seqcount_{begin,end}() that do not
  hold any locks removing the message and allowing correct execution.
  (BZ#1225642)

  * Dracut in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 has a dependency on a module called
  scsi_wait_scan that no longer exists on 3.x kernels. This caused the system
  to display misleading messages at start-up when the obsoleted
  scsi_wait_scan module was not found. To address this issue, MRG Realtime
  provides a dummy scsi_wait_scan module so that the requirements for the
  initramfs created by dracut are met and the boot messages are no longer
  displayed. (BZ#1230403)

  All kernel-rt users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues and add these enhancements. The system must be
  rebooted for this update to take effect.
