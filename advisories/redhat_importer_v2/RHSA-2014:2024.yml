summary: |
  Updated ntp packages that fix several security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time
  with a referenced time source.

  Multiple buffer overflow flaws were discovered in ntpd's crypto_recv(),
  ctl_putdata(), and configure() functions. A remote attacker could use
  either of these flaws to send a specially crafted request packet that could
  crash ntpd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
  the ntp user. Note: the crypto_recv() flaw requires non-default
  configurations to be active, while the ctl_putdata() flaw, by default, can
  only be exploited via local attackers, and the configure() flaw requires
  additional authentication to exploit. (CVE-2014-9295)

  It was found that ntpd automatically generated weak keys for its internal
  use if no ntpdc request authentication key was specified in the ntp.conf
  configuration file. A remote attacker able to match the configured IP
  restrictions could guess the generated key, and possibly use it to send
  ntpdc query or configuration requests. (CVE-2014-9293)

  It was found that ntp-keygen used a weak method for generating MD5 keys.
  This could possibly allow an attacker to guess generated MD5 keys that
  could then be used to spoof an NTP client or server. Note: it is
  recommended to regenerate any MD5 keys that had explicitly been generated
  with ntp-keygen; the default installation does not contain such keys).
  (CVE-2014-9294)

  A missing return statement in the receive() function could potentially
  allow a remote attacker to bypass NTP's authentication mechanism.
  (CVE-2014-9296)

  All ntp users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing the
  update, the ntpd daemon will restart automatically.
