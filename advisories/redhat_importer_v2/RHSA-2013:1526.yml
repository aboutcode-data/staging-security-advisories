summary: |
  Updated nagios packages that fix two security issues are now available
  for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Nagios is a program that can monitor hosts and services on your network. It
  can send email or page alerts when problems arise and when problems are
  resolved.

  Multiple insecure temporary file creation flaws were found in Nagios.
  A local attacker could use these flaws to cause arbitrary files to be
  overwritten as the root user via a symbolic link attack. (CVE-2013-2029,
  CVE-2013-4214)

  These issues were discovered by Grant Murphy of the Red Hat Product
  Security Team.

  All users of Nagios are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
