  - CVE-2015-8080
summary: "Updated redis packages that fix a security issue are now available for\nRed Hat Enterprise\
  \ Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having\
  \ Moderate security\nimpact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which\n\
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the\nReferences section.\n\
  \nRedis is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data \nstructure server\
  \ because keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, or \nsorted sets.\n\nAn integer-wraparound\
  \ flaw leading to a stack-based overflow was found in\nRedis. A user with access to run Lua\
  \ code in a Redis session could possibly \nuse this flaw to crash the server (denial of service)\
  \ or gain code\nexecution outside of the Lua sandbox. (CVE-2015-8080)\n\nAll users of redis\
  \ are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncorrect this issue."
