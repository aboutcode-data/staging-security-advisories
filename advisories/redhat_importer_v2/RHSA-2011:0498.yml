summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix several security issues, various bugs, and
  add an enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  Security fixes:

  * An integer overflow flaw in ib_uverbs_poll_cq() could allow a local,
  unprivileged user to cause a denial of service or escalate their
  privileges. (CVE-2010-4649, Important)

  * An integer signedness flaw in drm_modeset_ctl() could allow a local,
  unprivileged user to cause a denial of service or escalate their
  privileges. (CVE-2011-1013, Important)

  * The Radeon GPU drivers in the Linux kernel were missing sanity checks for
  the Anti Aliasing (AA) resolve register values which could allow a local,
  unprivileged user to cause a denial of service or escalate their privileges
  on systems using a graphics card from the ATI Radeon R300, R400, or R500
  family of cards. (CVE-2011-1016, Important)

  * A flaw in dccp_rcv_state_process() could allow a remote attacker to
  cause a denial of service, even when the socket was already closed.
  (CVE-2011-1093, Important)

  * A flaw in the Linux kernel's Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)
  implementation could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service
  if the sysctl "net.sctp.addip_enable" and "auth_enable" variables were
  turned on (they are off by default). (CVE-2011-1573, Important)

  * A memory leak in the inotify_init() system call. In some cases, it could
  leak a group, which could allow a local, unprivileged user to eventually
  cause a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4250, Moderate)

  * A missing validation of a null-terminated string data structure element
  in bnep_sock_ioctl() could allow a local user to cause an information leak
  or a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1079, Moderate)

  * An information leak in bcm_connect() in the Controller Area Network (CAN)
  Broadcast Manager implementation could allow a local, unprivileged user to
  leak kernel mode addresses in "/proc/net/can-bcm". (CVE-2010-4565, Low)

  * A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Integrity Measurement Architecture
  (IMA) implementation. When SELinux was disabled, adding an IMA rule which
  was supposed to be processed by SELinux would cause ima_match_rules() to
  always succeed, ignoring any remaining rules. (CVE-2011-0006, Low)

  * A missing initialization flaw in the XFS file system implementation could
  lead to an information leak. (CVE-2011-0711, Low)

  * Buffer overflow flaws in snd_usb_caiaq_audio_init() and
  snd_usb_caiaq_midi_init() could allow a local, unprivileged user with
  access to a Native Instruments USB audio device to cause a denial of
  service or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2011-0712, Low)

  * The start_code and end_code values in "/proc/[pid]/stat" were not
  protected. In certain scenarios, this flaw could be used to defeat Address
  Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). (CVE-2011-0726, Low)

  * A flaw in dev_load() could allow a local user who has the CAP_NET_ADMIN
  capability to load arbitrary modules from "/lib/modules/", instead of only
  netdev modules. (CVE-2011-1019, Low)

  * A flaw in ib_uverbs_poll_cq() could allow a local, unprivileged user to
  cause an information leak. (CVE-2011-1044, Low)

  * A missing validation of a null-terminated string data structure element
  in do_replace() could allow a local user who has the CAP_NET_ADMIN
  capability to cause an information leak. (CVE-2011-1080, Low)

  Red Hat would like to thank Vegard Nossum for reporting CVE-2010-4250;
  Vasiliy Kulikov for reporting CVE-2011-1079, CVE-2011-1019, and
  CVE-2011-1080; Dan Rosenberg for reporting CVE-2010-4565 and CVE-2011-0711;
  Rafael Dominguez Vega for reporting CVE-2011-0712; and Kees Cook for
  reporting CVE-2011-0726.

  This update also fixes various bugs and adds an enhancement. Documentation
  for these changes will be available shortly from the Technical Notes
  document linked to in the References section.

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
  patches to resolve these issues, and fix the bugs and add the enhancement
  noted in the Technical Notes. The system must be rebooted for this update
  to take effect.
