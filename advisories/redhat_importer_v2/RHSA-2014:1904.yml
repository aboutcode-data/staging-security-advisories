summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss Operations Network 3.2.3, which fixes multiple security
  issues and several bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Operations Network is a middleware management solution that
  provides a single point of control to deploy, manage, and monitor JBoss
  Enterprise Middleware, applications, and services.

  This JBoss Operations Network 3.3.0 release serves as a replacement for
  JBoss Operations Network 3.2.3, and includes several bug fixes. Refer to
  the JBoss Operations Network 3.3.0 Release Notes for information on the
  most significant of these changes. The Release Notes will be available
  shortly from https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/

  The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

  It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-5783 was incomplete: the code added
  to check that the server host name matches the domain name in a subject's
  Common Name (CN) field in X.509 certificates was flawed. A
  man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server
  using a specially crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2012-6153, CVE-2014-3577)

  It was found that the default context parameters as provided to RESTEasy
  deployments by JBoss EAP did not explicitly disable external entity
  expansion for RESTEasy. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform
  XML External Entity (XXE) attacks on RESTEasy applications accepting XML
  input. (CVE-2014-3481)

  It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-0818 was incomplete: external
  parameter entities were not disabled when the
  resteasy.document.expand.entity.references parameter was set to false.
  A remote attacker able to send XML requests to a RESTEasy endpoint could
  use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application
  server, and potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks.
  (CVE-2014-3490)

  The HawtJNI Library class wrote native libraries to a predictable file name
  in /tmp when the native libraries were bundled in a JAR file, and no custom
  library path was specified. A local attacker could overwrite these native
  libraries with malicious versions during the window between when HawtJNI
  writes them and when they are executed. (CVE-2013-2035)

  It was found that the security auditing functionality provided by PicketBox
  and JBossSX, both security frameworks for Java applications, used a
  world-readable audit.log file to record sensitive information. A local user
  could possibly use this flaw to gain access to the sensitive information in
  the audit.log file. (CVE-2014-0059)

  The CVE-2013-2035 and CVE-2012-6153 issues were discovered by Florian
  Weimer of Red Hat Product Security. The CVE-2014-3481 issue was discovered
  by the Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform QE team. The
  CVE-2014-3490 issue was discovered by David Jorm of Red Hat Product
  Security.

  All users of JBoss Operations Network 3.2.3 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Operations Network 3.3.0.
