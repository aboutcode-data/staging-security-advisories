summary: "Updated ImageMagick packages that correct several security issues are now\navailable\
  \ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 2.1.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate\
  \ security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nImageMagick is an image display\
  \ and manipulation tool for the X Window\nSystem that can read and write multiple image formats.\n\
  \nSeveral heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in ImageMagick. If a\nvictim opened\
  \ a specially-crafted DCM or XWD file, an attacker could\npotentially execute arbitrary code\
  \ on the victim's machine. (CVE-2007-1797) \n\nSeveral denial of service flaws were found\
  \ in ImageMagick's parsing of XCF\nand DCM files. Attempting to process a specially crafted\
  \ input file in\nthese formats could cause ImageMagick to enter an infinite loop.\n(CVE-2007-4985)\
  \ \n\nSeveral integer overflow flaws were found in ImageMagick. If a victim\nopened a specially-crafted\
  \ DCM, DIB, XBM, XCF or XWD file, an attacker\ncould potentially execute arbitrary code with\
  \ the privileges of the user\nrunning ImageMagick. (CVE-2007-4986)\n\nA heap-based buffer\
  \ overflow flaw was found in ImageMagick's processing of\ncertain malformed PCX images. If\
  \ a victim opened a specially-crafted PCX\nfile, an attacker could possibly execute arbitrary\
  \ code with the privileges\nof the user running ImageMagick.. (CVE-2008-1097)\n\nAll users\
  \ of ImageMagick should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches\
  \ to correct these issues."
