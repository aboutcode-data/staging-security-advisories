  - CVE-2010-2755
summary: |
  Updated seamonkey packages that fix a security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  SeaMonkey is an open source web browser, email and newsgroup client, IRC
  chat client, and HTML editor.

  An invalid free flaw was found in SeaMonkey's plugin handler. Malicious web content could result in an invalid memory pointer being freed, causing SeaMonkey to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2010-2755)

  All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
  this issue. After installing the update, SeaMonkey must be restarted for
  the changes to take effect.
