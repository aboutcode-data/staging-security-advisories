summary: |
  Updated nss and nspr packages that fix one security issue, various bugs,
  and add enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact.

  Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to support
  the cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server
  applications. Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) provides platform
  independence for non-GUI operating system facilities.

  It was found that a Certificate Authority (CA) mis-issued two intermediate
  certificates to customers. These certificates could be used to launch
  man-in-the-middle attacks. This update renders those certificates as
  untrusted. This covers all uses of the certificates, including SSL, S/MIME,
  and code signing. (BZ#890605)

  In addition, the nss package has been upgraded to upstream version 3.13.6,
  and the nspr package has been upgraded to upstream version 4.9.2. These
  updates provide a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous
  versions. (BZ#893371, BZ#893372)

  All NSS and NSPR users should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues and add these enhancements. After installing the
  update, applications using NSS and NSPR must be restarted for the changes
  to take effect.
