aliases:
  - CVE-2022-48624
  - CVE-2024-32487
summary: |
  An update for less is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The "less" utility is a text file browser that resembles "more", but allows users to move backwards in the file as well as forwards. Since "less" does not read the entire input file at startup, it also starts more quickly than ordinary text editors.

  Security Fix(es):

  * less: OS command injection (CVE-2024-32487)

  * less: missing quoting of shell metacharacters in LESSCLOSE handling (CVE-2022-48624)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.
