  Security Fix(es):

  * An EAP feature to download server log files allows logs to be available via GET requests making them vulnerable to cross-origin attacks. An attacker could trigger the user's browser to request the log files consuming enough resources that normal server functioning could be impaired. (CVE-2016-8627)

  * It was discovered that when configuring RBAC and marking information as sensitive, users with a Monitor role are able to view the sensitive information. (CVE-2016-7061)

  The CVE-2016-8627 issue was discovered by Darran Lofthouse and Brian Stansberry (Red Hat).
