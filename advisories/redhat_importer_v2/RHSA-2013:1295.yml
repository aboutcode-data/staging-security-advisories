  - CVE-2013-4284
summary: "Updated Grid component packages that fix one security issue, multiple bugs,\nand add\
  \ various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG\n2.4 for Red Hat Enterprise\
  \ Linux 5.\n\nThe Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate\n\
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,\nwhich gives a detailed\
  \ severity rating, is available from the CVE link in\nthe References section.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise\
  \ MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a next-generation\nIT infrastructure for enterprise\
  \ computing. MRG offers increased\nperformance, reliability, interoperability, and faster\
  \ computing for\nenterprise customers.\n\nMRG Grid provides high-throughput computing and\
  \ enables enterprises to\nachieve higher peak computing capacity as well as improved infrastructure\n\
  utilization by leveraging their existing technology to build high\nperformance grids. MRG\
  \ Grid provides a job-queueing mechanism, scheduling\npolicy, and a priority scheme, as well\
  \ as resource monitoring and resource\nmanagement. Users submit their jobs to MRG Grid, where\
  \ they are placed into\na queue. MRG Grid then chooses when and where to run the jobs based\
  \ upon a\npolicy, carefully monitors their progress, and ultimately informs the user\nupon\
  \ completion.\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way cumin, a web management\nconsole\
  \ for MRG, processed certain Ajax update queries. A remote attacker\ncould use this flaw to\
  \ issue a specially crafted HTTP request, causing\nexcessive use of CPU time and memory on\
  \ the system. (CVE-2013-4284)\n\nThe CVE-2013-4284 issue was discovered by Tomas Novacik of\
  \ Red Hat.\n\nThese updated packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 provide numerous\nenhancements\
  \ and bug fixes for the Grid component of MRG. Some of the most\nimportant enhancements include:\n\
  \n* Improved resource utilization with scheduler driven slot partitioning\n* Enhanced integration\
  \ with existing user & group management \ntechnology, specifically allowing group and netgroup\
  \ specifications in \nHTCondor security policies\n* Addition of global job priorities, allowing\
  \ for priority to span \nscaled-out queues\n* Reduced memory utilization per running job\n\
  \nSpace precludes documenting all of these changes in this advisory. Refer to\nthe Red Hat\
  \ Enterprise MRG 2 Technical Notes document, available shortly\nfrom the link in the References\
  \ section, for information on these changes.\n\nAll users of the Grid capabilities of Red\
  \ Hat Enterprise MRG are advised to\nupgrade to these updated packages, which correct this\
  \ issue, and fix the\nbugs and add the enhancements noted in the Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2\n\
  Technical Notes."
