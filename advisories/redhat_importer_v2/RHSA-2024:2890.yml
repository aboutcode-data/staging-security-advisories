  - CVE-2023-50868
summary: |
  An update for bind is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 Advanced Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named); a resolver library (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.

  The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol that allows individual devices on an IP network to get their own network configuration information, including an IP address, a subnet mask, and a broadcast address. The dhcp packages provide a relay agent and ISC DHCP service required to enable and administer DHCP on a network.

  Security Fix(es):

  * bind: KeyTrap - Extreme CPU consumption in DNSSEC validator (CVE-2023-50387)

  * bind: Preparing an NSEC3 closest encloser proof can exhaust CPU resources (CVE-2023-50868)

  * bind: Parsing large DNS messages may cause excessive CPU load (CVE-2023-4408)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.
