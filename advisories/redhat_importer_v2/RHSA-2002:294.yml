summary: "Updated Fetchmail packages are available for Red Hat Linux Advanced Server\nwhich\
  \ close a remotely-exploitable vulnerability in unpatched versions of\nFetchmail prior to\
  \ 6.2.0.\n\n[Updated 06 Feb 2003]\nAdded fixed packages for Advanced Workstation\n\nFetchmail\
  \ is a remote mail retrieval and forwarding utility intended for\nuse over on-demand TCP/IP\
  \ links such as SLIP and PPP connections.  A bug\nhas been found in the header parsing code\
  \ in versions of Fetchmail prior\nto 6.2.0.  \n\nThe bug allows a remote attacker to crash\
  \ Fetchmail and potentially execute\narbitrary code by sending a carefully crafted email which\
  \ is parsed by\nFetchmail.\n\nAll users of Fetchmail are advised to upgrade to the errata\
  \ packages\ncontaining a backported fix which corrects this issue."
