summary: |
  Updated httpd packages that fix multiple security issues, various bugs,
  and add enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The httpd packages contain the Apache HTTP Server (httpd), which is the
  namesake project of The Apache Software Foundation.

  Input sanitization flaws were found in the mod_negotiation module. A remote
  attacker able to upload or create files with arbitrary names in a directory
  that has the MultiViews options enabled, could use these flaws to conduct
  cross-site scripting and HTTP response splitting attacks against users
  visiting the site. (CVE-2008-0455, CVE-2008-0456, CVE-2012-2687)

  Bug fixes:

  * Previously, no check was made to see if the
  /etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key file was a valid key prior to running
  the "%post" script for the "mod_ssl" package. Consequently, when
  /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt did not exist and "localhost.key" was
  present but invalid, upgrading the Apache HTTP Server daemon (httpd) with
  mod_ssl failed. The "%post" script has been fixed to test for an existing
  SSL key. As a result, upgrading httpd with mod_ssl now proceeds as
  expected. (BZ#752618)

  * The "mod_ssl" module did not support operation under FIPS mode.
  Consequently, when operating Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 with FIPS mode
  enabled, httpd failed to start. An upstream patch has been applied to
  disable non-FIPS functionality if operating under FIPS mode and httpd now
  starts as expected. (BZ#773473)

  * Prior to this update, httpd exit status codes were not Linux Standard
  Base (LSB) compliant. When the command "service httpd reload" was run and
  httpd failed, the exit status code returned was "0" and not in the range 1
  to 6 as expected. A patch has been applied to the init script and httpd now
  returns "1" as an exit status code. (BZ#783242)

  * Chunked Transfer Coding is described in RFC 2616. Previously, the
  Apache server did not correctly handle a chunked encoded POST request with
  a "chunk-size" or "chunk-extension" value of 32 bytes or more.
  Consequently, when such a POST request was made the server did not respond.
  An upstream patch has been applied and the problem no longer occurs.
  (BZ#840845)

  * Due to a regression, when mod_cache received a non-cacheable 304
  response, the headers were served incorrectly. Consequently, compressed
  data could be returned to the client without the cached headers to indicate
  the data was compressed. An upstream patch has been applied to merge
  response and cached headers before data from the cache is served to the
  client. As a result, cached data is now correctly interpreted by the
  client. (BZ#845532)

  * In a proxy configuration, certain response-line strings were not handled
  correctly. If a response-line without a "description" string was received
  from the origin server, for a non-standard status code, such as the "450"
  status code, a "500 Internal Server Error" would be returned to the client.
  This bug has been fixed so that the original response line is returned to
  the client. (BZ#853128)

  Enhancements:

  * The configuration directive "LDAPReferrals" is now supported in addition
  to the previously introduced "LDAPChaseReferrals". (BZ#727342)

  * The AJP support module for "mod_proxy", "mod_proxy_ajp", now supports the
  "ProxyErrorOverride" directive. Consequently, it is now possible to
  configure customized error pages for web applications running on a backend
  server accessed via AJP. (BZ#767890)

  * The "%posttrans" scriptlet which automatically restarts the httpd service
  after a package upgrade can now be disabled. If the file
  /etc/sysconfig/httpd-disable-posttrans exists, the scriptlet will not
  restart the daemon. (BZ#833042)

  * The output of "httpd -S" now includes configured alias names for each
  virtual host. (BZ#833043)

  * New certificate variable names are now exposed by "mod_ssl" using the
  "_DN_userID" suffix, such as "SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_userID", which use the
  commonly used object identifier (OID) definition of "userID", OID
  0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.1. (BZ#840036)

  All users of httpd are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  fix these issues and add these enhancements.
