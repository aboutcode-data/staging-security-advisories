  - CVE-2002-0638
summary: "The util-linux package shipped with Red Hat Linux Advanced Server contains\na locally\
  \ exploitable vulnerability.\n\nThe util-linux package contains a large variety of low-level\
  \ system\nutilities that are necessary for a Linux system to function.  The 'chfn'\nutility\
  \ included in this package allows users to modify personal\ninformation stored in the system-wide\
  \ password file, /etc/passwd. In order\nto modify this file, this application is installed\
  \ setuid root.\n\nUnder certain conditions, a carefully crafted attack sequence can be\nperformed\
  \ to exploit a complex file locking and modification race present\nin this utility allowing\
  \ changes to be made to /etc/passwd.  \n\nIn order to successfully exploit the vulnerability\
  \ and perform privilege\nescalation there is a need for a minimal administrator interaction.\
  \ \nAdditionally, the password file must be over 4 kilobytes, and the local\nattackers entry\
  \ must not be in the last 4 kilobytes of the password file.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0638 to this issue.\n\
  \nAn interim workaround is to remove setuid flags from /usr/bin/chfn and\n/usr/bin/chsh. \
  \ All users of Red Hat Linux should update to the errata\nutil-linux packages which contain\
  \ a patch to correct this vulnerability.\n\nMany thanks to Michal Zalewski of Bindview for\
  \ alerting us to this issue."
