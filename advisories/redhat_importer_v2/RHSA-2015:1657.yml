summary: |
  Updated rh-ruby22-ruby packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Software Collections 2.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Ruby is an extensible, interpreted, object-oriented, scripting language.
  It has features to process text files and to perform system management
  tasks.

  A flaw was found in a way rubygems verified the API endpoint hostname
  retrieved through a DNS SRV record. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use
  this flaw to force a client to download content from an untrusted domain.
  (CVE-2015-3900)

  All rh-ruby22-ruby users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch to correct this issue. All running
  instances of Ruby need to be restarted for this update to take effect.
