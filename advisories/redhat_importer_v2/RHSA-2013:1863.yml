  - CVE-2013-6439
summary: |
  Updated candlepin packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Candlepin is an open source entitlement management system. It tracks the
  products which an owner has subscribed too, and allows the owner to consume
  the subscriptions based on configurable business rules.

  It was discovered that, by default, Candlepin enabled a very weak
  authentication scheme if no setting was specified in the configuration
  file. (CVE-2013-6439)

  This issue was discovered by Adrian Likins of Red Hat.

  Note: The configuration file as supplied by Subscription Asset Manager 1.2
  and 1.3 had this unsafe authentication mode disabled; however, users who
  have upgraded from Subscription Asset Manager 1.1 or earlier and who have
  not added "candlepin.auth.trusted.enable = false" to the Candlepin
  configuration will be affected by this issue.

  Users of Subscription Asset Manager 1.0 or 1.1 who cannot upgrade
  should add the following to "/etc/candlepin/candlepin.conf":

  candlepin.auth.trusted.enable = false
  candlepin.auth.trusted.enabled = false

  Users of Subscription Asset Manager 1.2 or 1.3 who cannot upgrade should
  only need to add:

  candlepin.auth.trusted.enable = false

  Installing this upgrade disables the unsafe authentication scheme unless
  it is specifically enabled in the configuration.

  Users of Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager are advised to upgrade to
  these updated packages, which correct this issue. Candlepin must be
  restarted for this update to take effect.
