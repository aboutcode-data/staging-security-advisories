summary: |
  An update for tomcat is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Apache Tomcat is a servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP) technologies.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A vulnerability was discovered in the error page mechanism in Tomcat's DefaultServlet implementation. A crafted HTTP request could cause undesired side effects, possibly including the removal or replacement of the custom error page. (CVE-2017-5664)

  * A vulnerability was discovered in Tomcat. When running an untrusted application under a SecurityManager it was possible, under some circumstances, for that application to retain references to the request or response objects and thereby access and/or modify information associated with another web application. (CVE-2017-5648)
