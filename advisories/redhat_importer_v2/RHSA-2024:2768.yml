  - CVE-2023-48795
summary: |
  An update for python-paramiko is now available for Red Hat OpenStack
  Platform 17.1 (Wallaby).

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact
  of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from
  the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Paramiko, a combination of the esperanto words for paranoid and friend, is
  a module for python 2.3 or greater that implements the SSH2 protocol for
  secure (encrypted and authenticated) connections to remote machines. Unlike
  SSL (aka TLS), the SSH2 protocol does not require heirarchical certificates
  signed by a powerful central authority. You may know SSH2 as the protocol
  that replaced telnet and rsh for secure access to remote shells, but the
  protocol also includes the ability to open arbitrary channels to remote
  services across an encrypted tunnel. This is how sftp works, for example.

  Security Fix(es):

  * Prefix truncation attack on Binary Packet Protocol (BPP) (CVE-2023-48795)
