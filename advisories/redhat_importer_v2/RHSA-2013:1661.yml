  - CVE-2012-4516
  - CVE-2013-2561
summary: |
  Updated rdma, libibverbs, libmlx4, librdmacm, qperf, perftest, openmpi,
  compat-openmpi, infinipath-psm, mpitests, and rds-tools packages that fix
  two security issues, several bugs, and add various enhancements are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat Enterprise Linux includes a collection of Infiniband and iWARP
  utilities, libraries and development packages for writing applications that
  use Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) technology.

  A flaw was found in the way ibutils handled temporary files. A local
  attacker could use this flaw to cause arbitrary files to be overwritten as
  the root user via a symbolic link attack. (CVE-2013-2561)

  It was discovered that librdmacm used a static port to connect to the
  ib_acm service. A local attacker able to run a specially crafted ib_acm
  service on that port could use this flaw to provide incorrect address
  resolution information to librmdacm applications. (CVE-2012-4516)

  The CVE-2012-4516 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat
  Product Security Team.

  This advisory updates the following packages to the latest upstream
  releases, providing a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
  previous versions:

  * libibverbs-1.1.7
  * libmlx4-1.0.5
  * librdmacm-1.0.17
  * mstflint-3.0
  * perftest-2.0
  * qperf-0.4.9
  * rdma-3.10

  Several bugs have been fixed in the openmpi, mpitests, ibutils, and
  infinipath-psm packages.

  The most notable changes in these updated packages from the RDMA stack are
  the following:

  * Multiple bugs in the Message Passing Interface (MPI) test packages were
  resolved, allowing more of the mpitest applications to pass on the
  underlying MPI implementations.

  * The libmlx4 package now includes dracut module files to ensure that any
  necessary custom configuration of mlx4 port types is included in the
  initramfs dracut builds.

  * Multiple test programs in the perftest and qperf packages now work
  properly over RoCE interfaces, or when specifying the use of rdmacm
  queue pairs.

  * The mstflint package has been updated to the latest upstream version,
  which is now capable of burning firmware on newly released Mellanox
  Connect-IB hardware.

  * A compatibility problem between the openmpi and infinipath-psm packages
  has been resolved with new builds of these packages.

  All RDMA users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues and add
  these enhancements.
