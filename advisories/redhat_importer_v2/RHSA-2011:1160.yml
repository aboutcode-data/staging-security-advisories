  - CVE-2011-2749
summary: |
  Updated dhcp packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol that allows
  individual devices on an IP network to get their own network configuration
  information, including an IP address, a subnet mask, and a broadcast
  address.

  Two denial of service flaws were found in the way the dhcpd daemon handled
  certain incomplete request packets. A remote attacker could use these flaws
  to crash dhcpd via a specially-crafted request. (CVE-2011-2748,
  CVE-2011-2749)

  Users of DHCP should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct these issues. After installing this update, all
  DHCP servers will be restarted automatically.
