  - CVE-2014-9623
summary: |
  Updated openstack-glance packages that fix one security issue and several
  bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  OpenStack Image service (glance) provides discovery, registration, and
  delivery services for disk and server images. It provides the ability to
  copy or snapshot a server image, and immediately store it away.
  Stored images can be used as a template to get new servers up and running
  quickly and more consistently than installing a server operating system and
  individually configuring additional services.

  A storage quota bypass flaw was found in OpenStack Image (glance). If an
  image was deleted while it was being uploaded, it would not count towards a
  user's quota. A malicious user could use this flaw to deliberately fill the
  backing store, and cause a denial of service. (CVE-2014-9623)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Tushar Patil of NTT as the original reporter.

  The openstack-glance packages have been upgraded to upstream version
  2014.1.4, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.
  (BZ#1203227)

  All openstack-glance users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues.
