  - CVE-2009-4212
summary: |
  Updated krb5 packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.7,
  5.2, and 5.3 Extended Update Support.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Kerberos is a network authentication system which allows clients and
  servers to authenticate to each other using symmetric encryption and a
  trusted third party, the Key Distribution Center (KDC).

  Multiple integer underflow flaws, leading to heap-based corruption, were
  found in the way the MIT Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) decrypted
  ciphertexts encrypted with the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and
  ARCFOUR (RC4) encryption algorithms. If a remote KDC client were able to
  provide a specially-crafted AES- or RC4-encrypted ciphertext or texts, it
  could potentially lead to either a denial of service of the central KDC
  (KDC crash or abort upon processing the crafted ciphertext), or arbitrary
  code execution with the privileges of the KDC (i.e., root privileges).
  (CVE-2009-4212)

  All krb5 users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct these issues. All running services using the
  MIT Kerberos libraries must be restarted for the update to take effect.
