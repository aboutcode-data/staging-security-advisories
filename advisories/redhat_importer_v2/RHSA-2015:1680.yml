  - CVE-2015-3221
summary: |
  Updated openstack-neutron packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  OpenStack Networking (Neutron) is a pluggable, scalable, and API-driven
  system that provisions networking services to virtual machines. Its main
  function is to manage connectivity to and from virtual machines.

  A Denial of Service flaw was found in the L2 agent when using the IPTables
  firewall driver. By submitting an address pair that will be rejected as
  invalid by the ipset tool, an attacker may cause the agent to crash.
  (CVE-2015-3221)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack upstream for reporting this
  issue. Upstream acknowledges Darragh O'Reilly (HP) as the original reporter.

  Additionally, the packages address the following issues:
  * Neutron failed to load multiple configuration files. The Puppet recipe
  hard-coded the --config-file parameter to a set list of configuration files
  and additional files were not loaded, even if specified. This fix creates a
  new Neutron configuration directory, /etc/neutron/conf.d, and any .conf
  files in that directory are loaded by Puppet and applied to all services.
  (BZ#1188480)

  * When configuring load balancer as a service, the Neutron configuration
  used no group as the default system user group. This group does not exist
  in the default Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 configuration, which caused the
  virtual IP address creation to fail with the error "cannot find group id
  for 'nogroup'." (BZ#1208002)

  * Log rotation was set to one week for Neutron, but that could allow the
  log file to grow to be very large before rotating. The default log rotation
  policy has been updated to include a size limit of 10MB as well as a time
  limit to rotate daily. (BZ#1212442)

  * Previously, dnsmasq did not save lease information in persistent storage.
  When it was restarted, the lease information was lost. This behavior
  resulted from removing the '--dhcp-script' option as part of fixing
  BZ#1202392. As a result, instances were stuck in the network boot process
  for a long period of time. In addition, NACK messages were noted in the
  dnsmasq log. This update removes the authoritative option, so that NAKs are
  not sent in response to DHCPREQUESTs to other servers. This change is
  expected to prevent dnsmasq from NAKing clients renewing leases issued
  before it was restarted/rescheduled. DHCPNAK messages should no longer be
  found in the log files. (BZ#1227635)

  * Conflict tags were included in the python-neutron package spec that
  resulted in Neutron unnecessarily blocking the python-oslo-db package.
  These conflicts have been removed from the spec, so the python-oslo-db
  package can be successfully installed. (BZ#1250056)

  All openstack-neutron users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.
