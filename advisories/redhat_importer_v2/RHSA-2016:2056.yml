summary: |
  An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  This release includes bug fixes and enhancements, as well as a new release of OpenSSL that addresses a number of outstanding security flaws. For further information, see the knowledge base article linked to in the References section. All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A flaw was found in the way OpenSSL encoded certain ASN.1 data structures. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially crafted certificate which, when verified or re-encoded by OpenSSL, could cause it to crash, or execute arbitrary code using the permissions of the user running an application compiled against the OpenSSL library. (CVE-2016-2108)

  * Multiple flaws were found in the way httpd parsed HTTP requests and responses using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could use these flaws to create a specially crafted request, which httpd would decode differently from an HTTP proxy software in front of it, possibly leading to HTTP request smuggling attacks. (CVE-2015-3183)

  * A memory leak vulnerability was found in the way OpenSSL parsed PKCS#7 and CMS data. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause an application that parses PKCS#7 or CMS data from untrusted sources to use an excessive amount of memory and possibly crash. (CVE-2015-3195)

  * A flaw was found in the way the TLS protocol composes the Diffie-Hellman exchange (for both export and non-export grade cipher suites). An attacker could use this flaw to downgrade a DHE connection to use export-grade key sizes, which could then be broken by sufficient pre-computation. This can lead to a passive man-in-the-middle attack in which the attacker is able to decrypt all traffic. (CVE-2015-4000)

  * An integer overflow flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in the way the EVP_EncodeUpdate() function of OpenSSL parsed very large amounts of input data. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash an application using OpenSSL or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running that application. (CVE-2016-2105)

  * An integer overflow flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in the way the EVP_EncryptUpdate() function of OpenSSL parsed very large amounts of input data. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash an application using OpenSSL or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running that application. (CVE-2016-2106)

  * It was discovered that it is possible to remotely Segfault Apache http server with a specially crafted string sent to the mod_cluster via service messages (MCMP). (CVE-2016-3110)

  * A denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenSSL parsed certain ASN.1-encoded data from BIO (OpenSSL's I/O abstraction) inputs. An application using OpenSSL that accepts untrusted ASN.1 BIO input could be forced to allocate an excessive amount of data. (CVE-2016-2109)

  * It was discovered that specifying configuration with a JVMRoute path longer than 80 characters will cause segmentation fault leading to a server crash. (CVE-2016-4459)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-2108, CVE-2016-2105, and CVE-2016-2106 and Michal Karm Babacek for reporting CVE-2016-3110. The CVE-2016-4459 issue was discovered by Robert Bost (Red Hat). Upstream acknowledges Huzaifa Sidhpurwala (Red Hat), Hanno Böck, and David Benjamin (Google) as the original reporters of CVE-2016-2108; and Guido Vranken as the original reporter of CVE-2016-2105 and CVE-2016-2106.
