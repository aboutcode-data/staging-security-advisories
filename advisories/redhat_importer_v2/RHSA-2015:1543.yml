summary: |
  An update for the PortletBridge component of Red Hat JBoss Portal 6.2.0
  that fixes one security issue is now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Portal is the open source implementation of the Java EE suite
  of services and Portal services running atop Red Hat JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform.

  It was found that PortletBridge PortletRequestDispatcher did not respect
  security constraints set by the servlet if a portlet request asked for
  rendering of a non-JSF resource such as JSP or HTML. A remote attacker
  could use this flaw to potentially bypass certain security constraints and
  gain access to restricted resources. (CVE-2015-5176)

  Red Hat would like to thank Liferay, Inc. for reporting this issue.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Portal 6.2.0 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
