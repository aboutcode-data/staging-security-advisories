aliases:
  - CVE-2002-0178
summary: |
  Updated packages for sharutils which fix potential privilege escalation
  using the uudecode utility are available.

  The sharutils package contains a set of tools for encoding and decoding
  packages of files in binary or text format.

  The uudecode utility creates an output file without checking to see if
  it was about to write to a symlink or a pipe. If a user uses uudecode to
  extract data into open shared directories, such as /tmp, this vulnerability
  could be used by a local attacker to overwrite files or lead to privilege
  escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2002-0178 to this issue.

  Users are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which
  contain a patch that resolves this issue.
