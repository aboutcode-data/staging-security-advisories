summary: |
  Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.1.1 is now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  OpenShift Enterprise is a cloud computing Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
  solution from Red Hat, and is designed for on-premise or private cloud
  deployments.

  Installing the updated packages and restarting the OpenShift services are
  the only requirements for this update. However, if you are updating your
  system to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 while applying OpenShift Enterprise
  1.1.1 updates, it is recommended that you restart your system.

  For further information about this release, refer to the OpenShift
  Enterprise 1.1.1 Technical Notes, available shortly from
  https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/

  This update also fixes the following security issues:

  Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in rubygem-actionpack.
  A remote attacker could use these flaws to conduct XSS attacks against
  users of an application using rubygem-actionpack. (CVE-2012-3463,
  CVE-2012-3464, CVE-2012-3465)

  It was found that certain methods did not sanitize file names before
  passing them to lower layer routines in Ruby. If a Ruby application created
  files with names based on untrusted input, it could result in the creation
  of files with different names than expected. (CVE-2012-4522)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the implementation of associative
  arrays (hashes) in Ruby. An attacker able to supply a large number of
  inputs to a Ruby application (such as HTTP POST request parameters sent to
  a web application) that are used as keys when inserting data into an array
  could trigger multiple hash function collisions, making array operations
  take an excessive amount of CPU time. To mitigate this issue, a new, more
  collision resistant algorithm has been used to reduce the chance of an
  attacker successfully causing intentional collisions. (CVE-2012-5371)

  Input validation vulnerabilities were discovered in rubygem-activerecord.
  A remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to perform an SQL
  injection attack against an application using rubygem-activerecord.
  (CVE-2012-2661, CVE-2012-2695, CVE-2013-0155)

  Input validation vulnerabilities were discovered in rubygem-actionpack. A
  remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to perform an SQL injection
  attack against an application using rubygem-actionpack and
  rubygem-activerecord. (CVE-2012-2660, CVE-2012-2694)

  A flaw was found in the HTTP digest authentication implementation in
  rubygem-actionpack. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a
  denial of service of an application using rubygem-actionpack and digest
  authentication. (CVE-2012-3424)

  A flaw was found in the handling of strings in Ruby safe level 4. A remote
  attacker can use Exception#to_s to destructively modify an untainted string
  so that it is tainted, the string can then be arbitrarily modified.
  (CVE-2012-4466)

  A flaw was found in the method for translating an exception message into a
  string in the Ruby Exception class. A remote attacker could use this flaw
  to bypass safe level 4 restrictions, allowing untrusted (tainted) code to
  modify arbitrary, trusted (untainted) strings, which safe level 4
  restrictions would otherwise prevent. (CVE-2012-4464)

  It was found that ruby_parser from rubygem-ruby_parser created a temporary
  file in an insecure way. A local attacker could use this flaw to perform a
  symbolic link attack, overwriting arbitrary files accessible to the
  application using ruby_parser. (CVE-2013-0162)

  The CVE-2013-0162 issue was discovered by Michael Scherer of the Red Hat
  Regional IT team.

  Users are advised to upgrade to Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.1.1.
