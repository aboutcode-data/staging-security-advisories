aliases:
  - CVE-2003-0192
summary: |
  An updated mod_ssl package is now available for Stronghold 4 on Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux that closes a security issue in certain rare configurations.

  Stronghold 4 contains a number of open source technologies, including the
  mod_ssl module (which provides SSL/TLS support for Apache).

  Ben Laurie found a bug in the optional renegotiation code in mod_ssl
  that can cause cipher suite restrictions to be ignored. This is triggered
  if optional renegotiation is used (SSLOptions +OptRenegotiate) along with
  verification of client certificates and a change to the cipher suite over
  the renegotiation. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0192 to this issue.

  Users of Stronghold 4 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux may update to
  this erratum package, which contains a backported security fix and is not
  vulnerable to this issue.
