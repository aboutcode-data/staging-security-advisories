  - CVE-2010-0727
summary: |
  Updated gfs-kmod packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.4 Extended Update Support, kernel release
  2.6.18-164.19.1.el5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The gfs-kmod packages contain modules that provide the ability to mount and
  use GFS file systems.

  A flaw was found in the gfs_lock() implementation. The GFS locking code
  could skip the lock operation for files that have the S_ISGID bit
  (set-group-ID on execution) in their mode set. A local, unprivileged user
  on a system that has a GFS file system mounted could use this flaw to cause
  a kernel panic. (CVE-2010-0727)

  These updated gfs-kmod packages are in sync with the latest kernel
  (2.6.18-164.19.1.el5). The modules in earlier gfs-kmod packages failed to
  load because they did not match the running kernel. It was possible to
  force-load the modules. With this update, however, users no longer need to.

  Users are advised to upgrade to these latest gfs-kmod packages, updated for
  use with the 2.6.18-164.19.1.el5 kernel, which contain a backported patch
  to correct this issue.
