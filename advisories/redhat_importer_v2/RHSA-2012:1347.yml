summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix two security issues and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 Extended Update Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issues:

  * A flaw was found in the way socket buffers (skb) requiring TSO (TCP
  segment offloading) were handled by the sfc driver. If the skb did not fit
  within the minimum-size of the transmission queue, the network card could
  repeatedly reset itself. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a
  denial of service. (CVE-2012-3412, Important)

  * A buffer overflow flaw was found in the hfs_bnode_read() function in the
  HFS Plus (HFS+) file system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local
  user able to mount a specially-crafted HFS+ file system image could use
  this flaw to cause a denial of service or escalate their privileges.
  (CVE-2012-2319, Low)

  Red Hat would like to thank Ben Hutchings of Solarflare (tm) for reporting
  CVE-2012-3412.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * Some subsystems clear the TIF_SIGPENDING flag during error handling in
  fork() paths. Previously, if the flag was cleared, the ERESTARTNOINTR error
  code could be returned. The underlying source code has been modified so
  that the error code is no longer returned. (BZ#855754)

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
  patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
  update to take effect.
