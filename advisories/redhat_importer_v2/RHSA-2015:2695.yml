  - CVE-2015-7512
summary: |
  Updated qemu-kvm-rhev packages that fix two security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
  Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm-rhev package provides the
  user-space component for running virtual machines using KVM.

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the way QEMU's AMD
  PC-Net II Ethernet Controller emulation received certain packets in
  loopback mode. A privileged user (with the CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability) inside
  a guest could use this flaw to crash the host QEMU process (resulting in
  denial of service) or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with privileges
  of the host QEMU process. (CVE-2015-7504)

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way QEMU's AMD PC-Net II emulation
  validated certain received packets from a remote host in non-loopback mode.
  A remote, unprivileged attacker could potentially use this flaw to execute
  arbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.
  Note that to exploit this flaw, the guest network interface must have a
  large MTU limit. (CVE-2015-7512)

  Red Hat would like to thank Qinghao Tang of QIHU 360 Marvel Team and Ling
  Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc. for reporting the CVE-2015-7504 issue, and Ling Liu
  of Qihoo 360 Inc. for reporting the CVE-2015-7512 issue. The CVE-2015-7512
  issue was independently discovered by Jason Wang of Red Hat.

  All qemu-kvm-rhev users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing
  this update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all virtual
  machines have shut down, start them again for this update to take effect.
