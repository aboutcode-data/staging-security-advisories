summary: "Updated LPRng packages resolving a temporary file vulnerability are now\navailable.\n\
  \nLPRng is a print spooler.  LPRng includes a program, psbanner, that can be\nused to produce\
  \ Postscript banner pages to separate print jobs.  \n\nA vulnerability has been found in psbanner,\
  \ which creates in an insecure\nmanner a temporary file with a known filename.  An attacker\
  \ could create a\nsymbolic link and cause arbitrary files to be written as the lp user.\n\n\
  Note: psbanner is not used by the default Red Hat Enterprise Linux LPRng\nconfiguration.\n\
  \nUsers that have configured LPRng to use psbanner should install these\nupdated packages,\
  \ which contain a patch so that psbanner does not create\nthe temporary file."
