  - CVE-2009-2904
summary: |
  Updated openssh packages that fix a security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  OpenSSH is OpenBSD's SSH (Secure Shell) protocol implementation. These
  packages include the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH client and
  server.

  A Red Hat specific patch used in the openssh packages as shipped in Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 5.4 (RHSA-2009:1287) loosened certain ownership
  requirements for directories used as arguments for the ChrootDirectory
  configuration options. A malicious user that also has or previously had
  non-chroot shell access to a system could possibly use this flaw to
  escalate their privileges and run commands as any system user.
  (CVE-2009-2904)

  All OpenSSH users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to resolve this issue. After installing this
  update, the OpenSSH server daemon (sshd) will be restarted automatically.
