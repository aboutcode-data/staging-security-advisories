  - CVE-2010-1623
summary: |
  Updated apr-util packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The Apache Portable Runtime (APR) is a portability library used by the
  Apache HTTP Server and other projects. apr-util is a library which provides
  additional utility interfaces for APR; including support for XML parsing,
  LDAP, database interfaces, URI parsing, and more.

  It was found that certain input could cause the apr-util library to
  allocate more memory than intended in the apr_brigade_split_line()
  function. An attacker able to provide input in small chunks to an
  application using the apr-util library (such as httpd) could possibly use
  this flaw to trigger high memory consumption. (CVE-2010-1623)

  All apr-util users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  a backported patch to correct this issue. Applications using the apr-util
  library, such as httpd, must be restarted for this update to take effect.
