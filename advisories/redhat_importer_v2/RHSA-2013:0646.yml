summary: |
  Updated pidgin packages that fix three security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Pidgin is an instant messaging program which can log in to multiple
  accounts on multiple instant messaging networks simultaneously.

  A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the Pidgin MXit protocol
  plug-in. A malicious server or a remote attacker could use this flaw to
  crash Pidgin by sending a specially-crafted HTTP request. (CVE-2013-0272)

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the Pidgin Sametime protocol plug-in.
  A malicious server or a remote attacker could use this flaw to crash Pidgin
  by sending a specially-crafted username. (CVE-2013-0273)

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Pidgin processed certain UPnP
  responses. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted UPnP response
  that, when processed, would crash Pidgin. (CVE-2013-0274)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Pidgin project for reporting the above
  issues. Upstream acknowledges Daniel Atallah as the original reporter of
  CVE-2013-0272.

  All Pidgin users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to resolve these issues. Pidgin must be restarted for
  this update to take effect.
