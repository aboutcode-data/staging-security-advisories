  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

  Red Hat would like to thank Mohamed Ghannam for reporting CVE-2017-8824.

  Bug Fix(es):

  * Previously, on certain Intel 64 systems, the microcode contained a new model-specific register (MSR) that was not present in the older microcode running on CPUs that had not been updated yet. As a consequence, the system crashed due to a general protection fault on a CPU running the older microcode. This update fixes the bug by having the kernel use MSR access routines that handle the general protection fault. As a result, the system no longer crashes in the described scenario. (BZ#1651481)
