summary: |
  An update for the XStream component that fixes one security issue is now
  available from the Red Hat Customer Portal for Red Hat JBoss Data
  Virtualization 6.0.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  score, which gives detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link
  in the References section.

  XStream is a simple library to serialize and de-serialize objects to and
  from XML.

  It was found that XStream could deserialize arbitrary user-supplied XML
  content, representing objects of any type. A remote attacker able to pass
  XML to XStream could use this flaw to perform a variety of attacks,
  including remote code execution in the context of the server running the
  XStream application. (CVE-2013-7285)

  The main distribution of Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.0.0 does not
  contain the vulnerable XStream library and is not vulnerable to
  CVE-2013-7285. Only users of Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.0.0 who
  installed an optional S-RAMP distribution as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
