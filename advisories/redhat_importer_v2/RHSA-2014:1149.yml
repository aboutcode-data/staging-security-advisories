  The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

  It was discovered that JBoss Web did not limit the length of chunk sizes
  when using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could use this flaw
  to perform a denial of service attack against JBoss Web by streaming an
  unlimited quantity of data, leading to excessive consumption of server
  resources. (CVE-2014-0075)

  It was found that JBoss Web did not check for overflowing values when
  parsing request content length headers. A remote attacker could use this
  flaw to perform an HTTP request smuggling attack on a JBoss Web server
  located behind a reverse proxy that processed the content length header
  correctly. (CVE-2014-0099)

  The CVE-2014-0075 issue was discovered by David Jorm of Red Hat Product
  Security.

  All users of JBoss Operations Network 3.2.2 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Operations Network 3.2.3.
