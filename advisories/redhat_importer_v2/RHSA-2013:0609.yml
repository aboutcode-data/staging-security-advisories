  - CVE-2012-6075
summary: |
  Updated qemu-kvm packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
  Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. qemu-kvm is the user-space component
  for running virtual machines using KVM.

  A flaw was found in the way QEMU-KVM emulated the e1000 network interface
  card when the host was configured to accept jumbo network frames, and a
  guest using the e1000 emulated driver was not. A remote attacker could use
  this flaw to crash the guest or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with
  root privileges in the guest. (CVE-2012-6075)

  All users of qemu-kvm should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct this issue. After installing this
  update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all virtual machines
  have shut down, start them again for this update to take effect.
