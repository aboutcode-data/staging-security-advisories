summary: |
  Updated php53 and php packages that fix multiple security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 respectively.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
  HTTP Server. PHP's fileinfo module provides functions used to identify a
  particular file according to the type of data contained by the file.

  Multiple denial of service flaws were found in the way the File Information
  (fileinfo) extension parsed certain Composite Document Format (CDF) files.
  A remote attacker could use either of these flaws to crash a PHP
  application using fileinfo via a specially crafted CDF file.
  (CVE-2014-0237, CVE-2014-0238, CVE-2014-3479, CVE-2014-3480, CVE-2012-1571)

  Two denial of service flaws were found in the way the File Information
  (fileinfo) extension handled indirect and search rules. A remote attacker
  could use either of these flaws to cause a PHP application using fileinfo
  to crash or consume an excessive amount of CPU. (CVE-2014-1943,
  CVE-2014-2270)

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way PHP parsed DNS TXT
  records. A malicious DNS server or a man-in-the-middle attacker could
  possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code as the PHP interpreter if
  a PHP application used the dns_get_record() function to perform a DNS
  query. (CVE-2014-4049)

  A type confusion issue was found in PHP's phpinfo() function. A malicious
  script author could possibly use this flaw to disclose certain portions of
  server memory. (CVE-2014-4721)

  A buffer over-read flaw was found in the way the DateInterval class parsed
  interval specifications. An attacker able to make a PHP application parse a
  specially crafted specification using DateInterval could possibly cause the
  PHP interpreter to crash. (CVE-2013-6712)

  A type confusion issue was found in the SPL ArrayObject and
  SPLObjectStorage classes' unserialize() method. A remote attacker able to
  submit specially crafted input to a PHP application, which would then
  unserialize this input using one of the aforementioned methods, could use
  this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  that PHP application. (CVE-2014-3515)

  The CVE-2014-0237, CVE-2014-0238, CVE-2014-3479, and CVE-2014-3480 issues
  were discovered by Francisco Alonso of Red Hat Product Security.

  All php53 and php users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues.
