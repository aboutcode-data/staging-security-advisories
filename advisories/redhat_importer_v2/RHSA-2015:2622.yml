  - CVE-2015-5233
summary: "Updated Satellite 6.1 packages that fix one security issue, add one\nenhancement,\
  \ and fix several bugs are available for Satellite 6.1.5.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has\
  \ rated this update as having Moderate\nSecurity impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System\
  \ (CVSS) base \nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each \nvulnerability\
  \ from the CVE links in the References section.\n\nRed Hat Satellite is a system management\
  \ solution that allows\norganizations to configure and maintain their systems without the\n\
  necessity to provide public Internet access to their servers or other\nclient systems. It\
  \ performs provisioning and configuration management\nof predefined standard operating environments.\n\
  \nThe following security issue is addressed with this release:\n\nSatellite failed to properly\
  \ enforce permissions on the show and destroy\nactions for reports. This could lead to an\
  \ authenticated user with show\nand/or destroy report permissions being able to view and/or\
  \ delete any\nreports held in Foreman. (CVE-2015-5233)\n\nIn addition, this update adds the\
  \ following enhancement:\n\n* Satellite 6 has been enhanced with the PXE-Less Discovery feature.\n\
  This feature supports the use of a single ISO to provision machines\nagainst specific host\
  \ groups. The users can provide the network\ninformation so that the host does not need to\
  \ be created on Satellite\nin advance and DHCP does not need to be used. (BZ#1258061)\n\n\
  This update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* The installer was not processing the '\\'\
  \ character correctly, leading\nto failed installations using proxies. This character is now\
  \ handled\ncorrectly, improving the installation experience. (BZ#1180637) \n\n* Help text\
  \ provided by the installer had a typo which has now been\nfixed. (BZ#1209139)\n\n* The hammer\
  \ container list command did not provide the container ID. \nThis data is now provided. (BZ#1230915)\n\
  \n* Repository Sync Tasks in the UI were reported as successful if there\nwas an unhandled\
  \ exception in the code. These exceptions are now\nhandled correctly, and the correct status\
  \ is reported. (BZ#1246054)\n\n* The installer would remove the dhcpd.conf even if the installer\
  \ was\ntold not to. This would remove users' configurations. The installer\nhas been updated\
  \ to not manage this file unless requested.\n(BZ#1247397)\n\n* The history diff page for templates\
  \ was opening two pages when only\none was required. The duplicate page is no longer opened.\
  \ (BZ#1254909)\n\n* During provisioning, the default root password was not used when a\nhostgroup\
  \ had a blank string for the root password. Since the UI can\nnot set an empty value, the\
  \ code was updated to cause either no or an\nempty root password to use the default. (BZ#1255021)\n\
  \n* Multi selection was not working for discovered hosts. This feature\nis now working. (BZ#1258521)\n\
  \n* When there is a mac address conflict, discovered hosts to not change\ntheir state to \"\
  Built.\" The code has been updated to handle this case.\n(BZ#1258578)\n\n* Deleting a lifecycle\
  \ environment would fail with a \"dependent hosts\"\nerror. This was due to an incorrect mapping\
  \ between environments and\nhosts. This mapping has been fixed, and the environments can be\n\
  deleted. (BZ#1269441)\n\n* There were performance issues in package installations. The speed\
  \ of\nthis action has been improved (BZ#1276443, BZ#1269509, BZ#1277269)\n\n* Synchronization\
  \ tasks seemed to be randomly stuck to do timeouts.\nThe locking in the qpid code has been\
  \ improved to keep these tasks\nfrom getting stuck (BZ#1279502)\n\n* This change enables users\
  \ of CloudForms 4.0 to proxy Red Hat\nInsights requests through Satellite.  The Satellite\
  \ can now act as a\nproxy for both CloudForms 4.0 and Satellite-only use cases.\n(BZ#1276676)\n\
  \nUsers of Red Hat Satellite are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain\
  \ backported patches to correct these issues\nand add this enhancement."
