summary: |
  Updated cups packages that fix a security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The Common UNIX® Printing System (CUPS) provides a portable printing layer
  for UNIX operating systems.

  The CUPS security advisory, RHSA-2008:0937, stated that it fixed
  CVE-2008-3640 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5. It was discovered
  this flaw was not properly fixed on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, however.
  (CVE-2009-0577)

  These new packages contain a proper fix for CVE-2008-3640 on Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 3. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 already contain the
  appropriate fix for this flaw and do not need to be updated.

  Users of cups should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue.
