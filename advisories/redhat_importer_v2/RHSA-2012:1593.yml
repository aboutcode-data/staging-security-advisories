summary: |
  JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.3.0 roll up patch 2, which fixes one
  security issue and various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer
  Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform is the next-generation ESB and business
  process automation infrastructure. JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform allows IT
  to leverage existing (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and future
  (EDA and CEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve business
  process execution speed and quality.

  This roll up patch serves as a cumulative upgrade for JBoss Enterprise SOA
  Platform 5.3.0. It includes various bug fixes. The following security issue
  is also fixed with this release:

  A flaw was found in the way Apache CXF verified that XML elements were
  signed or encrypted by a particular Supporting Token. Apache CXF checked to
  ensure these elements were signed or encrypted by a Supporting Token, but
  not whether the correct token was used. A remote attacker could use this
  flaw to transmit confidential information without the appropriate security,
  and potentially circumvent access controls on web services exposed via
  Apache CXF. (CVE-2012-2379)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Apache CXF project for reporting this
  issue.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.3.0 as provided from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this roll up patch.
