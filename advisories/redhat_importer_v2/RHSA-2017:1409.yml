summary: |
  An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java applications based on the JBoss Application Server.

  This release of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.0.6 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.0.5, and includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was discovered that under certain conditions RESTEasy could be forced to parse a request with YamlProvider, resulting in unmarshalling of potentially untrusted data. An attacker could possibly use this flaw execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the application using RESTEasy. (CVE-2016-9606)

  * It was found that the log file viewer in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application 6 and 7 allows arbitrary file read to authenticated user via path traversal. (CVE-2017-2595)

  * It was discovered that the code that parsed the HTTP request line permitted invalid characters. This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy that also permitted the invalid characters but with a different interpretation, to inject data into the HTTP response. By manipulating the HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack, or obtain sensitive information from requests other than their own. (CVE-2017-2666)

  * It was found that with non-clean TCP close, Websocket server gets into infinite loop on every IO thread, effectively causing DoS. (CVE-2017-2670)

  Red Hat would like to thank Moritz Bechler (AgNO3 GmbH & Co. KG) for reporting CVE-2016-9606 and Gregory Ramsperger and Ryan Moak for reporting CVE-2017-2670. The CVE-2017-2666 issue was discovered by Radim Hatlapatka (Red Hat).
