  - CVE-2014-8119
summary: "Updated netcf packages that fix several bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise\
  \ Linux 6.\n\nThe netcf packages contain a library for modifying the network configuration\
  \ of a system. Network configuration is expressed in a platform-independent XML format, which\
  \ netcf translates into changes to the system's \"native\" network configuration files.\n\n\
  This update fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, when the XML configuration for an interface\
  \ enabled dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) for IPv6, the netcf library erroneously\
  \ set the variable named \"DHCPV6\" in the ifcfg configuration file instead of \"DHCPV6C\"\
  . The underlying source code has been patched, and netcf now passes the correct \"DHCPV6C\"\
  \ option to ifcfg. (BZ#1113978)\n\n* Prior to this update, when requested to configure an\
  \ interface with an IPv4 netmask of 255.255.255.255, the netcf library logged an error as\
  \ the\ninterface configuration was rejected. This update fixes the netmask for the 32-bit\
  \ interface prefix, and netcf now configures IPv4 interfaces successfully. (BZ#1116314) \n\
  \n* Due to a parsing error, the ifcfg files with comments starting anywhere beyond column\
  \ 1 or multiple variables on a single line caused the netcf library to generate errors when\
  \ attempting to list host interfaces. The parsing error has been fixed, and any tool using\
  \ netcf now lists active interfaces as expected. (BZ#1208897) \n\n* When multiple static IPv6\
  \ addresses were specified in an interface configuration, an extra set of quotes appeared\
  \ in the IPV6ADDR_SECONDARIES entry in the generated configuration file. This update removes\
  \ extraneous single quotes from IPV6ADDR_SECONDARIES, thus fixing this bug. (BZ#1208894)\n\
  \n* Due to a denial of a service flaw in the netcf library, a specially crafted interface\
  \ name previously caused applications using netcf, such as the libvirt daemon, to terminate\
  \ unexpectedly. An upstream patch has been applied to fix this bug, and applications using\
  \ netcf no longer crash in the aforementioned situation. (BZ#1165966) \n\nUsers of netcf are\
  \ advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which fix these bugs."
