  - CVE-2011-0413
summary: |
  Updated dhcp packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol that allows
  individual devices on an IP network to get their own network configuration
  information, including an IP address, a subnet mask, and a broadcast
  address. DHCPv6 is the DHCP protocol version for IPv6 networks.

  A flaw was found in the way the dhcpd daemon processed certain DHCPv6
  messages for addresses that had previously been declined and marked as
  abandoned internally. If a remote attacker sent such messages to dhcpd, it
  could cause dhcpd to crash due to an assertion failure if it was running as
  a DHCPv6 server. (CVE-2011-0413)

  Red Hat would like to thank Internet Systems Consortium for reporting this
  issue.

  Users running dhcpd as a DHCPv6 server should upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After
  installing this update, all DHCP servers will be restarted automatically.
