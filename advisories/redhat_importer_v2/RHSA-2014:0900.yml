summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix three security issues and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Extended Update Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's futex subsystem handled
  the requeuing of certain Priority Inheritance (PI) futexes. A local,
  unprivileged user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the
  system. (CVE-2014-3153, Important)

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's floppy driver handled user
  space provided data in certain error code paths while processing FDRAWCMD
  IOCTL commands. A local user with write access to /dev/fdX could use this
  flaw to free (using the kfree() function) arbitrary kernel memory.
  (CVE-2014-1737, Important)

  * It was found that the Linux kernel's floppy driver leaked internal kernel
  memory addresses to user space during the processing of the FDRAWCMD IOCTL
  command. A local user with write access to /dev/fdX could use this flaw to
  obtain information about the kernel heap arrangement. (CVE-2014-1738, Low)

  Note: A local user with write access to /dev/fdX could use these two flaws
  (CVE-2014-1737 in combination with CVE-2014-1738) to escalate their
  privileges on the system.

  Red Hat would like to thank Kees Cook of Google for reporting
  CVE-2014-3153, and Matthew Daley for reporting CVE-2014-1737 and
  CVE-2014-1738. Google acknowledges Pinkie Pie as the original reporter of
  CVE-2014-3153.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * A previous change that introduced global clock updates caused guest
  machines to boot slowly when the host Time Stamp Counter (TSC) was marked
  as unstable. The slow down increased with the number of vCPUs allocated.
  To resolve this problem, a patch has been applied to limit the rate of the
  global clock updates. (BZ#1102253)

  All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
  rebooted for this update to take effect.
