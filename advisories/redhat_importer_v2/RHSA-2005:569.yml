  - CVE-2005-2096
summary: |
  Updated Zlib packages that fix a buffer overflow are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Zlib is a general-purpose lossless data compression library which is used
  by many different programs.

  Tavis Ormandy discovered a buffer overflow affecting Zlib version 1.2 and
  above.  An attacker could create a carefully crafted compressed stream that
  would cause an application to crash if the stream is opened by a user.  As
  an example, an attacker could create a malicious PNG image file which would
  cause a web browser or mail viewer to crash if the image is viewed.  The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the name
  CAN-2005-2096 to this issue.

  Please note that the versions of Zlib as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 2.1 and 3 are not vulnerable to this issue.

  All users should update to these erratum packages which contain a patch
  from Mark Adler which corrects this issue.
