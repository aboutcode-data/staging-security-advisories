summary: |
  Updated httpd packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The Apache HTTP Server is a popular web server.

  Cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the mod_proxy_balancer
  module's manager web interface. If a remote attacker could trick a user,
  who was logged into the manager web interface, into visiting a
  specially-crafted URL, it would lead to arbitrary web script execution in
  the context of the user's manager interface session. (CVE-2012-4558)

  It was found that mod_rewrite did not filter terminal escape sequences from
  its log file. If mod_rewrite was configured with the RewriteLog directive,
  a remote attacker could use specially-crafted HTTP requests to inject
  terminal escape sequences into the mod_rewrite log file. If a victim viewed
  the log file with a terminal emulator, it could result in arbitrary command
  execution with the privileges of that user. (CVE-2013-1862)

  Cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the mod_info, mod_status,
  mod_imagemap, mod_ldap, and mod_proxy_ftp modules. An attacker could
  possibly use these flaws to perform XSS attacks if they were able to make
  the victim's browser generate an HTTP request with a specially-crafted Host
  header. (CVE-2012-3499)

  All httpd users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.
