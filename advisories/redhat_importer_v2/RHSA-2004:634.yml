  - CVE-2004-1010
summary: |
  An updated zip package that fixes a buffer overflow vulnerability is now
  available.

  The zip program is an archiving utility which can create ZIP-compatible
  archives.

  A buffer overflow bug has been discovered in zip when handling long file
  names.  An attacker could create a specially crafted path which could
  cause zip to crash or execute arbitrary instructions.  The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
  CAN-2004-1010 to this issue.

  Users of zip should upgrade to this updated package, which contains
  backported patches and is not vulnerable to this issue.
