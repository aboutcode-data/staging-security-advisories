  - CVE-2003-0971
summary: "Updated gnupg packages are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux. \nThese updates\
  \ disable the ability to generate ElGamal keys (used for both\nsigning and encrypting) and\
  \ disable the ability to use ElGamal public keys\nfor encrypting data.\n\nGnuPG is a utility\
  \ for encrypting data and creating digital signatures.\n\nPhong Nguyen identified a severe\
  \ bug in the way GnuPG creates and uses\nElGamal keys, when those keys are used both to sign\
  \ and encrypt data.  This\nvulnerability can be used to trivially recover the private key.\
  \  While the\ndefault behavior of GnuPG when generating keys does not lead to the\ncreation\
  \ of unsafe keys, by overriding the default settings an unsafe key\ncould have been created.\n\
  \nIf you are using ElGamal keys, you should revoke those keys immediately.\n\nThe packages\
  \ included in this update do not make ElGamal keys safe to use;\nthey merely include a patch\
  \ by David Shaw that disables functions that\nwould generate or use ElGamal keys.\n\nTo determine\
  \ if your key is affected, run the following command to obtain a\nlist of secret keys that\
  \ you have on your secret keyring:\n\ngpg --list-secret-keys\n\nThe output of this command\
  \ includes both the size and type of the keys\nfound, and will look similar to this example:\n\
  \n/home/example/.gnupg/secring.gpg\n----------------------------------------------------\n\
  sec  1024D/01234567 2000-10-17 Example User <example@example.com>\nuid                   \
  \         Example User <example@example.com>\n\nThe key length, type, and ID are listed together,\
  \ separated by a forward\nslash.  In the example output above, the key's type is \"D\" (DSA,\
  \ sign\nand encrypt).  Your key is unsafe if and only if the key type is \"G\"\n(ElGamal,\
  \ sign and encrypt).  In the above example, the secret key is safe\nto use, while the secret\
  \ key in the following example is not:\n\n/home/example/.gnupg/secring.gpg\n----------------------------------------------------\n\
  sec  1024G/01234567 2000-10-17 Example User <example@example.com>\nuid                   \
  \         Example User <example@example.com>\n\nFor more details regarding this issue, as\
  \ well as instructions on how to\nrevoke any keys that are unsafe, refer to the advisory available\
  \ from the\nGnuPG web site:\n\nhttp://www.gnupg.org/"
