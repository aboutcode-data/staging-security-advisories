summary: |
  An update for ansible is now available for RHEV Engine version 4.1.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Ansible is a simple model-driven configuration management, multi-node deployment, and remote-task execution system. Ansible works over SSH and does not require any software or daemons to be installed on remote nodes. Extension modules can be written in any language and are transferred to managed machines automatically.

  The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: ansible (2.3.0.0). (BZ#1446527)

  Security Fix(es):

  * An input validation vulnerability was found in Ansible's handling of data sent from client systems. An attacker with control over a client system being managed by Ansible and the ability to send facts back to the Ansible server could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the Ansible server using the Ansible server privileges. (CVE-2016-9587)

  * An input validation vulnerability was found in Ansible's handling of data sent from client systems. An attacker with control over a client system being managed by Ansible, and the ability to send facts back to the Ansible server, could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the Ansible server using the Ansible server privileges. (CVE-2017-7466)

  * An input validation vulnerability was found in Ansible's mysql_user module which may fail to correctly change a password in certain circumstances. Thus the previous password would still be active when it should have been changed. (CVE-2016-8647)

  The CVE-2017-7466 issue was discovered by Evgeni Golov (Red Hat).
