  - CVE-2017-7539
summary: |
  An update for qemu-kvm-rhev is now available for RHEV 3.X Hypervisor and Agents for RHEL-7 and RHEV 4.X RHEV-H and Agents for RHEL-7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on a variety of architectures. The qemu-kvm-rhev packages provide the user-space component for running virtual machines that use KVM in environments managed by Red Hat products.

  Security Fix(es):

  * An assertion-failure flaw was found in the Network Block Device (NBD) server's initial connection negotiation, where the I/O co-routine was undefined. This could crash the qemu-nbd server if a client sent unexpected data during connection negotiation. A remote user or process could use this flaw to crash the qemu-nbd server resulting in denial of service. (CVE-2017-7539)
