  - CVE-2010-4344
summary: |
  Updated exim packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.7, 5.3,
  and 5.4 Extended Update Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Exim is a mail transport agent (MTA) developed at the University of
  Cambridge for use on Unix systems connected to the Internet.

  A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in Exim's internal
  string_vformat() function. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  execute arbitrary code on the mail server running Exim. (CVE-2010-4344)

  Note: successful exploitation would allow a remote attacker to execute
  arbitrary code as root on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 or 5 system that
  is running the Exim mail server. An exploit for this issue is known to
  exist.

  For additional information regarding this flaw, along with mitigation
  advice, please see the Knowledge Base article linked to in the
  References section of this advisory.

  Users of Exim are advised to update to these erratum packages which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing this
  update, the Exim daemon will be restarted automatically.
