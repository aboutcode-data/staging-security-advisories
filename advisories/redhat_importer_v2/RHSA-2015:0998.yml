  - CVE-2015-3456
summary: |
  Updated qemu-kvm packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
  Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm package provides the
  user-space component for running virtual machines using KVM.

  An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the way QEMU's virtual
  Floppy Disk Controller (FDC) handled FIFO buffer access while processing
  certain FDC commands. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash
  the guest or, potentially, execute arbitrary code on the host with the
  privileges of the host's QEMU process corresponding to the guest.
  (CVE-2015-3456)

  Red Hat would like to thank Jason Geffner of CrowdStrike for reporting
  this issue.

  All qemu-kvm users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing this
  update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all virtual machines
  have shut down, start them again for this update to take effect.
