  - CVE-2015-8138
summary: |
  Updated ntp packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time
  with a referenced time source.

  It was discovered that ntpd as a client did not correctly check the
  originate timestamp in received packets. A remote attacker could use this
  flaw to send a crafted packet to an ntpd client that would effectively
  disable synchronization with the server, or push arbitrary offset/delay
  measurements to modify the time on the client. (CVE-2015-8138)

  All ntp users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to resolve this issue. After installing the
  update, the ntpd daemon will restart automatically.
