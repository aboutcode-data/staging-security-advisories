  - CVE-2007-5393
summary: |
  Updated tetex packages that fix a security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 and 3.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  TeTeX is an implementation of TeX. TeX takes a text file and a set of
  formatting commands as input, and creates a typesetter-independent DeVice
  Independent (dvi) file as output.

  Alin Rad Pop discovered a flaw in the handling of PDF files. An attacker
  could create a malicious PDF file that would cause TeTeX to crash, or
  potentially execute arbitrary code when opened. (CVE-2007-5393)

  Users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to resolve these issues.
