summary: |
  Updated php53 packages that fix three security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
  HTTP Server.

  A flaw was found in the way PHP converted certain floating point values
  from string representation to a number. If a PHP script evaluated an
  attacker's input in a numeric context, the PHP interpreter could cause high
  CPU usage until the script execution time limit is reached. This issue only
  affected i386 systems. (CVE-2010-4645)

  A stack memory exhaustion flaw was found in the way the PHP filter_var()
  function validated email addresses. An attacker could use this flaw to
  crash the PHP interpreter by providing excessively long input to be
  validated as an email address. (CVE-2010-3710)

  A memory disclosure flaw was found in the PHP multi-byte string extension.
  If the mb_strcut() function was called with a length argument exceeding the
  input string size, the function could disclose a portion of the PHP
  interpreter's memory. (CVE-2010-4156)

  All php53 users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to take effect.
