  - CVE-2003-0788
summary: "Updated CUPS packages that fix a problem where CUPS can hang are now available.\n\n\
  CUPS is a print spooler.\n\nPaul Mitcheson reported a situation where the CUPS Internet Printing\n\
  Protocol (IPP) implementation in CUPS versions prior to 1.1.19 would get\ninto a busy loop.\
  \  This could result in a denial of service.  In order to\nexploit this bug an attacker would\
  \ need to have the ability to make a TCP\nconnection to the IPP port (by default 631). \n\n\
  Users of CUPS are advised to install these updated packages, which contain\na backported security\
  \ patch and are not vulnerable to this issue.\n\nThese packages also fix a problem with the\
  \ LPD backend that could cause\njobs to be repeated."
