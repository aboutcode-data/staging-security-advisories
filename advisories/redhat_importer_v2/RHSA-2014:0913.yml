summary: |
  Updated kernel-rt packages that fix multiple security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's futex subsystem handled
  the requeuing of certain Priority Inheritance (PI) futexes. A local,
  unprivileged user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the
  system. (CVE-2014-3153, Important)

  * It was found that the Linux kernel's ptrace subsystem allowed a traced
  process' instruction pointer to be set to a non-canonical memory address
  without forcing the non-sysret code path when returning to user space.
  A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system or,
  potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2014-4699,
  Important)

  Note: The CVE-2014-4699 issue only affected systems using an Intel CPU.

  * It was found that the permission checks performed by the Linux kernel
  when a netlink message was received were not sufficient. A local,
  unprivileged user could potentially bypass these restrictions by passing a
  netlink socket as stdout or stderr to a more privileged process and
  altering the output of this process. (CVE-2014-0181, Moderate)

  * It was found that the aio_read_events_ring() function of the Linux
  kernel's Asynchronous I/O (AIO) subsystem did not properly sanitize the AIO
  ring head received from user space. A local, unprivileged user could use
  this flaw to disclose random parts of the (physical) memory belonging to
  the kernel and/or other processes. (CVE-2014-0206, Moderate)

  * An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the Netlink Attribute
  extension of the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) interpreter functionality in
  the Linux kernel's networking implementation. A local, unprivileged user
  could use this flaw to crash the system or leak kernel memory to user space
  via a specially crafted socket filter. (CVE-2014-3144, CVE-2014-3145,
  Moderate)

  * An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's
  system call auditing implementation. On a system with existing audit rules
  defined, a local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to leak kernel
  memory to user space or, potentially, crash the system. (CVE-2014-3917,
  Moderate)

  * A flaw was found in the way Linux kernel's Transparent Huge Pages (THP)
  implementation handled non-huge page migration. A local, unprivileged user
  could use this flaw to crash the kernel by migrating transparent hugepages.
  (CVE-2014-3940, Moderate)

  * An integer underflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Stream
  Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation processed certain
  COOKIE_ECHO packets. By sending a specially crafted SCTP packet, a remote
  attacker could use this flaw to prevent legitimate connections to a
  particular SCTP server socket to be made. (CVE-2014-4667, Moderate)

  * An information leak flaw was found in the RAM Disks Memory Copy (rd_mcp)
  backend driver of the iSCSI Target subsystem of the Linux kernel.
  A privileged user could use this flaw to leak the contents of kernel memory
  to an iSCSI initiator remote client. (CVE-2014-4027, Low)

  Red Hat would like to thank Kees Cook of Google for reporting
  CVE-2014-3153, Andy Lutomirski for reporting CVE-2014-4699 and
  CVE-2014-0181, and Gopal Reddy Kodudula of Nokia Siemens Networks for
  reporting CVE-2014-4667. Google acknowledges Pinkie Pie as the original
  reporter of CVE-2014-3153. The CVE-2014-0206 issue was discovered by
  Mateusz Guzik of Red Hat.

  Users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which upgrade the
  kernel-rt kernel to version kernel-rt-3.10.33-rt32.43 and correct these
  issues. The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.
