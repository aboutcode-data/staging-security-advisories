summary: |
  Updated semi packages that fix vulnerabilities in semi's temporary file
  handling are now available for Red Hat Linux 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3.

  semi is a MIME library for GNU Emacs and XEmacs used by the wl mail package.

  A vulnerability in semi version 1.14.3 and earlier allows an attacker
  to overwrite arbitrary files with potentially arbitrary contents using the
  privileges of the user running Emacs and semi. The Common Vulnerabilities

  to this issue.

  Users of semi are advised to upgrade to these packages, which contain
  a backported patch correcting this issue.
