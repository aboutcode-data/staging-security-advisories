  - CVE-2011-0226
summary: |
  Updated freetype packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  FreeType is a free, high-quality, portable font engine that can open and
  manage font files. It also loads, hints, and renders individual glyphs
  efficiently. These packages provide the FreeType 2 font engine.

  A flaw was found in the way the FreeType font rendering engine processed
  certain PostScript Type 1 fonts. If a user loaded a specially-crafted font
  file with an application linked against FreeType, it could cause the
  application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2011-0226)

  Users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue. The X server must be restarted (log
  out, then log back in) for this update to take effect.
