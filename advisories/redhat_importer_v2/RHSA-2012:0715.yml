summary: |
  An updated thunderbird package that fixes multiple security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed content. Malicious
  content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
  code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2011-3101,
  CVE-2012-1937, CVE-2012-1938, CVE-2012-1939, CVE-2012-1940, CVE-2012-1941,
  CVE-2012-1946, CVE-2012-1947)

  Note: CVE-2011-3101 only affected users of certain NVIDIA display drivers
  with graphics cards that have hardware acceleration enabled.

  It was found that the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in
  Thunderbird no longer blocked Thunderbird inline event handlers. Malicious
  content could possibly bypass intended restrictions if that content relied
  on CSP to protect against flaws such as cross-site scripting (XSS).
  (CVE-2012-1944)

  If a web server hosted content that is stored on a Microsoft Windows share,
  or a Samba share, loading such content with Thunderbird could result in
  Windows shortcut files (.lnk) in the same share also being loaded. An
  attacker could use this flaw to view the contents of local files and
  directories on the victim's system. This issue also affected users opening
  content from Microsoft Windows shares, or Samba shares, that are mounted
  on their systems. (CVE-2012-1945)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.

  Note: None of the issues in this advisory can be exploited by a
  specially-crafted HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default
  for mail messages. They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for
  example, when viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

  All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains Thunderbird version 10.0.5 ESR, which corrects these issues. After
  installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes to
  take effect.
