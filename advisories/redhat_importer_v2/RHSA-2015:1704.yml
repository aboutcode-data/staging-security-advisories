summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.1.0 2015 roll up patch 3, which fixes
  one security issue and various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization is a lean data integration solution that
  provides easy, real-time, and unified data access across disparate sources
  to multiple applications and users. JBoss Data Virtualization makes data
  spread across physically distinct systems—such as multiple databases, XML
  files, and even Hadoop systems—appear as a set of tables in a local
  database.

  This roll up patch serves as a cumulative upgrade for Red Hat JBoss Data
  Virtualization 6.1.0. It includes various bug fixes, which are listed in
  the README file included with the patch files.

  The following security issue is also fixed with this release:

  A flaw was found in the dashbuilder import facility: the DocumentBuilders
  instantiated in org.jboss.dashboard.export.ImportManagerImpl did not
  disable external entities. This could allow an attacker to perform a
  variety of XML External Entity (XXE) and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  attacks. (CVE-2015-1818)

  Red Hat would like to thank David Jorm of IIX Product Security for
  reporting the CVE-2015-1818 issue.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.1.0 as provided from the
  Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this roll up patch.
