  - CVE-2003-0985
summary: "Updated kernel packages are now available that fix a security\nvulnerability which\
  \ may allow local users to gain root privileges.\n\nThe Linux kernel handles the basic functions\
  \ of the operating system.\n\nPaul Starzetz discovered a flaw in bounds checking in mremap()\
  \ in the Linux\nkernel versions 2.4.23 and previous which may allow a local attacker to\n\
  gain root privileges.  No exploit is currently available; however, it is\nbelieved that this\
  \ issue is exploitable (although not trivially.) The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures\
  \ project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2003-0985 to this issue.\n\nAll users\
  \ are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which contain a\nbackported security patch\
  \ that corrects this issue.  \n\nRed Hat would like to thank Paul Starzetz from ISEC for disclosing\
  \ this\nissue as well as Andrea Arcangeli and Solar Designer for working on the patch."
