summary: "Multicluster Engine for Kubernetes 2.6.3 General Availability release images and updated\
  \ container images.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security\
  \ impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives\
  \ a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE links in the\
  \ References section.\n\nMulticluster engine for Kubernetes v2.6.3 images\n\nMulticluster\
  \ engine for Kubernetes provides the foundational components\nthat are necessary for the centralized\
  \ management of multiple\nKubernetes-based clusters across data centers, public clouds, and\
  \ private\nclouds.\n\nYou can use the engine to create new Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform\n\
  clusters or to bring existing Kubernetes-based clusters under management by\nimporting them.\
  \ After the clusters are managed, you can use the APIs that\nare provided by the engine to\
  \ distribute configuration based on placement\npolicy.\n\nSecurity fix(es):\n\nnodejs/elliptic:\
  \ EDDSA signature malleability occurs because there is a missing signature length check, and\
  \ thus zero-valued bytes can be removed or appended (CVE-2024-42459) \nnodejs/elliptic: ECDSA\
  \ signature malleability occurs because there is a missing check for whether the leading bit\
  \ of r and s is zero (CVE-2024-42460) \nnodejs/elliptic: ECDSA implementation malleability\
  \ due to BER-enconded signatures being allowed (CVE-2024-42461)"
