  - CVE-2012-1182
summary: |
  Updated samba4 packages that fix one security issue, multiple bugs, and add
  various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Samba is an open-source implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) or
  Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol, which allows PC-compatible
  machines to share files, printers, and other information.

  A flaw was found in the Samba suite's Perl-based DCE/RPC IDL (PIDL)
  compiler, used to generate code to handle RPC calls. This could result in
  code generated by the PIDL compiler to not sufficiently protect against
  buffer overflows. (CVE-2012-1182)

  The samba4 packages have been upgraded to upstream version 4.0.0, which
  provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version.
  In particular, improved interoperability with Active Directory (AD)
  domains. SSSD now uses the libndr-krb5pac library to parse the Privilege
  Attribute Certificate (PAC) issued by an AD Key Distribution Center (KDC).

  The Cross Realm Kerberos Trust functionality provided by Identity
  Management, which relies on the capabilities of the samba4 client library,
  is included as a Technology Preview. This functionality and server
  libraries, is included as a Technology Preview. This functionality uses the
  libndr-nbt library to prepare Connection-less Lightweight Directory Access
  Protocol (CLDAP) messages.

  Additionally, various improvements have been made to the Local Security
  Authority (LSA) and Net Logon services to allow verification of trust
  from a Windows system. Because the Cross Realm Kerberos Trust functionality
  is considered a Technology Preview, selected samba4 components are
  considered to be a Technology Preview. For more information on which Samba
  packages are considered a Technology Preview, refer to Table 5.1, "Samba4
  Package Support" in the Release Notes, linked to from the References.
  (BZ#766333, BZ#882188)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * Prior to this update, if the Active Directory (AD) server was rebooted,
  Winbind sometimes failed to reconnect when requested by "wbinfo -n" or
  "wbinfo -s" commands. Consequently, looking up users using the wbinfo tool
  failed. This update applies upstream patches to fix this problem and now
  looking up a Security Identifier (SID) for a username, or a username for a
  given SID, works as expected after a domain controller is rebooted.
  (BZ#878564)

  All users of samba4 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which fix these issues and add these enhancements.

  Warning: If you upgrade from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3 to Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 6.4 and you have Samba in use, you should make sure that
  you uninstall the package named "samba4" to avoid conflicts during the
  upgrade.
