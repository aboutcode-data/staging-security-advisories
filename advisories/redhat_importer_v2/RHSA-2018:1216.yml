  Bug Fix(es):

  * Previously, the XFS code included a circular dependency between the xfs-log and the xfs-cil workqueues. Consequently, an XFS deadlock occurred in some cases. This update adds a new workqueue dedicated to the log covering background task to avoid the deadlock. (BZ#1543303)

  * The kernel build requirements have been updated to the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) compiler version that has the support for Retpolines. The Retpolines mechanism is a software construct that leverages specific knowledge of the underlying hardware to mitigate the branch target injection, also known as Spectre variant 2 vulnerability described in CVE-2017-5715. (BZ#1553181)
