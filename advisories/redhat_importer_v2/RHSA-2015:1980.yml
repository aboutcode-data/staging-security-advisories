summary: |
  Updated nss and nspr packages that fix three security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to support
  cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server
  applications. Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) provides platform
  independence for non-GUI operating system facilities.

  A use-after-poison flaw and a heap-based buffer overflow flaw were found in
  the way NSS parsed certain ASN.1 structures. An attacker could use these
  flaws to cause NSS to crash or execute arbitrary code with the permissions
  of the user running an application compiled against the NSS library.
  (CVE-2015-7181, CVE-2015-7182)

  A heap-based buffer overflow was found in NSPR. An attacker could use this
  flaw to cause NSPR to crash or execute arbitrary code with the permissions
  of the user running an application compiled against the NSPR library.
  (CVE-2015-7183)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
  Upstream acknowledges Tyson Smith, David Keeler and Ryan Sleevi as the
  original reporter.

  All nss and nspr users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues.
