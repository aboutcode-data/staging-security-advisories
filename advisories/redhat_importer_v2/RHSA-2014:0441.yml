  - CVE-2013-6445
summary: |
  Updated Messaging component packages that fix one security issue, several
  bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise
  MRG 2.5 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a next-generation
  IT infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG offers increased
  performance, reliability, interoperability, and faster computing for
  enterprise customers.

  MRG Messaging is a high-speed reliable messaging distribution for Linux
  based on AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol), an open protocol
  standard for enterprise messaging that is designed to make mission critical
  messaging widely available as a standard service, and to make enterprise
  messaging interoperable across platforms, programming languages, and
  vendors. MRG Messaging includes an AMQP 0-10 messaging broker; AMQP 0-10
  client libraries for C++, Java JMS, and Python; as well as persistence
  libraries and management tools.

  It was found that MRG Management Console (cumin) used the crypt(3)
  DES-based hash function to hash passwords. DES-based hashing has known
  weaknesses that allow an attacker to more easily recover plain text
  passwords from hashes via brute-force guessing. An attacker able to
  compromise a cumin user database could potentially use this flaw to recover
  plain text passwords from the password hashes stored in that database.
  (CVE-2013-6445)

  Note: In deployments where user account information is stored in a database
  managed by cumin, it is recommended that users change their passwords after
  this update is applied.

  This issue was discovered by Tomáš Nováčik of the Red Hat MRG Quality
  Engineering team.

  This update also fixes several bugs and adds enhancements.
  Documentation for these changes will be available shortly from the
  Technical Notes document linked to in the References section.

  All users of the Messaging capabilities of Red Hat Enterprise MRG are
  advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve these issues
  and add these enhancements. After installing the updated packages, stop the
  cluster by either running "service qpidd stop" on all nodes, or
  "qpid-cluster --all-stop" on any one of the cluster nodes. Once stopped,
  restart the cluster with "service qpidd start" on all nodes for the update
  to take effect.
