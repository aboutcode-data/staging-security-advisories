  - CVE-2012-2673
summary: |
  Updated gc packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  gc is a Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector for C and C++.

  It was discovered that gc's implementation of the malloc() and calloc()
  routines did not properly perform parameter sanitization when allocating
  memory. If an application using gc did not implement application-level
  validity checks for the malloc() and calloc() routines, a remote attacker
  could provide specially crafted application-specific input, which, when
  processed by the application, could lead to an application crash or,
  potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user
  running the application. (CVE-2012-2673)

  Users of gc are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct this issue. Applications using gc must be
  restarted for the update to take effect.
