  - CVE-2004-0422
summary: |
  Updated semi packages that fix vulnerabilities in flim temporary file
  handling are now available.

  The semi package includes a MIME library for GNU Emacs and XEmacs used by
  the wl mail package.

  Tatsuya Kinoshita discovered a vulnerability in flim, an emacs library
  for working with Internet messages included in the semi package. Temporary
  files were being created without taking adequate precautions, and therefore
  a local user could potentially overwrite files with the privileges of the
  user running emacs.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0422 to this issue.

  Users of semi are advised to upgrade to these packages, which contain
  a backported patch fixing this issue.
