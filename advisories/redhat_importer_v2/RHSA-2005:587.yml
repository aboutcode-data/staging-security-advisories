summary: "Updated mozilla packages that fix various security issues are now available.\n\nThis\
  \ update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response\
  \ Team.\n\nMozilla is an open source Web browser, advanced email and newsgroup client,\nIRC\
  \ chat client, and HTML editor.\n\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla handled synthetic events.\
  \ It is possible\nthat Web content could generate events such as keystrokes or mouse clicks\n\
  that could be used to steal data or execute malicious Javascript code. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2005-2260 to this issue.\
  \ \n\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla executed Javascript in XBL controls. It\nis possible\
  \ for a malicious webpage to leverage this vulnerability to\nexecute other JavaScript based\
  \ attacks even when JavaScript is disabled.\n(CAN-2005-2261) \n\nA bug was found in the way\
  \ Mozilla installed its extensions. If a user can\nbe tricked into visiting a malicious webpage,\
  \ it may be possible to obtain\nsensitive information such as cookies or passwords. (CAN-2005-2263)\n\
  \nA bug was found in the way Mozilla handled certain Javascript functions. It\nis possible\
  \ for a malicious webpage to crash the browser by executing\nmalformed Javascript code. (CAN-2005-2265)\n\
  \nA bug was found in the way Mozilla handled multiple frame domains. It is\npossible for a\
  \ frame as part of a malicious website to inject content into\na frame that belongs to another\
  \ domain. This issue was previously fixed as\nCAN-2004-0718 but was accidentally disabled.\
  \ (CAN-2005-1937) \n\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla handled child frames. It is possible\
  \ for\na malicious framed page to steal sensitive information from its parent\npage. (CAN-2005-2266)\n\
  \nA bug was found in the way Mozilla opened URLs from media players. If a\nmedia player opens\
  \ a URL which is Javascript, the Javascript executes\nwith access to the currently open webpage.\
  \ (CAN-2005-2267)\n\nA design flaw was found in the way Mozilla displayed alerts and prompts.\n\
  Alerts and prompts were given the generic title [JavaScript Application]\nwhich prevented\
  \ a user from knowing which site created them. (CAN-2005-2268)\n\nA bug was found in the way\
  \ Mozilla handled DOM node names. It is possible\nfor a malicious site to overwrite a DOM\
  \ node name, allowing certain\nprivileged chrome actions to execute the malicious Javascript.\
  \ (CAN-2005-2269)\n\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla cloned base objects. It is possible\
  \ for\nWeb content to traverse the prototype chain to gain access to privileged\nchrome objects.\
  \ (CAN-2005-2270)\n\nUsers of Mozilla are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\n\
  contain Mozilla version 1.7.10 and are not vulnerable to these issues."
