summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1.1, which fixes multiple
  security issues, various bugs, and adds enhancements, is now available
  from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java
  applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  This release serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform 6.1.0, and includes bug fixes and enhancements. Refer
  to the 6.1.1 Release Notes for information on the most significant of these
  changes, available shortly from
  https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/

  Security fixes:

  Cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the mod_info, mod_status,
  mod_imagemap, mod_ldap, and mod_proxy_ftp modules. An attacker could
  possibly use these flaws to perform XSS attacks if they were able to make
  the victim's browser generate an HTTP request with a specially-crafted Host
  header. (CVE-2012-3499)

  Cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the mod_proxy_balancer
  module's manager web interface. If a remote attacker could trick a user,
  who was logged into the manager web interface, into visiting a
  specially-crafted URL, it would lead to arbitrary web script execution in
  the context of the user's manager interface session. (CVE-2012-4558)

  A flaw was found in the way the mod_dav module handled merge requests. An
  attacker could use this flaw to send a crafted merge request that contains
  URIs that are not configured for DAV, causing the httpd child process to
  crash. (CVE-2013-1896)

  A flaw was found in the way Apache Santuario XML Security for Java
  validated XML signatures. Santuario allowed a signature to specify an
  arbitrary canonicalization algorithm, which would be applied to the
  SignedInfo XML fragment. A remote attacker could exploit this to spoof an
  XML signature via a specially-crafted XML signature block. (CVE-2013-2172)

  It was found that mod_rewrite did not filter terminal escape sequences from
  its log file. If mod_rewrite was configured with the RewriteLog directive,
  a remote attacker could use specially-crafted HTTP requests to inject
  terminal escape sequences into the mod_rewrite log file. If a victim viewed
  the log file with a terminal emulator, it could result in arbitrary command
  execution with the privileges of that user. (CVE-2013-1862)

  The data file used by PicketBox Vault to store encrypted passwords contains
  a copy of its own admin key. The file is encrypted using only this admin
  key, not the corresponding JKS key. A local attacker with permission to
  read the vault data file could read the admin key from the file, and use it
  to decrypt the file and read the stored passwords in clear text.
  (CVE-2013-1921)

  A flaw was found in JGroup's DiagnosticsHandler that allowed an attacker on
  an adjacent network to reuse the credentials from a previous successful
  authentication. This could be exploited to read diagnostic information
  (information disclosure) and attain limited remote code execution.
  (CVE-2013-4112)

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss
  Enterprise Application Platform installation and deployed applications.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1.0 as
  provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat
  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1.1.
