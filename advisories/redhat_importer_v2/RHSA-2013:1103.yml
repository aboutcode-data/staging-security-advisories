  - CVE-2013-4073
summary: |
  Updated ruby193-ruby packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0 (Grizzly).

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Ruby is an extensible, interpreted, object-oriented, scripting language. It
  has features to process text files and to do system management tasks. Red
  Hat OpenStack makes use of Puppet, which is written in Ruby.

  A flaw was found in Ruby's SSL client's hostname identity check when
  handling certificates that contain hostnames with NULL bytes. An attacker
  could potentially exploit this flaw to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack
  against the Puppet master and its clients. Note that to exploit this issue,
  an attacker would need to get a carefully-crafted certificate signed by an
  authority that the Puppet master and clients trust. (CVE-2013-4073)

  Users of Red Hat OpenStack 3.0 (Grizzly) are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages, which correct this issue. After installing the update,
  the puppetmaster service must be restarted on the Puppet master server,
  and the puppet service must be restarted on all clients that run the
  Puppet agent as a daemon.
