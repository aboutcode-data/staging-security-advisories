  - CVE-2013-4485
summary: |
  Updated redhat-ds-base packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Directory Server 8.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The redhat-ds-base packages provide Red Hat Directory Server, which is an
  LDAPv3 compliant server. The base packages include the Lightweight
  Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server and command-line utilities for
  server administration.

  It was discovered that the Red Hat Directory Server did not properly handle
  certain Get Effective Rights (GER) search queries when the attribute list,
  which is a part of the query, included several names using the '@'
  character. An attacker able to submit search queries to the Red Hat
  Directory Server could cause it to crash. (CVE-2013-4485)

  All Red Hat Directory Server 8 users are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
  After installing this update, the dirsrv service will be restarted
  automatically.
