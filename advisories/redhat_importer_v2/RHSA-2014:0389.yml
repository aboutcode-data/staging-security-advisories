aliases:
  - CVE-2013-7285
summary: |
  An updated jasperreports-server-pro package that fixes one security issue
  is now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization reports package provides a suite of
  pre-configured reports and dashboards that enable you to monitor the
  system. The reports module is based on JasperReports and JasperServer, and
  can also be used to create ad-hoc reports.

  XStream is a simple library used by the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  reports package to serialize and de-serialize objects to and from XML.

  It was found that XStream could deserialize arbitrary user-supplied XML
  content, representing objects of any type. A remote attacker able to pass
  XML to XStream could use this flaw to perform a variety of attacks,
  including remote code execution in the context of the server running the
  XStream application. (CVE-2013-7285)

  All jasperreports-server-pro users are advised to upgrade to this updated
  package, which contains a backported patch to correct this issue.
