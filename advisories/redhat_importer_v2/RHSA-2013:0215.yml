  - CVE-2012-5660
summary: |
  Updated abrt and libreport packages that fix two security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  ABRT (Automatic Bug Reporting Tool) is a tool to help users to detect
  defects in applications and to create a bug report with all the information
  needed by a maintainer to fix it. It uses a plug-in system to extend its
  functionality. libreport provides an API for reporting different problems
  in applications to different bug targets, such as Bugzilla, FTP, and Trac.

  It was found that the
  /usr/libexec/abrt-action-install-debuginfo-to-abrt-cache tool did not
  sufficiently sanitize its environment variables. This could lead to Python
  modules being loaded and run from non-standard directories (such as /tmp/).
  A local attacker could use this flaw to escalate their privileges to that
  of the abrt user. (CVE-2012-5659)

  A race condition was found in the way ABRT handled the directories used to
  store information about crashes. A local attacker with the privileges of
  the abrt user could use this flaw to perform a symbolic link attack,
  possibly allowing them to escalate their privileges to root.
  (CVE-2012-5660)

  Red Hat would like to thank Martin Carpenter of Citco for reporting the
  CVE-2012-5660 issue. CVE-2012-5659 was discovered by Miloslav Trmač of Red
  Hat.

  All users of abrt and libreport are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues.
