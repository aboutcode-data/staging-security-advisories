  - CVE-2011-1179
summary: |
  An updated spice-xpi package that fixes one security issue is now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) is a
  remote display protocol used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux for viewing
  virtualized guests running on the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM)
  hypervisor, or on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor.

  The spice-xpi package provides a plug-in that allows the SPICE client to
  run from within Mozilla Firefox.

  An uninitialized pointer use flaw was found in the SPICE Firefox plug-in.
  If a user were tricked into visiting a malicious web page with Firefox
  while the SPICE plug-in was enabled, it could cause Firefox to crash or,
  possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Firefox. (CVE-2011-1179)

  Users of spice-xpi should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
  backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the update,
  Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
