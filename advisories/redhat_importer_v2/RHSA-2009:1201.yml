summary: "Updated java-1.6.0-openjdk packages that fix several security issues and a\nbug are\
  \ now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.\n\nThis update has been rated as having important\
  \ security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nThese packages provide the OpenJDK\
  \ 6 Java Runtime Environment and the\nOpenJDK 6 Software Development Kit. The Java Runtime\
  \ Environment (JRE)\ncontains the software and tools that users need to run applications written\n\
  using the Java programming language.\n\nA flaw was found in the way the XML Digital Signature\
  \ implementation in the\nJRE handled HMAC-based XML signatures. An attacker could use this\
  \ flaw to\ncreate a crafted signature that could allow them to bypass authentication,\nor\
  \ trick a user, applet, or application into accepting untrusted content.\n(CVE-2009-0217)\n\
  \nSeveral potential information leaks were found in various mutable static\nvariables. These\
  \ could be exploited in application scenarios that execute\nuntrusted scripting code. (CVE-2009-2475)\n\
  \nIt was discovered that OpenType checks can be bypassed. This could allow a\nrogue application\
  \ to bypass access restrictions by acquiring references to\nprivileged objects through finalizer\
  \ resurrection. (CVE-2009-2476)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way the JRE processes\
  \ XML. A\nremote attacker could use this flaw to supply crafted XML that would lead\nto a\
  \ denial of service. (CVE-2009-2625)\n\nA flaw was found in the JRE audio system. An untrusted\
  \ applet or\napplication could use this flaw to gain read access to restricted System\nproperties.\
  \ (CVE-2009-2670)\n\nTwo flaws were found in the JRE proxy implementation. An untrusted applet\n\
  or application could use these flaws to discover the usernames of users\nrunning applets and\
  \ applications, or obtain web browser cookies and use\nthem for session hijacking attacks.\
  \ (CVE-2009-2671, CVE-2009-2672)\n\nAn additional flaw was found in the proxy mechanism implementation.\
  \ This\nflaw allowed an untrusted applet or application to bypass access\nrestrictions and\
  \ communicate using non-authorized socket or URL connections\nto hosts other than the origin\
  \ host. (CVE-2009-2673) \n\nAn integer overflow flaw was found in the way the JRE processes\
  \ JPEG\nimages. An untrusted application could use this flaw to extend its\nprivileges, allowing\
  \ it to read and write local files, as well as to\nexecute local applications with the privileges\
  \ of the user running the\napplication. (CVE-2009-2674)\n\nAn integer overflow flaw was found\
  \ in the JRE unpack200 functionality. An\nuntrusted applet or application could extend its\
  \ privileges, allowing it to\nread and write local files, as well as to execute local applications\
  \ with\nthe privileges of the user running the applet or application. (CVE-2009-2675)\n\n\
  It was discovered that JDK13Services grants unnecessary privileges to\ncertain object types.\
  \ This could be misused by an untrusted applet or\napplication to use otherwise restricted\
  \ functionality. (CVE-2009-2689)\n\nAn information disclosure flaw was found in the way private\
  \ Java variables\nwere handled. An untrusted applet or application could use this flaw to\n\
  obtain information from variables that would otherwise be private.\n(CVE-2009-2690)\n\nNote:\
  \ The flaws concerning applets in this advisory, CVE-2009-2475,\nCVE-2009-2670, CVE-2009-2671,\
  \ CVE-2009-2672, CVE-2009-2673, CVE-2009-2675,\nCVE-2009-2689, and CVE-2009-2690, can only\
  \ be triggered in\njava-1.6.0-openjdk by calling the \"appletviewer\" application.\n\nThis\
  \ update also fixes the following bug:\n\n* the EVR in the java-1.6.0-openjdk package as shipped\
  \ with Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux allowed the java-1.6.0-openjdk package from the EPEL\nrepository\
  \ to take precedence (appear newer). Users using\njava-1.6.0-openjdk from EPEL would not have\
  \ received security updates since\nOctober 2008. This update prevents the packages from EPEL\
  \ from taking\nprecedence. (BZ#499079)\n\nAll users of java-1.6.0-openjdk are advised to upgrade\
  \ to these updated\npackages, which resolve these issues. All running instances of OpenJDK\
  \ Java\nmust be restarted for the update to take effect."
