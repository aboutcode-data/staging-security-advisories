  - CVE-2016-2315
  - CVE-2016-2324
summary: |
  Updated git19-git packages that fix two security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Software Collections.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Git is a distributed revision control system with a decentralized
  architecture. As opposed to centralized version control systems with a
  client-server model, Git ensures that each working copy of a Git repository
  is an exact copy with complete revision history. This not only allows the
  user to work on and contribute to projects without the need to have
  permission to push the changes to their official repositories, but also
  makes it possible for the user to work with no network connection.

  An integer truncation flaw and an integer overflow flaw, both leading to a
  heap-based buffer overflow, were found in the way Git processed certain
  path information. A remote attacker could create a specially crafted Git
  repository that would cause a Git client or server to crash or, possibly,
  execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-2315, CVE-2016-2324)

  All git19-git users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
