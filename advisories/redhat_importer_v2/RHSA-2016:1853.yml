  - CVE-2016-5418
summary: "An update for atomic-openshift and heapster is now available for Red Hat OpenShift\
  \ Enterprise 3.2.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact\
  \ of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed\
  \ severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References\
  \ section.\n\nOpenShift Enterprise by Red Hat is the company's cloud computing Platform-\n\
  as-a-Service (PaaS) solution designed for on-premise or private cloud \ndeployments.\n\nSecurity\
  \ Fix(es):\n\n* When processing an archive file that contains an archive entry with type 1\
  \ (hardlink) but also having a non-zero data size a file overwrite can occur. This would allow\
  \ an attacker that can pass data to an application that uses libarchive to unpack it to overwrite\
  \ arbitrary files with arbitrary data. (CVE-2016-5418)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Insomnia\
  \ Security for reporting this issue.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously,\
  \ pods that had a resource request of 0 and specified limits were classified as BestEffort\
  \ when they should have been classified as Burstable. This bug fix ensures that those pods\
  \ are correctly classified as Burstable.(BZ#1357475)\n\n* Future versions of docker will require\
  \ containerized installations of OpenShift Container Platform to mount /var/lib/origin with\
  \ the `rslave` flag. New installations of OpenShift Container Platform 3.2 have this value\
  \ set. However, upgrades from 3.1 did not properly set this value. This bug fix ensures that\
  \ this flag is now set during upgrades, ensuring that OpenShift Container Platform works properly\
  \ under future versions of docker. (BZ#1358197)\n\n* The PersistentVolumeLabel admission plug-in\
  \ is now enabled by default. This plug-in labels AWS and GCE volumes with their zone so the\
  \ scheduler can limit the nodes for a pod to only those in the same zone as the persistent\
  \ volumes being used by the pod. (BZ#1365600)\n\n* Previously, heapster incorrectly generated\
  \ error messages indicating that it \"Failed to find node\". This bug fix corrects that error\
  \ and ensures that erroneous warnings are generated.(BZ#1366367)\n\n* The deployment controllers'\
  \ resync interval can now be configured. The previously hard-coded 2-minute default is the\
  \ likely cause of performance regressions when thousands of deploymentconfigs are present\
  \ in the system. Increase the resync interval by setting deploymentControllerResyncMinute\
  \ in /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml.(BZ#1366381)\n\n* Previously, AWS-related environment\
  \ variables were removed from /etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master files during an upgrade\
  \ if these values were not included in the advanced installer's inventory file. This bug fix\
  \ ensures that these variables are now preserved during upgrades. (BZ#1370641)\n\n* Previously,\
  \ updates to the containerized atomic-openshift-node service were not properly reloaded during\
  \ upgrades. This bug fix corrects this error and ensures that the service is reloaded during\
  \ upgrades. (BZ#1371708)\n\n* Previously the installer did not properly configure an environment\
  \ for flannel when openshift_use_flannel was set to `true`. This bug fix corrects those errors\
  \ and the installer will now correctly deploy environments using flannel. (BZ#1372026)"
