  - CVE-2013-2185
summary: |
  An updated jbossweb package that fixes one security issue is now available
  for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1.0 for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  JBoss Web is the web container, based on Apache Tomcat, in Red Hat
  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform. It provides a single deployment
  platform for the JavaServer Pages (JSP) and Java Servlet technologies.

  A flaw was found in the way the DiskFileItem class handled NULL characters
  in file names. A remote attacker able to supply a serialized instance of
  the DiskFileItem class, which will be deserialized on a server, could use
  this flaw to write arbitrary content to any location on the server that is
  accessible to the user running the application server process.
  (CVE-2013-2185)

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss
  Enterprise Application Platform installation and deployed applications.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1.0 on Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 are advised to upgrade to this updated package.
  The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.
