  - CVE-2009-0365
summary: |
  Updated NetworkManager packages that fix a security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  NetworkManager is a network link manager that attempts to keep a wired or
  wireless network connection active at all times.

  An information disclosure flaw was found in NetworkManager's D-Bus
  interface. A local attacker could leverage this flaw to discover sensitive
  information, such as network connection passwords and pre-shared keys.
  (CVE-2009-0365)

  Red Hat would like to thank Ludwig Nussel for responsibly reporting this
  flaw.

  NetworkManager users should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch that corrects this issue.
