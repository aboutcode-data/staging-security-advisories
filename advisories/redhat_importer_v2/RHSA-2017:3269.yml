  - CVE-2017-16844
summary: |
  An update for procmail is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The procmail packages contain a mail processing tool that can be used to create mail servers, mailing lists, sort incoming mail into separate folders or files, preprocess mail, start any program upon mail arrival, or automatically forward selected incoming mail.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in procmail's formail utility. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted email that, when processed by formail, could cause formail to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code as the user running formail. (CVE-2017-16844)
