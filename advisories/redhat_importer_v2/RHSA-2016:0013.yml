  - CVE-2015-7713
summary: "Updated openstack-nova packages that fix one security issue and \nvarious bugs are\
  \ now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack \nPlatform 6.0.\n\nRed Hat Product\
  \ Security has rated this update as having Moderate \nsecurity impact. A Common Vulnerability\
  \ Scoring System (CVSS) base \nscore, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available\
  \ from the \nCVE link in the References section.\n\nOpenStack Compute (nova) launches and\
  \ schedules large networks of \nvirtual machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud\
  \ computing \nplatform. Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs \nrequired\
  \ to orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine \ninstances and controlling access\
  \ through users and projects.\n\nA vulnerability was discovered in the way OpenStack Compute\
  \ (nova)\nnetworking handled security group updates; changes were not applied to\nalready\
  \ running VM instances. A remote attacker could use this flaw to\naccess running VM instances.\
  \ (CVE-2015-7713)\n\nAdditional bug fixes include:\n\n* Suspending an instance with a pre-created\
  \ port that uses\n  binding:vnic_type='direct' previously failed; this has been fixed\n  with\
  \ an update to the API.(BZ#1196054)\n\n* When using multipath-backed volumes using Object\
  \ Storage (cinder), \n  attach attempts failed without error. The handling of device \n  identifiers\
  \ has been updated and volumes can now be attached. \n  (BZ#1206699)\n\n* Previously, OpenStack\
  \ Compute did not conform to PEP8  conventions;\n  this has been fixed. (BZ#1278411)\n\n*\
  \ With a faulty lun in a multipath device, Compute tried to use the \n  wrong device. Compute\
  \ now uses the correct device, and instances\n  can boot normally. (BZ#1280359)\n\n* When\
  \ using a FCoE adapter instead of a FC adapter, volumes \n  previously failed to attach to\
  \ the VM. This issue has been fixed. \n  (BZ#1284033) \n\nAll openstack-nova users are advised\
  \ to upgrade to these updated \npackages, which correct these issues and add these enhancements."
