summary: "Updated redhat-ds-base packages are now available that fix security issues\nand various\
  \ bugs for Red Hat Enterprise IPA.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security\
  \ impact by the Red Hat\nSecurity Response Team.\n\nRed Hat Directory Server is an LDAPv3-compliant\
  \ directory server.\n\nMultiple memory leaks were identified in the Directory Server. An\n\
  unauthenticated remote attacker could use these flaws to trigger high\nmemory consumption\
  \ in the Directory Server, possibly causing it to crash or\nterminate unexpectedly when the\
  \ server ran out of available memory.\n(CVE-2008-3283)\n\nUlf Weltman of Hewlett-Packard discovered\
  \ a flaw in the way Directory\nServer handled LDAP search requests with patterns. A remote\
  \ attacker with\naccess to the LDAP service could create a search request that, when the\n\
  search pattern was matched against specially crafted data records, caused\nDirectory Server\
  \ to use a large amount of CPU time. Directory Server did\nnot impose time limits on such\
  \ search requests. In this updated package,\nDirectory Server imposes a configurable limit\
  \ on the pattern-search query\nrun time, with the default limit set to 30 seconds. (CVE-2008-2930)\n\
  \nIn addition to these security fixes, the following bugs have been fixed in\nthese updated\
  \ packages:\n\n* The change sequence numbers in multi-master replication had a built-in\n\
  time skew to accommodate differences in the clocks on master servers. Under\ncertain circumstances,\
  \ this skew exceeded the maximum allowable skew,\ncausing replication to stop entirely.\n\
  \ \n* If an entry with a large attribute value, such as over 32KB, was\nreplicated, the replication\
  \ could fail with a DB_BUFFER_SMALL error. \n\n* If a password policy attribute such as accountunlocktime\
  \ was added to an\nentry, the server would attempt to replicate that attribute, causing\n\
  replication to fail. \n\n* In replication scenarios, if an attribute value was scheduled to\
  \ be\ndeleted and also was indexed or had an attribute subtype which was indexed,\nthe Directory\
  \ Server would crash during the index operation.\n\n* On x86_64 systems, recursively adding\
  \ groups as members to other groups \ncould crash the server because the stack size for the\
  \ memberOf plug-in on \n64-bit systems was hard-coded to 256KB, regardless of the ulimit value.\n\
  \n* A problem in the SASL IO handling meant that memory was not reallocated\nafter SASL binds.\
  \ For example, a simple bind coming immediately after a\nSASL bind might have failed.\n\n\
  All users of Red Hat Directory Server 8.0 should upgrade to these updated\npackages, which\
  \ resolve these issues."
