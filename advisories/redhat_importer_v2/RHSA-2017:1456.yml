  - CVE-2016-9185
summary: |
  An update for openstack-heat is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8.0 (Liberty).

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Low. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  OpenStack Orchestration (heat) is a template-driven engine used to specify and deploy configurations for Compute, Storage, and OpenStack Networking. The service can be used to automate post-deployment actions, which in turn allows automated provisioning of infrastructure, services, and applications. Additionally, Orchestration can be integrated with Telemetry alarms to implement auto-scaling for certain infrastructure resources.

  The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: openstack-heat (5.0.3). (BZ#1409638)

  Security Fix(es):

  * An information-leak vulnerability was found in the OpenStack Orchestration (heat) service. Launching a new stack with a local URL resulted in a detailed error message, allowing an authenticated user to conduct network discovery and reveal the details of internal network services. (CVE-2016-9185)

  Bug Fix(es):

  * Previously, when heat-engine was terminated during startup, it tried to clean up processes that had not been started. Consequently, heat-engine reported and logged the "NoneType" attribute error. This behaviour has been corrected, and heat-engine now shuts down gracefully. (BZ#1389972)
