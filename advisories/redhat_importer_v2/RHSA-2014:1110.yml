  - CVE-2014-5119
summary: |
  Updated glibc packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The glibc packages contain the standard C libraries used by multiple
  programs on the system. These packages contain the standard C and the
  standard math libraries. Without these two libraries, a Linux system cannot
  function properly.

  An off-by-one heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in glibc's internal
  __gconv_translit_find() function. An attacker able to make an application
  call the iconv_open() function with a specially crafted argument could
  possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
  that application. (CVE-2014-5119)

  A directory traveral flaw was found in the way glibc loaded locale files.
  An attacker able to make an application use a specially crafted locale name
  value (for example, specified in an LC_* environment variable) could
  possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
  that application. (CVE-2014-0475)

  Red Hat would like to thank Stephane Chazelas for reporting CVE-2014-0475.

  All glibc users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
