summary: |
  A vulnerability in Pine version 4.44 and earlier releases can cause
  Pine to crash when sent a carefully crafted email.

  [Updated 04 July 2003]
  Added packages for Red Hat Linux on IBM iSeries and pSeries systems.

  Pine, developed at the University of Washington, is a tool for reading,
  sending, and managing electronic messages (including mail and news).

  A security problem was found in versions of Pine 4.44 and earlier. In these
  versions, Pine does not allocate enough memory for the parsing and escaping
  of the "From" header, allowing a carefully crafted email to cause a
  buffer overflow on the heap. This will result in Pine crashing.

  All users of Pine on Red Hat Linux are advised to update to these errata
  packages containing a patch to version 4.44 of Pine that fixes this
  vulnerability.
