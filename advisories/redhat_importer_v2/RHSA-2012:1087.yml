  - CVE-2012-2136
summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix one security issue and multiple bugs are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 Extended Update Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issue:

  * It was found that the data_len parameter of the sock_alloc_send_pskb()
  function in the Linux kernel's networking implementation was not validated
  before use. A local user with access to a TUN/TAP virtual interface could
  use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their
  privileges. Note that unprivileged users cannot access TUN/TAP devices
  until the root user grants them access. (CVE-2012-2136, Important)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * An insufficiently designed calculation in the CPU accelerator in the
  previous kernel caused an arithmetic overflow in the sched_clock() function
  when system uptime exceeded 208.5 days. This overflow led to a kernel panic
  on the systems using the Time Stamp Counter (TSC) or Virtual Machine
  Interface (VMI) clock source. This update corrects the described
  calculation so that this arithmetic overflow and kernel panic can no longer
  occur under these circumstances. (BZ#825981, BZ#835449)

  * Previously, a race condition between the journal_write_metadata_buffer()
  and jbd_unlock_bh_state() functions could occur. Consequently, another
  thread could call the get_write_access() function on the buffer head and
  cause the wrong data to be written into the journal. If the system
  terminated unexpectedly or was shut down incorrectly, subsequent file
  system journal replay could result in file system corruption. This update
  fixes the race condition and the file system corruption no longer occurs in
  the described scenario. (BZ#833764)

  * When the kvmclock initialization was used in a guest, it could write to
  the Time Stamp Counter (TSC) and, under certain circumstances, could cause
  the kernel to become unresponsive on boot. With this update, TSC
  synchronization, which is unnecessary due to kvmclock, has been disabled,
  thus fixing this bug. (BZ#834557)

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
  patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
  update to take effect.
