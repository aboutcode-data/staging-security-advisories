  - CVE-2013-4475
summary: |
  Updated samba packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Storage.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Samba is an open-source implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) or
  Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol, which allows PC-compatible
  machines to share files, printers, and other information.

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the DCE-RPC client code in
  Samba. A specially crafted DCE-RPC packet could cause various Samba
  programs to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code when parsed.
  A malicious or compromised Active Directory Domain Controller could use
  this flaw to compromise the winbindd daemon running with root privileges.
  (CVE-2013-4408)

  A flaw was found in the way Samba performed ACL checks on alternate file
  and directory data streams. An attacker able to access a CIFS share with
  alternate stream support enabled could access alternate data streams
  regardless of the underlying file or directory ACL permissions.
  (CVE-2013-4475)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Samba project for reporting CVE-2013-4408.
  Upstream acknowledges Stefan Metzmacher and Michael Adam of SerNet as the
  original reporters of this issue.

  All users of Red Hat Storage are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues. After
  installing this update, the smb service will be restarted automatically.
