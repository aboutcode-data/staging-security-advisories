summary: |
  Updated acroread packages that disable the Adobe Reader web browser plug-in
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 Supplementary.

  Adobe Reader allows users to view and print documents in Portable Document
  Format (PDF). Adobe Reader 9 reached the end of its support cycle on June
  26, 2013, and will not receive any more security updates. Future versions
  of Adobe Acrobat Reader will not be available with Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux.

  The Adobe Reader packages in the Red Hat Network (RHN) channels will
  continue to be available. Red Hat will continue to provide these packages
  only as a courtesy to customers. Red Hat will not provide updates to the
  Adobe Reader packages.

  This update disables the Adobe Reader web browser plug-in, which is
  available via the acroread-plugin package, to prevent the exploitation of
  security issues without user interaction when a user visits a malicious web
  page.
