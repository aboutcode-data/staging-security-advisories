  - CVE-2014-3430
summary: |
  Updated dovecot packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Dovecot is an IMAP server, written with security primarily in mind, for
  Linux and other UNIX-like systems. It also contains a small POP3 server.
  It supports mail in both the maildir or mbox format. The SQL drivers and
  authentication plug-ins are provided as subpackages.

  It was discovered that Dovecot did not properly discard connections trapped
  in the SSL/TLS handshake phase. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  cause a denial of service on an IMAP/POP3 server by exhausting the pool of
  available connections and preventing further, legitimate connections to the
  IMAP/POP3 server to be made. (CVE-2014-3430)

  All dovecot users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the
  updated packages, the dovecot service will be restarted automatically.
