  - CVE-2011-2697
summary: |
  An updated foomatic package that fixes one security issue is now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Foomatic is a comprehensive, spooler-independent database of printers,
  printer drivers, and driver descriptions. The package also includes
  spooler-independent command line interfaces to manipulate queues and to
  print files and manipulate print jobs. foomatic-rip is a print filter
  written in Perl.

  An input sanitization flaw was found in the foomatic-rip print filter. An
  attacker could submit a print job with the username, title, or job options
  set to appear as a command line option that caused the filter to use a
  specified PostScript printer description (PPD) file, rather than the
  administrator-set one. This could lead to arbitrary code execution with the
  privileges of the "lp" user. (CVE-2011-2697)

  All foomatic users should upgrade to this updated package, which contains
  a backported patch to resolve this issue.
