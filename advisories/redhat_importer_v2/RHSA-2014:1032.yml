  - CVE-2014-3562
summary: |
  Updated redhat-ds-base packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Directory Server 8.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The redhat-ds-base packages provide Red Hat Directory Server, which is an
  LDAPv3 compliant server. The base packages include the Lightweight
  Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server and command-line utilities for
  server administration.

  It was found that when replication was enabled for each attribute in Red
  Hat Directory Server, which is the default configuration, the server
  returned replicated metadata when the directory was searched while
  debugging was enabled. A remote attacker could use this flaw to disclose
  potentially sensitive information. (CVE-2014-3562)

  This issue was discovered by Ludwig Krispenz of Red Hat.

  All Red Hat Directory Server 8 users are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
  After installing this update, the dirsrv service will be restarted
  automatically.
