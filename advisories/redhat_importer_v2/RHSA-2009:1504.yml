summary: |
  Updated poppler packages that fix multiple security issues and a bug are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Poppler is a Portable Document Format (PDF) rendering library, used by
  applications such as Evince.

  Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in poppler. An attacker could
  create a malicious PDF file that would cause applications that use poppler
  (such as Evince) to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code when
  opened. (CVE-2009-3603, CVE-2009-3608, CVE-2009-3609)

  Red Hat would like to thank Chris Rohlf for reporting the CVE-2009-3608
  issue.

  This update also corrects a regression introduced in the previous poppler
  security update, RHSA-2009:0480, that prevented poppler from rendering
  certain PDF documents correctly. (BZ#528147)

  Users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to resolve these issues.
