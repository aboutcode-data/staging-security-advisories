  - CVE-2004-0827
summary: |
  Updated ImageMagick packages that fix a BMP loader vulnerability are now
  available.

  ImageMagick(TM) is an image display and manipulation tool for the X Window
  System.

  A heap overflow flaw has been discovered in the ImageMagick image handler.
  An attacker could create a carefully crafted BMP file in such a way that it
  could cause ImageMagick to execute arbitrary code when processing the
  image.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
  has assigned the name CAN-2004-0827 to this issue.

  Users of ImageMagick should upgrade to this updated package, which contains
  a backported patch, and is not vulnerable to this issue.
