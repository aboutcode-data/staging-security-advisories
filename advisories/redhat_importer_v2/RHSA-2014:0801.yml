  - CVE-2014-1738
summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 Long Life.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's floppy driver handled user
  space provided data in certain error code paths while processing FDRAWCMD
  IOCTL commands. A local user with write access to /dev/fdX could use this
  flaw to free (using the kfree() function) arbitrary kernel memory.
  (CVE-2014-1737, Important)

  * It was found that the Linux kernel's floppy driver leaked internal kernel
  memory addresses to user space during the processing of the FDRAWCMD IOCTL
  command. A local user with write access to /dev/fdX could use this flaw to
  obtain information about the kernel heap arrangement. (CVE-2014-1738, Low)

  Note: A local user with write access to /dev/fdX could use these two flaws
  (CVE-2014-1737 in combination with CVE-2014-1738) to escalate their
  privileges on the system.

  Red Hat would like to thank Matthew Daley for reporting these issues.

  All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
  rebooted for this update to take effect.
