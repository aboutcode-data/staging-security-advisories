summary: |
  Updated conga packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The Conga project is a management system for remote workstations.
  It consists of luci, which is a secure web-based front end, and ricci,
  which is a secure daemon that dispatches incoming messages to underlying
  management modules.

  It was discovered that Plone, included as a part of luci, did not properly
  protect the administrator interface (control panel). A remote attacker
  could use this flaw to inject a specially crafted Python statement or
  script into Plone's restricted Python sandbox that, when the administrator
  interface was accessed, would be executed with the privileges of that
  administrator user. (CVE-2012-5485)

  It was discovered that Plone, included as a part of luci, did not properly
  sanitize HTTP headers provided within certain URL requests. A remote
  attacker could use a specially crafted URL that, when processed, would
  cause the injected HTTP headers to be returned as a part of the Plone HTTP
  response, potentially allowing the attacker to perform other more advanced
  attacks. (CVE-2012-5486)

  Multiple information leak flaws were found in the way conga processed luci
  site extension-related URL requests. A remote, unauthenticated attacker
  could issue a specially crafted HTTP request that, when processed, would
  result in unauthorized information disclosure. (CVE-2013-6496)

  It was discovered that various components in the luci site
  extension-related URLs were not properly restricted to administrative
  users. A remote, authenticated attacker could escalate their privileges to
  perform certain actions that should be restricted to administrative users,
  such as adding users and systems, and viewing log data. (CVE-2014-3521)

  It was discovered that Plone, included as a part of luci, did not properly
  protect the privilege of running RestrictedPython scripts. A remote
  attacker could use a specially crafted URL that, when processed, would
  allow the attacker to submit and perform expensive computations or, in
  conjunction with other attacks, be able to access or alter privileged
  information. (CVE-2012-5488)

  It was discovered that Plone, included as a part of luci, did not properly
  enforce permissions checks on the membership database. A remote attacker
  could use a specially crafted URL that, when processed, could allow the
  attacker to enumerate user account names. (CVE-2012-5497)

  It was discovered that Plone, included as a part of luci, did not properly
  handle the processing of requests for certain collections. A remote
  attacker could use a specially crafted URL that, when processed, would lead
  to excessive I/O and/or cache resource consumption. (CVE-2012-5498)

  It was discovered that Plone, included as a part of luci, did not properly
  handle the processing of very large values passed to an internal utility
  function. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted URL that, when
  processed, would lead to excessive memory consumption. (CVE-2012-5499)

  It was discovered that Plone, included as a part of luci, allowed a remote
  anonymous user to change titles of content items due to improper
  permissions checks. (CVE-2012-5500)

  The CVE-2014-3521 issue was discovered by Radek Steiger of Red Hat, and the
  CVE-2013-6496 issue was discovered by Jan Pokorny of Red Hat.

  In addition, these updated conga packages include several bug fixes.
  Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this advisory.
  Users are directed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.11 Technical Notes,
  linked to in the References section, for information on the most
  significant of these changes

  All conga users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing this
  update, the luci and ricci services will be restarted automatically.
