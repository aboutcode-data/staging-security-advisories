summary: |
  New groff packages have been made available that fix an overflow in groff.
  If the printing system running this is a security issue, it is recommended
  to update to the new, fixed packages.

  [Update Jan 22 2003]
  Added description of CVE-2001-1022 which was also fixed by these erratum
  packages

  Groff is a document formatting system.  The groff preprocessor contains an
  exploitable buffer overflow. If groff can be invoked within the LPRng
  printing system, an attacker can gain rights as the "lp" user.

  Remote exploitation may be possible if lpd is running and is accessible
  remotely, and the attacker knows the name of the printer and spoolfile.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2002-0003 to this issue.

  Thanks to zen-parse for bringing this bug to our attention.

  In addition, this erratum also fixes a format string vulnerability in
  groff's pic utility which  allows remote attackers to bypass the -S option
  and execute arbitrary commands via format string specifiers in the plot
  command.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
  has assigned the name CVE-2001-1022 to this issue.
