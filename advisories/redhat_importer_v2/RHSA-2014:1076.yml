summary: |
  Updated qemu-kvm-rhev packages that fix two security issues and one bug are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
  Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm-rhev package provides the
  user-space component for running virtual machines using KVM in environments
  managed by Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

  Two integer overflow flaws were found in the QEMU block driver for QCOW
  version 1 disk images. A user able to alter the QEMU disk image files
  loaded by a guest could use either of these flaws to corrupt QEMU process
  memory on the host, which could potentially result in arbitrary code
  execution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.
  (CVE-2014-0222, CVE-2014-0223)

  Red Hat would like to thank NSA for reporting these issues.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * In certain scenarios, when performing live incremental migration, the
  disk size could be expanded considerably due to the transfer of unallocated
  sectors past the end of the base image. With this update, the
  bdrv_is_allocated() function has been fixed to no longer return "True" for
  unallocated sectors, and the disk size no longer changes after performing
  live incremental migration. (BZ#1110681)

  All users of qemu-kvm-rhev are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues. After
  installing this update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all
  virtual machines have shut down, start them again for this update to take
  effect.
