  - CVE-2015-1843
summary: |
  Updated docker packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Docker is a service providing container management on Linux.

  It was found that the fix for the CVE-2014-5277 issue was incomplete: the
  docker client could under certain circumstances erroneously fall back to
  HTTP when an HTTPS connection to a registry failed. This could allow a
  man-in-the-middle attacker to obtain authentication and image data from
  traffic sent from a client to the registry. (CVE-2015-1843)

  Red Hat would like to thank Eric Windisch of Docker Inc. for reporting
  this issue.

  All docker users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct this issue.
