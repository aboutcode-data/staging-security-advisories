  - CVE-2012-3480
summary: |
  Updated glibc packages that fix multiple security issues and one bug are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The glibc packages provide the standard C and standard math libraries used
  by multiple programs on the system. Without these libraries, the Linux
  system cannot function properly.

  Multiple integer overflow flaws, leading to stack-based buffer overflows,
  were found in glibc's functions for converting a string to a numeric
  representation (strtod(), strtof(), and strtold()). If an application used
  such a function on attacker controlled input, it could cause the
  application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.
  (CVE-2012-3480)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * Previously, logic errors in various mathematical functions, including
  exp, exp2, expf, exp2f, pow, sin, tan, and rint, caused inconsistent
  results when the functions were used with the non-default rounding mode.
  This could also cause applications to crash in some cases. With this
  update, the functions now give correct results across the four different
  rounding modes. (BZ#839411)

  All users of glibc are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
