summary: |
  JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform 5.2.0 roll up patch 1, which fixes two
  security issues, various bugs, and adds enhancements, is now available from
  the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform is a business rules management system for
  the management, storage, creation, modification, and deployment of JBoss
  Rules.

  This roll up patch serves as a cumulative upgrade for JBoss Enterprise BRMS
  Platform 5.2.0. It includes various bug fixes and enhancements. The
  following security issues are also fixed with this release:

  It was found that RESTEasy was vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE)
  attacks. If a remote attacker submitted a request containing an external
  XML entity to a RESTEasy endpoint, the entity would be resolved, allowing
  the attacker to read files accessible to the user running the application
  server. This flaw affected DOM (Document Object Model) Document and JAXB
  (Java Architecture for XML Binding) input. (CVE-2012-0818)

  It was found that the Attribute Exchange (AX) extension of OpenID4Java was
  not checking to ensure attributes were signed. If AX was being used to
  receive information that an application only trusts the identity provider
  to assert, a remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct
  man-in-the-middle attacks and compromise the integrity of the information
  via a specially-crafted request. By default, only the JBoss Seam openid
  example application uses OpenID4Java. (CVE-2011-4314)

  Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss Enterprise
  BRMS Platform installation (including its databases, applications,
  configuration files, and so on).

  All users of JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform 5.2.0 as provided from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this roll up patch.
