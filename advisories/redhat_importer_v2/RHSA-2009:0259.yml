  - CVE-2008-2384
summary: "An updated mod_auth_mysql package to correct a security issue is now\navailable for\
  \ Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact\
  \ by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nThe mod_auth_mysql package includes an extension\
  \ module for the Apache HTTP\nServer which can be used to implement web user authentication\
  \ against a\nMySQL database.\n\nA flaw was found in the way mod_auth_mysql escaped certain\n\
  multibyte-encoded strings. If mod_auth_mysql was configured to use a\nmultibyte character\
  \ set that allowed a backslash '\\' as part of the\ncharacter encodings, a remote attacker\
  \ could inject arbitrary SQL commands\ninto a login request. (CVE-2008-2384)\n\nNote: This\
  \ flaw only affected non-default installations where \nAuthMySQLCharacterSet is configured\
  \ to use one of the affected multibyte\ncharacter sets. Installations that did not use the\
  \ AuthMySQLCharacterSet\nconfiguration option were not vulnerable to this flaw.\n\nAll mod_auth_mysql\
  \ users are advised to upgrade to the updated package,\nwhich contains a backported patch\
  \ to resolve this issue. After installing\nthe update, the httpd daemon must be restarted\
  \ for the fix to take effect."
