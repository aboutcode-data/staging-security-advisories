  - CVE-2007-1466
summary: |
  Updated libwpd packages to correct a security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  libwpd is a library for reading and converting Word Perfect documents.

  iDefense reported several overflow bugs in libwpd.  An attacker could
  create a carefully crafted Word Perfect file that could cause an
  application linked with libwpd, such as OpenOffice, to crash or possibly
  execute arbitrary code if the file was opened by a victim. (CVE-2007-0002)

  All users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported fix for this issue.

  Red Hat would like to thank Fridrich Štrba for alerting us to these issues
  and providing a patch.
