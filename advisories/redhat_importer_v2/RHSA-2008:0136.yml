  - CVE-2008-0553
summary: |
  Updated tk packages that fix a security issue are now available for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Tk is a graphical toolkit for the Tcl scripting language.

  An input validation flaw was discovered in Tk's GIF image handling. A
  code-size value read from a GIF image was not properly validated before
  being used, leading to a buffer overflow. A specially crafted GIF file
  could use this to cause a crash or, potentially, execute code with the
  privileges of the application using the Tk graphical toolkit.
  (CVE-2008-0553)

  A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in Tk's animated GIF image handling.
  An animated GIF containing an initial image smaller than subsequent images
  could cause a crash or, potentially, execute code with the privileges of
  the application using the Tk library. (CVE-2007-5137)

  All users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages which contain a
  backported patches to resolve these issues.
