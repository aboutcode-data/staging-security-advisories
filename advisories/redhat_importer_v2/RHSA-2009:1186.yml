summary: "Updated nspr and nss packages that fix security issues, bugs, and add an\nenhancement\
  \ are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.\n\nThis update has been rated as having\
  \ critical security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nThe packages with this\
  \ update are identical to the packages released by\nRHBA-2009:1161 on the 20th of July 2009.\
  \ They are being reissued as a Red\nHat Security Advisory as they fixed a number of security\
  \ issues that were\nmade public today. If you are installing these packages for the first\
  \ time,\nthey also provide a number of bug fixes and add an enhancement, as detailed\nin RHBA-2009:1161.\
  \ Since the packages are identical, there is no need to\ninstall this update if RHBA-2009:1161\
  \ has already been installed.\n\nNetscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) provides platform independence\
  \ for non-GUI\noperating system facilities. These facilities include threads, thread\nsynchronization,\
  \ normal file and network I/O, interval timing, calendar\ntime, basic memory management (malloc\
  \ and free), and shared library linking.\n\nNetwork Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries\
  \ designed to support\nthe cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server\n\
  applications. Applications built with NSS can support SSLv2, SSLv3, TLS,\nand other security\
  \ standards.\n\nThese updated packages upgrade NSS from the previous version, 3.12.2, to a\n\
  prerelease of version 3.12.4. The version of NSPR has also been upgraded\nfrom 4.7.3 to 4.7.4.\
  \ \n\nMoxie Marlinspike reported a heap overflow flaw in a regular expression\nparser in the\
  \ NSS library used by browsers such as Mozilla Firefox to match\ncommon names in certificates.\
  \ A malicious website could present a\ncarefully-crafted certificate in such a way as to trigger\
  \ the heap\noverflow, leading to a crash or, possibly, arbitrary code execution with\nthe\
  \ permissions of the user running the browser. (CVE-2009-2404)\n\nNote: in order to exploit\
  \ this issue without further user interaction in\nFirefox, the carefully-crafted certificate\
  \ would need to be signed by a\nCertificate Authority trusted by Firefox, otherwise Firefox\
  \ presents the\nvictim with a warning that the certificate is untrusted. Only if the user\n\
  then accepts the certificate will the overflow take place.\n\nDan Kaminsky discovered flaws\
  \ in the way browsers such as Firefox handle\nNULL characters in a certificate. If an attacker\
  \ is able to get a\ncarefully-crafted certificate signed by a Certificate Authority trusted\
  \ by\nFirefox, the attacker could use the certificate during a man-in-the-middle\nattack and\
  \ potentially confuse Firefox into accepting it by mistake.\n(CVE-2009-2408)\n\nDan Kaminsky\
  \ found that browsers still accept certificates with MD2 hash\nsignatures, even though MD2\
  \ is no longer considered a cryptographically\nstrong algorithm. This could make it easier\
  \ for an attacker to create a\nmalicious certificate that would be treated as trusted by a\
  \ browser. NSS\nnow disables the use of MD2 and MD4 algorithms inside signatures by\ndefault.\
  \ (CVE-2009-2409)\n\nAll users of nspr and nss are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\n\
  which resolve these issues and add an enhancement."
