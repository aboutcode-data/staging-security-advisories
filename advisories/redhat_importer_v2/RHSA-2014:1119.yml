  - CVE-2014-3555
summary: |
  Updated openstack-neutron packages that fix one security issue, several
  bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  OpenStack Networking (neutron) is a pluggable, scalable, and API-driven
  system that provisions networking services to virtual machines. Its main
  function is to manage connectivity to and from virtual machines. As of Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0, 'neutron' replaces 'quantum'
  as the core component of OpenStack Networking.

  A denial of service flaw was found in neutron's handling of allowed address
  pairs. As there was no enforced quota on the amount of allowed address
  pairs, a sufficiently authorized user could possibly create a large number
  of firewall rules, impacting performance or potentially rendering a compute
  node unusable. (CVE-2014-3555)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Liping Mao from Cisco as the original reporter.

  The openstack-neutron packages have been upgraded to upstream version
  2014.1.2, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
  previous version, most notable of which are:

  * Multiple Open vSwitch agent fixes: the agent now sets bridges in the
  correct order to avoid breaking tunnel networks, creates the integration
  bridge if it is missing, sets the secure-failing mode for integration
  bridges to ensure the 'openvswitch' service does not program NORMAL action
  on restart and instead relies on L2 agent to manage those bridges on
  restart, limits veth names to 15 characters, and no longer spawns RPC
  consumers before all the needed data structures are ready to be accessed.

  * RPC interactions between the DHCP agent and the Neutron plug-in have
  been optimized.

  * Rule updates for security groups are now applied more effectively.

  * Firewall-as-a-Service (FWaaS): a possible race condition when deleting a
  firewall has been fixed; iptables updates are no longer deferred for the
  service.

  * Metering: metering data for egress and ingress are now reported
  separately; incorrect router key used to report against MongoDB has
  been fixed.

  * Load-Balancing-as-a-Service (LBaaS): resources are now registered against
  quotas engine; rootwrap filters are now shipped independent of L3 agent
  filters.

  * Metaplugin now supports multiple RPC workers.

  * The following plug-ins have been updated: BigSwitch, Brocade, Cisco N1k,
  HyperV, OFAgent, PLUMgrid, and VMWare NSX.

  Refer to https://launchpad.net/neutron/icehouse/2014.1.2 for more
  information on the changes included in the 2014.1.2 of openstack-neutron.
  (BZ#1127439)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * Previously, OpenStack Networking could stop processing network ports that
  disappeared from the integration bridge during the L2-agent loop, even
  after those ports were back on the bridge. As a result, updates for
  temporarily disappeared ports were not handled by the L2 agent. With this
  update, these ports are no longer marked as processed if not found on the
  integration bridge. Ports are now processed correctly even after they
  temporarily disappear from the integration bridge. (BZ#1115588)

  All openstack-neutron users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues and add these enhancements.
