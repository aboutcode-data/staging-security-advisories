summary: |
  Red Hat Network Satellite Server version 5.1.1 is now available. This
  update includes fixes for a number of security issues in Red Hat Network
  Satellite Server components.

  This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
  Security Response Team.

  During an internal security audit, it was discovered that Red Hat Network
  Satellite Server shipped with an XML-RPC script, manzier.pxt, which had a
  single hard-coded authentication key. A remote attacker who is able to
  connect to the Satellite Server XML-RPC service could use this flaw to
  obtain limited information about Satellite Server users, such as login
  names, associated email addresses, internal user IDs, and partial
  information about entitlements. (CVE-2008-2369)

  This release also corrects several security vulnerabilities in various
  components shipped as part of Red Hat Network Satellite Server 5.1. In a
  typical operating environment, these components are not exposed to users
  of Satellite Server in a vulnerable manner. These security updates will
  reduce risk in unique Satellite Server environments.

  A denial-of-service flaw was fixed in mod_perl. (CVE-2007-1349)

  Multiple cross-site scripting flaws were fixed in the image map feature in
  the JFreeChart package. (CVE-2007-6306)

  A flaw which could result in weak encryption was fixed in the
  perl-Crypt-CBC package. (CVE-2006-0898)

  Multiple flaws were fixed in the Apache Tomcat package. (CVE-2005-4838,
  CVE-2006-0254, CVE-2007-1355, CVE-2007-1358, CVE-2007-2449, CVE-2007-5461,
  CVE-2008-0128)

  Users of Red Hat Network Satellite Server 5.1 are advised to upgrade to
  5.1.1, which resolves these issues.
