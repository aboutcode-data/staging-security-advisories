  - CVE-2005-0891
summary: "Updated gtk2 packages that fix a double free vulnerability are now available.\n\n\
  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response\
  \ Team.\n\nThe gtk2 package contains the GIMP ToolKit (GTK+), a library for creating\ngraphical\
  \ user interfaces for the X Window System. \n\nA bug was found in the way gtk2 processes BMP\
  \ images. It is possible\nthat a specially crafted BMP image could cause a denial of service\
  \ attack\non applications linked against gtk2. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project\
  \ (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0891 to\nthis issue.\n\nUsers of gtk2 are\
  \ advised to upgrade to these packages, which contain\na backported patch and is not vulnerable\
  \ to this issue."
