summary: |
  An update for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3.0 CP10 that fixes
  multiple security issues is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  JBoss Web Server is the web container, based on Apache Tomcat, in JBoss
  Enterprise Application Platform. It provides a single deployment platform
  for the JavaServer Pages (JSP) and Java Servlet technologies.

  Multiple flaws were found in the way JBoss Web Server handled HTTP DIGEST
  authentication. These flaws weakened the JBoss Web Server HTTP DIGEST
  authentication implementation, subjecting it to some of the weaknesses of
  HTTP BASIC authentication, for example, allowing remote attackers to
  perform session replay attacks. (CVE-2011-1184, CVE-2011-5062,
  CVE-2011-5063, CVE-2011-5064)

  It was found that the Java hashCode() method implementation was susceptible
  to predictable hash collisions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  cause JBoss Web Server to use an excessive amount of CPU time by sending an
  HTTP request with a large number of parameters whose names map to the same
  hash value. This update introduces a limit on the number of parameters and
  headers processed per request to mitigate this issue. The default limit is
  512 for parameters and 128 for headers. These defaults can be changed by
  setting the org.apache.tomcat.util.http.Parameters.MAX_COUNT and
  org.apache.tomcat.util.http.MimeHeaders.MAX_COUNT system properties in
  "jboss-as/server/[PROFILE]/deploy/properties-service.xml". (CVE-2011-4858)

  A flaw was found in the way JBoss Web Server handled sendfile request
  attributes when using the HTTP APR (Apache Portable Runtime) or NIO
  (Non-Blocking I/O) connector. A malicious web application running on a
  JBoss Web Server instance could use this flaw to bypass security manager
  restrictions and gain access to files it would otherwise be unable to
  access, or possibly terminate the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
  (CVE-2011-2526)

  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting CVE-2011-4858, and the
  Apache Tomcat project for reporting CVE-2011-2526. oCERT acknowledges
  Julian Wälde and Alexander Klink as the original reporters of
  CVE-2011-4858.

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform's "jboss-as/server/[PROFILE]/deploy/" directory, along
  with all other customized configuration files.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3.0 CP10 as provided
  from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to install this update.
