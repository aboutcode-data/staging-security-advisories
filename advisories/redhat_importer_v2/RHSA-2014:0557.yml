summary: |
  Updated kernel-rt packages that fix multiple security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * A race condition leading to a use-after-free flaw was found in the way
  the Linux kernel's TCP/IP protocol suite implementation handled the
  addition of fragments to the LRU (Last-Recently Used) list under certain
  conditions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system or,
  potentially, escalate their privileges on the system by sending a large
  amount of specially crafted fragmented packets to that system.
  (CVE-2014-0100, Important)

  * A race condition flaw, leading to heap-based buffer overflows, was found
  in the way the Linux kernel's N_TTY line discipline (LDISC) implementation
  handled concurrent processing of echo output and TTY write operations
  originating from user space when the underlying TTY driver was PTY.
  An unprivileged, local user could use this flaw to crash the system or,
  potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2014-0196,
  Important)

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's floppy driver handled user
  space provided data in certain error code paths while processing FDRAWCMD
  IOCTL commands. A local user with write access to /dev/fdX could use this
  flaw to free (using the kfree() function) arbitrary kernel memory.
  (CVE-2014-1737, Important)

  * It was found that the Linux kernel's floppy driver leaked internal kernel
  memory addresses to user space during the processing of the FDRAWCMD IOCTL
  command. A local user with write access to /dev/fdX could use this flaw to
  obtain information about the kernel heap arrangement. (CVE-2014-1738, Low)

  Note: A local user with write access to /dev/fdX could use these two flaws
  (CVE-2014-1737 in combination with CVE-2014-1738) to escalate their
  privileges on the system.

  * A use-after-free flaw was found in the way the ping_init_sock() function
  of the Linux kernel handled the group_info reference counter. A local,
  unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially,
  escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2014-2851, Important)

  * It was found that a remote attacker could use a race condition flaw in
  the ath_tx_aggr_sleep() function to crash the system by creating large
  network traffic on the system's Atheros 9k wireless network adapter.
  (CVE-2014-2672, Moderate)

  * A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the rds_iw_laddr_check()
  function in the Linux kernel's implementation of Reliable Datagram Sockets
  (RDS). A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system.
  (CVE-2014-2678, Moderate)

  * A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's mac80211
  subsystem implementation handled synchronization between TX and STA wake-up
  code paths. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system.
  (CVE-2014-2706, Moderate)

  * It was found that the try_to_unmap_cluster() function in the Linux
  kernel's Memory Managment subsystem did not properly handle page locking in
  certain cases, which could potentially trigger the BUG_ON() macro in the
  mlock_vma_page() function. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw
  to crash the system. (CVE-2014-3122, Moderate)

  Red Hat would like to thank Matthew Daley for reporting CVE-2014-1737 and
  CVE-2014-1738. The CVE-2014-0100 issue was discovered by Nikolay
  Aleksandrov of Red Hat.

  Users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which upgrade the
  kernel-rt kernel to version kernel-rt-3.10.33-rt32.34 and correct these
  issues. The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.
