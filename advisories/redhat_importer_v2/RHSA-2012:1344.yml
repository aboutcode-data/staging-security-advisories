  - CVE-2011-1096
summary: |
  An update for the JBoss Web Services component in JBoss Enterprise Portal
  Platform 5.2.2 that fixes one security issue is now available from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform is the open source implementation of the
  Java EE suite of services and Portal services running atop JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform. It comprises a set of offerings for enterprise
  customers who are looking for pre-configured profiles of JBoss Enterprise
  Middleware components that have been tested and certified together to
  provide an integrated experience.

  An attack technique was found against the W3C XML Encryption Standard when
  block ciphers were used in cipher-block chaining (CBC) mode. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to conduct chosen-ciphertext attacks, leading
  to the recovery of the entire plain text of a particular cryptogram by
  examining the differences between SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
  responses sent from JBoss Web Services. (CVE-2011-1096)

  Red Hat would like to thank Juraj Somorovsky of Ruhr-University Bochum
  for reporting this issue.

  Note: Manual action is required to apply this update. The CVE-2011-1096
  issue is an attack on the WS-Security standard itself. Using new
  Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) based algorithms for WS-Security encryption is
  the W3C suggested way of dealing with this issue. The WS-SecurityPolicy
  specification has not yet been updated to include the new algorithms.
  Consequently, Apache CXF independently added support for such GCM based
  algorithms through AlgorithmSuites called "Basic128GCM", "Basic192GCM", and
  "Basic256GCM" in the namespace
  "http://cxf.apache.org/custom/security-policy".

  To apply these policies to your applications that use WS-Security
  encryption, specify them in the application's WSDL file. Refer to Red Hat
  Bugzilla bug 681916 for an example.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.2.2 as provided from the
  Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to install this update.
