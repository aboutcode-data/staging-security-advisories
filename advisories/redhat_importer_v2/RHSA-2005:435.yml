summary: |
  Updated mozilla packages that fix various security bugs are now available.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  [Updated 24 May 2005]
  This erratum now includes updated devhelp packages which are required to
  satisfy a dependancy on systems that have devhelp packages installed.

  Mozilla is an open source Web browser, advanced email and newsgroup client,
  IRC chat client, and HTML editor.

  Several bugs were found in the way Mozilla executes javascript code.
  Javascript executed from a web page should run with a restricted access
  level, preventing dangerous actions. It is possible that a malicious web
  page could execute javascript code with elevated privileges, allowing
  access to protected data and functions. The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CAN-2005-1476,
  CAN-2005-1477, CAN-2005-1531, and CAN-2005-1532 to these issues.

  Users of Mozilla are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains Mozilla version 1.7.8 to correct these issues.
