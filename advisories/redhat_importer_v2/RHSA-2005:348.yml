summary: |
  Updated mysql-server packages that fix several vulnerabilities are now
  available.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server.

  This update fixes several security risks in the MySQL server.

  Stefano Di Paola discovered two bugs in the way MySQL handles user-defined
  functions. A user with the ability to create and execute a user defined
  function could potentially execute arbitrary code on the MySQL server. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
  the names CAN-2005-0709 and CAN-2005-0710 to these issues.

  Stefano Di Paola also discovered a bug in the way MySQL creates temporary
  tables. A local user could create a specially crafted symlink which could
  result in the MySQL server overwriting a file which it has write access to.
  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name
  CAN-2005-0711 to this issue.

  All users of the MySQL server are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain fixes for these issues.
