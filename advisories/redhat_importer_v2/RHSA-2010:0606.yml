  - CVE-2010-2521
summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and one bug are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issues:

  * a flaw was found in the CIFSSMBWrite() function in the Linux kernel
  Common Internet File System (CIFS) implementation. A remote attacker could
  send a specially-crafted SMB response packet to a target CIFS client,
  resulting in a kernel panic (denial of service). (CVE-2010-2248, Important)

  * buffer overflow flaws were found in the Linux kernel's implementation of
  the server-side External Data Representation (XDR) for the Network File
  System (NFS) version 4. An attacker on the local network could send a
  specially-crafted large compound request to the NFSv4 server, which could
  possibly result in a kernel panic (denial of service) or, potentially, code
  execution. (CVE-2010-2521, Important)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * the rpc_call_async() function in the SUN Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
  subsystem in the Linux kernel had a reference counting bug. In certain
  situations, some Network Lock Manager (NLM) messages may have triggered
  this bug on NFSv2 and NFSv3 servers, leading to a kernel panic (with
  "kernel BUG at fs/lockd/host.c:[xxx]!" logged to "/var/log/messages").
  (BZ#612962)

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
  patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
  update to take effect.
