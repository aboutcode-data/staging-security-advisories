  - CVE-2014-0248
summary: |
  An update for the Seam component of Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.5.0
  that fixes one security issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer
  Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit combines popular open source web frameworks
  into a single solution for Java applications. Seam is an open source
  development platform for building rich Internet applications in Java.
  Seam integrates technologies such as Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
  (AJAX), JavaServer Faces (JSF), Java Persistence API (JPA), and Enterprise
  Java Beans (EJB). Seam 2.3 provides support for JSF 2, RichFaces 4, and JPA
  2 capabilities, running on top of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application
  Platform 6.

  It was found that the org.jboss.seam.web.AuthenticationFilter class
  implementation did not properly use Seam logging. A remote attacker could
  send specially crafted authentication headers to an application, which
  could result in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user
  running that application. (CVE-2014-0248)

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.5.0 as provided from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
