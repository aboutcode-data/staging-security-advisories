  README file included with the patch files.

  The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

  It was found that async-http-client would disable SSL/TLS certificate
  verification under certain conditions, for example if HTTPS communication
  also used client certificates. A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker could
  use this flaw to spoof a valid certificate. (CVE-2013-7397)

  It was found that async-http-client did not verify that the server hostname
  matched the domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName
  field in X.509 certificates. This could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker
  to spoof an SSL server if they had a certificate that was valid for any
  domain name. (CVE-2013-7398)

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works 6.0.0 as provided from the
