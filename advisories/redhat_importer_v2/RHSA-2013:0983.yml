  - CVE-2013-2174
summary: |
  Updated curl packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  cURL provides the libcurl library and a command line tool for downloading
  files from servers using various protocols, including HTTP, FTP, and LDAP.

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libcurl unescaped
  URLs. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted URL that, when
  processed by an application using libcurl that handles untrusted URLs,
  would possibly cause it to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.
  (CVE-2013-2174)

  Red Hat would like to thank the cURL project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Timo Sirainen as the original reporter.

  Users of curl should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue. All running applications using
  libcurl must be restarted for the update to take effect.
