  security issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  JBoss Operations Network provides an integrated solution for managing
  JBoss middleware, other network infrastructure, and applications built
  on Red Hat Enterprise Application Platform (EAP). The Apache Commons
  Collections library provides new interfaces, implementations, and
  utilities to extend the features of the Java Collections Framework.

  It was found that the Apache commons-collections library permitted code
  execution when deserializing objects involving a specially constructed
  chain of classes. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute
  arbitrary code with the permissions of the application using the
  commons-collections library. (CVE-2015-7501)
