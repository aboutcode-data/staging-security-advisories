summary: "Updated kernel packages that fix several security issues and bugs in the\nRed Hat\
  \ Enterprise Linux 4 kernel are now available.\n\nThis security advisory has been rated as\
  \ having important security impact\nby the Red Hat Security Response Team.\n\nThe Linux kernel\
  \ handles the basic functions of the operating system.\n\nThese new kernel packages contain\
  \ fixes for the security issues described\nbelow:\n\n* a flaw in the connection tracking support\
  \ for SCTP that allowed a remote\nuser to cause a denial of service by dereferencing a NULL\
  \ pointer.\n(CVE-2007-2876, Important)\n\n* a flaw in the mount handling routine for 64-bit\
  \ systems that allowed a\nlocal user to cause denial of service (crash). (CVE-2006-7203, Important)\n\
  \n* a flaw in the IPv4 forwarding base that allowed a local user to cause an\nout-of-bounds\
  \ access. (CVE-2007-2172, Important)\n\n* a flaw in the PPP over Ethernet implementation that\
  \ allowed a local user\nto cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by creating a socket\n\
  using connect and then releasing it before the PPPIOCGCHAN ioctl has been\ncalled. (CVE-2007-2525,\
  \ Important)\n\n* a flaw in the fput ioctl handling of 32-bit applications running on\n64-bit\
  \ platforms that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service\n(panic). (CVE-2007-0773,\
  \ Important)\n\n* a flaw in the NFS locking daemon that allowed a local user to cause\ndenial\
  \ of service (deadlock). (CVE-2006-5158, Moderate)\n\n* a flaw in the sysfs_readdir function\
  \ that allowed a local user to cause a\ndenial of service by dereferencing a NULL pointer.\
  \ (CVE-2007-3104, Moderate)\n\n* a flaw in the core-dump handling that allowed a local user\
  \ to create core\ndumps from unreadable binaries via PT_INTERP. (CVE-2007-0958, Low) \n\n\
  * a flaw in the Bluetooth subsystem that allowed a local user to trigger an\ninformation leak.\
  \ (CVE-2007-1353, Low)\n\nIn addition, the following bugs were addressed:\n\n* the NFS could\
  \ recurse on the same spinlock. Also, NFS, under certain\nconditions, did not completely clean\
  \ up Posix locks on a file close,\nleading to mount failures.\n\n* the 32bit compatibility\
  \ didn't return to userspace correct values for the\nrt_sigtimedwait system call.\n\n* the\
  \ count for unused inodes could be incorrect at times, resulting in\ndirty data not being\
  \ written to disk in a timely manner.\n\n* the cciss driver had an incorrect disk size calculation\
  \ (off-by-one\nerror) which prevented disk dumps.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Ilja van\
  \ Sprundel and the OpenVZ Linux kernel\nteam for reporting issues fixed in this erratum.\n\
  \nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 users are advised to upgrade their kernels\nto the packages\
  \ associated with their machine architectures and\nconfigurations as listed in this erratum."
