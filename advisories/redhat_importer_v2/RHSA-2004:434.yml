aliases:
  - CVE-2004-0750
summary: |
  An updated redhat-config-nfs package that fixes bugs and potential security
  issues is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

  The redhat-config-nfs package includes a graphical user interface for
  creating, modifying, and deleting nfs shares.

  John Buswell discovered a flaw in redhat-config-nfs that could lead to
  incorrect permissions on exported shares when exporting to multiple
  hosts.  This could cause an option such as "all_squash" to not be
  applied to all of the listed hosts.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0750 to
  this issue.

  Additionally, a bug was found that prevented redhat-config-nfs from being
  run if hosts didn't have options set in /etc/exports.

  All users of redhat-config-nfs are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages as well as checking their NFS shares directly or via the
  /etc/exports file for any incorrectly set options.
