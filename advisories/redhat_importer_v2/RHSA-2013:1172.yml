  - CVE-2013-4255
summary: |
  Updated condor packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.3 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  HTCondor is a specialized workload management system for compute-intensive
  jobs. It provides a job queuing mechanism, scheduling policy, priority
  scheme, and resource monitoring and management.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way HTCondor's policy definition
  evaluator processed certain policy definitions. If an administrator used an
  attribute defined on a job in a CONTINUE, KILL, PREEMPT, or SUSPEND
  condor_startd policy, a remote HTCondor service user could use this flaw to
  cause condor_startd to exit by submitting a job that caused such a policy
  definition to be evaluated to either the ERROR or UNDEFINED states.
  (CVE-2013-4255)

  Note: This issue did not affect the default HTCondor configuration.

  This issue was found by Matthew Farrellee of Red Hat.

  All Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.3 users are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
  HTCondor must be restarted for the update to take effect.
