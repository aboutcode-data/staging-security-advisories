summary: "Updated tcpdump packages that fix an infinite loop vulnerability and drop\nprivileges\
  \ on startup are now available.\n\nTcpdump is a command-line tool for monitoring network traffic.\
  \ \n\nA vulnerability exists in tcpdump before 3.7.2 and is related to an\ninability to handle\
  \ unknown RADIUS attributes properly.  This vulnerability\n allows remote attackers to cause\
  \ a denial of service (infinite loop).\n\nThe Red Hat tcpdump packages advertise that, by\
  \ default, tcpdump will drop\nprivileges to user 'pcap'.  Due to a compilation error this\
  \ did not\nhappen, and tcpdump would run as root unless the '-U' flag was specified.\n\nUsers\
  \ of tcpdump are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which\ncontain a patch correcting\
  \ the RADIUS issue and are compiled so that by\ndefault tcpdump will drop privileges to the\
  \ 'pcap' user."
