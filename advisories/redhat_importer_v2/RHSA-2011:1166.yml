  Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed HTML content.
  Malicious HTML content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially,
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird.
  (CVE-2011-2982)

  A dangling pointer flaw was found in the Thunderbird Scalable Vector
  Graphics (SVG) text manipulation routine. An HTML mail message containing a

  resolves these issues. All running instances of Thunderbird must be
  restarted for the update to take effect.
