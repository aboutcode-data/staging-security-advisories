  - CVE-2015-8213
summary: "Updated python-django packages that fix one security issue are now\navailable for\
  \ Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 7.\n\nRed\
  \ Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security\nimpact. Common Vulnerability\
  \ Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give\ndetailed severity ratings, are available\
  \ for each vulnerability from the\nCVE links in the References section.\n\nDjango is a high-level\
  \ Python Web framework that encourages rapid\ndevelopment and a clean, pragmatic design. It\
  \ focuses on automating as much\nas possible and adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)\
  \ principle.\n\nAn information-exposure flaw was found in the Django date filter. If an\n\
  application allowed users to provide non-validated date formats, a\nmalicious end user could\
  \ expose application-settings data by providing\nthe relevant applications-settings key instead\
  \ of a valid date format. \n(CVE-2015-8213)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Django project\
  \ for reporting this issue.\nUpstream acknowledges Ryan Butterfield as the original reporter.\n\
  \nAll python-django users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich contain\
  \ backported patches to correct this issue."
