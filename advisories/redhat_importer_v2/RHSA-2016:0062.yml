summary: "An update for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.0 that fixes four security\nissues is now\
  \ available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update\
  \ as having Moderate\nsecurity impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,\
  \ \nwhich give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability \nfrom the\
  \ CVE links in the References section.\n\n[Updated 15th February 2018]\nPreviously, this erratum\
  \ stated that CVE-2012-1148 was fixed .This was incorrect;the erratum text has now been modified\
  \ to reflect this.\n\nRed Hat JBoss Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set of\
  \ \ncomponents for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the Apache \nHTTP Server,\
  \ the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat Connector \n(mod_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector\
  \ (mod_cluster), Hibernate, and the Tomcat \nNative library.\n\nMultiple flaws were found\
  \ in the way httpd parsed HTTP requests and\nresponses using chunked transfer encoding. A\
  \ remote attacker could use\nthese flaws to create a specially crafted request, which httpd\
  \ would decode \ndifferently from an HTTP proxy software in front of it, possibly leading\
  \ to \nHTTP request smuggling attacks. (CVE-2015-3183)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found\
  \ in the implementation of hash arrays in \nExpat. An attacker could use this flaw to make\
  \ an application using Expat \nconsume an excessive amount of CPU time by providing a specially-crafted\n\
  XML file that triggers multiple hash function collisions. To mitigate this\nissue, randomization\
  \ has been added to the hash function to reduce the\nchance of an attacker successfully causing\
  \ intentional collisions.\n(CVE-2012-0876)\n\nA flaw was found in the way httpd handled HTTP\
  \ Trailer headers when \nprocessing requests using chunked encoding. A malicious client could\
  \ use \nTrailer headers to set additional HTTP headers after header processing was \nperformed\
  \ by other modules. This could, for example, lead to a bypass of \nheader restrictions defined\
  \ with mod_headers. (CVE-2013-5704)\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.0 as provided\
  \ from the Red Hat \nCustomer Portal are advised to apply this update. The Red Hat JBoss Web\
  \ \nServer process must be restarted for the update to take effect."
