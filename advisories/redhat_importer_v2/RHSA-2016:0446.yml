summary: |
  Updated packages that fix several OpenSSL security issues are available for
  Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3.0.2 for Microsoft Windows and Solaris.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set of
  components for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the
  Apache HTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat
  Connector (mod_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod_cluster), Hibernate, and
  the Tomcat Native library.

  A padding oracle flaw was found in the Secure Sockets Layer version 2.0
  (SSLv2) protocol. An attacker could potentially use this flaw to decrypt
  RSA-encrypted cipher text from a connection using a newer SSL/TLS protocol
  version, allowing them to decrypt such connections. This cross-protocol
  attack is publicly referred to as DROWN. (CVE-2016-0800)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled SSLv2
  handshake messages. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a
  TLS/SSL server using OpenSSL to exit on a failed assertion if it had both
  the SSLv2 protocol and EXPORT-grade cipher suites enabled. (CVE-2015-0293)

  A flaw was found in the way malicious SSLv2 clients could negotiate SSLv2
  ciphers that were disabled on the server. This could result in weak
  SSLv2 ciphers being used for SSLv2 connections, making them vulnerable to
  man-in-the-middle attacks. (CVE-2015-3197)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting these issues.
  Upstream acknowledges Nimrod Aviram and Sebastian Schinzel as the original
  reporters of CVE-2016-0800 and CVE-2015-3197; and Sean Burford (Google)
  and Emilia Käsper (OpenSSL development team) as the original reporters of
  CVE-2015-0293.

  Users of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3.0.2 are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages which fix these issues. The Red Hat JBoss Web Server
  process must be restarted for the update to take effect.
