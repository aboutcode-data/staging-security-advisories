  - CVE-2007-5116
summary: |
  Updated Perl packages that fix security issues for Red Hat Application
  Stack v1.2 are now available.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Perl is a high-level programming language commonly used for system
  administration utilities and Web programming.

  A flaw was found in Perl's regular expression engine. Specially crafted
  input to a regular expression can cause Perl to improperly allocate memory,
  possibly resulting in arbitrary code running with the permissions of the
  user running Perl. (CVE-2007-5116)

  Users of Perl are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue.

  Red Hat would like to thank Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry for properly
  disclosing this issue.
