  Multicluster engine for Kubernetes v2.7.5 images

  Multicluster engine for Kubernetes provides the foundational components that are necessary for the centralized management of multiple Kubernetes-based clusters across data centers, public clouds, and private clouds.

  You can use the engine to create new Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
  clusters or manage existing Kubernetes-based clusters by importing them. After the clusters are managed, you can use the APIs that are provided by the engine to distribute configuration based on placement policy.
