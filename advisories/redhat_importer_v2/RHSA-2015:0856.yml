summary: |
  Updated postgresql packages that fix multiple security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Satellite 5.7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system
  (DBMS).

  An information leak flaw was found in the way the PostgreSQL database
  server handled certain error messages. An authenticated database user could
  possibly obtain the results of a query they did not have privileges to
  execute by observing the constraint violation error messages produced when
  the query was executed. (CVE-2014-8161)

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way PostgreSQL handled certain
  numeric formatting. An authenticated database user could use a specially
  crafted timestamp formatting template to cause PostgreSQL to crash or,
  under certain conditions, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of
  the user running PostgreSQL. (CVE-2015-0241)

  A stack-buffer overflow flaw was found in PostgreSQL's pgcrypto module.
  An authenticated database user could use this flaw to cause PostgreSQL to
  crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the
  user running PostgreSQL. (CVE-2015-0243)

  A flaw was found in the way PostgreSQL handled certain errors that were
  generated during protocol synchronization. An authenticated database user
  could use this flaw to inject queries into an existing connection.
  (CVE-2015-0244)

  Red Hat would like to thank the PostgreSQL project for reporting these
  issues. Upstream acknowledges Stephen Frost as the original reporter of
  CVE-2014-8161; Andres Freund, Peter Geoghegan, Bernd Helmle, and Noah Misch
  as the original reporters of CVE-2015-0241; Marko Tiikkaja as the original
  reporter of CVE-2015-0243; and Emil Lenngren as the original reporter of
  CVE-2015-0244.

  All PostgreSQL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues. If the postgresql
  service is running, it will be automatically restarted after installing
  this update.
