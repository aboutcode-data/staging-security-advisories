  - CVE-2009-0115
summary: "Updated device-mapper-multipath packages that fix a security issue are now\navailable\
  \ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security\
  \ impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nThe device-mapper multipath packages provide\
  \ tools to manage multipath\ndevices by issuing instructions to the device-mapper multipath\
  \ kernel\nmodule, and by managing the creation and removal of partitions for\ndevice-mapper\
  \ devices.\n\nIt was discovered that the multipathd daemon set incorrect permissions on\n\
  the socket used to communicate with command line clients. An unprivileged,\nlocal user could\
  \ use this flaw to send commands to multipathd, resulting in\naccess disruptions to storage\
  \ devices accessible via multiple paths and,\npossibly, file system corruption on these devices.\
  \ (CVE-2009-0115)\n\nUsers of device-mapper-multipath are advised to upgrade to these updated\n\
  packages, which contain a backported patch to resolve this issue. The\nmultipathd service\
  \ must be restarted for the changes to take effect.\n\nImportant: the version of the multipathd\
  \ daemon in Red Hat Enterprise Linux\n5 has a known issue which may cause a machine to become\
  \ unresponsive when\nthe multipathd service is stopped. This issue is tracked in the Bugzilla\n\
  bug #494582; a link is provided in the References section of this erratum.\nUntil this issue\
  \ is resolved, we recommend restarting the multipathd\nservice by issuing the following commands\
  \ in sequence:\n\n\t# killall -KILL multipathd\n\n\t# service multipathd restart"
