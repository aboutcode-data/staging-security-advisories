  - CVE-2011-0064
summary: |
  Updated pango packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Pango is a library used for the layout and rendering of internationalized
  text.

  It was discovered that Pango did not check for memory reallocation failures
  in the hb_buffer_ensure() function. An attacker able to trigger a
  reallocation failure by passing sufficiently large input to an application
  using Pango could use this flaw to crash the application or, possibly,
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
  application. (CVE-2011-0064)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla Security Team for reporting this
  issue.

  All pango users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue. After installing this update, you
  must restart your system or restart the X server for the update to take
  effect.
