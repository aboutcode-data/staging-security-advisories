summary: |
  Updated bind packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Extended Life Cycle Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the Domain
  Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named); a resolver
  library (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and
  tools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.

  A flaw was found in the way BIND handled resource records with a large
  RDATA value. A malicious owner of a DNS domain could use this flaw to
  create specially-crafted DNS resource records, that would cause a recursive
  resolver or secondary server to exit unexpectedly with an assertion
  failure. (CVE-2012-4244)

  A flaw was found in the way BIND handled certain combinations of resource
  records. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a recursive
  resolver, or an authoritative server in certain configurations, to lockup.
  (CVE-2012-5166)

  Users of bind are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues. After installing the update, the BIND daemon (named)
  will be restarted automatically.
