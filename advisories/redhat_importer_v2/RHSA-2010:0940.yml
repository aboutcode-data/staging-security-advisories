  - CVE-2010-3708
summary: |
  A patch for JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 4.2 and 4.3 that fixes one
  security issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform is the next-generation ESB and business
  process automation infrastructure. JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform allows IT
  to leverage existing (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and future
  (EDA and CEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve business
  process execution speed and quality.

  An input sanitization flaw was found in the way JBoss Drools implemented
  certain rule base serialization. If a remote attacker supplied
  specially-crafted input to a JBoss Seam based application that accepts
  serialized input, it could lead to arbitrary code execution with the
  privileges of the JBoss server process. (CVE-2010-3708)

  All users of JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 4.2 and 4.3 as provided from the
  Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this patch. Refer to the
  Solution section of this erratum for update instructions.
