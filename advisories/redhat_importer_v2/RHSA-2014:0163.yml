  - CVE-2013-6368
summary: |
  Updated kvm packages that fix two security issues are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
  Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. KVM is a Linux kernel module built for
  the standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel.

  A divide-by-zero flaw was found in the apic_get_tmcct() function in KVM's
  Local Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (LAPIC) implementation.
  A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the host.
  (CVE-2013-6367)

  A memory corruption flaw was discovered in the way KVM handled virtual APIC
  accesses that crossed a page boundary. A local, unprivileged user could use
  this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on
  the system. (CVE-2013-6368)

  Red Hat would like to thank Andrew Honig of Google for reporting these
  issues.

  All kvm users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. Note: the procedure in
  the Solution section must be performed before this update will take effect.
