  - CVE-2012-1823
summary: |
  Updated php53 packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 Extended Update Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
  HTTP Server.

  A flaw was found in the way the php-cgi executable processed command line
  arguments when running in CGI mode. A remote attacker could send a
  specially-crafted request to a PHP script that would result in the query
  string being parsed by php-cgi as command line options and arguments. This
  could lead to the disclosure of the script's source code or arbitrary code
  execution with the privileges of the PHP interpreter. (CVE-2012-1823)

  Red Hat is aware that a public exploit for this issue is available that
  allows remote code execution in affected PHP CGI configurations. This flaw
  does not affect the default configuration using the PHP module for Apache
  httpd to handle PHP scripts.

  All php53 users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to resolve this issue. After installing the updated
  packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to take effect.
