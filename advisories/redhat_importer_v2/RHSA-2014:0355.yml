  - CVE-2014-2525
summary: |
  Updated ruby193-libyaml packages that fix two security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Software Collections 1.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  YAML is a data serialization format designed for human readability and
  interaction with scripting languages. LibYAML is a YAML parser and emitter
  written in C.

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the libyaml library parsed URLs
  in YAML documents. An attacker able to load specially crafted YAML input to
  an application using libyaml could cause the application to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  the application. (CVE-2014-2525)

  An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the libyaml library handled
  excessively long YAML tags. An attacker able to load specially crafted YAML
  input to application using libyaml could cause the application to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  the application. (CVE-2013-6393)

  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting the CVE-2014-2525 issue.
  oCERT acknowledges Ivan Fratric of the Google Security Team as the original
  reporter. The CVE-2013-6393 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the
  Red Hat Product Security Team.

  All ruby193-libyaml users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues. All running
  applications linked against the libyaml library must be restarted for this
  update to take effect.
