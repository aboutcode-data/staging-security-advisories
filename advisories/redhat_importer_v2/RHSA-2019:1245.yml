summary: |
  An update is now available for Red Hat Quay 3.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact
  of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from
  the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Red Hat Quay is a secure, private container registry that builds, analyzes
  and distributes container images. It provides a high level of automation
  and customization.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A flaw was found in the way the DES/3DES cipher was used as part of the
   TLS/SSL protocol. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to recover some plaintext data by capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between TLS/SSL server and client if the communication used a DES/3DES based ciphersuite. (CVE-2016-2183)

  Bug Fix(es):

  * Running Quay in config mode now works in a disconnected option which doesn't require pulling resources from the Internet.

  * Quay's security scan endpoint is now enabled at startup for viewing results of Clair container image scans.
