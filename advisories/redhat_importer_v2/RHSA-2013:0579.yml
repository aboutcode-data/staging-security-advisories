summary: |
  An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes three security issues,
  various bugs, and adds an enhancement is now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
  is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
  everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Agent.

  Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
  the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

  A flaw was found in the way the vhost kernel module handled descriptors
  that spanned multiple regions. A privileged guest user could use this flaw
  to crash the host or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the host.
  (CVE-2013-0311)

  It was found that the default SCSI command filter does not accommodate
  commands that overlap across device classes. A privileged guest user could
  potentially use this flaw to write arbitrary data to a LUN that is
  passed-through as read-only. (CVE-2012-4542)

  It was discovered that dnsmasq, when used in combination with certain
  libvirtd configurations, could incorrectly process network packets from
  network interfaces that were intended to be prohibited. A remote,
  unauthenticated attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of
  service via DNS amplification attacks. (CVE-2012-3411)

  The CVE-2012-4542 issue was discovered by Paolo Bonzini of Red Hat.

  This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
  several security issues. These issues had no security impact on Red Hat
  Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fixes
  included in this update address the following CVE numbers:

  CVE-2012-3955 (dhcp issue)

  CVE-2011-4355 (gdb issue)

  CVE-2012-4508, CVE-2013-0190, CVE-2013-0309, and CVE-2013-0310 (kernel
  issues)

  CVE-2012-5536 (openssh issue)

  CVE-2011-3148 and CVE-2011-3149 (pam issues)

  CVE-2013-0157 (util-linux-ng issue)

  This updated Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor package also
  fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, the Administration Portal would always display the option to
  upgrade the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor ISO regardless of
  whether or not the selected host was up-to-date. Now, the VDSM version
  compatibility is considered and the upgrade message only displays if there
  is an upgrade relevant to the host available. (BZ#853092)

  * An out of date version of libvirt was included in the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Hypervisor 6.4 package. As a result, virtual machines with
  supported CPU models were not being properly parsed by libvirt and failed
  to start. A more recent version of libvirt has been included in this
  updated hypervisor package. Virtual machines now start normally.
  (BZ#895078)

  As well, this update adds the following enhancement:

  * Hypervisor packages now take advantage of the installonlypkg function
  provided by yum. This allows for multiple versions of the hypervisor
  package to be installed on a system concurrently without making changes to
  the yum configuration as was previously required. (BZ#863579)

  This update includes the ovirt-node build from RHBA-2013:0556:

      https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2013-0556.html

  Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
  upgrade to this updated package, which fixes these issues and adds this
  enhancement.
