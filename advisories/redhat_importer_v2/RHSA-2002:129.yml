  - CVE-2001-1246
summary: "PHP versions earlier than 4.1.0 contain a vulnerability that could allow\narbitrary\
  \ commands to be executed.\n\n[updated 22 Aug 2002]\nThe initial set of errata packages contained\
  \ an incorrect set of\ndependencies. This meant that a number of packages would need to be\n\
  installed before php that were not essential to the operation of php. \nUpdated errata packages\
  \ are included with this advisory that have corrected\ndependencies.\n\nPHP is an HTML-embedded\
  \ scripting language commonly used with Apache. PHP\nversions 4.0.5 through 4.1.0 in safe\
  \ mode do not properly cleanse the 5th\nparameter to the mail() function. This vulnerability\
  \ allows local users and\npossibly remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell\n\
  metacharacters.\n\nRed Hat Linux Advanced Server version 2.1 shipped with PHP 4.0.6.\n\nThe\
  \ Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2001-1246\
  \ to this issue.\n \nAll users of PHP should upgrade to these errata packages containing PHP\n\
  4.1.2, which is not vulnerable to this issue.\n\nNote:\n\nThis PHP errata enforces memory\
  \ limits on the size of the PHP process to\nprevent a badly generated script from becoming\
  \ a possible source for a\ndenial of service attack. The default process size is 8Mb though\
  \ you can\nadjust this as you deem necessary thought the php.ini directive\nmemory_limit.\
  \ For example, to change the process memory limit to 4MB, add\nthe following:\n\nmemory_limit\
  \ 4194304\n\nImportant Installation Note:\n\nThere are special instructions you should follow\
  \ regarding your\n/etc/php.ini configuration file in the \"Solution\" section below."
