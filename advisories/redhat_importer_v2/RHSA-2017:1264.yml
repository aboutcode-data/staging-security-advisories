  - CVE-2017-8422
summary: |
  An update for kdelibs is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The K Desktop Environment (KDE) is a graphical desktop environment for the X Window System. The kdelibs packages include core libraries for the K Desktop Environment.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A privilege escalation flaw was found in the way kdelibs handled D-Bus messages. A local user could potentially use this flaw to gain root privileges by spoofing a callerID and leveraging a privileged helper application. (CVE-2017-8422)

  Red Hat would like to thank Sebastian Krahmer (SUSE) for reporting this issue.
