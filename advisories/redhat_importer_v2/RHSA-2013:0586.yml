summary: |
  An update for JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform 5.3.1, JBoss Enterprise Portal
  Platform 4.3.0 CP07 and 5.2.2, and JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 4.2.0
  CP05, and 4.3.0 CP05 which fixes one security issue is now available from
  the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform is a business rules management system for
  the management, storage, creation, modification, and deployment of JBoss
  Rules. JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform is the open source implementation
  of the Java EE suite of services and Portal services running atop JBoss
  Enterprise Application Platform. JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform is the
  next-generation ESB and business process automation infrastructure.

  When using LDAP authentication with the provided LDAP login modules
  (LdapLoginModule/LdapExtLoginModule), empty passwords were allowed by
  default. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass intended authentication
  by providing an empty password for a valid username, as the LDAP server may
  recognize this as an 'unauthenticated authentication' (RFC 4513). This
  update sets the allowEmptyPasswords option for the LDAP login modules to
  false if the option is not already configured. (CVE-2012-5629)

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your JBoss installation,
  including any databases, database settings, applications, configuration
  files, and so on.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform 5.3.1, JBoss Enterprise Portal
  Platform 4.3.0 CP07 and 5.2.2, and JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 4.2.0
  CP05, and 4.3.0 CP05 as provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are
  advised to apply this update.
