summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.0.0 roll up patch 1, which fixes one
  security issue and various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer
  Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization is a lean data integration solution that
  provides easy, real-time, and unified data access across disparate sources
  to multiple applications and users. JBoss Data Virtualization makes data
  spread across physically distinct systems—such as multiple databases, XML
  files, and even Hadoop systems—appear as a set of tables in a local
  database.

  This roll up patch serves as a cumulative upgrade for Red Hat JBoss Data
  Virtualization 6.0.0. It includes various bug fixes, which are listed in
  the README file included with the patch files.

  The following security issue is also fixed with this release:

  It was found that when JBoss Web processed a series of HTTP requests in
  which at least one request contained either multiple content-length
  headers, or one content-length header with a chunked transfer-encoding
  header, JBoss Web would incorrectly handle the request. A remote attacker
  could use this flaw to poison a web cache, perform cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attacks, or obtain sensitive information from other requests.
  (CVE-2013-4286)

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.0.0 as provided from the
  Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this roll up patch.
