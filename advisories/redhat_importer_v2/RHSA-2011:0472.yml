summary: |
  Updated nss packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact.

  Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to support
  the development of security-enabled client and server applications.

  This erratum blacklists a small number of HTTPS certificates by adding
  them, flagged as untrusted, to the NSS Builtin Object Token (the
  libnssckbi.so library) certificate store. (BZ#689430)

  Note: This fix only applies to applications using the NSS Builtin Object
  Token. It does not blacklist the certificates for applications that use the
  NSS library, but do not use the NSS Builtin Object Token (such as curl).

  All NSS users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct this
  issue. After installing the update, applications using NSS must be
  restarted for the changes to take effect.
