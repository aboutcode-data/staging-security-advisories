summary: |
  An updated JBoss Web Services Native component for JBoss Communications
  Platform 1.2.11 and 5.1.1 that fixes one security issue is now available
  from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  JBoss Web Services Native is a web service framework included as part of
  JBoss Communications Platform. It implements the JAX-WS specification.

  It was found that JBoss Web Services Native did not properly protect
  against recursive entity resolution when processing Document Type
  Definitions (DTD). A remote attacker could exploit this flaw by sending a
  specially-crafted HTTP POST request to a deployed web service, causing
  excessive CPU and memory consumption on the system hosting that service. If
  the attack is repeated to consume all available network sockets, the server
  will become unavailable. (CVE-2011-1483)

  All users of JBoss Communications Platform 1.2.11 and 5.1.1 as provided
  from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to install this update.
