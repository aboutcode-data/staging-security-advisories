summary: |
  Updated openssl packages that fix multiple security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL),
  Transport Layer Security (TLS), and Datagram Transport Layer Security
  (DTLS) protocols, as well as a full-strength, general purpose cryptography
  library.

  It was discovered that the OBJ_obj2txt() function could fail to properly
  NUL-terminate its output. This could possibly cause an application using
  OpenSSL functions to format fields of X.509 certificates to disclose
  portions of its memory. (CVE-2014-3508)

  Multiple flaws were discovered in the way OpenSSL handled DTLS packets.
  A remote attacker could use these flaws to cause a DTLS server or client
  using OpenSSL to crash or use excessive amounts of memory. (CVE-2014-0221,
  CVE-2014-3505, CVE-2014-3506)

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way OpenSSL performed a
  handshake when using the anonymous Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange. A
  malicious server could cause a DTLS client using OpenSSL to crash if that
  client had anonymous DH cipher suites enabled. (CVE-2014-3510)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting
  CVE-2014-0221. Upstream acknowledges Imre Rad of Search-Lab as the original
  reporter of this issue.

  All OpenSSL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. For the update to take
  effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library (such as httpd and other
  SSL-enabled services) must be restarted or the system rebooted.
