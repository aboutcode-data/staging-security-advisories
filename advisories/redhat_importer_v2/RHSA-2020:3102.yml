summary: |
  An update for openstack-keystone is now available for Red Hat OpenStack
  Platform 15 (Stein).

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact
  of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The OpenStack Identity service (keystone) authenticates and authorizes
  OpenStack users by keeping track of users and their permitted activities.
  The Identity service supports multiple forms of authentication, including
  user name and password credentials, token-based systems, and AWS-style
  logins.

  Security Fix(es):

  * EC2 and credential endpoints are not protected from a scoped context
  (CVE-2020-12689)

  * OAuth1 request token authorize silently ignores roles parameter
  (CVE-2020-12690)

  * Credentials endpoint policy logic allows changing credential owner and
  target project ID (CVE-2020-12691)

  * failure to check signature TTL of the EC2 credential auth method
  (CVE-2020-12692)

  score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE
