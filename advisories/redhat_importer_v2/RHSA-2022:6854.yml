  - CVE-2022-2509
summary: |
  An update for gnutls and nettle is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The gnutls packages provide the GNU Transport Layer Security (GnuTLS) library, which implements cryptographic algorithms and protocols such as SSL, TLS, and DTLS.

  Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in almost any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages, such as C++, Python, or Pike, in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel space.

  The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: gnutls (3.7.6), nettle (3.8).

  Security Fix(es):

  * gnutls: Double free during gnutls_pkcs7_verify. (CVE-2022-2509)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

  Bug Fix(es):

  * [IBM 9.1] [P10] POWER10 performance enhancements for cryptography: nettle - incremental work (BZ#2102589)

  * Allow enabling KTLS in RHEL 9.1 (BZ#2108532)

  * DES-CBC bag is decryptable under FIPS (BZ#2115314)

  * allow signature verification using RSA keys <2k in FIPS mode (BZ#2119770)
