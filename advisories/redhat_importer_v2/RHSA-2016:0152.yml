  - CVE-2015-7529
summary: "An updated sos package that fixes one security issue and one bug is now\navailable\
  \ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having\
  \ Moderate security\nimpact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which\n\
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the\nReferences section.\n\
  \nThe sos package contains a set of tools that gather information from system\nhardware, logs\
  \ and configuration files. The information can then be used\nfor diagnostic purposes and debugging.\n\
  \nAn insecure temporary file use flaw was found in the way sos created \ncertain sosreport\
  \ files. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw \nto perform a symbolic link attack\
  \ to reveal the contents of sosreport \nfiles, or in some cases modify arbitrary files and\
  \ escalate their \nprivileges on the system. (CVE-2015-7529)\n\nThis issue was discovered\
  \ by Mateusz Guzik of Red Hat.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n\n* Previously,\
  \ when the hpasm plug-in ran the \"hpasmcli\" command in a Python\nPopen constructor or a\
  \ system pipeline, the command would hang and\neventually time out after 300 seconds. Sos\
  \ was forced to wait for the time\nout to finish, unnecessarily prolonging its run time. With\
  \ this update, the\ntimeout of the \"hpasmcli\" command has been set to 0, eliminating the\
  \ delay\nand speeding up sos completion time. (BZ#1291828)\n\nAll sos users are advised to\
  \ upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported patches to correct these issues."
