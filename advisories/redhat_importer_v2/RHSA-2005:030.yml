  - CVE-2004-1236
summary: |
  Patches for Netscape Directory Server that fix a remotely exploitable
  security issue are now available.

  In December 2004 Red Hat aquired the Netscape Directory Server product from
  America Online, Inc.

  A stack buffer overflow was found in the access control code in Netscape
  Directory Server 6.21 and earlier.  A remote attacker who can communicate
  with the LDAP service could trigger this flaw by creating a carefully
  crafted attribute change request.  A sucessful exploit would lead to a
  denial of service (crash) or potentially to remote code execution on the
  server.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2004-1236 to this issue.
