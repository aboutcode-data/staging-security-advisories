summary: |
  This is the final notification for the retirement of Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 5.3 Advanced Mission Critical (AMC). This notification applies only
  to those customers with subscriptions for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3
  Advanced Mission Critical (AMC).

  In accordance with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Errata Support Policy,
  Advanced Mission Critical (AMC) for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3 was
  retired as of March 31, 2014, and support is no longer provided.
  Accordingly, Red Hat will no longer provide updated packages, including
  Critical impact security patches or urgent priority bug fixes, for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 5.3 AMC after March 31, 2014. In addition, technical
  support through Red Hat's Global Support Services for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 5.3 AMC will no longer be provided after this date.

  We encourage customers to plan their migration from Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 5.3 to a more recent release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 or 6. As a
  benefit of the Red Hat subscription model, customers can use their active
  subscriptions to entitle any system on a currently supported Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 5 release (AMC is available on 5.9) or Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 6 release (AMC is available on 6.2 and 6.4, and planned for 6.6).
