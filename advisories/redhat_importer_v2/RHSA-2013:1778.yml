summary: |
  Updated gimp packages that fix three security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is an image composition and
  editing program.

  A stack-based buffer overflow flaw, a heap-based buffer overflow, and an
  integer overflow flaw were found in the way GIMP loaded certain X Window
  System (XWD) image dump files. A remote attacker could provide a specially
  crafted XWD image file that, when processed, would cause the XWD plug-in to
  crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  user running the GIMP. (CVE-2012-5576, CVE-2013-1913, CVE-2013-1978)

  The CVE-2013-1913 and CVE-2013-1978 issues were discovered by Murray
  McAllister of the Red Hat Security Response Team.

  Users of the GIMP are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues. The GIMP must be restarted for the update to take
  effect.
