summary: "Updated PHP packages that fix multiple security issues are now available\nfor Red\
  \ Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security\
  \ impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nPHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language\
  \ commonly used with the Apache\nHTTP Web server. \n\nA directory traversal vulnerability\
  \ was found in PHP.  Local users could\nbypass open_basedir restrictions allowing remote attackers\
  \ to create files\nin arbitrary directories via the tempnam() function.  (CVE-2006-1494)\n\
  \nThe wordwrap() PHP function did not properly check for integer overflow in\nthe handling\
  \ of the \"break\" parameter. An attacker who could control the\nstring passed to the \"break\"\
  \ parameter could cause a heap overflow.\n(CVE-2006-1990) \n\nA flaw was found in the zend_hash_del()\
  \ PHP function.  For PHP scripts that\nrely on the use of the unset() function, a remote attacker\
  \ could force\nvariable initialization to be bypassed.  This would be a security issue\nparticularly\
  \ for installations that enable the \"register_globals\" setting.\n\"register_globals\" is\
  \ disabled by default in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n(CVE-2006-3017)\n\nUsers of PHP should\
  \ upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches that resolve these\
  \ issues."
