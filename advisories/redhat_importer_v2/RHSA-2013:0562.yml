summary: |
  Updated Messaging component packages that fix multiple security issues,
  several bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat
  Enterprise MRG 2.3 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a next-generation
  IT infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG offers increased
  performance, reliability, interoperability, and faster computing for
  enterprise customers.

  MRG Messaging is a high-speed reliable messaging distribution for Linux
  based on AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol), an open protocol
  standard for enterprise messaging that is designed to make mission critical
  messaging widely available as a standard service, and to make enterprise
  messaging interoperable across platforms, programming languages, and
  vendors. MRG Messaging includes an AMQP 0-10 messaging broker; AMQP 0-10
  client libraries for C++, Java JMS, and Python; as well as persistence
  libraries and management tools.

  It was found that the Apache Qpid daemon (qpidd) treated AMQP connections
  with the federation_tag attribute set as a broker-to-broker connection,
  rather than a client-to-server connection. This resulted in the source user
  ID of messages not being checked. A client that can establish an AMQP
  connection with the broker could use this flaw to bypass intended
  authentication. For Condor users, if condor-aviary is installed, this flaw
  could be used to submit jobs that would run as any user (except root, as
  Condor does not run jobs as root). (CVE-2012-4446)

  It was found that the AMQP type decoder in qpidd allowed arbitrary data
  types in certain messages. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send a
  message containing an excessively large amount of data, causing qpidd to
  allocate a large amount of memory. qpidd would then be killed by the Out of
  Memory killer (denial of service). (CVE-2012-4458)

  An integer overflow flaw, leading to an out-of-bounds read, was found in
  the Qpid qpid::framing::Buffer::checkAvailable() function. An
  unauthenticated, remote attacker could send a specially-crafted message to
  Qpid, causing it to crash. (CVE-2012-4459)

  The CVE-2012-4446, CVE-2012-4458, and CVE-2012-4459 issues were discovered
  by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.

  This update also fixes several bugs and adds enhancements. Documentation
  for these changes will be available shortly from the Technical Notes
  document linked to in the References section.

  All users of the Messaging capabilities of Red Hat Enterprise MRG are
  advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve these issues,
  and fix the bugs and add the enhancements noted in the Red Hat Enterprise
  MRG 2 Technical Notes. After installing the updated packages, stop the
  cluster by either running "service qpidd stop" on all nodes, or
  "qpid-cluster --all-stop" on any one of the cluster nodes. Once stopped,
  restart the cluster with "service qpidd start" on all nodes for the update
  to take effect.
