  - CVE-2009-4565
summary: "Updated sendmail packages that fix one security issue and three bugs are\nnow available\
  \ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.\n\nThe Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update\
  \ as having low\nsecurity impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,\n\
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in\nthe References\
  \ section.\n\nSendmail is a Mail Transport Agent (MTA) used to send mail between\nmachines.\n\
  \nA flaw was found in the way sendmail handled NUL characters in the\nCommonName field of\
  \ X.509 certificates. An attacker able to get a\ncarefully-crafted certificate signed by a\
  \ trusted Certificate Authority\ncould trick sendmail into accepting it by mistake, allowing\
  \ the attacker to\nperform a man-in-the-middle attack or bypass intended client certificate\n\
  authentication. (CVE-2009-4565) \n\nThe CVE-2009-4565 issue only affected configurations using\
  \ TLS with\ncertificate verification and CommonName checking enabled, which is not a\ntypical\
  \ configuration.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, sendmail did\
  \ not correctly handle mail messages that had a\nlong first header line. A line with more\
  \ than 2048 characters was split,\ncausing the part of the line exceeding the limit, as well\
  \ as all of the\nfollowing mail headers, to be incorrectly handled as the message body.\n\
  (BZ#499450)\n\n* When an SMTP-sender is sending mail data to sendmail, it may spool that\n\
  data to a file in the mail queue. It was found that, if the SMTP-sender\nstopped sending data\
  \ and a timeout occurred, the file may have been left\nstalled in the mail queue, instead\
  \ of being deleted. This update may not\ncorrect this issue for every situation and configuration.\
  \ Refer to the\nSolution section for further information. (BZ#434645)\n\n* Previously, the\
  \ sendmail macro MAXHOSTNAMELEN used 64 characters as the\nlimit for the hostname length.\
  \ However, in some cases, it was used against\nan FQDN length, which has a maximum length\
  \ of 255 characters. With this\nupdate, the MAXHOSTNAMELEN limit has been changed to 255.\
  \ (BZ#485380)\n\nAll sendmail users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\n\
  backported patches to correct these issues. After installing this update,\nsendmail will be\
  \ restarted automatically."
