summary: |
  An updated thunderbird package that fixes several security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed content. Malicious
  content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
  code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-0801,
  CVE-2013-1674, CVE-2013-1675, CVE-2013-1676, CVE-2013-1677, CVE-2013-1678,
  CVE-2013-1679, CVE-2013-1680, CVE-2013-1681)

  A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled Content Level Constructors.
  Malicious content could use this flaw to perform cross-site scripting (XSS)
  attacks. (CVE-2013-1670)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
  Upstream acknowledges Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Jesse Ruderman,
  Timothy Nikkel, Jeff Walden, Nils, Ms2ger, Abhishek Arya, and Cody Crews as
  the original reporters of these issues.

  Note: All of the above issues cannot be exploited by a specially-crafted
  HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default for mail messages.
  They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when
  viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

  All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains Thunderbird version 17.0.6 ESR, which corrects these issues. After
  installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes to
  take effect.
