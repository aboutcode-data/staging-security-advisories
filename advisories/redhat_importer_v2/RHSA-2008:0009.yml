summary: |
  Updated Apache httpd packages that correct several security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Application Stack v2.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The Apache HTTP Server is a popular and freely-available Web server.

  These updated httpd packages resolve the following security issues:

  A flaw was found in the mod_imagemap module. On sites where mod_imagemap
  was enabled and an imagemap file was publicly available, a cross-site
  scripting attack was possible.  (CVE-2007-5000)

  A flaw was found in the mod_status module. On sites where mod_status was
  enabled and the status pages were publicly accessible, a cross-site
  scripting attack was possible.  (CVE-2007-6388)

  A flaw was found in the mod_proxy_balancer module. On sites where
  mod_proxy_balancer was enabled, a cross-site scripting attack against an
  authorized user was possible.  (CVE-2007-6421)

  A flaw was found in the mod_proxy_balancer module. On sites where
  mod_proxy_balancer was enabled, an authorized user could send a carefully
  crafted request that would cause the Apache child process handling that
  request to crash. This could lead to a denial of service if using a
  threaded Multi-Processing Module.  (CVE-2007-6422)

  A flaw was found in the mod_proxy_ftp module. On sites where mod_proxy_ftp
  was enabled and a forward proxy was configured, a cross-site scripting
  attack was possible against browsers which do not correctly derive the
  response character set following the rules in RFC 2616. (CVE-2008-0005)

  Users of httpd should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues. Users should restart httpd
  after installing this update.
