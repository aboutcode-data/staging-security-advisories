  - CVE-2011-4608
summary: |
  Updated mod_cluster packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5,
  and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  mod_cluster-native provides a native build of mod_cluster for the Apache
  HTTP Server (httpd). mod_cluster is an httpd-based load balancer. Like
  mod_jk, it uses a communication channel to forward requests from httpd to
  an application server node.

  It was found that mod_cluster allowed worker nodes to register on any
  virtual host (vhost), regardless of the security constraints applied to
  other vhosts. In a typical environment, there will be one vhost configured
  internally for worker nodes, and another configured externally for serving
  content. A remote attacker could use this flaw to register an
  attacker-controlled worker node via an external vhost that is not
  configured to apply security constraints, then use that worker node to
  serve malicious content, intercept credentials, and hijack user sessions.
  (CVE-2011-4608)

  This update also upgrades mod_cluster to version 1.0.10.GA_CP02.

  Users of mod_cluster should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  resolve this issue. After installing the updated packages, Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 4 users must restart the httpd22 service, and Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 users must restart the httpd service, for the
  update to take effect.
