  - CVE-2015-5223
summary: |
  Updated openstack-swift packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0, 6.0, and
  7.0.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  OpenStack Object Storage (swift) provides object storage in virtual
  containers, which allows users to store and retrieve files (arbitrary
  data). The service's distributed architecture supports horizontal scaling;
  redundancy as failure-proofing is provided through software-based data
  replication. Because Object Storage supports asynchronous eventual
  consistency replication, it is well suited to deployment in multiple
  data centers.

  A flaw was found in the OpenStack Object storage service (swift)
  tempurls. An attacker in possession of a tempurl key with PUT permissions
  may be able to gain read access to other objects in the same project.
  (CVE-2015-5223)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this
  issue. Upstream acknowledges Richard Hawkins of Rackspace, and the
  OpenStack Swift core reviewers as the original reporters.

  All users of openstack-swift are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct this issue. After installing this update, the
  OpenStack Object Storage services will be restarted automatically.
