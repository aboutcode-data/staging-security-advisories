summary: "Updated Gaim packages that fix a number of serious vulnerabilities are now\navailable.\n\
  \nGaim is an instant messenger client that can handle multiple protocols.\n\nStefan Esser\
  \ audited the Gaim source code and found a number of bugs that\nhave security implications.\
  \  Due to the nature of instant messaging many of\nthese bugs require man-in-the-middle attacks\
  \ between client and server.\nHowever at least one of the buffer overflows could be exploited\
  \ by an\nattacker sending a carefully-constructed malicious message through a server.\n\n\
  The issues include:\n\nMultiple buffer overflows that affect versions of Gaim 0.75 and earlier.\
  \ \n1) When parsing cookies in a Yahoo web connection, 2) YMSG protocol\noverflows parsing\
  \ the Yahoo login webpage, 3) a YMSG packet overflow, 4)\nflaws in the URL parser, and 5)\
  \ flaws in HTTP Proxy connect.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0006 to these issues.\n\nA buffer overflow in Gaim 0.74\
  \ and earlier in the Extract Info\nField Function used for MSN and YMSG protocol handlers.\
  \ The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name\
  \ CAN-2004-0007 to this issue.\n\nAn integer overflow in Gaim 0.74 and earlier, when allocating\n\
  memory for a directIM packet results in heap overflow.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\
  \ project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-0008 to this issue.\n\nAll users\
  \ of Gaim should upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain\nbackported security patches\
  \ correcting these issues.  \n\nRed Hat would like to thank Steffan Esser for finding and\
  \ reporting these\nissues and Jacques A. Vidrine for providing initial patches."
