  - CVE-2014-0160
summary: |
  Updated openssl packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
  and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
  full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

  An information disclosure flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS and
  DTLS Heartbeat Extension packets. A malicious TLS or DTLS client or server
  could send a specially crafted TLS or DTLS Heartbeat packet to disclose a
  limited portion of memory per request from a connected client or server.
  Note that the disclosed portions of memory could potentially include
  sensitive information such as private keys. (CVE-2014-0160)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Neel Mehta of Google Security as the original
  reporter.

  All OpenSSL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. For the update to take
  effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library (such as httpd and other
  SSL-enabled services) must be restarted or the system rebooted.
