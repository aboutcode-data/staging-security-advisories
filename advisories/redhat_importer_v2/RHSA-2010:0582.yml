summary: |
  Updated tomcat5 packages that fix three security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Application Server v2.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Apache Tomcat is a servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer
  Pages (JSP) technologies.

  A flaw was found in the way Tomcat handled the Transfer-Encoding header in
  HTTP requests. A specially-crafted HTTP request could prevent Tomcat from
  sending replies, or cause Tomcat to return truncated replies, or replies
  containing data related to the requests of other users, for all subsequent
  HTTP requests. (CVE-2010-2227)

  Two directory traversal flaws were found in the Tomcat deployment process.
  A specially-crafted WAR file could, when deployed, cause a file to be
  created outside of the web root into any directory writable by the Tomcat
  user, or could lead to the deletion of files in the Tomcat host's work
  directory. (CVE-2009-2693, CVE-2009-2902)

  Users of Tomcat should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to resolve these issues. Tomcat must be restarted for
  this update to take effect.
