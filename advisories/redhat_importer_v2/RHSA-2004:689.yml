summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix several security issues in Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 3 are now available.

  The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.

  This advisory includes fixes for several security issues:

  Petr Vandrovec discovered a flaw in the 32bit emulation code affecting the
  Linux 2.4 kernel on the AMD64 architecture.  A local attacker could use
  this flaw to gain privileges. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
  project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1144 to this issue.

  ISEC security research discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the IGMP
  functionality which was backported in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3
  kernels.  These flaws could allow a local user to cause a denial of
  service (crash) or potentially gain privileges.  Where multicast
  applications are being used on a system, these flaws may also allow remote
  users to cause a denial of service.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1137 to
  this issue.

  ISEC security research and Georgi Guninski independantly discovered a flaw
  in the scm_send function in the auxiliary message layer.  A local user
  could create a carefully crafted auxiliary message which could cause a
  denial of service (system hang).  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
  project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1016 to this issue.

  A floating point information leak was discovered in the ia64 architecture
  context switch code.  A local user could use this flaw to read register
  values of other processes by setting the MFH bit. The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
  name CAN-2004-0565 to this issue.

  Kirill Korotaev found a flaw in load_elf_binary affecting kernels prior to
  2.4.26.  A local user could create a carefully crafted binary in such a
  way that it would cause a denial of service (system crash).  The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
  name CAN-2004-1234 to this issue.

  These packages also fix issues in the io_edgeport driver, and a memory leak
  in ip_options_get.

  Note: The kernel-unsupported package contains various drivers and modules
  that are unsupported and therefore might contain security problems that
  have not been addressed.

  All Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 users are advised to upgrade their
  kernels to the packages associated with their machine architectures
  and configurations as listed in this erratum.
