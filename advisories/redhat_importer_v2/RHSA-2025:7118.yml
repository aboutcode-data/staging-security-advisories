summary: |
  An update for osbuild and osbuild-composer is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  A service for building customized OS artifacts, such as VM images and OSTree commits, that uses osbuild under the hood. Besides building images for local usage, it can also upload images directly to cloud.  It is compatible with composer-cli and cockpit-composer clients.

  Security Fix(es):

  * golang-fips/openssl: Memory leaks in code encrypting and decrypting RSA payloads (CVE-2024-1394)

  * go/build/constraint: golang: Calling Parse on a "// +build" build tag line with deeply nested expressions can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion (CVE-2024-34158)

  * golang-fips: Golang FIPS zeroed buffer (CVE-2024-9355)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.
