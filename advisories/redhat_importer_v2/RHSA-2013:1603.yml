summary: |
  Updated luci packages that fix two security issues, several bugs, and add
  two enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Luci is a web-based high availability administration application.

  A flaw was found in the way the luci service was initialized. If a system
  administrator started the luci service from a directory that was writable
  to by a local user, that user could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code
  as the root or luci user. (CVE-2013-4482)

  A flaw was found in the way luci generated its configuration file. The file
  was created as world readable for a short period of time, allowing a local
  user to gain access to the authentication secrets stored in the
  configuration file. (CVE-2013-4481)

  These issues were discovered by Jan Pokorný of Red Hat.

  These updated luci packages include numerous bug fixes and two
  enhancements. Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this
  advisory. Users are directed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Technical
  Notes, linked to in the References, for information on the most significant
  of these changes.

  All luci users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
  enhancements. After installing this update, the luci service will be
  restarted automatically.
