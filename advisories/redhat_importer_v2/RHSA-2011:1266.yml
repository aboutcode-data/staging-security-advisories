summary: |
  Updated seamonkey packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact.

  SeaMonkey is an open source web browser, email and newsgroup client, IRC
  chat client, and HTML editor.

  The RHSA-2011:1244 SeaMonkey update rendered HTTPS certificates signed by a
  certain Certificate Authority (CA) as untrusted, but made an exception for
  a select few. This update removes that exception, rendering every HTTPS
  certificate signed by that CA as untrusted. (BZ#735483)

  All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
  this issue. After installing the update, SeaMonkey must be restarted for
  the changes to take effect.
