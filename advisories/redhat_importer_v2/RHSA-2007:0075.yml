  - CVE-2007-0451
summary: |
  Updated spamassassin packages that fix a security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  SpamAssassin provides a way to reduce unsolicited commercial email (spam)
  from incoming email.

  A flaw was found in the way SpamAssassin processes HTML email containing
  URIs. A carefully crafted mail message could cause SpamAssassin to consume
  significant resources. If a number of these messages are sent, this could
  lead to a denial of service, potentially delaying or preventing the
  delivery  of email. (CVE-2007-0451)

  Users of SpamAssassin should upgrade to these updated packages which
  contain version 3.1.8 which is not vulnerable to these issues.
