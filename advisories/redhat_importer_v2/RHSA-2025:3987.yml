  Multicluster engine for Kubernetes v2.7.4 images

  The multicluster engine for Kubernetes provides the foundational components
  that are necessary for the centralized management of multiple
  Kubernetes-based clusters across data centers, public clouds, and private
  clouds.

  You can use the engine to create new Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
  clusters, or to import existing Kubernetes-based clusters for management.

  After the clusters are managed, you can use the APIs that are provided by
  the engine to distribute configuration that is based on placement policy.

  Security fix(es):

  * golang.org/x/oauth2: Unexpected memory consumption during token parsing in
  golang.org/x/oauth2 (CVE-2025-22868)
