summary: |
  An updated thunderbird package that fixes several security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Thunderbird. (CVE-2014-1518, CVE-2014-1524, CVE-2014-1529, CVE-2014-1531)

  A use-after-free flaw was found in the way Thunderbird resolved hosts in
  certain circumstances. An attacker could use this flaw to crash Thunderbird
  or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
  running Thunderbird. (CVE-2014-1532)

  An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the way Thunderbird decoded JPEG
  images. Loading an email or a web page containing a specially crafted JPEG
  image could cause Thunderbird to crash. (CVE-2014-1523)

  A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled browser navigations through
  history. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to cause the address bar
  of the browser to display a web page name while loading content from an
  entirely different web page, which could allow for cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attacks. (CVE-2014-1530)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
  Upstream acknowledges Bobby Holley, Carsten Book, Christoph Diehl, Gary
  Kwong, Jan de Mooij, Jesse Ruderman, Nathan Froyd, Christian Holler,
  Abhishek Arya, Mariusz Mlynski, moz_bug_r_a4, Nils, Tyson Smith and Jesse
  Schwartzentrube as the original reporters of these issues.

  Note: All of the above issues cannot be exploited by a specially crafted
  HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default for mail messages.
  They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when
  viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

  For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
  advisories for Thunderbird 24.5.0. You can find a link to the Mozilla
  advisories in the References section of this erratum.

  All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains Thunderbird version 24.5.0, which corrects these issues.
  After installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes
  to take effect.
