summary: "Updated images are now available for Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for\nKubernetes\
  \ (RHACS).\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of\
  \ Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed\
  \ severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References\
  \ section.\n\nThe release of RHACS 3.67 provides the following new features, bug fixes, security\
  \ patches and system changes:\n\nOpenShift Dedicated support\n\nRHACS 3.67 is thoroughly tested\
  \ and supported on OpenShift Dedicated on Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform.\n\
  \n1. Use OpenShift OAuth server as an identity provider\nIf you are using RHACS with OpenShift,\
  \ you can now configure the built-in OpenShift OAuth server as an identity provider for RHACS.\
  \ \n\n2. Enhancements for CI outputs\nRed Hat has improved the usability of RHACS CI integrations.\
  \ CI outputs now show additional detailed information about the vulnerabilities and the security\
  \ policies responsible for broken builds.\n\n3. Runtime Class policy criteria\nUsers can now\
  \ use RHACS to define the container runtime configuration that may be used to run a pod’s\
  \ containers using the Runtime Class policy criteria.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* civetweb:\
  \ directory traversal when using the built-in example HTTP form-based file upload mechanism\
  \ via the mg_handle_form_request API (CVE-2020-27304)\n\n* nodejs-axios: Regular expression\
  \ denial of service in trim function (CVE-2021-3749)\n\n* nodejs-prismjs: ReDoS vulnerability\
  \ (CVE-2021-3801)\n\n* golang: net: incorrect parsing of extraneous zero characters at the\
  \ beginning of an IP address octet (CVE-2021-29923)\n\n* helm: information disclosure vulnerability\
  \ (CVE-2021-32690)\n\n* golang: archive/zip: malformed archive may cause panic or memory exhaustion\
  \ (incomplete fix of CVE-2021-33196) (CVE-2021-39293)\n\n* nodejs-path-parse: ReDoS via splitDeviceRe,\
  \ splitTailRe and splitPathRe (CVE-2021-23343)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s),\
  \ including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer\
  \ to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nBug Fixes\nThe release of RHACS\
  \ 3.67 includes the following bug fixes:\n\n1. Previously, when using RHACS with the Compliance\
  \ Operator integration, RHACS did not respect or populate Compliance Operator TailoredProfiles.\
  \ This has been fixed.\n\n2. Previously, the Alpine Linux package manager (APK) in Image policy\
  \ looked for the presence of apk package in the image rather than the apk-tools package. This\
  \ issue has been fixed.\n\nSystem changes\nThe release of RHACS 3.67 includes the following\
  \ system changes:\n\n1. Scanner now identifies vulnerabilities in Ubuntu 21.10 images.\n2.\
  \ The Port exposure method policy criteria now include route as an exposure method.\n3. The\
  \ OpenShift: Kubeadmin Secret Accessed security policy now allows the OpenShift Compliance\
  \ Operator to check for the existence of the Kubeadmin secret without creating a violation.\n\
  4. The OpenShift Compliance Operator integration now supports using TailoredProfiles.\n5.\
  \ The RHACS Jenkins plugin now provides additional security information.\n6. When you enable\
  \ the environment variable ROX_NETWORK_ACCESS_LOG for Central, the logs contain the Request\
  \ URI and X-Forwarded-For header values.\n7. The default uid:gid pair for the Scanner image\
  \ is now 65534:65534.\n8. RHACS adds a new default Scope Manager role that includes minimum\
  \ permissions to create and modify access scopes.\n9. If microdnf is part of an image or shows\
  \ up in process execution, RHACS reports it as a security violation for the Red Hat Package\
  \ Manager in Image or the Red Hat Package Manager Execution security policies.\n10. In addition\
  \ to manually uploading vulnerability definitions in offline mode, you can now upload definitions\
  \ in online mode. \n11. You can now format the output of the following roxctl CLI commands\
  \ in table, csv, or JSON format: image scan, image check & deployment check\n12. You can now\
  \ use a regular expression for the deployment name while specifying policy exclusions"
