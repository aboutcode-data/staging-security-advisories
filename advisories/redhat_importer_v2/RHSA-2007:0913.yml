  - CVE-2007-3999
summary: |
  An updated nfs-utils-lib package to correct a security flaw is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The nfs-utils-lib package contains support libraries that are needed by the
  commands and daemons of the nfs-utils package.

  Tenable Network Security discovered a stack buffer overflow flaw in the RPC
  library used by nfs-utils-lib. A remote unauthenticated attacker who can
  access an application linked against nfs-utils-lib could trigger this flaw
  and cause the application to crash. On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 it is not
  possible to exploit this flaw to run arbitrary code as the overflow is
  blocked by FORTIFY_SOURCE. (CVE-2007-3999)

  Users of nfs-utils-lib are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
  which contains a backported patch that resolves this issue.
