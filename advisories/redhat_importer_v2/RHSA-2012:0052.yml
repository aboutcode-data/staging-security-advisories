  - CVE-2012-0056
summary: "Updated kernel packages that fix one security issue and three bugs are now \navailable\
  \ for for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. \n\nThe Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this\
  \ update as having\nimportant security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)\
  \ base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\nvulnerability\
  \ from the CVE links in the References section.\n\nThe kernel packages contain the Linux kernel,\
  \ the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nThis update fixes the following security issue:\n\
  \n* It was found that permissions were not checked properly in the Linux\nkernel when handling\
  \ the /proc/[pid]/mem writing functionality. A local,\nunprivileged user could use this flaw\
  \ to escalate their privileges. Refer\nto Red Hat Knowledgebase article DOC-69129, linked\
  \ to in the References,\nfor further information. (CVE-2012-0056, Important)\n\nRed Hat would\
  \ like to thank Jüri Aedla for reporting this issue.\n\nThis update fixes the following bugs:\n\
  \n* The RHSA-2011:1849 kernel update introduced a bug in the Linux kernel\nscheduler, causing\
  \ a \"WARNING: at kernel/sched.c:5915 thread_return\"\nmessage and a call trace to be logged.\
  \ This message was harmless, and was\nnot due to any system malfunctions or adverse behavior.\
  \ With this update,\nthe WARN_ON_ONCE() call in the scheduler that caused this harmless message\n\
  has been removed. (BZ#768288)\n\n* The RHSA-2011:1530 kernel update introduced a regression\
  \ in the way\nthe Linux kernel maps ELF headers for kernel modules into kernel memory.\nIf\
  \ a third-party kernel module is compiled on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux\nsystem with a kernel\
  \ prior to RHSA-2011:1530, then loading that module on\na system with RHSA-2011:1530 kernel\
  \ would result in corruption of one byte\nin the memory reserved for the module. In some cases,\
  \ this could prevent\nthe module from functioning correctly. (BZ#769595)\n\n* On some SMP\
  \ systems the tsc may erroneously be marked as unstable during\nearly system boot or while\
  \ the system is under heavy load. A \"Clocksource\ntsc unstable\" message was logged when\
  \ this occurred. As a result the system\nwould switch to the slower access, but higher precision\
  \ HPET clock.\n\nThe \"tsc=reliable\" kernel parameter is supposed to avoid this problem by\n\
  indicating that the system has a known good clock, however, the parameter\nonly affected run\
  \ time checks.  A fix has been put in to avoid the boot\ntime checks so that the TSC remains\
  \ as the clock for the duration of\nsystem runtime. (BZ#755867)\n\nUsers should upgrade to\
  \ these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system\
  \ must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect."
