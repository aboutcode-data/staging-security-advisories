summary: |
  This is the End Of Life notification for RHN Proxy Server 4.

  On December 31st, 2010, per the life-cycle support policy, the version 4
  series of Satellite and Proxy products exited Production Phase 2 marking
  the end of their support by Red Hat. Please reference the support policy
  here:

  https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/satellite/

  Though we are committed to the December 31st date for beginning the
  process of decommissioning Satellite and Proxy 4.x support, we recognize
  that our customers have woven these products very deeply into their
  processes and may need some time to migrate.

  For migration purposes, please note the following dates:
  - December 31st, 2010 - Satellite and Proxy 4.x ceased to be supported.
    Official support ended. Only Severity 1 issues and migration assistance
    will be addressed. Satellite and Proxy will continue to operate, but all
    customers are encouraged to migrate in a timely manner.
  - April 30th, 2011 - Satellite and Proxy 4.x active status will be
    terminated. Satellite and Proxy version 4.x will enter an inactive
    state. Satellite and Proxy communication to RHN Hosted will cease to
    function (for example, the satellite-sync command will no longer work).

  The Satellite Upgrade process starting point is outlined here:

  http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Network_Satellite/5.4/html/Installation_Guide/s1-upgrades.html

  How to proceed:
  - All Satellite and Proxy 4.x users must plan to migrate to a newer version
    prior to April 30th, 2011.
  - If you have a Technical Account Manager, contact that person immediately
    to discuss migration plans.
  - Otherwise, contact support for assistance:
    https://www.redhat.com/apps/support/
  - Alternatively, Red Hat Consulting can be engaged to assist with a smooth
    migration: http://www.redhat.com/consulting/
    More information on Red Hat Consulting for Satellite can be found here:

  http://www.redhat.com/f/pdf/consulting/RHNSatelliteImplementation-Brochure.pdf

  It is critical to ensure you have a plan to migrate off of Satellite and
  Proxy 4.x prior to April 30th, 2011.
