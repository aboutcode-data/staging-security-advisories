  - CVE-2011-1928
summary: |
  Updated apr packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The Apache Portable Runtime (APR) is a portability library used by the
  Apache HTTP Server and other projects. It provides a free library of C data
  structures and routines.

  The fix for CVE-2011-0419 (released via RHSA-2011:0507) introduced an
  infinite loop flaw in the apr_fnmatch() function when the APR_FNM_PATHNAME
  matching flag was used. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to
  cause a denial of service on an application using the apr_fnmatch()
  function. (CVE-2011-1928)

  Note: This problem affected httpd configurations using the "Location"
  directive with wildcard URLs. The denial of service could have been
  triggered during normal operation; it did not specifically require a
  malicious HTTP request.

  This update also addresses additional problems introduced by the rewrite of
  the apr_fnmatch() function, which was necessary to address the
  CVE-2011-0419 flaw.

  All apr users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue. Applications using the apr library,
  such as httpd, must be restarted for this update to take effect.
