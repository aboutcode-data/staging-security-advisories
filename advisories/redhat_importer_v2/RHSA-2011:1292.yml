  - CVE-2011-2729
summary: |
  An updated jakarta-commons-daemon-jsvc package that fixes one security
  issue is now available for JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0 for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The jakarta-commons-daemon-jsvc package includes jsvc, a service wrapper
  that allows Java applications to be run as daemons.

  It was found that jsvc did not correctly drop capabilities after starting
  an application. If an administrator used jsvc to run an application, and
  also used the "-user" option to specify a user for it to run as, the
  application correctly ran as that user but did not drop its increased
  capabilities, allowing it access to all files and directories accessible to
  the root user. (CVE-2011-2729)

  Note: This flaw does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, as the
  jakarta-commons-daemon-jsvc packages for those products are not built with
  capabilities support.

  Users of JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4
  should upgrade to this updated package, which contains backported patches
  to correct this issue. If jsvc is started, it must be restarted for this
  update to take effect.
