summary: |
  Red Hat Application Stack v1.3 is now available. This update fixes a
  security issue and adds several enhancements.

  This updated has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The Red Hat Application Stack is an integrated open source application
  stack, and includes JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP).

  Starting with this update, JBoss EAP is no longer provided via the
  Application Stack channels. Instead, all Application Stack customers are
  automatically entitled to the JBoss EAP channels. This ensures all users
  have immediate access to JBoss EAP packages when they are released,
  ensuring lesser wait for security and critical patches.

  As a result, you must MANUALLY subscribe to the appropriate JBoss EAP
  channel, as all further JBoss EAP updates will only go to that channel.

  This update also entitles all customers to the JBoss EAP 4.3.0 channels.
  Users receive support for JBoss EAP 4.3.0 if they choose to install it.
  Important: downgrading from JBoss EAP 4.3.0 to 4.2.0 is unsupported.

  MySQL was updated to version 5.0.50sp1a, fixing the following security
  issue:

  MySQL did not correctly check directories used as arguments for the DATA
  DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY directives. Using this flaw, an authenticated
  attacker could elevate their access privileges to tables created by other
  database users. Note: this attack does not work on existing tables. An
  attacker can only elevate their access to another user's tables as the
  tables are created. As well, the names of these created tables need to be
  predicted correctly for this attack to succeed. (CVE-2008-2079)

  The following packages are updated:

  * httpd to 2.0.63
  * mod_jk to 1.2.26
  * the MySQL Connector/ODBC to 3.51.24r1071
  * perl-DBD-MySQL to 4.006
  * perl-DBI to 1.604
  * postgresqlclient7 to 7.4.19
  * postgresql-jdbc to 8.1.412
  * unixODBC to 2.2.12
