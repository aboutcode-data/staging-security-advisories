  - CVE-2004-1154
summary: |
  Updated samba packages that fix an integer overflow vulnerability are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.

  Samba provides file and printer sharing services to SMB/CIFS clients.

  Greg MacManus of iDEFENSE Labs discovered an integer overflow bug in Samba
  versions prior to 3.0.10.  An authenticated remote user could exploit this
  bug, which could lead to arbitrary code execution on the Samba server.  The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
  the name CAN-2004-1154 to this issue.

  Please note that the patch included in RHSA-2004:681 was incomplete and may
  not have fixed CAN-2004-1154.  These packages contain a complete fix for
  CAN-2004-1154 along with some additional checks to mitigate similar issues
  in the future.

  Users of Samba should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported security patches, and are not vulnerable to these issues.
