summary: |
  An update for python-django is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0 (Kilo) for RHEL 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and a clean, pragmatic design. It focuses on automating as much as possible and adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A redirect flaw, where the is_safe_url() function did not correctly sanitize numeric-URL user input, was found in python-django. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to perform XSS attacks against the OpenStack dashboard. (CVE-2017-7233)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Django project for reporting this issue.
