  - CVE-2012-3540
summary: |
  Updated python-django-horizon packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat OpenStack Essex.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Horizon is the OpenStack Dashboard (http://www.openstack.org), a web
  interface for managing OpenStack services.

  An open redirect flaw was found in the way Horizon handled authentication.
  A remote attacker able to trick a victim into opening the Horizon login
  page using a specially-crafted link could redirect the victim to an
  arbitrary web page, and conduct phishing attacks, after the victim
  successfully logs in. (CVE-2012-3540)

  Red Hat would like to thank Thomas Biege of SUSE for reporting this issue.

  All users of Horizon are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which correct this issue. After installing the updated packages, the httpd
  daemon must be restarted ("service httpd restart") for the update to take
  effect.
