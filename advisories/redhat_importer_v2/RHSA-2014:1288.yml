  References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java
  applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  It was discovered that the implementation of
  org.hibernate.validator.util.ReflectionHelper together with the permissions
  required to run Hibernate Validator under the Java Security Manager could
  allow a malicious application deployed in the same application container to
  execute several actions with escalated privileges, which might otherwise
  not be possible. This flaw could be used to perform various attacks,
  including but not restricted to, arbitrary code execution in systems that
  are otherwise secured by the Java Security Manager. (CVE-2014-3558)

  This release of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform also includes bug
  fixes and enhancements. A list of these changes is available
  from the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.3.1 Downloads page on
  the Customer Portal.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.3 as provided
  from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
  The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.
