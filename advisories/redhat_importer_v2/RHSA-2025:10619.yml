summary: |
  An update for jq is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.8 Update Services for SAP Solutions and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.8 Telecommunications Update Service.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  jq is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. jq is like sed for JSON data. You can use it to slice, filter, map, or transform structured data with the same ease that sed, awk, grep, or similar applications allow you to manipulate text.

  Security Fix(es):

  * jq: jq has signed integer overflow in jv.c:jvp_array_write (CVE-2024-23337)

  * jq: AddressSanitizer: stack-buffer-overflow in jq_fuzz_execute (jv_string_vfmt) (CVE-2025-48060)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.
