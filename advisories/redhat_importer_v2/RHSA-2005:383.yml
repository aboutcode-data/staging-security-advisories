summary: "Updated firefox packages that fix various security bugs are now available.\n\nThis\
  \ update has been rated as having Important security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response\
  \ Team.\n\nMozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser.\n\nVladimir V. Perepelitsa discovered\
  \ a bug in the way Firefox handles\nanonymous functions during regular expression string replacement.\
  \ It is\npossible for a malicious web page to capture a random block of browser\nmemory. The\
  \ Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\nhas assigned the name CAN-2005-0989\
  \ to this issue.\n\nOmar Khan discovered a bug in the way Firefox processes the PLUGINSPAGE\n\
  tag. It is possible for a malicious web page to trick a user into pressing\nthe \"manual install\"\
  \ button for an unknown plugin leading to arbitrary\njavascript code execution. The Common\
  \ Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0752\
  \ to this issue.\n\nDoron Rosenberg discovered a bug in the way Firefox displays pop-up\n\
  windows. If a user choses to open a pop-up window whose URL is malicious\njavascript, the\
  \ script will be executed with elevated privileges. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures\
  \ project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2005-1153 to this issue.\n\nA bug was\
  \ found in the way Firefox handles the javascript global scope for\na window. It is possible\
  \ for a malicious web page to define a global\nvariable known to be used by a different site,\
  \ allowing malicious code to\nbe executed in the context of the site. The Common Vulnerabilities\
  \ and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-1154 to\nthis issue.\n\
  \nMichael Krax discovered a bug in the way Firefox handles favicon links. A\nmalicious web\
  \ page can programatically define a favicon link tag as\njavascript, executing arbitrary javascript\
  \ with elevated privileges. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has assigned\nthe name CAN-2005-1155 to this issue.\n\nMichael Krax discovered a bug in\
  \ the way Firefox installed search plugins.\nIf a user chooses to install a search plugin\
  \ from a malicious site, the new\nplugin could silently overwrite an existing plugin. This\
  \ could allow the\nmalicious plugin to execute arbitrary code and steal sensitive information.\n\
  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the names CAN-2005-1156\
  \ and CAN-2005-1157 to these issues. \n\nKohei Yoshino discovered a bug in the way Firefox\
  \ opens links in its\nsidebar. A malicious web page could construct a link in such a way that,\n\
  when clicked on, could execute arbitrary javascript with elevated\nprivileges. The Common\
  \ Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-1158\
  \ to this issue.\n\nA bug was found in the way Firefox validated several XPInstall related\n\
  javascript objects. A malicious web page could pass other objects to the\nXPInstall objects,\
  \ resulting in the javascript interpreter jumping to\narbitrary locations in memory. The Common\
  \ Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-1159\
  \ to this issue.\n\nA bug was found in the way the Firefox privileged UI code handled DOM\
  \ nodes\nfrom the content window. A malicious web page could install malicious\njavascript\
  \ code or steal data requiring a user to do commonplace actions\nsuch as clicking a link or\
  \ opening the context menu. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has assigned the name\nCAN-2005-1160 to this issue.\n\nUsers of Firefox are advised to upgrade\
  \ to this updated package which\ncontains Firefox version 1.0.3 and is not vulnerable to these\
  \ issues."
