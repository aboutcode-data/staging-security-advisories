  - CVE-2007-5503
summary: |
  Updated Cairo packages that resolve a security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Cairo is a vector graphics library designed to provide high-quality display
  and print output.

  An integer overflow flaw was found in the way Cairo processes PNG images.
  If an application linked against Cairo processes a malicious PNG image, it
  is possible to execute arbitrary code as the user running the application.
  (CVE-2007-5503)

  Users of Cairo are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to resolve this issue.
