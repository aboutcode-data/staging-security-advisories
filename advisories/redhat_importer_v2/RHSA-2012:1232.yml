summary: |
  JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.2.2, which fixes multiple security
  issues and various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform is the open source implementation of the
  Java EE suite of services and Portal services running atop JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform. It comprises a set of offerings for enterprise
  customers who are looking for pre-configured profiles of JBoss Enterprise
  Middleware components that have been tested and certified together to
  provide an integrated experience.

  This release of JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.2.2 serves as a
  replacement for JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.2.1, and includes bug
  fixes. Refer to the JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.2.2 Release Notes
  for information on the most significant of these changes. The Release Notes
  will be available shortly from https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/

  The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

  It was found that the JBoss JNDI service allowed unauthenticated, remote
  write access by default. The JNDI and HA-JNDI services, and the
  HAJNDIFactory invoker servlet were all affected. A remote attacker able to
  access the JNDI service (port 1099), HA-JNDI service (port 1100), or the
  HAJNDIFactory invoker servlet on a JBoss server could use this flaw to add,
  delete, and modify items in the JNDI tree. This could have various,
  application-specific impacts. (CVE-2011-4605)

  A flaw was found in the way the Apache Xerces2 Java Parser processed the
  SYSTEM identifier in DTDs. A remote attacker could provide a
  specially-crafted XML file, which once parsed by an application using the
  Apache Xerces2 Java Parser, would lead to a denial of service (application
  hang due to excessive CPU use). (CVE-2009-2625)

  It was found that the JMX Console did not protect against Cross-Site
  Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. If a remote attacker could trick a user,
  who was logged into the JMX Console, into visiting a specially-crafted URL,
  the attacker could perform operations on MBeans, which may lead to
  arbitrary code execution in the context of the JBoss server process.
  (CVE-2011-2908)

  A flaw was found in the way Apache POI, a Java API for manipulating files
  created with a Microsoft Office application, handled memory when processing
  certain Channel Definition Format (CDF) and Compound File Binary Format
  (CFBF) documents. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted CDF
  or CFBF document to an application using Apache POI, leading to a denial of
  service. (CVE-2012-0213)

  When a JBoss server is configured to use JaccAuthorizationRealm, the
  WebPermissionMapping class creates permissions that are not checked and can
  permit access to users without checking their roles. If the
  ignoreBaseDecision property is set to true on JBossWebRealm, the web
  authorization process is handled exclusively by JBossAuthorizationEngine,
  without any input from JBoss Web. This allows any valid user to access an
  application, without needing to be assigned the role specified in the
  application's web.xml "security-constraint" tag. (CVE-2012-1167)

  When a JGroups channel is started, the JGroups diagnostics service would be
  enabled by default with no authentication. This service is exposed via IP
  multicast. An attacker on an adjacent network could exploit this flaw to
  read diagnostics information. (CVE-2012-2377)

  Red Hat would like to thank Christian Schlüter (VIADA) for reporting the
  CVE-2011-4605 issue.

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up all applications deployed on
  JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform, along with all customized configuration
  files, and any databases and database settings.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.2.1 as provided from the
  Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Enterprise Portal
  Platform 5.2.2.
