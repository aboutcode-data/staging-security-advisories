summary: "An updated sysreport package that fixes an information disclosure flaw is\nnow available.\n\
  \nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response\
  \ Team\n\nSysreport is a utility that gathers information about a system's hardware\nand configuration.\
  \ The information can then be used for diagnostic purposes\nand debugging.\n\nWhen run by\
  \ the root user, sysreport includes the contents of the\n/etc/sysconfig/rhn/up2date configuration\
  \ file.  If up2date has been\nconfigured to connect to a proxy server that requires an authentication\n\
  password, that password is included in plain text in the system report. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures project assigned the name\nCAN-2005-1760 to this issue.\n\nUsers of sysreport\
  \ should update to this erratum package, which contains a\npatch that removes any proxy authentication\
  \ passwords."
