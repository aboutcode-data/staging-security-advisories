  - CVE-2012-6136
summary: "Updated tuned packages that fix several bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise\
  \ Linux 6.\n\nThe tuned packages contain a daemon that tunes system settings dynamically.\
  \ It does so by monitoring the usage of several system components periodically. \n\nThis update\
  \ fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.1 and later enters processor power-saving\
  \ states more aggressively. This could result in a small performance penalty on certain workloads.\
  \ With this update, the pmqos-static.py daemon has been added to the tuned packages, which\
  \ allows to set the requested latency using the kernel Power Management QoS interface. It\
  \ is run when the \"latency-performance\" profile is activated and it sets cpu_dma_latency=0,\
  \ which keeps the CPU in C0 state, thus making the system as responsive as possible. (BZ#714180)\n\
  \n* When the ELEVATOR_TUNE_DEVS option was set to a disk device in the /etc/sysconfig/ktune\
  \ file instead of providing a disk scheduler control file, the scheduler setting was not written\
  \ to a disk scheduler control file but directly into the disk device file. Consequently, contents\
  \ of the disk could become corrupted. With this update, the value of ELEVATOR_TUNE_DEVS is\
  \ checked and only the disk scheduler control file is allowed for writing. As a result, an\
  \ invalid value of ELEVATOR_TUNE_DEVS is detected in the described scenario so that the disk\
  \ contents damage can be prevented. (BZ#784308)\n\n* When the tuned daemon run with the \"\
  enterprise-storage\" profile enabled and a non-root, non-boot disk partition from a device\
  \ with write-back cache was mounted, tuned remounted the partition with the \"nobarriers\"\
  \ option. If a power failure occurred at that time, the file system could become corrupted.\
  \ With this update, tuned can detect usage of write-back cache on devices communicating with\
  \ kernel via SCSI. In these cases, \"nobarriers\" is now disabled, thus preventing this bug\
  \ in the described scenario. (BZ#801561)\n\n* Previously, when the tuned service was started,\
  \ the tuned PID file was created with world-writable permissions. This bug has been fixed\
  \ and the /var/run/tuned/tuned.pid file is now created with correct permissions as expected.\
  \ (BZ#845336)\n\n* On a machine with hot-plug disk devices with the \"enterprise-storage\"\
  \ profile activated, a new disk device could be added into the system, or the disk could be\
  \ removed and inserted back. In such a scenario, the scheduler and read-ahead settings from\
  \ the profile were not applied on the newly-added disks. With this update, a new udev rule\
  \ has been added, which restarts the ktune daemon whenever a new disk device is added, thus\
  \ fixing this bug. (BZ#847445)\n\n* The transparent hugepage kernel thread could interfere\
  \ with latency-sensitive applications. To lower the latency, the transparent hugepages are\
  \ now disabled in the latency-performance tuned profile. (BZ#887355)\n\n* Previously, non-root,\
  \ non-boot partitions were re-mounted using the \"nobarrier\" option to improve performance.\
  \ On virtual guests, this could lead to data corruption if power supply was suddenly interrupted,\
  \ because there was usually a host cache in transfer. This bug has been fixed and the virtual-guest\
  \ profile no longer re-mounts partitions using \"nobarrier\". (BZ#886956)\n\nUsers of tuned\
  \ are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which fix these bugs."
