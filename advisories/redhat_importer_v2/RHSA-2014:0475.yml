summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix three security issues and several bugs are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's netfilter connection
  tracking implementation for Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)
  packets used the skb_header_pointer() function. A remote attacker could use
  this flaw to send a specially crafted DCCP packet to crash the system or,
  potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2014-2523,
  Important)

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Adaptec RAID controller
  (aacraid) checked permissions of compat IOCTLs. A local attacker could use
  this flaw to bypass intended security restrictions. (CVE-2013-6383,
  Moderate)

  * A flaw was found in the way the handle_rx() function handled large
  network packets when mergeable buffers were disabled. A privileged guest
  user could use this flaw to crash the host or corrupt QEMU process memory
  on the host, which could potentially result in arbitrary code execution on
  the host with the privileges of the QEMU process. (CVE-2014-0077, Moderate)

  The CVE-2014-0077 issue was discovered by Michael S. Tsirkin of Red Hat.

  This update also fixes several bugs. Documentation for these changes will
  be available shortly from the Technical Notes document linked to in the
  References section.

  All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
  rebooted for this update to take effect.
