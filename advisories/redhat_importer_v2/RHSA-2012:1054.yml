  - CVE-2012-2088
  - CVE-2012-2113
summary: |
  Updated libtiff packages that fix multiple security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The libtiff packages contain a library of functions for manipulating Tagged
  Image File Format (TIFF) files.

  libtiff did not properly convert between signed and unsigned integer
  values, leading to a buffer overflow. An attacker could use this flaw to
  create a specially-crafted TIFF file that, when opened, would cause an
  application linked against libtiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary
  code. (CVE-2012-2088)

  Multiple integer overflow flaws, leading to heap-based buffer overflows,
  were found in the tiff2pdf tool. An attacker could use these flaws to
  create a specially-crafted TIFF file that would cause tiff2pdf to crash or,
  possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2012-2113)

  All libtiff users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to resolve these issues. All running applications linked
  against libtiff must be restarted for this update to take effect.
