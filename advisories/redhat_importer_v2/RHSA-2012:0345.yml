summary: |
  An update for JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 4.3 CP07 that fixes one
  security issue and one bug is now available from the Red Hat Customer
  Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform is the open source implementation of the
  Java EE suite of services and Portal services running atop JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform. It comprises a set of offerings for enterprise
  customers who are looking for pre-configured profiles of JBoss Enterprise
  Middleware components that have been tested and certified together to
  provide an integrated experience.

  It was found that JBoss Web did not handle large numbers of parameters and
  large parameter values efficiently. A remote attacker could make JBoss Web
  use an excessive amount of CPU time by sending an HTTP request containing a
  large number of parameters or large parameter values. This update
  introduces limits on the number of parameters and headers processed per
  request to address this issue. The default limit is 512 for parameters
  and 128 for headers. These defaults can be changed by setting the
  org.apache.tomcat.util.http.Parameters.MAX_COUNT and
  org.apache.tomcat.util.http.MimeHeaders.MAX_COUNT system properties in
  "jboss-as/server/[PROFILE]/deploy/properties-service.xml". (CVE-2012-0022)

  This update also fixes a bug that occurred when using certain forms with a
  custom encoding. (BZ#794470)

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up all applications deployed on
  JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform, along with all customized configuration
  files.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 4.3 CP07 as provided from the
  Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to install this update.
