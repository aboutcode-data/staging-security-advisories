  - CVE-2017-7895
summary: |
  An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.9 Long Life.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

  Security Fix(es):

  * The NFSv2 and NFSv3 server implementations in the Linux kernel through 4.10.13 lacked certain checks for the end of a buffer. A remote attacker could trigger a pointer-arithmetic error or possibly cause other unspecified impacts using crafted requests related to fs/nfsd/nfs3xdr.c and fs/nfsd/nfsxdr.c. (CVE-2017-7895, Important)

  Red Hat would like to thank Ari Kauppi for reporting this issue.

  Bug Fix(es):

  * When upgrading to kernel with the fix for stack guard flaw, a crash could occur in Java Virtual Machine (JVM) environments, which attempted to implement their own stack guard page. With this update, the underlying source code has been fixed to consider the PROT_NONE mapping as a part of the stack, and the crash in JVM no longer occurs under the described circumstances. (BZ#1472671)
