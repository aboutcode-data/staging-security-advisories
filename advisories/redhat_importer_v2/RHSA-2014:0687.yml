summary: |
  Updated libtasn1 packages that fix three security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The libtasn1 library provides Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) parsing
  and structures management, and Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) encoding
  and decoding functions.

  It was discovered that the asn1_get_bit_der() function of the libtasn1
  library incorrectly reported the length of ASN.1-encoded data. Specially
  crafted ASN.1 input could cause an application using libtasn1 to perform
  an out-of-bounds access operation, causing the application to crash or,
  possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-3468)

  Multiple incorrect buffer boundary check issues were discovered in
  libtasn1. Specially crafted ASN.1 input could cause an application using
  libtasn1 to crash. (CVE-2014-3467)

  Multiple NULL pointer dereference flaws were found in libtasn1's
  asn1_read_value() function. Specially crafted ASN.1 input could cause an
  application using libtasn1 to crash, if the application used the
  aforementioned function in a certain way. (CVE-2014-3469)

  Red Hat would like to thank GnuTLS upstream for reporting these issues.

  All libtasn1 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues. For the update to take effect, all applications
  linked to the libtasn1 library must be restarted.
