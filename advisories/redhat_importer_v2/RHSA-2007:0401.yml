summary: "Updated thunderbird packages that fix several security bugs are now\navailable for\
  \ Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.\n\nThis update has been rated as having critical security\
  \ impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nMozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail\
  \ and newsgroup client.\n\nSeveral flaws were found in the way Thunderbird processed certain\
  \ malformed\nJavaScript code. A web page containing malicious JavaScript code could\ncause\
  \ Thunderbird to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code\nas the user running Thunderbird.\
  \ (CVE-2007-2867, CVE-2007-2868)\n\nSeveral denial of service flaws were found in the way\
  \ Thunderbird handled\ncertain form and cookie data. A malicious web site that is able to\
  \ set\narbitrary form and cookie data could prevent Thunderbird from\nfunctioning properly.\
  \ (CVE-2007-1362, CVE-2007-2869)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Thunderbird processed certain\
  \ APOP\nauthentication requests. By sending certain responses when Thunderbird\nattempted\
  \ to authenticate against an APOP server, a remote attacker could\npotentially acquire certain\
  \ portions of a user's authentication\ncredentials. (CVE-2007-1558)\n\nA flaw was found in\
  \ the way Thunderbird displayed certain web content. A\nmalicious web page could generate\
  \ content which could overlay user\ninterface elements such as the hostname and security indicators,\
  \ tricking \nusers into thinking they are visiting a different site. (CVE-2007-2871)\n\nUsers\
  \ of Thunderbird are advised to apply this update, which contains\nThunderbird version 1.5.0.12\
  \ that corrects these issues."
