  - CVE-2003-0984
  - CVE-2003-0985
summary: "Updated kernel packages are now available that fix a security\nvulnerability which\
  \ may allow local users to gain root privileges.\n\nThe Linux kernel handles the basic functions\
  \ of the operating system.\n\nPaul Starzetz discovered a flaw in bounds checking in mremap()\
  \ in the Linux\nkernel versions 2.4.23 and previous which may allow a local attacker to\n\
  gain root privileges.  No exploit is currently available; however, it is\nbelieved that this\
  \ issue is exploitable (although not trivially.) The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures\
  \ project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2003-0985 to this issue.\n\nAll users\
  \ are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which contain a\nbackported security patch\
  \ that corrects this issue.  \n\nRed Hat would like to thank Paul Starzetz from ISEC for disclosing\
  \ this\nissue as well as Andrea Arcangeli and Solar Designer for working on the patch.\n\n\
  These packages also contain a fix for a minor information leak in the real\ntime clock (rtc)\
  \ routines. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned\
  \ the name CAN-2003-0984 to this issue.\n\nWe have provided kernel updates for Red Hat Linux\
  \ 7.1-8.0 with this\nadvisory as these were prepared by us prior to December 31 2003. Please\n\
  note that Red Hat Linux 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, and 8.0 have reached their end of\nlife for errata\
  \ support and no further errata will be issued for those\ndistributions."
