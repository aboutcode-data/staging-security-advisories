  - CVE-2004-0426
summary: |
  An updated rsync package that fixes a directory traversal security flaw is
  now available.

  Rsync is a program for synchronizing files over a network.

  Rsync before 2.6.1 does not properly sanitize paths when running a
  read/write daemon without using chroot.  This could allow a remote attacker
  to write files outside of the module's "path", depending on the privileges
  assigned to the rsync daemon.  Users not running an rsync daemon, running a
  read-only daemon, or running a chrooted daemon are not affected by this
  issue.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
  has assigned the name CAN-2004-0426 to this issue.

  Users of Rsync are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a backported patch and is not affected by this issue.
