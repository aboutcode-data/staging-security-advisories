summary: "Updated libtiff packages that fix various buffer and integer overflows are\nnow available.\n\
  \nThe libtiff package contains a library of functions for manipulating TIFF\n(Tagged Image\
  \ File Format) image format files. TIFF is a widely used file\nformat for bitmapped images.\
  \ \n\nDuring a source code audit, Chris Evans discovered a number of integer\noverflow bugs\
  \ that affect libtiff. An attacker who has the ability to trick\na user into opening a malicious\
  \ TIFF file could cause the application\nlinked to libtiff to crash or possibly execute arbitrary\
  \ code. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the\n\
  names CAN-2004-0886 and CAN-2004-0804 to these issues.\n\nAdditionally, a number of buffer\
  \ overflow bugs that affect libtiff have\nbeen found.  An attacker who has the ability to\
  \ trick a user into opening a\nmalicious TIFF file could cause the application linked to libtiff\
  \ to crash\nor possibly execute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures\
  \ project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0803 to\nthis issue.\n\nAll users\
  \ are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which contain\nfixes for these issues."
