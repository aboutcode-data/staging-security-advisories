  - CVE-2013-6445
summary: |
  Updated Grid component packages that fix two security issues, multiple
  bugs, and provide several enhancements are now available for Red Hat
  Enterprise MRG 2.5 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a next-generation
  IT infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG offers increased
  performance, reliability, interoperability, and faster computing for
  enterprise customers.

  MRG Grid provides high-throughput computing and enables enterprises to
  achieve higher peak computing capacity as well as improved infrastructure
  utilization by leveraging their existing technology to build high
  performance grids. MRG Grid provides a job-queueing mechanism, scheduling
  policy, and a priority scheme, as well as resource monitoring and resource
  management. Users submit their jobs to MRG Grid, where they are placed into
  a queue. MRG Grid then chooses when and where to run the jobs based upon a
  policy, carefully monitors their progress, and ultimately informs the user
  upon completion.

  A buffer over-read flaw was found in the way MongoDB handled BSON data.
  A database user permitted to insert BSON data into a MongoDB server could
  use this flaw to read server memory, potentially disclosing sensitive data.
  (CVE-2012-6619)

  Note: This update addresses CVE-2012-6619 by enabling the "--objcheck"
  option in the /etc/mongodb.conf file. If you have edited this file, the
  updated version will be stored as /etc/mongodb.conf.rpmnew, and you will
  need to merge the changes into /etc/mongodb.conf manually.

  It was found that MRG Management Console (cumin) used the crypt(3)
  DES-based hash function to hash passwords. DES-based hashing has known
  weaknesses that allow an attacker to recover plain text passwords from
  hashes. An attacker able to compromise a cumin user database could
  potentially use this flaw to recover plain text passwords from the password
  hashes stored in that database. (CVE-2013-6445)

  Note: In deployments where user account information is stored in a database
  managed by cumin, it is recommended that users change their passwords after
  this update is applied.

  The CVE-2013-6445 issue was discovered by Tomáš Nováčik of the Red Hat MRG
  Quality Engineering team.

  These updated packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 also provide numerous
  bug fixes and enhancements for the Grid component of Red Hat Enterprise
  MRG. Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this advisory.
  Refer to the Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 Technical Notes document, available
  shortly from the link in the References section, for information on
  these changes.

  All users of the Grid capabilities of Red Hat Enterprise MRG are advised to
  upgrade to these updated packages, which correct these issues and add these
  enhancements.
