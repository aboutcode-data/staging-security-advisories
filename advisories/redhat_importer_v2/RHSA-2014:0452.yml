summary: |
  Fuse ESB Enterprise/MQ Enterprise 7.1.0 R1 P3 (Patch 3 on Rollup Patch 1),
  which addresses several security issues and contains multiple bug fixes, is
  now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Fuse ESB Enterprise is an integration platform based on Apache ServiceMix.
  Fuse MQ Enterprise, based on Apache ActiveMQ, is a standards-compliant
  messaging system that is tailored for use in mission critical applications.

  This release of Fuse ESB Enterprise/MQ Enterprise 7.1.0 R1 P3 is an update
  to Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0 and Fuse MQ Enterprise 7.1.0. It includes
  various bug fixes, which are listed in the README file included with the
  patch files.

  The following security issues are also addressed with this release:

  It was found that XStream could deserialize arbitrary user-supplied XML
  content, representing objects of any type. A remote attacker able to pass
  XML to XStream could use this flaw to perform a variety of attacks,
  including remote code execution in the context of the server running the
  XStream application. (CVE-2013-7285)

  It was found that the Apache Camel XSLT component allowed XSL stylesheets
  to call external Java methods. A remote attacker able to submit messages to
  a Camel route could use this flaw to perform arbitrary remote code
  execution in the context of the Camel server process. (CVE-2014-0003)

  It was found that the ParserPool and Decrypter classes in the OpenSAML Java
  implementation resolved external entities, permitting XML External Entity
  (XXE) attacks. A remote attacker could use this flaw to read files
  accessible to the user running the application server and, potentially,
  perform other more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2013-6440)

  It was found that the Apache Camel XSLT component would resolve entities in
  XML messages when transforming them using an XSLT route. A remote attacker
  able to submit messages to an XSLT Camel route could use this flaw to read
  files accessible to the user running the application server and,
  potentially, perform other more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2014-0002)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way Apache Commons FileUpload
  handled small-sized buffers used by MultipartStream. A remote attacker
  could use this flaw to create a malformed Content-Type header for a
  multipart request, causing Apache Commons FileUpload to enter an infinite
  loop when processing such an incoming request. (CVE-2014-0050)

  The CVE-2014-0002 and CVE-2014-0003 issues were discovered by David Jorm of
  the Red Hat Security Response Team, and the CVE-2013-6440 issue was
  discovered by David Illsley, Ron Gutierrez of Gotham Digital Science, and
  David Jorm of the Red Hat Security Response Team.

  All users of Fuse ESB Enterprise/MQ Enterprise 7.1.0 as provided from the
  Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to Fuse ESB Enterprise/MQ
  Enterprise 7.1.0 R1 P3.
