  - CVE-2004-0398
summary: |
  An updated cadaver package is now available that fixes a vulnerability in
  neon which could be exploitable by a malicious DAV server.

  cadaver is a command-line WebDAV client that uses inbuilt code from neon,
  an HTTP and WebDAV client library.

  Stefan Esser discovered a flaw in the neon library which allows a heap
  buffer overflow in a date parsing routine.  An attacker could create
  a malicious WebDAV server in such a way as to allow arbitrary code
  execution on the client should a user connect to it using cadaver.  The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
  the name CAN-2004-0398 to this issue.

  Users of cadaver are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a patch correcting this issue.

  This issue does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.
