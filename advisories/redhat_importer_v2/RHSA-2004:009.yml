  - CVE-2003-0966
summary: |
  Updated elm packages are now available that fix a buffer overflow
  vulnerability in the 'frm' command.

  Elm is a terminal mode email user agent.  The frm command is provided as
  part of the Elm packages and gives a summary list of the sender and subject
  of selected messages in a mailbox or folder.

  A buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the frm command.  An attacker
  could create a message with an overly long Subject line such that when the
  frm command is run by a victim arbitrary code is executed.  The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
  CAN-2003-0966 to this issue.

  Users of the frm command should update to these erratum packages, which
  contain a backported security patch that corrects this issue.

  Red Hat would like to thank Paul Rubin for discovering and disclosing this
  issue.
