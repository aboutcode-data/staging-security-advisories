summary: "An updated SquirrelMail package that fixes a cross-site scripting\nvulnerability is\
  \ now available.\n\nSquirrelMail is a webmail package written in PHP.\n\nA cross-site scripting\
  \ bug has been found in SquirrelMail.  This issue\ncould allow an attacker to send a mail\
  \ with a carefully crafted header,\nwhich could result in causing the victim's machine to\
  \ execute a malicious\nscript. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned\
  \ the\nname CAN-2004-1036 to this issue.\n\nAdditionally, the following issues have been addressed:\n\
  \n- updated splash screens\n- HIGASHIYAMA Masato's patch to improve Japanese support\n- real\
  \ 1.4.3a tarball\n- config_local.php and default_pref in /etc/squirrelmail/ to match upstream\
  \   \n  RPM.\n\nPlease note that it is possible that upgrading to this package may remove\n\
  your SquirrelMail configuration files due to a bug in the RPM package. \nUpgrading will prevent\
  \ this from happening in the future.\n\nUsers of SquirrelMail are advised to upgrade to this\
  \ updated package which\ncontains a patched version of SquirrelMail version 1.43a and is not\n\
  vulnerable to these issues."
