summary: |
  Updated krb5 packages that fix three security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Kerberos is a network authentication system which allows clients and
  servers to authenticate to each other using symmetric encryption and a
  trusted third-party, the Key Distribution Center (KDC).

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the MIT Kerberos KDC
  processed principal names that were not null terminated, when the KDC was
  configured to use an LDAP back end. A remote attacker could use this flaw
  to crash the KDC via a specially-crafted request. (CVE-2011-0282)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way the MIT Kerberos KDC
  processed certain principal names when the KDC was configured to use an
  LDAP back end. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause the KDC to
  hang via a specially-crafted request. (CVE-2011-0281)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way the MIT Kerberos V5 slave KDC
  update server (kpropd) processed certain update requests for KDC database
  propagation. A remote attacker could use this flaw to terminate the kpropd
  daemon via a specially-crafted update request. (CVE-2010-4022)

  Red Hat would like to thank the MIT Kerberos Team for reporting the
  CVE-2011-0282 and CVE-2011-0281 issues. Upstream acknowledges Kevin
  Longfellow of Oracle Corporation as the original reporter of the
  CVE-2011-0281 issue.

  All krb5 users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the krb5kdc daemon will be restarted automatically.
