  - CVE-2007-6284
summary: |
  Updated libxml2 packages that fix a security issue are now available.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The libxml2 packages provide a library that allows you to manipulate XML
  files. It includes support to read, modify, and write XML and HTML files.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way libxml2 processes certain
  content. If an application linked against libxml2 processes malformed XML
  content, it could cause the application to stop responding. (CVE-2007-6284)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Google Security Team for responsibly
  disclosing this issue.

  All users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to resolve this issue.
