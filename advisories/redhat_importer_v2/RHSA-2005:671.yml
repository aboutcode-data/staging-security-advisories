summary: "Updated kdegraphics packages that resolve a security issue in kpdf are now\navailable.\n\
  \nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response\
  \ Team.\n\nThe kdegraphics packages contain applications for the K Desktop Environment\nincluding\
  \ kpdf, a pdf file viewer. \n\nA flaw was discovered in kpdf.  An attacker could construct\
  \ a carefully\ncrafted PDF file that would cause kpdf to consume all available disk space\n\
  in /tmp when opened. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nassigned the name CAN-2005-2097\
  \ to this issue.\n\nNote this issue does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 or 2.1.\n\n\
  Users of kpdf should upgrade to these updated packages, which contains a\nbackported patch\
  \ to resolve this issue."
