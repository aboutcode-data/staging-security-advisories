  - CVE-2010-0926
summary: |
  Updated samba packages that fix one security issue, one bug, and add one
  enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Samba is an open-source implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) or
  Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol, which allows PC-compatible
  machines to share files, printers, and other information.

  The default Samba server configuration enabled both the "wide links" and
  "unix extensions" options, allowing Samba clients with write access to a
  share to create symbolic links that point to any location on the file
  system. Clients connecting with CIFS UNIX extensions disabled could have
  such links resolved on the server, allowing them to access and possibly
  overwrite files outside of the share. With this update, "wide links" is
  set to "no" by default. In addition, the update ensures "wide links" is
  disabled for shares that have "unix extensions" enabled. (CVE-2010-0926)

  Warning: This update may cause files and directories that are only linked
  to Samba shares using symbolic links to become inaccessible to Samba
  clients. In deployments where support for CIFS UNIX extensions is not
  needed (such as when files are exported to Microsoft Windows clients),
  administrators may prefer to set the "unix extensions" option to "no" to
  allow the use of symbolic links to access files out of the shared
  directories. All existing symbolic links in a share should be reviewed
  before re-enabling "wide links".

  These updated samba packages also fix the following bug:

  * The smbclient tool sometimes failed to return the proper exit status
  code. Consequently, using smbclient in a script caused some scripts to
  fail. With this update, an upstream patch has been applied and smbclient
  now returns the correct exit status. (BZ#768908)

  In addition, these updated samba packages provide the following
  enhancement:

  * With this update, support for Windows Server 2008 R2 domains has been
  added. (BZ#736124)

  Users are advised to upgrade to these updated samba packages, which correct
  these issues and add this enhancement. After installing this update, the
  smb service will be restarted automatically.
