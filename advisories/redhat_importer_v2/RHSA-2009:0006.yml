summary: "Updated pkisetup, rhpki-common, rhpki-ca, rhpki-kra, rhpki-ocsp, rhpki-tks,\nand rhpki-tps\
  \ (and rhpki-util for Solaris 9) packages that fix various\nsecurity issues and several bugs\
  \ are now available for Red Hat Certificate\nSystem 7.2.\n\nThis update has been rated as\
  \ having moderate security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nRed Hat Certificate\
  \ System is an enterprise software system designed to\nmanage enterprise public key infrastructure\
  \ (PKI) deployments.\n\nIt was discovered that Red Hat Certificate System used insecure default\n\
  file permissions on certain configuration files (for example,\npassword.conf) that may contain\
  \ authentication credentials. These \ncredentials should only be accessible to administrative\
  \ and service users. \nA local user could use this flaw to read Red Hat Certificate System\
  \ \nconfiguration files containing sensitive information. (CVE-2008-2367)\n\nIt was discovered\
  \ that Red Hat Certificate System stored plain text\npasswords in multiple debug log files\
  \ with insufficient access restrictions\n(such as the UserDirEnrollment log and RA wizard\
  \ installer log). A local\nuser could use this flaw to extract plain text passwords from the\
  \ Red Hat\nCertificate System debug log files. (CVE-2008-2368)\n\nThese updated packages fix\
  \ the following bugs:\n\n* Due to a regression, signing a certificate revocation list (CRL)\
  \ with\napproximately 150,000 records may have taken up to five minutes. In these\nupdated\
  \ packages, signing such CRLs takes approximately twenty seconds.\n\n* Because Certificate\
  \ System servers could not handle Online Certificate \nStatus Protocol (OCSP) requests in\
  \ the GET method, OCSP GET requests \nresulted in a 404 error. The bug for handling GET requests\
  \ may have also \ncaused a system to use 100% CPU. This has been resolved. Additionally, \n\
  OCSP requests are now logged to the debug log file.\n\n* It was possible for a CRL update\
  \ to run at the same time as a certificate\nstatus update. Now, CRL updating locks out the\
  \ certificate status update\nthread.\n\n* Inefficient LDAP search methods caused LDAP searches\
  \ for 100,000 or \nmore revoked certificates to take twenty minutes or longer during CRL \n\
  generation. The LDAP search method has been modified to greatly improve \nLDAP search times.\n\
  \n* The default OCSP verification path has changed since Red Hat Certificate\nSystem 7.1.\
  \ These updated packages add support for certificates that use\nthe old AuthorityInfoAccess\
  \ (AIA) URL.\n\n* An OCSP client submitting an OCSP request via the GET method may have \n\
  caused a NullPointerException.\n\n* If an agent automatically approved a certificate signing\
  \ request (CSR),\nusing AgentCertAuth, the resultant certificate contained blank \nsubjectAltName\
  \ extension fields. A manual enrollment by the same agent \nproduced a certificate with the\
  \ correct number of subjectAltNames and no \nblank entries. With this update, automated enrollments\
  \ through \nAgentCertAuth do not have blank fields in issued certificates.\n\nAll users of\
  \ Red Hat Certificate System 7.2 should upgrade to these updated\npackages, which resolve\
  \ these issues."
