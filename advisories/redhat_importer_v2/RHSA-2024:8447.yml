  - CVE-2024-6232
summary: |
  An update for python3.12 is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.4 Extended Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Python 3.12 is an accessible, high-level, dynamically typed, interpreted programming language, designed with an emphasis on code readability. It includes an extensive standard library, and has a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries.  The python3.12 package provides the "python3.12" executable: the reference interpreter for the Python language, version 3. The majority of its standard library is provided in the python3.12-libs package, which should be installed automatically along with python3.12. The remaining parts of the Python standard library are broken out into the python3.12-tkinter and python3.12-test packages, which may need to be installed separately.  Documentation for Python is provided in the python3.12-docs package.  Packages containing additional libraries for Python are generally named with the "python3.12-" prefix.

  Security Fix(es):

  * python: cpython: tarfile: ReDos via excessive backtracking while parsing header values (CVE-2024-6232)
