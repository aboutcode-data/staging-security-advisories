  - CVE-2007-5191
summary: "Updated util-linux packages that fix a security issue are now available for\nRed Hat\
  \ Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security\
  \ impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nThe util-linux package contains a large\
  \ variety of low-level system\nutilities that are necessary for a Linux system to function.\
  \ \n\nA flaw was discovered in the way that the mount and umount utilities\nused the setuid\
  \ and setgid functions, which could lead to privileges being\ndropped improperly.  A local\
  \ user could use this flaw to run mount helper\napplications such as, mount.nfs, with additional\
  \ privileges (CVE-2007-5191).\n\nUsers are advised to update to these erratum packages which\
  \ contain a\nbackported patch to correct this issue."
