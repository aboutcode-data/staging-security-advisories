aliases:

  - CVE-2017-8386
summary: |
  An update for rh-git29-git is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Git is a distributed revision control system with a decentralized architecture. As opposed to centralized version control systems with a client-server model, Git ensures that each working copy of a Git repository is an exact copy with complete revision history. This not only allows the user to work on and contribute to projects without the need to have permission to push the changes to their official repositories, but also makes it possible for the user to work with no network connection.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A shell command injection flaw related to the handling of "ssh" URLs has been discovered in Git. An attacker could use this flaw to execute shell commands with the privileges of the user running the Git client, for example, when performing a "clone" action on a malicious repository or a legitimate repository containing a malicious commit. (CVE-2017-1000117)

  * A flaw was found in the way git-shell handled command-line options for the restricted set of git-shell commands. A remote, authenticated attacker could use this flaw to bypass git-shell restrictions, to view and manipulate files, by abusing the instance of the less command launched using crafted command-line options. (CVE-2017-8386)
