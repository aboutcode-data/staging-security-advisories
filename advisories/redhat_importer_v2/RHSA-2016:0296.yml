summary: |
  Updated rh-ror41-rubygem-actionpack, rh-ror41-rubygem-actionview,
  rh-ror41-rubygem-activemodel, and rh-ror41-rubygem-activerecord packages
  that fix multiple security issues are now available for Red Hat Software
  Collections.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The rh-ror41 collection provides Ruby on Rails version 4.1. Ruby on Rails
  is a model-view-controller (MVC) framework for web application development.

  The following issue was corrected in rubygem-actionpack and
  rubygem-actionview:

  A directory traversal flaw was found in the way the Action View component
  searched for templates for rendering. If an application passed untrusted
  input to the 'render' method, a remote, unauthenticated attacker could use
  this to render unexpected files and, possibly, execute arbitrary code.
  (CVE-2016-0752)

  The following issues were corrected in rubygem-actionpack:

  A flaw was found in the way the Action Pack component performed MIME type
  lookups. Since queries were cached in a global cache of MIME types, an
  attacker could use this flaw to grow the cache indefinitely, potentially
  resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2016-0751)

  A flaw was found in the Action Pack component's caching of controller
  references. An attacker could use this flaw to cause unbounded memory
  growth, potentially resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-7581)

  A flaw was found in the way the Action Controller component compared user
  names and passwords when performing HTTP basic authentication. Time taken
  to compare strings could differ depending on input, possibly allowing a
  remote attacker to determine valid user names and passwords using a timing
  attack. (CVE-2015-7576)

  The following issue was corrected in rubygem-activerecord:

  A flaw was found in the Active Record component's handling of nested
  attributes in combination with the destroy flag. An attacker could possibly
  use this flaw to set attributes to invalid values or clear all attributes.
  (CVE-2015-7577)

  The following issue was corrected in rubygem-activemodel and
  rubygem-activerecord:

  A flaw was found in the way the Active Model based models processed
  attributes. An attacker with the ability to pass arbitrary attributes to
  models could possibly use this flaw to bypass input validation.
  (CVE-2016-0753)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Ruby on Rails project for reporting these
  issues. Upstream acknowledges John Poulin as the original reporter of
  CVE-2016-0752, Aaron Patterson of Red Hat as the original reporter of
  CVE-2016-0751, Daniel Waterworth as the original reporter of CVE-2015-7576,
  Justin Coyne as the original reporter of CVE-2015-7577, and John Backus
  from BlockScore as the original reporter of CVE-2016-0753.

  All rh-ror41 collection rubygem-actionpack, rubygem-actionview,
  rubygem-activemodel, and rubygem-activerecord packages users are advised to
  upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported patches to
  correct these issues. All running applications using the rh-ror41
  collection must be restarted for this update to take effect.
