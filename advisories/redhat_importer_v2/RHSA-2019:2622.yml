  - CVE-2019-14433
summary: "An update for openstack-nova is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13.0\
  \ (Queens).\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact\
  \ of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed\
  \ severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References\
  \ section.\n\nOpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual machines,\
  \ creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform. Compute provides the software,\
  \ control panels, and APIs required to orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine\
  \ instances and controlling access through users and projects.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* openstack-nova:\
  \ Nova server resource faults leak external exception details (CVE-2019-14433)\n\nFor more\
  \ details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments,\
  \ and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\
  \nBug Fix(es):\n\n* Previously, the heal info cache periodic task used the network info cache\
  \ to heal the network info cache. If the cache was corrupted or missing, the heal info cache\
  \ task could not heal the network info cache.\n\nWith this update, the heal info cache uses\
  \ VM data from Neutron when healing the network info cache. (BZ#1703225)\n\n* Previously,\
  \ evacuation, migration, and resize operations took unnecessarily long to process on destination\
  \ hosts with a large number of network interfaces. This was due to the my_ip configuration\
  \ printing a warning when it did not find any of the host interfaces. \n\nWith this update,\
  \ the my_ip configuration occurs only once during host initialization. This reduces the time\
  \ it takes to process migrations, evacuations, and resize operations. (BZ#1732879)"
