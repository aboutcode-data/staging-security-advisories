summary: |
  An update for ntp is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time with another referenced time source. These packages include the ntpd service which continuously adjusts system time and utilities used to query and configure the ntpd service.

  Security Fix(es):

  * Two vulnerabilities were discovered in the NTP server's parsing of configuration directives. A remote, authenticated attacker could cause ntpd to crash by sending a crafted message. (CVE-2017-6463, CVE-2017-6464)

  * A vulnerability was found in NTP, in the parsing of packets from the /dev/datum device. A malicious device could send crafted messages, causing ntpd to crash. (CVE-2017-6462)

  Red Hat would like to thank the NTP project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Cure53 as the original reporter of these issues.
