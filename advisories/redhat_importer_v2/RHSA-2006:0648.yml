summary: "Updated kdegraphics packages that fix several security flaws in kfax are\nnow available\
  \ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, and 3.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate\
  \ security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nThe kdegraphics package contains\
  \ graphics applications for the K Desktop\nEnvironment.\n\nTavis Ormandy of Google discovered\
  \ a number of flaws in libtiff during a\nsecurity audit.  The kfax application contains a\
  \ copy of the libtiff code\nused for parsing TIFF files and is therefore affected by these\
  \ flaws.  \nAn attacker who has the ability to trick a user into opening a malicious\nTIFF\
  \ file could cause kfax to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2006-3459, CVE-2006-3460,\
  \ CVE-2006-3461, CVE-2006-3462, CVE-2006-3463,\nCVE-2006-3464, CVE-2006-3465)\n\nRed Hat Enterprise\
  \ Linux 4 is not vulnerable to these issues as kfax uses\nthe shared libtiff library which\
  \ has been fixed in a previous update.\n\nUsers of kfax should upgrade to these updated packages,\
  \ which contain\nbackported patches and are not vulnerable to this issue."
