  - CVE-2006-1168
  - CVE-2011-2716
summary: |
  Updated busybox packages that fix two security issues and several bugs are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  BusyBox provides a single binary that includes versions of a large number
  of system commands, including a shell. This can be very useful for
  recovering from certain types of system failures, particularly those
  involving broken shared libraries.

  A buffer underflow flaw was found in the way the uncompress utility of
  BusyBox expanded certain archive files compressed using Lempel-Ziv
  compression. If a user were tricked into expanding a specially-crafted
  archive file with uncompress, it could cause BusyBox to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
  running BusyBox. (CVE-2006-1168)

  The BusyBox DHCP client, udhcpc, did not sufficiently sanitize certain
  options provided in DHCP server replies, such as the client hostname. A
  malicious DHCP server could send such an option with a specially-crafted
  value to a DHCP client. If this option's value was saved on the client
  system, and then later insecurely evaluated by a process that assumes the
  option is trusted, it could lead to arbitrary code execution with the
  privileges of that process. Note: udhcpc is not used on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux by default, and no DHCP client script is provided with the busybox
  packages. (CVE-2011-2716)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Prior to this update, the "findfs" command did not recognize Btrfs
  partitions. As a consequence, an error message could occur when dumping a
  core file. This update adds support for recognizing such partitions so
  the problem no longer occurs. (BZ#751927)

  * If the "grep" command was used with the "-F" and "-i" options at the
  same time, the "-i" option was ignored. As a consequence, the "grep -iF"
  command incorrectly performed a case-sensitive search instead of an
  insensitive search. A patch has been applied to ensure that the combination
  of the "-F" and "-i" options works as expected. (BZ#752134)

  * Prior to this update, the msh shell did not support the "set -o pipefail"
  command. This update adds support for this command. (BZ#782018)

  * Previously, the msh shell could terminate unexpectedly with a
  segmentation fault when attempting to execute an empty command as a result
  of variable substitution (for example msh -c '$nonexistent_variable').
  With this update, msh has been modified to correctly interpret such
  commands and no longer crashes in this scenario. (BZ#809092)

  * Previously, the msh shell incorrectly executed empty loops. As a
  consequence, msh never exited such a loop even if the loop condition was
  false, which could cause scripts using the loop to become unresponsive.
  With this update, msh has been modified to execute and exit empty loops
  correctly, so that hangs no longer occur. (BZ#752132)

  All users of busybox are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to fix these issues.
