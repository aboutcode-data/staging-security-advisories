aliases:
  - CVE-2013-4222
summary: |
  Updated openstack-keystone packages that fix one security issue and several
  bugs are now available for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The openstack-keystone packages provide Keystone, a Python implementation
  of the OpenStack identity service API, which provides Identity, Token,
  Catalog, and Policy services.

  It was found that tokens issued to a tenant were not invalidated when that
  tenant was disabled in Keystone. This could allow users assigned to a
  disabled tenant to retain access to resources they should no longer be able
  to access. (CVE-2013-4222)

  These updated packages have been upgraded to upstream version 2013.1.4,
  which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.
  (BZ#1021641)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * WebOb 1.0 has been removed from the Red Hat Openstack 3.0 package
  requirements; all packages now use WebOb 1.2.3. (BZ#1012694)

  All users of openstack-keystone are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the Keystone service (openstack-keystone) will be restarted
  automatically.
