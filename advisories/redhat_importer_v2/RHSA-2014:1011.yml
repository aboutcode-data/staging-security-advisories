  - CVE-2014-3490
summary: |
  Updated resteasy-base packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  RESTEasy contains a JBoss project that provides frameworks to help build
  RESTful Web Services and RESTful Java applications. It is a fully certified
  and portable implementation of the JAX-RS specification.

  It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-0818 was incomplete: external
  parameter entities were not disabled when the
  resteasy.document.expand.entity.references parameter was set to false.
  A remote attacker able to send XML requests to a RESTEasy endpoint could
  use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application
  server, and potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks.
  (CVE-2014-3490)

  This issue was discovered by David Jorm of Red Hat Product Security.

  All resteasy-base users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
