  - CVE-2018-1102
summary: |
  An update for source-to-image is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Source-to-Image (S2I) is a tool for building reproducible container images. It produces ready-to-run images by injecting a user source into a container image and assembling a new container image. The new image incorporates the base image (the builder) and built source, and is ready to use with the "docker run" command. S2I supports incremental builds, which re-use previously downloaded dependencies, previously built artifacts, and more.

  The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: source-to-image (1.1.13). (BZ#1654243)

  Security Fix(es):

  * source-to-image: Improper path sanitization in ExtractTarStreamFromTarReader in tar/tar.go (CVE-2018-1102)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.
