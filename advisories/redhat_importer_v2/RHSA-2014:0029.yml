summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.2.0, which fixes multiple security issues,
  various bugs, and adds enhancements, is now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Data Grid is a distributed in-memory data grid, based on
  Infinispan.

  This release of Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.2.0 serves as a replacement for
  Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.1.0. It includes various bug fixes and
  enhancements which are detailed in the Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.2.0
  Release Notes. The Release Notes will be available shortly from
  https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/Red_Hat_JBoss_Data_Grid/

  This update also fixes the following security issues:

  Multiple path traversal flaws where found in the Mojarra JSF2
  implementation for identifying resources by name or by library.
  An unauthenticated, remote attacker could use these flaws to gather
  otherwise undisclosed information from within an application's root
  directory. (CVE-2013-3827)

  It was found that the SolrResourceLoader class in Apache Solr allowed
  loading of resources via absolute paths, or relative paths which were not
  sanitized for directory traversal. Some Solr components expose REST
  interfaces which load resources (XSL style sheets and Velocity templates)
  via SolrResourceLoader, using paths identified by REST parameters. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to load arbitrary local files on the server
  via SolrResourceLoader, potentially resulting in information disclosure or
  remote code execution. (CVE-2013-6397)

  It was found that the XML and XSLT UpdateRequestHandler classes in Apache
  Solr would resolve external entities, allowing an attacker to conduct XML
  External Entity (XXE) attacks. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  read files accessible to the user running the application server, and
  potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2012-6612,
  CVE-2013-6407)

  It was found that the DocumentAnalysisRequestHandler class in Apache Solr
  would resolve external entities, allowing an attacker to conduct XXE
  attacks. A remote attacker could use this flaw to read files accessible to
  the user running the application server, and potentially perform other more
  advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2013-6408)

  The data file used by PicketBox Vault to store encrypted passwords contains
  a copy of its own admin key. The file is encrypted using only this admin
  key, not the corresponding JKS key. A local attacker with permission to
  read the vault data file could read the admin key from the file.
  (CVE-2013-1921)

  The HawtJNI Library class wrote native libraries to a predictable file name
  in /tmp/ when the native libraries were bundled in a JAR file, and no
  custom library path was specified. A local attacker could overwrite these
  native libraries with malicious versions during the window between when
  HawtJNI writes them and when they are executed. (CVE-2013-2035)

  A flaw was found in JGroup's DiagnosticsHandler that allowed an attacker on
  an adjacent network to reuse the credentials from a previous successful
  authentication. This could be exploited to read diagnostic information
  (information disclosure) and attain limited remote code execution.
  (CVE-2013-4112)

  Note that CVE-2013-6397, CVE-2013-6407, and CVE-2013-6408 are not exposed
  by default. They are only exploitable if a user has manually exposed
  servlets provided in the Apachr Solr component that ships with Red Hat
  JBoss Data Grid, or written their own code that makes use of the vulnerable
  elements of Apache Solr.

  The CVE-2013-2035 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat
  Product Security Team.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.1.0 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.2.0.
