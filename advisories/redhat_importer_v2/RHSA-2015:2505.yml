summary: |
  Updated abrt and libreport packages that fix three security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  ABRT (Automatic Bug Reporting Tool) is a tool to help users to detect
  defects in applications and to create a bug report with all the information
  needed by a maintainer to fix it. It uses a plug-in system to extend its
  functionality. libreport provides an API for reporting different problems
  in applications to different bug targets, such as Bugzilla, FTP, and Trac.

  It was found that the ABRT debug information installer
  (abrt-action-install-debuginfo-to-abrt-cache) did not use temporary
  directories in a secure way. A local attacker could use the flaw to create
  symbolic links and files at arbitrary locations as the abrt user.
  (CVE-2015-5273)

  It was discovered that the kernel-invoked coredump processor provided by
  ABRT did not handle symbolic links correctly when writing core dumps of
  ABRT programs to the ABRT dump directory (/var/spool/abrt). A local
  attacker with write access to an ABRT problem directory could use this flaw
  to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2015-5287)

  It was found that ABRT may have exposed unintended information to Red Hat
  Bugzilla during crash reporting. A bug in the libreport library caused
  changes made by a user in files included in a crash report to be discarded.
  As a result, Red Hat Bugzilla attachments may contain data that was not
  intended to be made public, including host names, IP addresses, or command
  line options. (CVE-2015-5302)

  This flaw did not affect default installations of ABRT on Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux as they do not post data to Red Hat Bugzilla. This feature
  can however be enabled, potentially impacting modified ABRT instances.

  As a precaution, Red Hat has identified bugs filed by such non-default Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux users of ABRT and marked them private.

  Red Hat would like to thank Philip Pettersson of Samsung for reporting the
  CVE-2015-5273 and CVE-2015-5287 issues. The CVE-2015-5302 issue was
  discovered by Bastien Nocera of Red Hat.

  All users of abrt and libreport are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.
