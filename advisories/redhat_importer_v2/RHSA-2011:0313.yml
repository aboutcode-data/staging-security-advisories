summary: |
  Updated seamonkey packages that fix several security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  SeaMonkey is an open source web browser, email and newsgroup client, IRC
  chat client, and HTML editor.

  A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled dialog boxes. An attacker
  could use this flaw to create a malicious web page that would present a
  blank dialog box that has non-functioning buttons. If a user closes the
  dialog box window, it could unexpectedly grant the malicious web page
  elevated privileges. (CVE-2011-0051)

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  SeaMonkey. (CVE-2011-0053)

  A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled plug-ins that perform HTTP
  requests. If a plug-in performed an HTTP request, and the server sent a 307
  redirect response, the plug-in was not notified, and the HTTP request was
  forwarded. The forwarded request could contain custom headers, which could
  result in a Cross Site Request Forgery attack. (CVE-2011-0059)

  All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
  these issues. After installing the update, SeaMonkey must be restarted for
  the changes to take effect.
