summary: |
  Red Hat Network Satellite Server version 5.1.1 is now available. This
  update includes fixes for a number of security issues in Red Hat Network
  Satellite Server Solaris client components.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  This release corrects several security vulnerabilities in components
  shipped as part of the Red Hat Network Satellite Server Solaris client. In
  a typical operating environment, these components are not used by the
  Satellite Server in a vulnerable manner. These security updates will reduce
  risk should these components be used by other applications.

  Several flaws in Zlib were discovered. An attacker could create a
  carefully-crafted compressed stream that would cause an application to
  crash if the stream was opened by a user. (CVE-2005-2096, CVE-2005-1849)

  A buffer overflow was discovered in the OpenSSL SSL_get_shared_ciphers()
  utility function. An attacker could send a list of ciphers to an
  application that used this function and overrun a buffer (CVE-2006-3738).

  A flaw in the SSLv2 client code was discovered. If a client application
  used OpenSSL to create an SSLv2 connection to a malicious server, that
  server could cause the client to crash. (CVE-2006-4343)

  An attack on OpenSSL PKCS #1 v1.5 signatures was discovered. Where an RSA
  key with exponent 3 was used an attacker could, potentially, forge a PKCS
  #1 v1.5 signature that would be incorrectly verified by implementations
  that do not check for excess data in the RSA exponentiation result of the
  signature. This issue affected applications that use OpenSSL to verify
  X.509 certificates as well as other uses of PKCS #1 v1.5. (CVE-2006-4339)

  OpenSSL contained a software work-around for a bug in SSL handling in
  Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.0.2. It is enabled in most servers
  that use OpenSSL to provide support for SSL and TLS. This work-around was
  vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack which allowed a remote user to
  force an SSL connection to use SSL 2.0, rather than a stronger protocol,
  such as SSL 3.0 or TLS 1.0. (CVE-2005-2969)

  During OpenSSL parsing of certain invalid ASN.1 structures, an error
  condition was mishandled. This could result in an infinite loop which
  consumed system memory (CVE-2006-2937).

  Certain public key types could take disproportionate amounts of time to
  process in OpenSSL, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2006-2940)

  A flaw was discovered in the Python repr() function's handling of
  UTF-32/UCS-4 strings. If an application used the repr() function on
  untrusted data, this could lead to a denial of service or, possibly, allow
  the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the application
  using the flawed function. (CVE-2006-4980)

  A flaw was discovered in the strxfrm() function of Python's locale module.
  Strings generated by this function were not properly NULL-terminated. This
  could, potentially, cause disclosure of data stored in the memory of an
  application using this function. (CVE-2007-2052)

  Multiple integer overflow flaws were discovered in Python's imageop module.
  If an application used the imageop module to process untrusted images, it
  could cause the application to crash, enter an infinite loop, or, possibly,
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Python interpreter.
  (CVE-2007-4965)

  A stack-based buffer overflow was discovered in the Python interpreter,
  which could allow a local user to gain privileges by running a script with
  a long name from the current working directory. (CVE-2006-1542)

  Users of Red Hat Network Satellite Server should upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.
