summary: |
  An updated ceph-deploy package that fixes two security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Ceph Storage.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat Ceph Storage is a massively scalable, open, software-defined
  storage platform that combines the most stable version of Ceph with a Ceph
  management platform, deployment tools, and support services.

  It was discovered that ceph-deploy, a utility for deploying Red Hat Ceph
  Storage, would create the keyring file with world readable permissions,
  which could possibly allow a local user to obtain authentication
  credentials from the keyring file. (CVE-2015-3010, CVE-2015-4053)

  All ceph-deploy users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains backported patches to correct these issues.
