  - CVE-2010-2063
summary: |
  Updated samba and samba3x packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5, and Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 4.7, 5.3, and 5.4 Extended Update Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Samba is a suite of programs used by machines to share files, printers, and
  other information.

  An input sanitization flaw was found in the way Samba parsed client data. A
  malicious client could send a specially-crafted SMB packet to the Samba
  server, resulting in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the
  Samba server (smbd). (CVE-2010-2063)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Samba team for responsibly reporting this
  issue. Upstream acknowledges Jun Mao as the original reporter.

  Users of Samba are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to resolve this issue. After installing this
  update, the smb service will be restarted automatically.
