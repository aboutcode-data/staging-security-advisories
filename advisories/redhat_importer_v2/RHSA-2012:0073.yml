summary: |
  This is the 30 day notification of the End Of Life plans for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 4.

  In accordance with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Errata Support Policy,
  the 7 year life-cycle of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 will end on February
  29, 2012 and your subscription services for that version will change.
  Active Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscribers using Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 4 will have the option to upgrade to currently supported versions
  of Red Hat Enterprise Linux and receive the full benefits of the
  subscription.

  After February 29, 2012, Red Hat will discontinue technical support
  services as well as software maintenance services for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 4 meaning that new bug fixes, security errata and product
  enhancements will no longer be provided for the following products:

  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS 4
  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES 4
  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux WS 4
  * Red Hat Desktop 4
  * Red Hat Global File System 4
  * Red Hat Cluster Suite 4

  Customers who choose to continue to deploy Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4
  offerings will continue to have access via Red Hat Network (RHN) to the
  following content as part of their active Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  subscription:

  - Previously released bug fixes, security errata and product
    enhancements.
  - Red Hat Knowledge Base and other content (whitepapers, reference
    architectures, etc) found in the Red Hat Customer Portal.
  - All Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 documentation.

  Customers are strongly encouraged to take advantage of the upgrade
  benefits of their active Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription and
  migrate to an active version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux such as
  version 5 or 6.

  For customers who are unable to migrate off Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4
  before its end-of-life date and require software maintenance and/or
  technical support, Red Hat offers an optional support extension called
  the Extended Life-cycle Support (ELS) Add-On Subscription. The ELS
  Subscription provides up to three additional years of limited Software
  Maintenance (Production 3 Phase) for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 with
  unlimited technical support, critical Security Advisories (RHSAs) and
  selected Urgent Priority Bug Advisories (RHBAs). For more information,
  contact your Red Hat sales representative or channel partner.

  Details of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux life-cycle can be found on the
  Red Hat website: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/
