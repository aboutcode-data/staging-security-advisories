summary: "Updated kernel-rt packages that fix two security issues, several bugs, and\nadd one\
  \ enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.\n\nRed Hat Product Security\
  \ has rated this update as having Moderate security\nimpact. Common Vulnerability Scoring\
  \ System (CVSS) base scores, which give\ndetailed severity ratings, are available for each\
  \ vulnerability from the\nCVE links in the References section.\n\nThe kernel packages contain\
  \ the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\n* A flaw was found in the\
  \ way the Linux kernel's VFS subsystem handled file\nsystem locks. A local, unprivileged user\
  \ could use this flaw to trigger a\ndeadlock in the kernel, causing a denial of service on\
  \ the system.\n(CVE-2014-8559, Moderate)\n\n* A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way\
  \ the Linux kernel's virtio-net\nsubsystem handled certain fraglists when the GRO (Generic\
  \ Receive Offload)\nfunctionality was enabled in a bridged network configuration. An attacker\n\
  on the local network could potentially use this flaw to crash the system,\nor, although unlikely,\
  \ elevate their privileges on the system.\n(CVE-2015-5156, Moderate)\n\nThe CVE-2015-5156\
  \ issue was discovered by Jason Wang of Red Hat.\n\nThe kernel-rt packages have been upgraded\
  \ to version 3.10.0-229.20.1, which\nprovides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over\
  \ the previous version,\nincluding:\n\n* Unexpected completion is detected on Intel Ethernet\
  \ x540\n\n* Divide by zero error in intel_pstate_timer_func() [ inline s64\ndiv_s64_rem()\
  \ ]\n\n* NFS Recover from stateid-type error on SETATTR\n\n* pNFS RHEL 7.1 Data Server connection\
  \ remains after umount due to lseg\nrefcount leak\n\n* Race during NFS v4.0 recovery and standard\
  \ IO.\n\n* Fix ip6t_SYNPROXY for namespaces and connection delay\n\n* synproxy window size\
  \ and sequence number behaviour causes long connection\ndelay\n\n* Crash in kmem_cache_alloc()\
  \ during disk stress testing (using ipr)\n\n* xfs: sync/backport to upstream v4.1\n\n* iscsi_session\
  \ recovery_tmo revert back to default when a path becomes\nactive\n\n* read from MD raid1\
  \ can fail if read from resync target fails\n\n* backport scsi-mq\n\n* unable to handle kernel\
  \ paging request at 0000000000237037 [zswap]\n\n(BZ#1266915) \n\nAll kernel-rt users are advised\
  \ to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncorrect these issues and add this enhancement.\
  \ The system must be rebooted\nfor this update to take effect."
