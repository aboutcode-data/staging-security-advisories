  - CVE-2008-3834
summary: |
  Updated dbus packages that fix a security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  D-Bus is a system for sending messages between applications. It is used for
  the system-wide message bus service and as a per-user-login-session
  messaging facility.

  A denial-of-service flaw was discovered in the system for sending messages
  between applications. A local user could send a message with a malformed
  signature to the bus causing the bus (and, consequently, any process using
  libdbus to receive messages) to abort. (CVE-2008-3834)

  All users are advised to upgrade to these updated dbus packages, which
  contain backported patch which resolve this issue. For the update to take
  effect, all running instances of dbus-daemon and all running applications
  using libdbus library must be restarted, or the system rebooted.
