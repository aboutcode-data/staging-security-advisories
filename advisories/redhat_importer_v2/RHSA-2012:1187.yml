summary: |
  Updated katello packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Katello allows you to manage the application life-cycle for Linux systems.
  Katello is used by Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager, a distributor
  application for handling subscription information and software updates on
  client machines.

  It was found that the katello-common package's installation script did not
  correctly generate the secret token used for session cookie generation,
  leading to every default installation using the same secret token. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to create a cookie that would allow them to
  log into the Subscription Asset Manager web interface as any user, without
  knowing the passwords. (CVE-2012-3503)

  All users of Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager are advised to upgrade to
  these updated packages, which correct this issue. For instructions on
  applying this update, refer to the Subscription Asset Manager Installation
  Guide, linked to in the References section.
