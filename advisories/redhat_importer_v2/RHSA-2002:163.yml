summary: |
  Updated Apache packages are available which fix several serious buffer
  overflow vulnerabilities in OpenSSL and a local privilege escalation
  vulnerability in MM.

  Note:

  Please read the "Solution" section below as there are special upgrade
  instructions for this errata.

  -----------

  OpenSSL is a commercial-grade, full-featured, and Open Source toolkit which
  implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer
  Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength general purpose
  cryptography library. A security audit of the OpenSSL code sponsored by
  DARPA found several buffer overflows in OpenSSL which affect versions 0.9.7
  and 0.9.6d and earlier:

  1. The master key supplied by a client to an SSL version 2 server could be
  oversized, causing a stack-based buffer overflow. This issue is remotely
  exploitable. Services that have SSLv2 disabled would not be vulnerable to
  this issue. (CAN-2002-0656)

  2. The SSLv3 session ID supplied to a client from a malicious server could
  be oversized and overrun a buffer. This issue looks to be remotely
  exploitable. (CAN-2002-0656)

  3. Various buffers used for storing ASCII representations of integers were
  too small on 64 bit platforms. This issue may be exploitable. (CAN-2002-0655)

  A further issue was found in OpenSSL 0.9.7 that does not affect versions of
  OpenSSL included in Stronghold (CAN-2002-0657).

  The MM library provides an abstraction layer which allows related processes
  to easily share data. On systems where shared memory or other
  inter-process communication mechanisms are not available, the MM library
  will emulate them using temporary files. MM is used in Stronghold to
  providing shared memory pools to Apache modules.

  Versions of MM up to and including 1.1.3 open temporary files in an unsafe
  manner, allowing a malicious local user to cause an application which uses
  MM to overwrite any file to which it has write access. (CAN-2002-0658)

  All users are advised to upgrade to these errata packages which contain a
  patched version of MM that is not vulnerable to this issue.

  Thanks go to the OpenSSL team, Ben Laurie, and Marcus Meissner for
  providing patches for these issues.
