summary: |
  Updated httpd packages that fix several minor security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Linux 8.0 and 9.

  The Apache HTTP server is a powerful, full-featured, efficient, and
  freely-available Web server.

  Ben Laurie found a bug in the optional renegotiation code in mod_ssl
  included with Apache 2 versions 2.0.35 through 2.0.46 that can cause
  cipher suite restrictions to be ignored. This is triggered if optional
  renegotiation is used (SSLOptions +OptRenegotiate) along with verification
  of client certificates and a change to the cipher suite over the
  renegotiation.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0192 to this issue.

  Yoshioka Tsuneo found that unpatched versions of Apache 2 versions 2.0.35
  to 2.0.46 have a bug that can cause a remote Denial of Service. When a
  client requests that proxy ftp connect to a ftp server with an IPv6
  address, and the proxy is unable to create an IPv6 socket, an infinite loop
  occurs.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the
  name CAN-2003-0254 to this issue.

  Saheed Akhtar found that unpatched Apache 2 versions 2.0.35 through 2.0.46
  have a bug in the prefork MPM when handling accept errors. In a server with
  multiple listening sockets, a certain error returned by accept() on a
  rarely-accessed port can cause a temporary denial of service.  The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name CAN-2003-0253
  to this issue.

  It is possible for Apache 2 to get into an infinite loop handling internal
  redirects and nested subrequests. A patch for this issue adds the new
  LimitInternalRecursion directive.

  All users of the Apache HTTP Web Server are advised to upgrade to the
  applicable errata packages, which contain back-ported fixes correcting
  these issues, and are applied to Apache version 2.0.40.

  After the errata packages are installed, restart the Web service by running
  (as root) the following command:

  /sbin/service httpd restart
