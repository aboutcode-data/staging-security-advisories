summary: |
  The unzip and tar utilities contain vulnerabilities which can allow
  arbitrary files to be overwritten during archive extraction.

  [updated Jan 22 2003]
  Added description of CAN-2002-1216 which was also fixed by these erratum
  packages.

  The unzip and tar utilities are used for dealing with archives, which
  are multiple files stored inside of a single file.

  A directory traversal vulnerability in unzip version 5.42 and earlier,
  as well as GNU tar 1.13.19 and earlier, allows attackers to overwrite
  arbitrary files during archive extraction via a ".." (dot dot) in an
  extracted filename (CAN-2001-1267, CAN-2001-1268). In addition, unzip
  version 5.42 and earlier version also allow attackers to overwrite
  arbitrary files during archive extraction via filenames in the archive that
  begin with the "/" (slash) character (CAN-2001-1269).

  During testing of the fix to GNU tar, we discovered that GNU tar 1.13.25
  was still vulnerable to a modified version of the same problem. Red Hat has
  provided a patch to tar 1.3.25 to correct this problem (CAN-2002-0399).

  GNU tar 1.13.19 and other versions before 1.13.25 allow remote attackers
  to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack, as the result of a
  modification that effectively disabled the security check.  (CAN-2002-1216)

  Users of unzip and tar are advised to upgrade to these errata packages,
  containing unzip version 5.50 and a patched version of GNU tar 1.13.25,
  which are not vulnerable to these issues.
