summary: |
  An updated jbossweb package that fixes two security issues is now available
  for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.2 and 4.3 for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  JBoss Web is the web container, based on Apache Tomcat, in JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform. It provides a single deployment platform for the
  JavaServer Pages (JSP) and Java Servlet technologies, Microsoft .NET, PHP,
  and CGI.

  A flaw was found in the way JBoss Web handled the Transfer-Encoding header
  in HTTP requests. A specially-crafted HTTP request could prevent JBoss Web
  from sending replies, or cause JBoss Web to return truncated replies, or
  replies containing data related to the requests of other users, for all
  subsequent HTTP requests. (CVE-2010-2227)

  A possible minor information leak was found in the way JBoss Web generated
  HTTP BASIC and DIGEST authentication requests. For configurations where a
  realm name was not specified and JBoss Web was accessed via a proxy, the
  default generated realm contained the hostname and port used by the proxy
  to send requests to the JBoss Web server. (CVE-2010-1157)

  Users of JBoss Web should upgrade to this updated package, which upgrades
  JBoss Web to version 2.0.0.CP14, and resolves these issues. The JBoss
  server process must be restarted for this update to take effect.
