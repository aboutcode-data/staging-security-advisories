summary: |
  Updated freetype packages that fix various security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  FreeType is a free, high-quality, portable font engine that can open and
  manage font files. It also loads, hints, and renders individual glyphs
  efficiently. These packages provide both the FreeType 1 and FreeType 2
  font engines.

  Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team discovered several integer
  overflow flaws in the FreeType 2 font engine. If a user loaded a
  carefully-crafted font file with an application linked against FreeType 2,
  it could cause the application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary
  code with the privileges of the user running the application.
  (CVE-2009-0946)

  Chris Evans discovered multiple integer overflow flaws in the FreeType font
  engine. If a user loaded a carefully-crafted font file with an application
  linked against FreeType, it could cause the application to crash or,
  possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  the application. (CVE-2006-1861)

  An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the FreeType font engine
  processed TrueType® Font (TTF) files. If a user loaded a carefully-crafted
  font file with an application linked against FreeType, it could cause the
  application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2007-2754)

  Note: For the FreeType 2 font engine, the CVE-2006-1861 and CVE-2007-2754
  flaws were addressed via RHSA-2006:0500 and RHSA-2007:0403 respectively.
  This update provides corresponding updates for the FreeType 1 font engine,
  included in the freetype packages distributed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  2.1.

  Users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues. The X server must be restarted
  (log out, then log back in) for this update to take effect.
