  - CVE-2013-1935
summary: |
  An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes two security issues and
  various bugs is now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
  is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
  everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Agent.

  Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
  the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

  A flaw was found in the way KVM initialized a guest's registered pv_eoi
  (paravirtualized end-of-interrupt) indication flag when entering the guest.
  An unprivileged guest user could potentially use this flaw to crash the
  host. (CVE-2013-1935)

  A flaw was found in the way unexpected fields in guestInfo dictionaries
  were processed. A privileged guest user could potentially use this flaw to
  make the host the guest is running on unavailable to the management server.
  (CVE-2013-0167)

  Red Hat would like to thank IBM for reporting the CVE-2013-1935 issue. The
  CVE-2013-0167 issue was discovered by Dan Kenigsberg of the Red Hat
  Enterprise Virtualization team.

  This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
  various security issues. These issues have no security impact on Red Hat
  Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fixes
  included in this update address the following CVE numbers:

  CVE-2013-1962 (libvirt issue)

  CVE-2013-2017 and CVE-2013-1943 (kernel issues)

  CVE-2012-6137 (subscription-manager issue)

  This update also contains the fixes from the following errata:

  * vdsm: RHSA-2013:0886, which adds support for Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization 3.2 clusters.

  * ovirt-node: RHBA-2013:0908

  Upgrade Note: If you upgrade the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor through the 3.2 Manager administration portal, the Host may
  appear with the status of "Install Failed". If this happens, place the host
  into maintenance mode, then activate it again to get the host back to an
  "Up" state.

  Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
  upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.
