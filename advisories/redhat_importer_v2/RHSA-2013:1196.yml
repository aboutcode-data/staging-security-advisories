summary: |
  Updated Foreman packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat OpenStack 3.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The Foreman packages provide facilities for rapidly deploying Red Hat
  OpenStack 3.0. These packages are provided as a Technology Preview. For
  more information on the scope and nature of support for items marked as
  Technology Preview, refer to
  https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/

  A flaw was found in the API where insufficient privilege checks were
  conducted by the hosts controller, allowing any user with API access to
  control any host. (CVE-2013-4182)

  A denial of service flaw was found in Foreman in the way user input was
  converted to a symbol. An authenticated user could create inputs that would
  lead to excessive memory consumption. (CVE-2013-4180)

  Red Hat would like to thank Daniel Lobato of CERN IT-PES-PS for reporting
  CVE-2013-4182. The CVE-2013-4180 issue was discovered by Marek Hulán of the
  Red Hat Foreman team.

  Users of Foreman are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues. In Red Hat OpenStack, Foreman runs on the Apache HTTP
  Server using mod_passenger. As such, after installing the updated packages,
  the httpd service must be restarted ("service httpd restart") for this
  update to take effect.
