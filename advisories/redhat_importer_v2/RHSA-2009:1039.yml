aliases:
  - CVE-2009-0159
  - CVE-2009-1252
summary: |
  An updated ntp package that fixes two security issues is now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time
  with a referenced time source.

  A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the ntpd daemon's NTPv4
  authentication code. If ntpd was configured to use public key cryptography
  for NTP packet authentication, a remote attacker could use this flaw to
  send a specially-crafted request packet that could crash ntpd.
  (CVE-2009-1252)

  Note: NTP authentication is not enabled by default.

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the ntpq diagnostic command. A
  malicious, remote server could send a specially-crafted reply to an ntpq
  request that could crash ntpq. (CVE-2009-0159)

  All ntp users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing the
  update, the ntpd daemon will be restarted automatically.
