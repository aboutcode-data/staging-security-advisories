  - CVE-2009-0949
summary: "Updated cups packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red\nHat Enterprise\
  \ Linux 5.\n\nThis update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red\n\
  Hat Security Response Team.\n\nThe Common UNIX® Printing System (CUPS) provides a portable\
  \ printing layer\nfor UNIX operating systems. The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) allows\n\
  users to print and manage printing-related tasks over a network. \n\nA NULL pointer dereference\
  \ flaw was found in the CUPS IPP routine, used for\nprocessing incoming IPP requests for the\
  \ CUPS scheduler. An attacker could\nuse this flaw to send specially-crafted IPP requests\
  \ that would crash the\ncupsd daemon. (CVE-2009-0949)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Anibal\
  \ Sacco from Core Security Technologies\nfor reporting this issue.\n\nUsers of cups are advised\
  \ to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch to correct this\
  \ issue. After installing this\nupdate, the cupsd daemon will be restarted automatically."
