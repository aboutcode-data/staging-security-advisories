summary: |
  An update for dhcp is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Advanced Update Support, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Telco Extended Update Support, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Update Services for SAP Solutions.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol that allows individual devices on an IP network to get their own network configuration information, including an IP address, a subnet mask, and a broadcast address. The dhcp packages provide a relay agent and ISC DHCP service required to enable and administer DHCP on a network.

  Security Fix(es):

  * dhcp: stack-based buffer overflow when parsing statements with colon-separated hex digits in config or lease files in dhcpd and dhclient (CVE-2021-25217)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.
