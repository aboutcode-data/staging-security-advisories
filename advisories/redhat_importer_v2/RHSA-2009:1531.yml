summary: |
  Updated seamonkey packages that fix several security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  SeaMonkey is an open source Web browser, email and newsgroup client, IRC
  chat client, and HTML editor.

  A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey creates temporary file names for
  downloaded files. If a local attacker knows the name of a file SeaMonkey is
  going to download, they can replace the contents of that file with
  arbitrary contents. (CVE-2009-3274)

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the SeaMonkey string to
  floating point conversion routines. A web page containing malicious
  JavaScript could crash SeaMonkey or, potentially, execute arbitrary code
  with the privileges of the user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2009-1563)

  A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handles text selection. A malicious
  website may be able to read highlighted text in a different domain (e.g.
  another website the user is viewing), bypassing the same-origin policy.
  (CVE-2009-3375)

  A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey displays a right-to-left override
  character when downloading a file. In these cases, the name displayed in
  the title bar differs from the name displayed in the dialog body. An
  attacker could use this flaw to trick a user into downloading a file that
  has a file name or extension that differs from what the user expected.
  (CVE-2009-3376)

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  SeaMonkey. (CVE-2009-3380)

  All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
  these issues. After installing the update, SeaMonkey must be restarted for
  the changes to take effect.
