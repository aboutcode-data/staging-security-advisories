summary: |
  Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.2 is now available which fixes several bugs and introduces feature enhancements.

  OpenShift Enterprise is a cloud computing Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution from Red Hat, and is designed for on-premise or private cloud deployments.

  The OpenShift Enterprise 1.2 Release Notes provide information about changes in this release, and instructions on how to upgrade from previous OpenShift Enterprise releases. Visit https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/ to access all OpenShift Enterprise documentation.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Access to MongoDB was inconsistent, and concurrent changes to user applications by multiple logins caused some changes to be overwritten by other changes. This behavior put MongoDB in a state inconsistent with what was actually on the gears of a node. For example, scaling up one application with two separate logins concurrently would cause MongoDB to not recognize one of the gears. The current release of OpenShift Enterprise introduces distributed locking mechanisms along with a database schema and model refactor so that user actions are successfully queued for consistency. (BZ#878205)

  * When an application alias was added, the broker did not verify if that alias was in use by another application. Therefore, a duplicate alias was created if the gear was on a different node host than the one the existing application was on. If the gear was on the same node host, it resulted in the following error message: "node execution error." This fix includes a MongoDB model refactor and duplicate aliases are now rejected by the broker. Users must first remove an existing alias from an application before that alias can be used with a new application. (BZ#895864)

  * The "oo-admin-ctl-domain" command had a bug which blocked domain deletion. Once a user had a domain, it could not be removed with "oo-admin-ctl-domain", and the following message was displayed: "User still has domains. Delete them first." The "oo-admin-ctl-domain" command has been fixed in the current release of OpenShift Enterprise, and user domains are now successfully deleted. (BZ#913390)

  * The "oo-register-dns" command's help text listed the "-h" option twice, suggesting the "-h" was for both the host name and the help text. With this release, the help text has been updated: the "-h" option is only for host name and "-?" is for help. (BZ#917493)

  * The "Community" link on the Management Console linked to the old website at openshift.redhat.com. Users were not being linked to the new OpenShift community site which moved to www.openshift.com. With this release, the link has been updated: the Management Console's "Community" link now points to www.openshift.com. (BZ#924103)

  * When the openshift-console package was not installed, /etc/openshift/console.conf did not exist when the "oo-accept-broker" command looked for it. As a result, "oo-accept-broker" execution failed with the following error: "/usr/sbin/oo-accept-broker: line 168: [: too many arguments." Installing openshift-console worked around this issue even if the service was not configured or started. With this release, the "oo-accept-broker" command only checks the console's configuration if the /etc/openshift/console.conf file is present. The error no longer occurs when the console (now openshift-origin-console) is not installed. (BZ#958437)

  * The Apache configuration in previous versions of OpenShift Enterprise left the default value of "localhost" for the "ServerName" setting, causing SSL certificates created on the node and broker hosts to be invalid. As a result, access by Java 7 clients (for example, JBoss Developer Tools) to the broker and user applications would fail. This fix includes updated steps in the OpenShift Enterprise Deployment Guide and example install scripts, which indicate setting Apache's "ServerName" and creating valid certificates. (BZ#970805)

  Users are advised to upgrade to Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.2.
