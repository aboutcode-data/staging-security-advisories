  - CVE-2009-3546
summary: |
  Updated gd packages that fix a security issue are now available for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The gd packages provide a graphics library used for the dynamic creation of
  images, such as PNG and JPEG.

  A missing input sanitization flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was
  discovered in the gd library. A specially-crafted GD image file could cause
  an application using the gd library to crash or, possibly, execute
  arbitrary code when opened. (CVE-2009-3546)

  Users of gd should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to resolve this issue.
