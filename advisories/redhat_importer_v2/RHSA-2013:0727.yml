summary: |
  Updated kvm packages that fix three security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
  Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. KVM is a Linux kernel module built for
  the standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel.

  A flaw was found in the way KVM handled guest time updates when the buffer
  the guest registered by writing to the MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME machine state
  register (MSR) crossed a page boundary. A privileged guest user could use
  this flaw to crash the host or, potentially, escalate their privileges,
  allowing them to execute arbitrary code at the host kernel level.
  (CVE-2013-1796)

  A potential use-after-free flaw was found in the way KVM handled guest time
  updates when the GPA (guest physical address) the guest registered by
  writing to the MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME machine state register (MSR) fell into a
  movable or removable memory region of the hosting user-space process (by
  default, QEMU-KVM) on the host. If that memory region is deregistered from
  KVM using KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION and the allocated virtual memory
  reused, a privileged guest user could potentially use this flaw to
  escalate their privileges on the host. (CVE-2013-1797)

  A flaw was found in the way KVM emulated IOAPIC (I/O Advanced Programmable
  Interrupt Controller). A missing validation check in the
  ioapic_read_indirect() function could allow a privileged guest user to
  crash the host, or read a substantial portion of host kernel memory.
  (CVE-2013-1798)

  Red Hat would like to thank Andrew Honig of Google for reporting all of
  these issues.

  All users of kvm are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. Note that the procedure
  in the Solution section must be performed before this update will take
  effect.
