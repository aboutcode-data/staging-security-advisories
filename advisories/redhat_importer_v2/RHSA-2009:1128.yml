  - CVE-2009-1698
summary: |
  Updated kdelibs packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The kdelibs packages provide libraries for the K Desktop Environment (KDE).

  A flaw was found in the way the KDE CSS parser handled content for the
  CSS "style" attribute. A remote attacker could create a specially-crafted
  CSS equipped HTML page, which once visited by an unsuspecting user, could
  cause a denial of service (Konqueror crash) or, potentially, execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Konqueror.
  (CVE-2009-1698)

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a backported
  patch to correct this issue. The desktop must be restarted (log out, then
  log back in) for this update to take effect.
