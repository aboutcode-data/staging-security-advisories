summary: |
  CloudForms System Engine 1.1.2 is now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat CloudForms is an on-premise hybrid cloud
  Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) product that lets you create and manage
  private and public clouds. It provides self-service computing resources to
  users in a managed, governed, and secure way. CloudForms System Engine can
  be used to configure new systems, subscribe to updates, and maintain
  installations in distributed environments.

  It was found that the
  "/usr/share/katello/script/katello-generate-passphrase" utility, which is
  run during the installation and configuration process, set world-readable
  permissions on the "/etc/katello/secure/passphrase" file. A local attacker
  could use this flaw to obtain the passphrase for Katello, giving them
  access to information they would otherwise not have access to.
  (CVE-2012-5561)

  Note: After installing this update, ensure the
  "/etc/katello/secure/passphrase" file is owned by the root user and group
  and mode 0750 permissions. Sites should also consider re-creating the
  Katello passphrase as this issue exposed it to local users.

  One task the katello-configure utility performs is creating an RPM to be
  installed on client machines that need to connect to the Katello server. It
  was found that this RPM set world-readable and writable permissions on the
  pem file (containing the Certificate Authority certificate) used for
  trusting the Katello server. An attacker could use this flaw to perform a
  man-in-the-middle attack, allowing them to manage (such as installing and
  removing software) Katello client systems. (CVE-2012-6116)

  The CVE-2012-5561 issue was discovered by Aaron Weitekamp of the Red Hat
  Cloud Quality Engineering team, and CVE-2012-6116 was discovered by Dominic
  Cleal and James Laska of Red Hat.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * The CloudForms System Engine command line tool incorrectly parsed
  locales, which caused the following error:

  "translation missing: de.activerecord.errors.messages.record_invalid"

  This update replaces the controller for setting the locale. The translation
  error no longer appears. (BZ#896251)

  * Certain locales did not properly escape certain UI content for new role
  creation. This broke the Save button for some locales. This update corrects
  the escape behavior for localized UI content. The Save button now works
  for new role creation. (BZ#896252)

  * A missing icon stopped users from deleting recent or saved searches. This
  update adds the icon and users can now delete recent or saved searches.
  (BZ#896253)

  * A performance issue in the Candlepin 0.7.8 component caused subscription
  responsiveness to decrease as the number of systems subscribed to
  CloudForms System Engine increases. This erratum updates to Candlepin
  0.7.19, which corrects the performance issues. (BZ#896261)

  * CloudForms System Engine would not fetch Extended Update Service (EUS)
  entitlements. This blocked the user from seeing and enabling EUS
  repositories. This update revises the manifest upload and deletion code,
  which also corrects the behavior for fetching entitlements. System Engine
  now fetches EUS entitlements. (BZ#896265)

  * Issues with menu widths caused the localized UI to not render certain
  menu items. This update corrects the style for the System Engine UI. The
  Web UI now renders the menu items correctly. (BZ#903702)

  Refer to the CloudForms 1.1.2 Release Notes for further information about
  this release. The Release Notes will be available shortly from
