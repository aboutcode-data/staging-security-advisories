summary: |
  Updated Grid component packages that fix multiple security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a next-generation
  IT infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG offers increased
  performance, reliability, interoperability, and faster computing for
  enterprise customers.

  MRG Grid provides high-throughput computing and enables enterprises to
  achieve higher peak computing capacity as well as improved infrastructure
  utilization by leveraging their existing technology to build high
  performance grids. MRG Grid provides a job-queueing mechanism, scheduling
  policy, and a priority scheme, as well as resource monitoring and resource
  management. Users submit their jobs to MRG Grid, where they are placed into
  a queue. MRG Grid then chooses when and where to run the jobs based upon a
  policy, carefully monitors their progress, and ultimately informs the user
  upon completion.

  It was found that, when using RubyGems, the connection could be redirected
  from HTTPS to HTTP. This could lead to a user believing they are installing
  a gem via HTTPS, when the connection may have been silently downgraded to
  HTTP. (CVE-2012-2125)

  It was found that RubyGems did not verify SSL connections. This could lead
  to man-in-the-middle attacks. (CVE-2012-2126)

  It was discovered that the rubygems API validated version strings using an
  unsafe regular expression. An application making use of this API to process
  a version string from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a denial
  of service attack through CPU exhaustion. (CVE-2013-4287)

  A flaw was found in the way cumin enforced user roles, allowing an
  unprivileged cumin user to access a range of resources without having the
  appropriate role. A remote, authenticated attacker could use this flaw to
  access privileged information, and perform a variety of privileged
  operations. (CVE-2013-4404)

  It was found that multiple forms in the cumin web interface did not protect
  against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. If a remote attacker
  could trick a user, who is logged into the cumin web interface, into
  visiting a specially crafted URL, the attacker could perform actions in the
  context of the logged in user. (CVE-2013-4405)

  It was found that cumin did not properly escape input from the "Max
  allowance" field in the "Set limit" form of the cumin web interface.
  A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform cross-site scripting (XSS)
  attacks against victims by tricking them into visiting a specially crafted
  URL. (CVE-2013-4414)

  A flaw was found in the way cumin parsed POST request data. A remote
  attacker could potentially use this flaw to perform SQL injection attacks
  on cumin's database. (CVE-2013-4461)

  Red Hat would like to thank Rubygems upstream for reporting CVE-2013-4287.
  Upstream acknowledges Damir Sharipov as the original reporter of
  CVE-2013-4287. The CVE-2013-4404, CVE-2013-4405, CVE-2013-4414, and
  CVE-2013-4461 issues were discovered by Tomáš Nováčik of the Red Hat MRG
  Quality Engineering team.

  All users of the Grid capabilities of Red Hat Enterprise MRG are advised to
  upgrade to these updated packages, which correct these issues.
