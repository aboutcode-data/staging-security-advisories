summary: |
  Updated openssl packages that fix multiple security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
  and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
  full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

  It was found that OpenSSL clients and servers could be forced, via a
  specially crafted handshake packet, to use weak keying material for
  communication. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to decrypt
  and modify traffic between a client and a server. (CVE-2014-0224)

  Note: In order to exploit this flaw, both the server and the client must be
  using a vulnerable version of OpenSSL; the server must be using OpenSSL
  version 1.0.1 and above, and the client must be using any version of
  OpenSSL. For more information about this flaw, refer to:
  https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/904433

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled invalid DTLS
  packet fragments. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to execute
  arbitrary code on a DTLS client or server. (CVE-2014-0195)

  Multiple flaws were found in the way OpenSSL handled read and write buffers
  when the SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS mode was enabled. A TLS/SSL client or
  server using OpenSSL could crash or unexpectedly drop connections when
  processing certain SSL traffic. (CVE-2010-5298, CVE-2014-0198)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled certain DTLS
  ServerHello requests. A specially crafted DTLS handshake packet could cause
  a DTLS client using OpenSSL to crash. (CVE-2014-0221)

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way OpenSSL performed
  anonymous Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) key exchange. A specially
  crafted handshake packet could cause a TLS/SSL client that has the
  anonymous ECDH cipher suite enabled to crash. (CVE-2014-3470)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting these issues.
  Upstream acknowledges KIKUCHI Masashi of Lepidum as the original reporter
  of CVE-2014-0224, Jüri Aedla as the original reporter of CVE-2014-0195,
  Imre Rad of Search-Lab as the original reporter of CVE-2014-0221, and Felix
  Gröbert and Ivan Fratrić of Google as the original reporters of
  CVE-2014-3470.

  All OpenSSL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. For the update to take
  effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library (such as httpd and other
  SSL-enabled services) must be restarted or the system rebooted.
