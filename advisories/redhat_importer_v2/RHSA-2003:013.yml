summary: "Updated CVS packages are now available for Red Hat Linux Advanced Server. \nThese\
  \ updates fix a vulnerability which would permit arbitrary command\nexecution on servers configured\
  \ to allow anonymous read-only access.\n\n[Updated 06 Feb 2003]\nAdded fixed packages for\
  \ Advanced Workstation 2.1\n\nCVS is a version control system frequently used to manage source\
  \ code\nrepositories.  During an audit of the CVS sources, Stefan Esser discovered\nan exploitable\
  \ double-free bug in the CVS server.\n\nOn servers which are configured to allow anonymous\
  \ read-only access, this\nbug could be used by anonymous users to gain write privileges. \
  \ Users with\nCVS write privileges can then use the Update-prog and Checkin-prog features\n\
  to execute arbitrary commands on the server.\n\nAll users of CVS are advised to upgrade to\
  \ these packages which\ncontain patches to correct the double-free bug.\n\nOur thanks go to\
  \ Stefan Esser of e-matters for reporting this issue to us."
