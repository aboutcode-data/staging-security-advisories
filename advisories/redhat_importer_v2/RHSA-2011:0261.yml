  - CVE-2008-5374
summary: |
  Updated bash packages that fix one security issue and several bugs are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Bash (Bourne-again shell) is the default shell for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux.

  It was found that certain scripts bundled with the Bash documentation
  created temporary files in an insecure way. A malicious, local user could
  use this flaw to conduct a symbolic link attack, allowing them to overwrite
  the contents of arbitrary files accessible to the victim running the
  scripts. (CVE-2008-5374)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * If a child process's PID was the same as the PID of a previously ended
  child process, Bash did not wait for that child process. In some cases this
  caused "Resource temporarily unavailable" errors. With this update, Bash
  recycles PIDs and waits for processes with recycled PIDs. (BZ#521134)

  * Bash's built-in "read" command had a memory leak when "read" failed due
  to no input (pipe for stdin). With this update, the memory is correctly
  freed. (BZ#537029)

  * Bash did not correctly check for a valid multi-byte string when setting
  the IFS value, causing Bash to crash. With this update, Bash checks the
  multi-byte string and no longer crashes. (BZ#539536)

  * Bash incorrectly set locale settings when using the built-in "export"
  command and setting the locale on the same line (for example, with
  "LC_ALL=C export LC_ALL"). With this update, Bash correctly sets locale
  settings. (BZ#539538)

  All bash users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues.
