summary: |
  Updated openstack-nova packages that fix multiple security issues and
  several bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack
  Platform 4.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  OpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual
  machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform.
  Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to
  orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances, managing
  networks, and controlling access through users and projects.

  It was discovered that the metadata agent in OpenStack Networking was
  missing an authorization check on the device ID that is bound to a specific
  port. A remote tenant could guess the instance ID bound to a port and
  retrieve metadata of another tenant, resulting in information disclosure.
  Note that only OpenStack Networking setups running neutron-metadata-agent
  were affected. (CVE-2013-6419)

  It was found that nova used directories that were writable to by all local
  users to temporarily store live snapshots. A local attacker with access to
  such a directory could use this flaw to read and modify the contents of
  live snapshots. (CVE-2013-7048)

  A flaw was found in the way the libvirt driver handled short-lived disk
  back-up files on Compute nodes. An authenticated attacker could use this
  flaw to create a large number of such files, exhausting all available space
  on Compute node disks, and potentially causing a denial of service.
  Note that only Compute setups using the libvirt driver were affected.
  (CVE-2013-6437)

  It was discovered that the libvirt driver did not properly handle live
  migration of virtual machines. An authenticated attacker could use this
  flaw to gain access to a snapshot of a migrated virtual machine. Note that
  only setups using KVM live block migration were affected. (CVE-2013-7130)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack Project for reporting
  CVE-2013-6419, CVE-2013-6437, and CVE-2013-7130. Upstream acknowledges
  Aaron Rosen of VMware as the original reporter of CVE-2013-6419, Phil Day
  from HP as the original reporter of CVE-2013-6437, and Loganathan Parthipan
  as the original reporter of CVE-2013-7130.

  These updated openstack-nova packages have been upgraded to upstream
  version 2013.2.2, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous
  version. (BZ#1065317)

  Bug fixes:

  * The GlusterFS volume connector in nova did not pass a port to libvirt for
  the GlusterFS disk specification. Attaching a volume failed with a libvirt
  error indicating the port field was missing. This update fixes this bug by
  providing the default Gluster port in nova. (BZ#1020979)

  * The database back end did not handle the 2013 MySQL error code (Lost
  connection). The 2013 MySQL error code has been added to the collection of
  known database error codes. (BZ#1060771)

  * OpenStack Compute set the smbios product/vendor information to OpenStack
  values, which Red Hat Satellite 5 did not recognize when processing
  entitlements. (BZ#1059414)

  * Prior to this update, nova-api did not pass the absolute path of the
  configuration file to the api-paste library if a file with the same name
  was found in the current directory. (BZ#1039554)

  * The definition of the libvirt_info method in the RBD back-end class was
  missing a positional argument that the base class defined. (BZ#1063445)

  * Rebooting a host caused all of its instances to stop and change to the
  SHUTDOWN power state. The unpause action was only allowed on instances with
  the PAUSED power state. (BZ#1047863)

  * The previous default of writing zeros over deleted volumes took a
  significant amount of time. It is now possible to set a global
  configuration setting to clear only a part of a volume, or to disable
  clearing completely. Additionally, a new 'shred' capability is available to
  overwrite volumes with random data instead of zeros. (BZ#1062377)

  * In OpenStack Compute, low-level QPID debug log messages are no longer
  shown by default. These previously appeared due to the 'level=debug'
  parameter set in the nova.conf file. (BZ#1047849)

  All openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which correct these issues.
