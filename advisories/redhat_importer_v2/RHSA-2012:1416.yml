  - CVE-2012-4513
summary: |
  Updated kdelibs packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The kdelibs packages provide libraries for the K Desktop Environment
  (KDE). Konqueror is a web browser.

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the CSS (Cascading
  Style Sheets) parser in kdelibs parsed the location of the source for font
  faces. A web page containing malicious content could cause an application
  using kdelibs (such as Konqueror) to crash or, potentially, execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.
  (CVE-2012-4512)

  A heap-based buffer over-read flaw was found in the way kdelibs calculated
  canvas dimensions for large images. A web page containing malicious content
  could cause an application using kdelibs to crash or disclose portions of
  its memory. (CVE-2012-4513)

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
  patches to correct these issues. The desktop must be restarted (log out,
  then log back in) for this update to take effect.
