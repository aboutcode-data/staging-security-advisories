summary: |
  This is the 5-Month notification for the conclusion of Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 5.6 Extended Update Support (EUS) Add-on offering.

  In accordance with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Errata Support Policy, the
  Extended Update Support Add-On for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 will
  conclude on July 31, 2013. Accordingly, Red Hat will no longer provide
  updated packages, including critical impact security patches or urgent
  priority bug fixes, for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 EUS after that date.
  In addition, after July 31, 2013, technical support through Red Hat’s
  Global Support Services will no longer be provided for this Add-on.

  Note: This notification applies only to those customers subscribed to the
  Extended Update Support (EUS) channel for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6.

  We encourage customers to plan their migration from Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 5.6 to a more recent version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 or 6. As
  a benefit of the Red Hat subscription model, customers can use their active
  subscriptions to entitle any system on a currently supported Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 5 release (5.9, for which EUS is available) or Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 6 release (6.2, 6.3, or 6.4, for which EUS is available).
