  - CVE-2015-3238
summary: |
  An updated pam package that fixes one security issue is now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) provide a system whereby
  administrators can set up authentication policies without having to
  recompile programs to handle authentication.

  It was discovered that the _unix_run_helper_binary() function of PAM's
  unix_pam module could write to a blocking pipe, possibly causing the
  function to become unresponsive. An attacker able to supply large passwords
  to the unix_pam module could use this flaw to enumerate valid user
  accounts, or cause a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2015-3238)

  Red Hat would like to thank Sebastien Macke of Trustwave SpiderLabs for
  reporting this issue.

  All pam users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a backported patch to correct this issue.
