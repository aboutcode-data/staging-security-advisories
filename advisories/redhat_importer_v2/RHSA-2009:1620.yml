  - CVE-2009-4022
summary: |
  Updated bind packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the Domain
  Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named); a resolver
  library (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and
  tools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.

  Michael Sinatra discovered that BIND was incorrectly caching responses
  without performing proper DNSSEC validation, when those responses were
  received during the resolution of a recursive client query that requested
  DNSSEC records but indicated that checking should be disabled. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to bypass the DNSSEC validation check and
  perform a cache poisoning attack if the target BIND server was receiving
  such client queries. (CVE-2009-4022)

  All BIND users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to resolve this issue. After installing the
  update, the BIND daemon (named) will be restarted automatically.
