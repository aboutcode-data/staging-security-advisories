summary: |
  An update for glibc is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Advanced Mission Critical Update Support, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Telecommunications Update Service, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Update Services for SAP Solutions.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The glibc packages provide the standard C libraries (libc), POSIX thread libraries (libpthread), standard math libraries (libm), and the name service cache daemon (nscd) used by multiple programs on the system. Without these libraries, the Linux system cannot function correctly.

  Security Fix(es):

  * glibc: Out of bounds write in iconv may lead to remote code execution (CVE-2024-2961)

  * glibc: stack-based buffer overflow in netgroup cache (CVE-2024-33599)

  * glibc: null pointer dereferences after failed netgroup cache insertion (CVE-2024-33600)

  * glibc: netgroup cache may terminate daemon on memory allocation failure (CVE-2024-33601)

  * glibc: netgroup cache assumes NSS callback uses in-buffer strings (CVE-2024-33602)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.
