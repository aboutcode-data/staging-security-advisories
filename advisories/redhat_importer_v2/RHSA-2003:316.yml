  - CVE-2003-0856
summary: "Updated iproute packages that close a locally-exploitable denial of service\nvulnerability\
  \ are now available.\n\nThe iproute package contains advanced IP routing and network device\n\
  configuration tools.\n\nHerbert Xu reported that iproute can accept spoofed messages sent\
  \ on the\nkernel netlink interface by other users on the local machine.  This could\nlead\
  \ to a local denial of service attack.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project\
  \ (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0856 to\nthis issue. \n \nUsers of iproute\
  \ should upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain a\npatch that checks that netlink\
  \ messages actually came from the kernel."
