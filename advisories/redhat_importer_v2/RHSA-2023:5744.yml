  - CVE-2023-22081
summary: |
  An update for java-11-openjdk is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The java-11-openjdk packages provide the OpenJDK 11 Java Runtime Environment and the OpenJDK 11 Java Software Development Kit.

  Security Fix(es):

  * OpenJDK: certificate path validation issue during client authentication (8309966) (CVE-2023-22081)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

  Bug Fix(es):

  * Additional validity checks in the handling of Zip64 files, JDK-8302483, were introduced in the 11.0.20 release of OpenJDK, causing the use of some valid zip files to now fail with an error. This release, 11.0.20.1, allows for zero-length headers and additional padding produced by some Zip64 creation tools. With both releases, the checks can be disabled using -Djdk.util.zip.disableZip64ExtraFieldValidation=true. (RHBZ#2237175)

  * A maximum signature file size property, jdk.jar.maxSignatureFileSize, was introduced in the 11.0.20 release of OpenJDK by JDK-8300596, with a default of 8 MB. This default proved to be too small for some JAR files. This release, 11.0.20.1, increases it to 16 MB.

  * The serviceability agent would print an exception when encountering null addresses while producing thread dumps. These null values are now handled appropriately. (JDK-8243210)

  * The /usr/bin/jfr alternative is now owned by the java-11-openjdk package (RHEL-13532)

  * The jcmd tool is now provided by the java-11-openjdk-headless package, rather than java-11-openjdk-devel, to make it more accessible (RHEL-13536)
