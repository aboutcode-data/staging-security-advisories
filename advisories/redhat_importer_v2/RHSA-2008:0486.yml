  - CVE-2008-1376
summary: |
  An updated nfs-utils package that fixes a security issue is now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The nfs-utils package provides a daemon for the kernel NFS server and
  related tools.

  A flaw was found in the nfs-utils package build. The nfs-utils package was
  missing TCP wrappers support, which could result in an administrator
  believing they had access restrictions enabled when they did not.
  (CVE-2008-1376)

  Users of nfs-utils are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to resolve this issue.
