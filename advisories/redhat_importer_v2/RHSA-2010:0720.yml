summary: |
  Updated mikmod packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  MikMod is a MOD music file player for Linux, UNIX, and similar operating
  systems. It supports various file formats including MOD, STM, S3M, MTM, XM,
  ULT, and IT.

  Multiple input validation flaws, resulting in buffer overflows, were
  discovered in MikMod. Specially-crafted music files in various formats
  could, when played, cause an application using the MikMod library to crash
  or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2009-3995, CVE-2009-3996,
  CVE-2007-6720)

  All MikMod users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues. All running applications using
  the MikMod library must be restarted for this update to take effect.
