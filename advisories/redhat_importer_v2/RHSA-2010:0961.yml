  - CVE-2010-3862
summary: |
  Updated JBoss Enterprise Web Platform packages that fix one security issue
  and various bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The Enterprise Web Platform is for mid-size workloads, focusing on light
  and rich Java applications. Web Platform is a slimmed down profile of the
  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform.

  A flaw was found in the JBoss Remoting component. A remote attacker could
  use specially-crafted input to cause the JBoss Remoting listeners to become
  unresponsive, resulting in a denial of service condition for services
  communicating via JBoss Remoting sockets. (CVE-2010-3862)

  Red Hat would like to thank Ole Husgaard of eXerp.com for reporting this
  issue.

  These updated packages include multiple bug fixes. Documentation for these
  bug fixes will be available shortly from the Release Notes, linked to in
  the References section.

  As well, this update adds a new jbossws-cxf package to JBoss Enterprise
  Web Platform 5.1, to provide the sources for jbossws-cxf. (BZ#645465)

  Warning: Before applying this update, please backup the JBoss Enterprise
  Web Platform "jboss-as-web/server/$PROFILE/deploy/" directory, along with
  all other customized configuration files.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Platform on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4
  and 5 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages. The JBoss server
  process must be restarted for the update to take effect.
