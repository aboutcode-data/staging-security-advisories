  - CVE-2013-1840
summary: |
  Updated openstack-glance packages that fix one security issue and various
  bugs are now available for Red Hat OpenStack Folsom.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  These packages provide a service (code name Glance) that acts as a registry
  for virtual machine images.

  An information leak flaw was found in the way Glance handled certain image
  requests. If caching were enabled, an authenticated user could use this
  flaw to obtain Glance's OpenStack Swift or Amazon Simple Storage Service
  (Amazon S3) credentials. (CVE-2013-1840)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Stuart McLaren (HP) as the original reporter.

  This update also fixes various bugs in the openstack-glance packages.

  All users of openstack-glance are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the running Glance services must be manually restarted (using
  "service [service name] restart") for this update to take effect.
