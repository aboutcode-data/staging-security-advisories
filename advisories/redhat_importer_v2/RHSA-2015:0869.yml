summary: |
  Updated kvm packages that fix two security issues are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
  Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. KVM is a Linux kernel module built for
  the standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel.

  It was found that KVM's Write to Model Specific Register (WRMSR)
  instruction emulation would write non-canonical values passed in by the
  guest to certain MSRs in the host's context. A privileged guest user could
  use this flaw to crash the host. (CVE-2014-3610)

  A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's KVM subsystem
  handled PIT (Programmable Interval Timer) emulation. A guest user who has
  access to the PIT I/O ports could use this flaw to crash the host.
  (CVE-2014-3611)

  Red Hat would like to thank Lars Bull of Google and Nadav Amit for
  reporting the CVE-2014-3610 issue, and Lars Bull of Google for reporting
  the CVE-2014-3611 issue.

  All kvm users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. Note: The procedure in
  the Solution section must be performed before this update will take effect.
