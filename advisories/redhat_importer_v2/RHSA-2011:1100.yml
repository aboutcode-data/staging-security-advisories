summary: |
  Updated icedtea-web packages that fix two security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The IcedTea-Web project provides a Java web browser plug-in and an
  implementation of Java Web Start, which is based on the Netx project. It
  also contains a configuration tool for managing deployment settings for the
  plug-in and Web Start implementations.

  A flaw was discovered in the JNLP (Java Network Launching Protocol)
  implementation in IcedTea-Web. An unsigned Java Web Start application
  could use this flaw to manipulate the content of a Security Warning
  dialog box, to trick a user into granting the application unintended access
  permissions to local files. (CVE-2011-2514)

  An information disclosure flaw was discovered in the JNLP implementation in
  IcedTea-Web. An unsigned Java Web Start application or Java applet could
  use this flaw to determine the path to the cache directory used to store
  downloaded Java class and archive files, and therefore determine the user's
  login name. (CVE-2011-2513)

  All icedtea-web users should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
