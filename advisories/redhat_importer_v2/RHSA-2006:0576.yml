  - CVE-2006-2933
summary: "Updated kdebase packages that resolve a security issue are now available.\n\nThis\
  \ update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red Hat\nSecurity Response\
  \ Team.\n\nThe kdebase packages provide the core applications for KDE, the K Desktop\nEnvironment.\n\
  \nA flaw was found in KDE where the kdesktop_lock process sometimes\nfailed to terminate properly.\
  \  This issue could either block the user's\nability to manually lock the desktop or prevent\
  \ the screensaver to\nactivate, both of which could have a security impact for users who rely\
  \ on\nthese functionalities. \n(CVE-2006-2933)\n\nPlease note that this issue only affected\
  \ Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.\n\nAll users of kdebase should upgrade to these updated packages,\
  \ which\ncontain a patch to resolve this issue."
