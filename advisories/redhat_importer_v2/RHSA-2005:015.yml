  - CVE-2003-0297
summary: |
  An updated Pine package is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1
  to fix a denial of service attack.

  Pine is an email user agent.

  The c-client IMAP client library, as used in Pine 4.44 contains an integer
  overflow and integer signedness flaw.  An attacker could create a malicious
  IMAP server in such a way that it would cause Pine to crash.  The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
   CAN-2003-0297 to this issue.

  Users of Pine are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
