summary: |
  JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.2.0, which fixes two security issues,
  various bugs, and adds enhancements is now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform is the next-generation ESB and business
  process automation infrastructure. JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform allows IT
  to leverage existing (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and future
  (EDA and CEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve business
  process execution speed and quality.

  This release of JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.2.0 serves as a replacement
  for JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.1.0. It includes various bug fixes and
  enhancements which are detailed in the JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.2.0
  Release Notes. The Release Notes will be available shortly from
  https://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/index.html

  The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

  A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in JRuby (a Java implementation
  of Ruby), which is included in the scripting_chain sample application. The
  sample application does not expose this flaw. If the version of JRuby
  shipped with the scripting_chain sample application was used to build a
  custom application, a remote attacker could use this flaw to supply
  specially-crafted input to that application, leading to the execution of
  arbitrary HTML or web script. (CVE-2010-1330)

  Note: JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform only provides JRuby as a dependency of
  the scripting_chain quickstart. The CVE-2010-1330 flaw is not exposed
  unless the version of JRuby shipped with that quickstart is used by a
  deployed, custom application.

  It was found that the invoker servlets, deployed by default via
  httpha-invoker, only performed access control on the HTTP GET and POST
  methods, allowing remote attackers to make unauthenticated requests by
  using different HTTP methods. Due to the second layer of authentication
  provided by a security interceptor, this issue is not exploitable on
  default installations unless an administrator has misconfigured the
  security interceptor or disabled it. (CVE-2011-4085)

  Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss Enterprise
  SOA Platform installation (including its databases, applications,
  configuration files, and so on).

  All users of JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.1.0 as provided from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform
  5.2.0.
