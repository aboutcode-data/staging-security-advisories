summary: |
  An update for the Apache Tomcat 6 and Apache Tomcat 7 component for Red Hat
  JBoss Web Server 2.1.0 that fixes two security issues is now available from
  the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set of
  components for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the Apache
  HTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat Connector
  (mod_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod_cluster), Hibernate, and the Tomcat
  Native library.

  It was found that the expression language resolver evaluated expressions
  within a privileged code section. A malicious web application could use
  this flaw to bypass security manager protections. (CVE-2014-7810)

  It was found that Tomcat would keep connections open after processing
  requests with a large enough request body. A remote attacker could
  potentially use this flaw to exhaust the pool of available connections and
  preventing further, legitimate connections to the Tomcat server to be made.
  (CVE-2014-0230)

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.0 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to apply this update. The Red Hat JBoss Web
  Server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.
