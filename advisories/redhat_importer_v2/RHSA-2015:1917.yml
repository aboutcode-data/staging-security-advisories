summary: |
  Updated libwmf packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  libwmf is a library for reading and converting Windows Metafile Format
  (WMF) vector graphics. libwmf is used by applications such as GIMP and
  ImageMagick.

  It was discovered that libwmf did not correctly process certain WMF
  (Windows Metafiles) with embedded BMP images. By tricking a victim into
  opening a specially crafted WMF file in an application using libwmf, a
  remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with
  the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2015-0848,
  CVE-2015-4588)

  It was discovered that libwmf did not properly process certain WMF files.
  By tricking a victim into opening a specially crafted WMF file in an
  application using libwmf, a remote attacker could possibly exploit this
  flaw to cause a crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  user running the application. (CVE-2015-4696)

  It was discovered that libwmf did not properly process certain WMF files.
  By tricking a victim into opening a specially crafted WMF file in an
  application using libwmf, a remote attacker could possibly exploit this
  flaw to cause a crash. (CVE-2015-4695)

  All users of libwmf are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
  update, all applications using libwmf must be restarted for the update to
  take effect.
