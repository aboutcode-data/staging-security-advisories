  - CVE-2014-3595
summary: |
  Updated spacewalk-java packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Satellite 5.4, 5.5, and 5.6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Red Hat Satellite is a systems management tool for Linux-based
  infrastructures. It allows for provisioning, monitoring, and remote
  management of multiple Linux deployments with a single, centralized tool.
  The spacewalk-java packages contain the code for the Java version of the
  Spacewalk Web site.

  A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way
  spacewalk-java displayed log files. By sending a specially crafted request
  to Satellite, a remote attacker could embed HTML content into the log file,
  allowing them to inject malicious content into the web page that is used to
  view that log file. (CVE-2014-3595)

  Red Hat would like to thank Ron Bowes of Google for reporting this issue.

  All spacewalk-java users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
