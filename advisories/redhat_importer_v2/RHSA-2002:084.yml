summary: "Updated nss_ldap packages are now available for Red Hat Linux 6.2, 7,\n7.1, 7.2, and\
  \ 7.3. These packages fix a string format vulnerability in the\npam_ldap module.\n\n[Update\
  \ Jun 4, 2002]\nReplacement packages have been added for Red Hat Linux 6.2. The previous\n\
  packages could not be installed with the version of RPM that shipped with\nRed Hat Linux 6.2.\n\
  \nThe pam_ldap module provides authentication for user access to a system by\nconsulting a\
  \ directory using LDAP. Versions of pam_ldap prior to version\n144 include a format string\
  \ bug in the logging function. The packages\nincluded in this erratum update pam_ldap to version\
  \ 144, fixing this bug.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0374 to this issue.\n\nDue to differences in the default\
  \ behavior of the pam_ldap module when\nperforming account management, the version of authconfig\
  \ included in Red\nRat Linux 7.2 generates incorrect /etc/pam.d/system-auth files for \nthe\
  \ version of pam_ldap included in this erratum.  Thus, an updated \nversion of authconfig\
  \ for Red Hat Linux 7.2 is included in this erratum \n(versions of authconfig included with\
  \ Red Hat Linux 7, 7.1, and 7.3 are not\naffected).\n\nOur thanks go to the pam_ldap team\
  \ at padl.com for bringing this to our\nattention.\n\nA previous revision of this erratum\
  \ included packages which could not be\ninstalled with the version of RPM included with Red\
  \ Hat Linux 6.2.  While\nthey can be installed with versions of RPM which have been released\
  \ as\nerrata for Red Hat Linux 6.2, this revision includes packages which remove\nthis restriction.\
  \  Packages for Red Hat Linux 7, 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3 have not\nbeen modified."
