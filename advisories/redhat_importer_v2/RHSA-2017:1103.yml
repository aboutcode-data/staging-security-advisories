  - CVE-2017-5461
summary: |
  An update for nss is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.9 Long Life.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to support the cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server applications.

  Security Fix(es):

  * An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the way NSS performed certain Base64-decoding operations. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially crafted certificate which, when parsed by NSS, could cause it to crash or execute arbitrary code, using the permissions of the user running an application compiled against the NSS library. (CVE-2017-5461)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Ronald Crane as the original reporter.
