  - CVE-2008-1105
summary: |
  Updated samba packages that fix a security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 4.5 Extended Update Support.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Samba is a suite of programs used by machines to share files, printers, and
  other information.

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Samba clients handle
  over-sized packets. If a client connected to a malicious Samba server, it
  was possible to execute arbitrary code as the Samba client user. It was
  also possible for a remote user to send a specially crafted print request
  to a Samba server that could result in the server executing the vulnerable
  client code, resulting in arbitrary code execution with the permissions of
  the Samba server. (CVE-2008-1105)

  Red Hat would like to thank Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research for
  responsibly disclosing this issue.

  Users of Samba are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to resolve this issue.
