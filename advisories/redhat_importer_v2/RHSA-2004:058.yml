summary: |
  Updated mod_python packages that fix a denial of service vulnerability are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

  mod_python embeds the Python language interpreter within the Apache httpd
  server.

  A bug has been found in mod_python versions 2.7.10 and earlier that can
  lead to a denial of service vulnerability.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0973 to
  this issue.

  Although Red Hat Enterprise Linux shipped with a version of mod_python that
  contains this bug, our testing was unable to trigger the denial of service
  vulnerability.  However, mod_python users are advised to upgrade to these
  errata packages, which contain a backported patch that corrects this bug.
