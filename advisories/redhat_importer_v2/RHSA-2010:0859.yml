summary: |
  Updated poppler packages that fix three security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Poppler is a Portable Document Format (PDF) rendering library, used by
  applications such as Evince.

  Two uninitialized pointer use flaws were discovered in poppler. An attacker
  could create a malicious PDF file that, when opened, would cause
  applications that use poppler (such as Evince) to crash or, potentially,
  execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-3702, CVE-2010-3703)

  An array index error was found in the way poppler parsed PostScript Type 1
  fonts embedded in PDF documents. An attacker could create a malicious PDF
  file that, when opened, would cause applications that use poppler (such as
  Evince) to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-3704)

  Users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues.
