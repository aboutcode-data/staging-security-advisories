  - CVE-2012-1182
summary: |
  Updated samba packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Extended Life Cycle Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Samba is an open-source implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) or
  Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol, which allows PC-compatible
  machines to share files, printers, and other information.

  A flaw in the Samba suite's Perl-based DCE/RPC IDL (PIDL) compiler, used
  to generate code to handle RPC calls, resulted in multiple buffer overflows
  in Samba. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could send a specially-crafted
  RPC request that would cause the Samba daemon (smbd) to crash or, possibly,
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the root user.
  (CVE-2012-1182)

  Users of Samba are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to resolve this issue. After installing this
  update, the smb service will be restarted automatically.
