summary: |
  An updated sudo package that fixes two security issues, several bugs, and
  adds two enhancements is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The sudo (superuser do) utility allows system administrators to give
  certain users the ability to run commands as root.

  A flaw was found in the way sudo handled time stamp files. An attacker able
  to run code as a local user and with the ability to control the system
  clock could possibly gain additional privileges by running commands that
  the victim user was allowed to run via sudo, without knowing the victim's
  password. (CVE-2013-1775)

  It was found that sudo did not properly validate the controlling terminal
  device when the tty_tickets option was enabled in the /etc/sudoers file.
  An attacker able to run code as a local user could possibly gain additional
  privileges by running commands that the victim user was allowed to run via
  sudo, without knowing the victim's password. (CVE-2013-2776, CVE-2013-2777)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, sudo did not support netgroup filtering for sources from the
  System Security Services Daemon (SSSD). Consequently, SSSD rules were
  applied to all users even when they did not belong to the specified
  netgroup. With this update, netgroup filtering for SSSD sources has been
  implemented. As a result, rules with a netgroup specification are applied
  only to users that are part of the netgroup. (BZ#880150)

  * When the sudo utility set up the environment in which it ran a command,
  it reset the value of the RLIMIT_NPROC resource limit to the parent's value
  of this limit if both the soft (current) and hard (maximum) values of
  RLIMIT_NPROC were not limited. An upstream patch has been provided to
  address this bug and RLIMIT_NPROC can now be set to "unlimited".
  (BZ#947276)

  * Due to the refactoring of the sudo code by upstream, the SUDO_USER
  variable that stores the name of the user running the sudo command was not
  logged to the /var/log/secure file as before. Consequently, user name
  "root" was always recorded instead of the real user name. With this update,
  the previous behavior of sudo has been restored. As a result, the expected
  user name is now written to /var/log/secure. (BZ#973228)

  * Due to an error in a loop condition in sudo's rule listing code, a buffer
  overflow could have occurred in certain cases. This condition has been
  fixed and the buffer overflow no longer occurs. (BZ#994626)

  In addition, this update adds the following enhancements:

  * With this update, sudo has been modified to send debug messages about
  netgroup matching to the debug log. These messages should provide better
  understanding of how sudo matches netgroup database records with values
  from the running system and what the values are exactly. (BZ#848111)

  * With this update, sudo has been modified to accept the ipa_hostname value
  from the /etc/sssd/sssd.conf configuration file when matching netgroups.
  (BZ#853542)

  All sudo users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains backported patches to correct these issues and add
  these enhancements.
