summary: |
  An updated ca-certificates package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact.

  This package contains the set of CA certificates chosen by the Mozilla
  Foundation for use with the Internet Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).

  It was found that a subordinate Certificate Authority (CA) mis-issued an
  intermediate certificate, which could be used to conduct man-in-the-middle
  attacks. This update renders that particular intermediate certificate as
  untrusted. (BZ#1038894)

  All users should upgrade to this updated package. After installing the
  update, all applications using the ca-certificates package must be
  restarted for the changes to take effect.
