  - CVE-2014-5356
summary: |
  Updated openstack-glance packages that fix one security issue and two bugs
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  OpenStack Image service (glance) provides discovery, registration, and
  delivery services for disk and server images. It provides the ability to
  copy or snapshot a server image, and immediately store it away. Stored
  images can be used as a template to get new servers up and running quickly
  and more consistently than installing a server operating system and
  individually configuring additional services.

  It was discovered that the image_size_cap configuration option in glance
  was not honored. An authenticated user could use this flaw to upload an
  image to glance and consume all available storage space, resulting in a
  denial of service. (CVE-2014-5356)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Uploading an image to glance that exceeded the user's current quota
  setting was rejected, but no message was added to the glance API log to
  indicate this. This update fixes this bug, and such events are now logged
  as INFO messages in the glance API log. (BZ#1055550)

  * Whenever the 'x-image-meta-store' header was passed to glance-api, the
  service would check whether the value was a valid store instead of a valid
  scheme. However, the rest of the store library uses the scheme to identify
  the store that should be used; this prevented the use of this feature.
  Glance now verifies that the value of 'x-image-meta-store' is a valid
  scheme instead of a valid store name. (BZ#1130622)

  All openstack-glance users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues.
