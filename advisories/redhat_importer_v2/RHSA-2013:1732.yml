  - CVE-2013-1813
summary: |
  Updated busybox packages that fix one security issue and several bugs are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  BusyBox provides a single binary that includes versions of a large number
  of system commands, including a shell. This can be very useful for
  recovering from certain types of system failures, particularly those
  involving broken shared libraries.

  It was found that the mdev BusyBox utility could create certain directories
  within /dev with world-writable permissions. A local unprivileged user
  could use this flaw to manipulate portions of the /dev directory tree.
  (CVE-2013-1813)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, due to a too eager string size optimization on the IBM System
  z architecture, the "wc" BusyBox command failed after processing standard
  input with the following error:

      wc: : No such file or directory

  This bug was fixed by disabling the string size optimization and the "wc"
  command works properly on IBM System z architectures. (BZ#820097)

  * Prior to this update, the "mknod" command was unable to create device
  nodes with a major or minor number larger than 255. Consequently, the kdump
  utility failed to handle such a device. The underlying source code has been
  modified, and it is now possible to use the "mknod" command to create
  device nodes with a major or minor number larger than 255. (BZ#859817)

  * If a network installation from an NFS server was selected, the "mount"
  command used the UDP protocol by default. If only TCP mounts were supported
  by the server, this led to a failure of the mount command. As a result,
  Anaconda could not continue with the installation. This bug is now fixed
  and NFS mount operations default to the TCP protocol. (BZ#855832)

  All busybox users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
