summary: |
  An updated foreman-proxy package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 3.0 and 4.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Critical
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The foreman-proxy package provides a RESTful API to manage DNS, DHCP, TFTP,
  and Puppet settings, and can be used as part of Foreman.

  A shell command injection flaw was found in the way foreman-proxy verified
  URLs in the TFTP module. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute
  arbitrary shell commands on the system with the privileges of the user
  running foreman-proxy. (CVE-2014-0007)

  This issue was discovered by Lukas Zapletal of Red Hat.

  Note that for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 3.0, Foreman was
  released as a Technology Preview. More information about Red Hat Technology
  Previews is available at

  All foreman-proxy users are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
  which corrects this issue.
