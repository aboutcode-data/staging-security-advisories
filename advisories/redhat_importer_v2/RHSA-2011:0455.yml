  - CVE-2011-1485
summary: |
  Updated polkit packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  PolicyKit is a toolkit for defining and handling authorizations.

  A race condition flaw was found in the PolicyKit pkexec utility and polkitd
  daemon. A local user could use this flaw to appear as a privileged user to
  pkexec, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands as root by running
  those commands with pkexec. (CVE-2011-1485)

  Red Hat would like to thank Neel Mehta of Google for reporting this issue.

  All polkit users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct this issue. The system must be rebooted for
  this update to take effect.
