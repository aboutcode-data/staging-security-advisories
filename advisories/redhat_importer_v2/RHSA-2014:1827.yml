summary: |
  Updated kdenetwork packages that fix three security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The kdenetwork packages contain networking applications for the K Desktop
  Environment (KDE). Krfb Desktop Sharing, which is a part of the kdenetwork
  package, is a server application that allows session sharing between users.
  Krfb uses the LibVNCServer library.

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way LibVNCServer handled
  certain ClientCutText message. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  crash the VNC server by sending a specially crafted ClientCutText message
  from a VNC client. (CVE-2014-6053)

  A divide-by-zero flaw was found in the way LibVNCServer handled the scaling
  factor when it was set to "0". A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  crash the VNC server using a malicious VNC client. (CVE-2014-6054)

  Two stack-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way LibVNCServer
  handled file transfers. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the
  VNC server using a malicious VNC client. (CVE-2014-6055)

  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting these issues. oCERT
  acknowledges Nicolas Ruff as the original reporter.

  Note: Prior to this update, the kdenetwork packages used an embedded copy
  of the LibVNCServer library. With this update, the kdenetwork packages have
  been modified to use the system LibVNCServer packages. Therefore, the
  update provided by RHSA-2014:1826 must be installed to fully address the
  issues in krfb described above.

  All kdenetwork users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues. All running
  instances of the krfb server must be restarted for this update to take
  effect.
