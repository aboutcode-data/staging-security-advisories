  issues are addressed in this release:

  It was found that Apache Camel's XML converter performed XML External
  Entity (XXE) expansion. A remote attacker able to submit an SAXSource
  containing an XXE declaration could use this flaw to read files accessible
  to the user running the application server, and potentially perform other
  more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2015-0263)

  It was found that Apache Camel performed XML External Entity (XXE)
  expansion when evaluating invalid XML Strings or invalid XML GenericFile
  objects. A remote attacker able to submit a crafted XML message could use

  server, and potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks.
  (CVE-2015-0264)
