  - CVE-2013-2186
summary: |
  An updated jakarta-commons-fileupload package that fixes one security issue
  is now available for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 1.0.2 for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The Apache Commons FileUpload component can be used to add a file upload
  capability to your applications.

  A flaw was found in the way the DiskFileItem class handled NULL characters
  in file names. A remote attacker able to supply a serialized instance of
  the DiskFileItem class, which will be deserialized on a server, could use
  this flaw to write arbitrary content to any location on the server that is
  accessible to the user running the application server process.
  (CVE-2013-2186)

  Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing Red Hat
  JBoss Enterprise Web Server installation (including all applications and
  configuration files).

  5 and 6 are advised to upgrade to this updated package. The JBoss server
  process must be restarted for the update to take effect.
