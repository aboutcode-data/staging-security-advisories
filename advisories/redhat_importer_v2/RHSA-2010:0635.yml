summary: |
  The Red Hat High Performance Computing (HPC) Solution version 5.5 for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5, or RHHPC 5.5, is now available, fixing multiple
  security issues, multiple bugs, and adding several enhancements.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The Red Hat HPC Solution is a low-cost, end-to-end software stack for high
  performance computing. It provides all the tools needed to deploy, run, and
  manage an HPC cluster in one easy-to-install package. It is designed to
  power departmental clusters running industry-standard x86 64-bit hardware.

  This update introduces the Red Hat HPC Solution version 5.5 for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 5.5, RHHPC 5.5. (BZ#599419)

  RHHPC 5.5 changes include:

  * add-on kits updated according to the new upstream released version.

  * many bug fixes for PCM, and enhancements for image/diskless provisioning.

  The Cacti RRD graphing tool was updated to version 0.8.7g, fixing multiple
  security flaws:

  Multiple SQL injection flaws were discovered in Cacti. An unauthenticated,
  or authenticated user with certain administrative privileges, could use
  these flaws to execute arbitrary SQL queries. (CVE-2010-2092,
  CVE-2010-1431)

  Multiple command injection flaws were discovered in Cacti. An authenticated
  user with certain administrative privileges could use these flaws to
  execute arbitrary commands on the Cacti server with the privileges of the
  web server user. (CVE-2010-1645)

  Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were discovered in Cacti. An
  unauthenticated, or authenticated user with certain administrative
  privileges, could perform an XSS attack against victims viewing Cacti web
  pages. (CVE-2009-4032, CVE-2010-1644, CVE-2010-2544, CVE-2010-2545)

  Users wanting to run the Red Hat HPC Solution on Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  5.5 should install these packages.
