summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works 6.0.0 roll up patch 1, which fixes
  multiple security issues and various bugs, is now available from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works is the next-generation ESB and business
  process automation infrastructure. Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works allows
  IT to leverage existing (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and
  future (EDA and CEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve
  business process execution speed and quality.

  This roll up patch serves as a cumulative upgrade for Red Hat JBoss Fuse
  Service Works 6.0.0. It includes various bug fixes, which are listed in the
  README file included with the patch files.

  The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

  It was found that the Apache Camel XSLT component allowed XSL stylesheets
  to call external Java methods. A remote attacker able to submit messages to
  a Camel route could use this flaw to perform arbitrary remote code
  execution in the context of the Camel server process. (CVE-2014-0003)

  It was found that when JBoss Web processed a series of HTTP requests in
  which at least one request contained either multiple content-length
  headers, or one content-length header with a chunked transfer-encoding
  header, JBoss Web would incorrectly handle the request. A remote attacker
  could use this flaw to poison a web cache, perform cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attacks, or obtain sensitive information from other requests.
  (CVE-2013-4286)

  It was found that the Apache Camel XSLT component would resolve entities in
  XML messages when transforming them using an XSLT route. A remote attacker
  able to submit messages to an XSLT Camel route could use this flaw to read
  files accessible to the user running the application server and,
  potentially, perform other more advanced XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.
  (CVE-2014-0002)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way Apache Commons FileUpload,
  which is embedded in the JBoss Web component of JBoss EAP, handled
  small-sized buffers used by MultipartStream. A remote attacker could use
  this flaw to create a malformed Content-Type header for a multipart
  request, causing JBoss Web to enter an infinite loop when processing such
  an incoming request. (CVE-2014-0050)

  The CVE-2014-0002 and CVE-2014-0003 issues were discovered by David Jorm of
  the Red Hat Security Response Team.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works 6.0.0 as provided from the
  Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this roll up patch.
