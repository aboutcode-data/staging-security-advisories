summary: "These updated kernel packages address security vulnerabilites, including a\npotential\
  \ data corruption scenario.  In addition, a number of drivers have\nbeen updated, bugs have\
  \ been resolved, and support for the IBM x450 platform\nand the Madison processor have been\
  \ added.\n\nThe Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.\n\nA ptrace-related\
  \ vulnerability has been discovered that could allow a local\nuser to gain elevated (root)\
  \ privileges without authorization.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has assigned the name\nCAN-2003-0127 to this issue.\n\nA flaw has been discovered that could\
  \ potentially lead to data corruption.\n The scenario only occurs while performing memory\
  \ mapped file I/O, where\nthe file is simultaneously unlinked and the corresponding file blocks\n\
  reallocated.  Furthermore, the memory mapped must be to a partial page at\nthe end of a file\
  \ on an ext3 file system.  As such, Red Hat considers this\nscenario unlikely.\n\nA flaw has\
  \ been found in several hash table implementations in the kernel\nnetworking code. A remote\
  \ attacker could send packets with carefully\nchosen, forged source addresses in such a way\
  \ as to make every routing\ncache entry get hashed into the same hash chain. The result would\
  \ be that\nthe kernel would use a disproportionate amount of processor time to deal\nwith\
  \ new packets, resulting in a remote denial of service attack. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2003-0244 to this issue.\n\
  \nIn addition, the following drivers have been updated to the version indicated:\n\n- e1000:\
  \ 4.4.19-k1\n- e100: 2.1.29-k2\n- ips: 6.00.26\n- qla2100, qla2200, qla2300: v6.04.01\n- tg3\
  \ driver to 1.4c\n- cciss driver to 2.4.44\n- mpt fusion: 2.05.00\n- aic7xxx to 6.2.32\n-\
  \ aic79xx to 1.3.6\n\nIf the system is configured to use alternate drivers, we recommend applying\n\
  the kudzu errata RHEA-2003:132 prior to updating the kernel.\n\nThe updated kernel also adds\
  \ support for the IBM x450 platform and the\nMadison processor, and incorporates improved\
  \ support for the hugetlb file\nsystem.  This file system makes efficient use of the large\
  \ page size\nsupport that the Itanium architecture provides.   \n\nAll users should upgrade\
  \ to these errata packages, which address these issues."
