  - CVE-2009-0034
summary: |
  An updated sudo package to fix a security issue is now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The sudo (superuser do) utility allows system administrators to give
  certain users the ability to run commands as root with logging.

  A flaw was discovered in a way sudo handled group specifications in "run
  as" lists in the sudoers configuration file. If sudo configuration allowed
  a user to run commands as any user of some group and the user was also a
  member of that group, sudo incorrectly allowed them to run defined commands
  with the privileges of any system user. This gave the user unintended
  privileges. (CVE-2009-0034)

  Users of sudo should update to this updated package, which contains a
  backported patch to resolve this issue.
