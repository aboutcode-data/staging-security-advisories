summary: "Updated Apache and mod_ssl packages which fix a number of security issues\nare now\
  \ available for iSeries and pSeries systems.\n\nThe Apache HTTP Web Server is a secure, efficient,\
  \ and extensible web\nserver.  This erratum provides updated Apache and mod_ssl packages for\n\
  iSeries and pSeries that correct a number of security issues:\n\nVersions of the Apache Web\
  \ server up to and including 1.3.24 contain a bug\nin the routines which deal with requests\
  \ using \"chunked\" encoding.\nA carefully crafted invalid request can cause an Apache child\
  \ process to\ncall the memcpy() function in a way that will write past the end of its\nbuffer,\
  \ corrupting the stack. On some platforms this can be remotely\nexploited -- allowing arbitrary\
  \ code to be run on the server. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has assigned the name\nCAN-2002-0392 to this issue.\n\nBuffer overflows in the ApacheBench\
  \ support program (ab.c) in Apache\nversions prior to 1.3.27, and Apache versions 2.x prior\
  \ to 2.0.43, allow a\nmalicious Web server to cause a denial of service (DoS) and possibly\n\
  execute arbitrary code via a long response. (CAN-2002-0843)\n\nTwo cross-site scripting (XSS)\
  \ vulnerabilities are present in the error\npages for the default \"404 Not Found\" error\
  \ and for the error response\nwhen a plain HTTP request is received on an SSL port. Both of\
  \ these issues\nare only exploitable if the \"UseCanonicalName\" setting has been changed\
  \ to\n\"Off\" and wildcard DNS is in use. These issues could allow remote\nattackers to execute\
  \ scripts as other webpage visitors, for instance, to\nsteal cookies. These issues affect\
  \ versions of Apache 1.3 before 1.3.26,\nversions of Apache 2.0 before 2.0.43, and versions\
  \ of mod_ssl before\n2.8.12. (CAN-2002-0840, CAN-2002-1157)\n\nThe mod_ssl module provides\
  \ strong cryptography for the Apache Web\nserver via the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport\
  \ Layer Security\n(TLS) protocols. Versions of mod_ssl prior to 2.8.10 are subject to a\n\
  single NULL overflow that can cause arbitrary code execution.  (CAN-2002-0653)\n\nThe shared\
  \ memory scoreboard in the HTTP daemon for Apache 1.3, prior to\nversion 1.3.27, allows a\
  \ user running as the \"apache\" UID to send a\nSIGUSR1 signal to any process as root, resulting\
  \ in a denial of service\n(process kill) or other such behavior that would not normally be\
  \ allowed. \n(CAN-2002-0839). \n\nAfter the updated packages are installed, restart the httpd\
  \ service by\nrunning the following command:\n\n/sbin/service httpd restart"
