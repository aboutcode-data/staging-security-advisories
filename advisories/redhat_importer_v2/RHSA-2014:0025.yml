  - CVE-2013-6443
summary: |
  Updated cfme packages that fix one security issue, several bugs, and add
  various enhancements are now available for Red Hat CloudForms 3.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine delivers the insight, control, and
  automation enterprises need to address the challenges of managing virtual
  environments, which are far more complex than physical ones. This
  technology enables enterprises with existing virtual infrastructures
  to improve visibility and control, and those just starting virtualization
  deployments to build and operate a well-managed virtual infrastructure.

  It was found that sending a GET request for a destructive action could
  bypass the Ruby on Rails protect_from_forgery mechanism. A remote attacker
  could use this flaw to perform Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks
  against CloudForms applications. (CVE-2013-6443)

  This issue was discovered by Martin Povolný of Red Hat.

  This update fixes several bugs and adds multiple enhancements.
  Documentation for these changes will be available shortly from the Red Hat
  CloudForms 3.0 Management Engine 5.2 Technical Notes linked to in the
  References section.

  All users of Red Hat CloudForms are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues and add
  these enhancements.
