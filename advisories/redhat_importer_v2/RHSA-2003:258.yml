summary: "Updated GDM packages are available which correct a bug allowing local users\nto read\
  \ any text files on the system, and a denial of service issue if\nXDMCP is enabled.\n\nGDM\
  \ is the GNOME Display Manager for X.\n\nVersions of GDM prior to 2.4.1.6 contain a bug where\
  \ GDM will run as root\nwhen examining the ~/.xsession-errors file when using the \"examine\
  \ session\nerrors\" feature, allowing local users the ability to read any text file\non the\
  \ system by creating a symlink. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has assigned the name CAN-2003-0547 to\nthis issue.\n\nRed Hat Linux 8.0 and 9 are vulnerable\
  \ to this issue. Versions of GDM in\nearlier releases did not have the \"examine session errors\"\
  \ feature and\ntherefore are not vulnerable to this issue. \n\nAlso addressed by these erratum\
  \ packages are two problems in the X Display\nManager Control Protocol (XDMCP) which allow\
  \ a denial of service attack\n(DoS) by crashing the gdm daemon. The Common Vulnerabilities\
  \ and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CAN-2003-0548 and\nCAN-2003-0549\
  \ to these issues.\n\nThis attack is only possible if XDMCP is enabled. XDMCP is not enabled\
  \ by\ndefault in Red Hat Linux distributions, and as documented XDMCP should only\never be\
  \ run on trusted networks.\n\nUsers of GDM are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages\
  \ which disable\nthe \"examine session errors\" feature and contain backported security fixes\n\
  for the XDMCP issues."
