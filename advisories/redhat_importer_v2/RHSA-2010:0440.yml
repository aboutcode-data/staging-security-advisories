summary: |
  An updated rhev-hypervisor package that fixes two security issues and
  several bugs is now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  (RHEV) Hypervisor ISO disk image. The RHEV Hypervisor is a dedicated
  Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes everything
  necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Agent.

  Note: RHEV Hypervisor is only available for the Intel 64 and AMD64
  architectures with virtualization extensions.

  It was discovered that OpenSSL did not always check the return value of
  the bn_wexpand() function. An attacker able to trigger a memory allocation
  failure in that function could cause an application using the OpenSSL
  library to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2009-3245)

  A flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure
  Sockets Layer) protocols handled session renegotiation. A man-in-the-middle
  attacker could use this flaw to prefix arbitrary plain text to a client's
  session (for example, an HTTPS connection to a website). This could force
  the server to process an attacker's request as if authenticated using the
  victim's credentials. This update addresses this flaw in openssl, nss, and
  gnutls by implementing the TLS Renegotiation Indication Extension, as
  defined in RFC 5746. (CVE-2009-3555)

  This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
  security issues; however, these issues have no security impact for RHEV
  Hypervisor. These fixes are for kernel issues CVE-2009-4307, CVE-2010-0727,
  CVE-2009-4027, and CVE-2010-1188; cpio issues CVE-2010-0624 and
  CVE-2007-4476; gnutls issue CVE-2009-2409; openssl issue CVE-2010-0433; and
  tar issues CVE-2010-0624 and CVE-2007-4476.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * bridged network interfaces using the bnx2x, mlx4_en, enic and s2io
  drivers had Large Receive Offload (LRO) enabled by default. This caused
  significantly degraded network I/O performance. LRO has been disabled for
  all network interface drivers which have LRO enabled by default in Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 5. With this change, network I/O performance is
  significantly improved. (BZ#576374, BZ#579730)

  * RHEV Hypervisor supported IPv6, but as this is not used to communicate
  with the RHEV Manager, it is superfluous. Support for IPv6 has now been
  disabled in RHEV Hypervisor. (BZ#577300)

  * for VLAN interfaces, the hardware (MAC) address of the interface was set
  only in the VLAN ifcfg script, not in the physical interface ifcfg script.
  This caused network interfaces with VLAN tags to intermittently fail on
  boot. The MAC address is now set in the ifcfg script for the underlying
  physical interface. Network interfaces with VLAN tags now work consistently
  between reboots. (BZ#581876)

  * the hypervisor would hang on reboot after repeated upgrade operations,
  due to GRUB accessing the /boot file system before it was flushed. The
  /boot file system is now remounted before GRUB accesses it. (BZ#591111)

  As RHEV Hypervisor is based on KVM, the bug fixes from the KVM update
  RHBA-2010:0434 have been included in this update. Also included are the bug
  fixes from the RHEV Manager Agent (VDSM) update RHBA-2010:0435.

  Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
  upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.
