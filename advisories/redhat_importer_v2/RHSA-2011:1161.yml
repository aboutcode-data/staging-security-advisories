  - CVE-2011-2895
summary: |
  Updated freetype packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  FreeType is a free, high-quality, portable font engine that can open and
  manage font files. It also loads, hints, and renders individual glyphs
  efficiently. These packages provide both the FreeType 1 and FreeType 2 font
  engines.

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the FreeType library handled
  malformed font files compressed using UNIX compress. If a user loaded a
  specially-crafted compressed font file with an application linked against
  FreeType, it could cause the application to crash or, possibly, execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.
  (CVE-2011-2895)

  Note: This issue only affects the FreeType 2 font engine.

  Users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue. The X server must be restarted (log
  out, then log back in) for this update to take effect.
