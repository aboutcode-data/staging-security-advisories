  - CVE-2010-1675
summary: |
  Updated quagga packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Quagga is a TCP/IP based routing software suite. The Quagga bgpd daemon
  implements the BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) routing protocol.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way the Quagga bgpd daemon
  processed certain route metrics information. A BGP message with a
  specially-crafted path limit attribute would cause the bgpd daemon to reset
  its session with the peer through which this message was received.
  (CVE-2010-1675)

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the Quagga bgpd daemon
  processed malformed route extended communities attributes. A configured BGP
  peer could crash bgpd on a target system via a specially-crafted BGP
  message. (CVE-2010-1674)

  Users of quagga should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the bgpd daemon must be restarted for the update to take effect.
