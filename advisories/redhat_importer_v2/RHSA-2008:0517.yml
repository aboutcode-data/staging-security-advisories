  - CVE-2008-1108
summary: |
  Updated evolution packages that address a buffer overflow vulnerability are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.5 Extended Update Support.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Evolution is the integrated collection of e-mail, calendaring, contact
  management, communications and personal information management (PIM) tools
  for the GNOME desktop environment.

  A flaw was found in the way Evolution parsed iCalendar timezone attachment
  data. If mail which included a carefully crafted iCalendar attachment was
  opened, arbitrary code could be executed as the user running Evolution.
  (CVE-2008-1108)

  Red Hat would like to thank Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research for
  responsibly disclosing this issue.

  All users of Evolution should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contains a backported patch which resolves this issue.
