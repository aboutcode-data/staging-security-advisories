  - CVE-2015-3183
summary: |
  Updated httpd and httpd22 packages that fix two security issues are now
  available for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  5, 6, and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which
  give detailed severity ratings, are available from the CVE links in the
  References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set of
  components for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the Apache
  HTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat Connector
  (mod_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod_cluster), Hibernate, and the Tomcat
  Native library.

  Multiple flaws were found in the way httpd parsed HTTP requests and
  responses using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could use
  these flaws to create a specially crafted request, which httpd would decode
  differently from an HTTP proxy software in front of it, possibly leading to
  HTTP request smuggling attacks. (CVE-2015-3183)

  A flaw was found in the way httpd handled HTTP Trailer headers when
  processing requests using chunked encoding. A malicious client could use
  Trailer headers to set additional HTTP headers after header processing was
  performed by other modules. This could, for example, lead to a bypass of
  header restrictions defined with mod_headers. (CVE-2013-5704)

  Users of httpd or httpd22 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing
  the updated packages, the httpd or httpd22 service must be restarted
  manually for this update to take effect.
