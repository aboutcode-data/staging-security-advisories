  - CVE-2013-4326
summary: |
  An updated rtkit package that fixes one security issue is now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  RealtimeKit is a D-Bus system service that changes the scheduling policy of
  user processes/threads to SCHED_RR (that is, realtime scheduling mode) on
  request. It is intended to be used as a secure mechanism to allow real-time
  scheduling to be used by normal user processes.

  It was found that RealtimeKit communicated with PolicyKit for authorization
  using a D-Bus API that is vulnerable to a race condition. This could have
  led to intended PolicyKit authorizations being bypassed. This update
  modifies RealtimeKit to communicate with PolicyKit via a different API that
  is not vulnerable to the race condition. (CVE-2013-4326)

  All rtkit users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a backported patch to correct this issue.
