  Updated firefox packages that fix a security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser.

  An invalid free flaw was found in Firefox's plugin handler. Malicious web content could result in an invalid memory pointer being freed, causing Firefox to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2010-2755)

  All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a backported patch that corrects this issue. After installing the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
