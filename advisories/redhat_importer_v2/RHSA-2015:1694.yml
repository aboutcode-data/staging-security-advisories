  - CVE-2015-4491
summary: |
  Updated gdk-pixbuf2 packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  gdk-pixbuf is an image loading library that can be extended by loadable
  modules for new image formats. It is used by toolkits such as GTK+ or
  clutter.

  An integer overflow, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was found in
  the way gdk-pixbuf, an image loading library for GNOME, scaled certain
  bitmap format images. An attacker could use a specially crafted BMP image
  file that, when processed by an application compiled against the gdk-pixbuf
  library, would cause that application to crash or execute arbitrary code
  with the permissions of the user running the application. (CVE-2015-4491)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Gustavo Grieco as the original reporter.

  All gdk-pixbuf2 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
