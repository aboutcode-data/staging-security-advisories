summary: "JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.3.1, which fixes multiple security issues,\nvarious\
  \ bugs, and adds enhancements, is now available from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal.\n\nThe\
  \ Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having\nimportant security impact.\
  \ Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings,\
  \ are available for each\nvulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.\n\n\
  This release of JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.3.1 serves as a replacement\nfor JBoss Enterprise\
  \ SOA Platform 5.3.0. It includes various bug fixes and\nenhancements which are detailed in\
  \ the JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.3.1\nRelease Notes. The Release Notes will be available\
  \ shortly from\nhttps://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/\n\nSecurity:\n\nJBoss Web Services\
  \ leaked side-channel data when distributing symmetric\nkeys (for XML encryption), allowing\
  \ a remote attacker to recover the entire\nplain text form of a symmetric key. (CVE-2011-2487)\n\
  \nSpring framework could possibly evaluate Expression Language (EL)\nexpressions twice, allowing\
  \ a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in\nthe context of the application server, or\
  \ to obtain sensitive information\nfrom the server. (CVE-2011-2730)\n\nNote: Manual action\
  \ is required to apply the fix for CVE-2011-2730. If your\nsystem has deployed applications\
  \ which use Spring framework, the context\nparameter \"springJspExpressionSupport\" must be\
  \ set to \"false\" to mitigate\nthis flaw, for example, in the application's web.xml file.\
  \ This will\nprevent the double-evaluation of EL expressions that led to this flaw.\n\nAn\
  \ XSS flaw allowed a remote attacker to perform an XSS attack against\nvictims using the JMX\
  \ Console. (CVE-2011-4575)\n\nSecurityAssociation.getCredential() returned the previous credential\
  \ if\nno security context was provided. Depending on the deployed applications,\nthis could\
  \ possibly allow a remote attacker to hijack the credentials of a\npreviously-authenticated\
  \ user. (CVE-2012-3370)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the implementation of associative\n\
  arrays (hashes) in JRuby. An attacker able to supply a large number of\ninputs to a JRuby\
  \ application (such as HTTP POST request parameters sent to\na web application) that are used\
  \ as keys when inserting data into an array\ncould trigger multiple hash function collisions,\
  \ making array operations\ntake an excessive amount of CPU time. To mitigate this issue, the\
  \ Murmur\nhash function has been replaced with the Perl hash function.\n(CVE-2012-5370)\n\n\
  Note: JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform only provides JRuby as a dependency of\nthe scripting_chain\
  \ quickstart example application. The CVE-2012-5370 flaw\nis not exposed unless the version\
  \ of JRuby shipped with that quickstart is\nused by a deployed, custom application.\n\nConfiguring\
  \ the JMX Invoker to restrict access to users with specific\nroles did not actually restrict\
  \ access, allowing remote attackers with\nvalid JMX Invoker credentials to perform JMX operations\
  \ accessible to\nroles they are not a member of. (CVE-2012-5478)\n\ntwiddle.sh accepted credentials\
  \ as command line arguments, allowing local\nusers to view them via a process listing. (CVE-2009-5066)\n\
  \nNonManagedConnectionFactory logged the username and password in plain text\nwhen an exception\
  \ was thrown. This could lead to the exposure of\nauthentication credentials if local users\
  \ had permissions to read the log\nfile. (CVE-2012-0034)\n\nThe JMXInvokerHAServlet and EJBInvokerHAServlet\
  \ invoker servlets allow\nunauthenticated access by default in some profiles. The security\n\
  interceptor's second layer of authentication prevented direct exploitation\nof this flaw.\
  \ If the interceptor was misconfigured or inadvertently\ndisabled, this flaw could lead to\
  \ arbitrary code execution in the context\nof the user running the JBoss server. (CVE-2012-0874)\n\
  \nCallerIdentityLoginModule retained the password from the previous call if a\nnull password\
  \ was provided. In non-default configurations this could\npossibly lead to a remote attacker\
  \ hijacking a previously-authenticated\nuser's session. (CVE-2012-3369)\n\nRed Hat would like\
  \ to thank Juraj Somorovsky of Ruhr-University Bochum\nfor reporting CVE-2011-2487, and Tyler\
  \ Krpata for reporting CVE-2011-4575.\nThe CVE-2012-3370 and CVE-2012-3369 issues were discovered\
  \ by Carlo de Wolf\nof Red Hat; CVE-2012-5478 was discovered by Derek Horton of Red Hat; and\
  \ \nCVE-2012-0874 was discovered by David Jorm of the Red Hat Security Response\nTeam.\n\n\
  Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss Enterprise\nSOA Platform\
  \ installation (including its databases, applications,\nconfiguration files, and so on).\n\
  \nAll users of JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.3.0 as provided from the Red\nHat Customer\
  \ Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform\n5.3.1."
