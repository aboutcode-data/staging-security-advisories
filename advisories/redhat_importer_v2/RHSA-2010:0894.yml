  - CVE-2010-4171
summary: |
  Updated systemtap packages that fix two security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  SystemTap is an instrumentation system for systems running the Linux
  kernel, version 2.6. Developers can write scripts to collect data on the
  operation of the system. staprun, the SystemTap runtime tool, is used for
  managing SystemTap kernel modules (for example, loading them).

  It was discovered that staprun did not properly sanitize the environment
  before executing the modprobe command to load an additional kernel module.
  A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to escalate their
  privileges. (CVE-2010-4170)

  It was discovered that staprun did not check if the module to be unloaded
  was previously loaded by SystemTap. A local, unprivileged user could use
  this flaw to unload an arbitrary kernel module that was not in use.
  (CVE-2010-4171)

  Note: After installing this update, users already in the stapdev group must
  be added to the stapusr group in order to be able to run the staprun tool.

  Red Hat would like to thank Tavis Ormandy for reporting these issues.

  SystemTap users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues.
