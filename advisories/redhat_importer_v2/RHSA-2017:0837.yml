summary: |
  An update for icoutils is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The icoutils are a set of programs for extracting and converting images in Microsoft Windows icon and cursor files. These files usually have the extension .ico or .cur, but they can also be embedded in executables or libraries.

  Security Fix(es):

  * Multiple vulnerabilities were found in icoutils, in the wrestool program. An attacker could create a crafted executable that, when read by wrestool, could result in memory corruption leading to a crash or potential code execution. (CVE-2017-5208, CVE-2017-5333, CVE-2017-6009)

  * A vulnerability was found in icoutils, in the wrestool program. An attacker could create a crafted executable that, when read by wrestool, could result in failure to allocate memory or an over-large memcpy operation, leading to a crash. (CVE-2017-5332)

  * Multiple vulnerabilities were found in icoutils, in the icotool program. An attacker could create a crafted ICO or CUR file that, when read by icotool, could result in memory corruption leading to a crash or potential code execution. (CVE-2017-6010, CVE-2017-6011)
