  - CVE-2010-2059
summary: |
  Updated rpm packages that fix one security issue and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The RPM Package Manager (RPM) is a command line driven package management
  system capable of installing, uninstalling, verifying, querying, and
  updating software packages.

  It was discovered that RPM did not remove setuid and setgid bits set on
  binaries when upgrading packages. A local attacker able to create hard
  links to binaries could use this flaw to keep those binaries on the system,
  at a specific version level and with the setuid or setgid bit set, even if
  the package providing them was upgraded by a system administrator. This
  could have security implications if a package was upgraded because of a
  security flaw in a setuid or setgid program. (CVE-2010-2059)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * A memory leak in the communication between RPM and the Security-Enhanced
  Linux (SELinux) subsystem, which could have caused extensive memory
  consumption. In reported cases, this issue was triggered by running
  rhn_check when errata were scheduled to be applied. (BZ#627630)

  All users of rpm are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
