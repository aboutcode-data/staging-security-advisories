aliases:
  - CVE-2004-0594
  - CVE-2004-0595
summary: |
  Updated php packages that fix various security issues are now available.

  PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
  HTTP server.

  Stefan Esser discovered a flaw when memory_limit configuration setting  is
  enabled in versions of PHP 4 before 4.3.8.  If a remote attacker could
  force the PHP interpreter to allocate more memory than the memory_limit
  setting before script execution begins, then the attacker may be
  able to supply the contents of a PHP hash table remotely.  This hash table
  could then be used to execute arbitrary code as the 'apache' user.  The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
  the name CAN-2004-0594 to this issue.

  This issue may be exploitable if using the default PHP configuration with
  the "register_globals" setting of "On".  The Apache memory exhaustion bug,
  fixed in a previous update to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, may also allow
  this PHP issue to be exploited; this Apache bug does not affect Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 2.1.

  Stefan Esser discovered a flaw in the strip_tags function in versions of
  PHP before 4.3.8. The strip_tags function is commonly used by PHP scripts
  to prevent Cross-Site-Scripting attacks by removing HTML tags from
  user-supplied form data. By embedding NUL bytes into form data, HTML tags
  can in some cases be passed intact through the strip_tags function, which
  may allow a Cross-Site-Scripting attack. The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0595 to
  this issue.

  All users of PHP are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches that address these issues.
