summary: |
  Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces 3.25.0 has been released.

  Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces provides a cloud developer workspace server and a browser-based IDE built for teams and organizations. Dev Spaces runs in OpenShift and is well-suited for container-based development.
  The 3.25 release is based on Eclipse Che 7.111 and uses the DevWorkspace engine to provide support for workspaces based on devfile v2.1 and v2.2.
  Users still using the v1 standard should migrate as soon as possible.

  Dev Spaces supports OpenShift EUS releases v4.16 and higher. Users are expected to update to supported OpenShift releases in order to continue to get Dev Spaces updates.
