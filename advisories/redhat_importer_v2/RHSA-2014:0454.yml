summary: |
  An update for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2.2 that
  fixes one security issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java
  applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  It was found that the secure processing feature of Xalan-Java had
  insufficient restrictions defined for certain properties and features.
  A remote attacker able to provide Extensible Stylesheet Language
  Transformations (XSLT) content to be processed by an application using
  Xalan-Java could use this flaw to bypass the intended constraints of the
  secure processing feature. Depending on the components available in the
  classpath, this could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the
  context of the application server running the application that uses
  Xalan-Java. (CVE-2014-0107)

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2.2 as
  provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
  The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.
