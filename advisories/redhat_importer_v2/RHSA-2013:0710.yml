summary: |
  Updated puppet packages that fix several security issues are now available
  for Red Hat OpenStack Folsom.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Puppet allows provisioning, patching, and configuration of clients to be
  managed and automated.

  A flaw was found in how Puppet handled certain HTTP PUT requests. An
  attacker with valid authentication credentials, and authorized to save to
  the authenticated client's own report, could construct a malicious request
  that could possibly cause the Puppet master to execute arbitrary code.
  (CVE-2013-2274)

  A flaw was found in how Puppet handled the "template" and "inline_template"
  functions during catalog compilation. If an authenticated attacker were to
  requests its catalog from the Puppet master, it could possibly result in
  arbitrary code execution when the catalog is compiled. (CVE-2013-1640)

  A flaw was found in how Puppet handled certain HTTP GET requests. An
  attacker with valid authentication credentials could construct a request to
  retrieve catalogs from the Puppet master that they are not authorized to
  access. (CVE-2013-1652)

  It was found that the default /etc/puppet/auth.conf configuration file
  allowed an authenticated node to submit a report for any other node, which
  could breach compliance requirements. (CVE-2013-2275)

  It was found that the /var/log/puppet directory was created world-readable.
  This could allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the
  Puppet log files. (CVE-2012-6120)

  It was found that Puppet allowed the use of the SSLv2 protocol. A Puppet
  agent could use this to negotiate the use of the weak SSLv2 protocol for
  its connection to a Puppet master. (CVE-2013-1654)

  Red Hat would like to thank Puppet Labs for reporting CVE-2013-1640,
  CVE-2013-1652, CVE-2013-1654, CVE-2013-2274, and CVE-2013-2275.

  Note: In most default configurations these issues are not directly
  exploitable unless the attacker has access to the underlying OpenStack
  infrastructure (e.g. shell access to a Nova compute node).

  Users of Red Hat OpenStack Folsom are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which upgrade Puppet to version 2.6.18 and correct these issues.
