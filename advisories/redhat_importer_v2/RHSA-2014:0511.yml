summary: |
  An update for Red Hat JBoss Operations Network 3.2.1, which fixes two
  security issues, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Operations Network is a middleware management solution that
  provides a single point of control to deploy, manage, and monitor JBoss
  Enterprise Middleware, applications, and services.

  Apache Struts is a framework for building web applications with Java.

  It was found that the Struts 1 ActionForm object allowed access to the
  'class' parameter, which is directly mapped to the getClass() method. A
  remote attacker could use this flaw to manipulate the ClassLoader used by
  an application server running Struts 1. This could lead to remote code
  execution under certain conditions. (CVE-2014-0114)

  It was found that when JBoss Web processed a series of HTTP requests in
  which at least one request contained either multiple content-length
  headers, or one content-length header with a chunked transfer-encoding
  header, JBoss Web would incorrectly handle the request. A remote attacker
  could use this flaw to poison a web cache, perform cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attacks, or obtain sensitive information from other requests.
  (CVE-2013-4286)

  All users of JBoss Operations Network 3.2.1 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
