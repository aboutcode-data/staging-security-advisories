summary: |
  Updated python27 collection packages that fix multiple security issues and
  several bugs are now available as part of Red Hat Software Collections 2.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language
  that supports modules, classes, exceptions, high-level dynamic data types,
  and dynamic typing. The python27 collection provide a stable release of
  Python 2.7 with a number of additional utilities and database connectors
  for MySQL and PostgreSQL.

  The python27-python packages have been upgraded to upstream version 2.7.8,
  which provides numerous bug fixes over the previous version. (BZ#1167912)

  The following security issues were fixed in the python27-python component:

  It was discovered that the socket.recvfrom_into() function failed to check
  the size of the supplied buffer. This could lead to a buffer overflow when
  the function was called with an insufficiently sized buffer.
  (CVE-2014-1912)

  It was discovered that the Python xmlrpclib module did not restrict the
  size of gzip-compressed HTTP responses. A malicious XMLRPC server could
  cause an XMLRPC client using xmlrpclib to consume an excessive amount of
  memory. (CVE-2013-1753)

  It was discovered that multiple Python standard library modules
  implementing network protocols (such as httplib or smtplib) failed to
  restrict the sizes of server responses. A malicious server could cause a
  client using one of the affected modules to consume an excessive amount of
  memory. (CVE-2013-1752)

  It was discovered that the CGIHTTPServer module incorrectly handled URL
  encoded paths. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute scripts
  outside of the cgi-bin directory, or disclose the source code of the
  scripts in the cgi-bin directory. (CVE-2014-4650)

  An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the buffer() function handled
  its offset and size arguments. An attacker able to control these arguments
  could use this flaw to disclose portions of the application memory or cause
  it to crash. (CVE-2014-7185)

  The following security issue was fixed in the python27-python and
  python27-python-simplejson components:

  A flaw was found in the way the json module handled negative index
  arguments passed to certain functions (such as raw_decode()). An attacker
  able to control the index value passed to one of the affected functions
  could possibly use this flaw to disclose portions of the application
  memory. (CVE-2014-4616)

  In addition, this update adds the following enhancement:

  * The python27 Software Collection now includes the python-wheel and
  python-pip modules. (BZ#994189, BZ#1167902)

  All python27 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues and add these enhancements. All running python27
  instances must be restarted for this update to take effect.
