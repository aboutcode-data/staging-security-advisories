summary: |
  An updated Adobe Flash Player package that fixes three security issues is
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 Supplementary.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The flash-plugin package contains a Mozilla Firefox compatible Adobe Flash
  Player web browser plug-in.

  This update fixes multiple vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player. These
  vulnerabilities are detailed in the Adobe Security Bulletin APSB14-17,
  listed in the References section.

  Multiple flaws were found in the way flash-plugin displayed certain SWF
  content. An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially crafted
  SWF file that would cause flash-plugin to crash or, potentially, execute
  arbitrary code when the victim loaded a page containing the malicious SWF
  content. (CVE-2014-0537, CVE-2014-0539)

  This update also fixes a flaw that would lead to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  (CSRF) attacks. (CVE-2014-4671)

  All users of Adobe Flash Player should install this updated package, which
  upgrades Flash Player to version 11.2.202.394.
