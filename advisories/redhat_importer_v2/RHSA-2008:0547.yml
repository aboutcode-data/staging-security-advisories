summary: |
  Updated seamonkey packages that fix a security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 4.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  SeaMonkey is an open source Web browser, advanced email and newsgroup
  client, IRC chat client, and HTML editor.

  Multiple flaws were found in the processing of malformed JavaScript
  content. A web page containing such malicious content could cause SeaMonkey
  to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running
  SeaMonkey. (CVE-2008-2801, CVE-2008-2802, CVE-2008-2803)

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running SeaMonkey.
  (CVE-2008-2798, CVE-2008-2799, CVE-2008-2811)

  Several flaws were found in the way malformed web content was displayed. A
  web page containing specially-crafted content could potentially trick a
  SeaMonkey user into surrendering sensitive information. (CVE-2008-2800)

  Two local file disclosure flaws were found in SeaMonkey. A web page
  containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to reveal the contents
  of a local file to a remote attacker. (CVE-2008-2805, CVE-2008-2810)

  A flaw was found in the way a malformed .properties file was processed by
  SeaMonkey. A malicious extension could read uninitialized memory, possibly
  leaking sensitive data to the extension. (CVE-2008-2807)

  A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey escaped a listing of local file
  names. If a user could be tricked into listing a local directory containing
  malicious file names, arbitrary JavaScript could be run with the
  permissions of the user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2008-2808)

  A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey displayed information about
  self-signed certificates. It was possible for a self-signed certificate to
  contain multiple alternate name entries, which were not all displayed to
  the user, allowing them to mistakenly extend trust to an unknown site.
  (CVE-2008-2809)

  All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to resolve these issues.
