summary: |
  This is the final notification for the retirement of Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 3 Extended Life Cycle Support (ELS). This notice applies only to
  those customers subscribed in the Customer Portal to the Extended Life
  Cycle Support (ELS) channel for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

  In accordance with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Errata Support Policy,
  Extended Life Cycle Support (ELS) for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 was
  retired on January 30, 2014, and support is no longer provided.
  Accordingly, Red Hat will no longer provide updated packages, including
  critical impact security patches or urgent priority bug fixes, for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 3 ELS after January 30, 2014. In addition, technical
  support through Red Hat's Global Support Services will no longer be
  provided after this date.

  In order to provide customers with a final opportunity to migrate their
  systems to a supported version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the retirement
  process for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 ELS will complete on March 31, 2014.
  On that date, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 ELS channels will be moved to
  the "Retired" channels area (under the "Retired" tab) on the Customer
  Portal, and customers will be unsubscribed from the Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 3 Extended Life Cycle Support channels.

  For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 only, customers may continue to run Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 3 ELS on their systems without consuming a subscription.
  However, customers wishing to access Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 ELS
  content (now under the "Retired" tab) on the Customer Portal will need an
  active RHEL Server subscription. Also, customers who choose to resubscribe
  a system to the retired Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 ELS channels will
  consume a RHEL Server subscription. Note again that the contents of
  Retired channels are frozen, and no further security patches or bug fixes
  are provided.

  We encourage customers to plan their migration from Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 3 to a more recent version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. As a benefit
  of the Red Hat subscription model, customers can use active subscriptions
  to entitle any system on a currently supported Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  release.
