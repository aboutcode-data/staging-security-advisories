summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's futex subsystem handled
  reference counting when requeuing futexes during futex_wait(). A local,
  unprivileged user could use this flaw to zero out the reference counter of
  an inode or an mm struct that backs up the memory area of the futex, which
  could lead to a use-after-free flaw, resulting in a system crash or,
  potentially, privilege escalation. (CVE-2014-0205, Important)

  * A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's
  networking implementation handled logging while processing certain invalid
  packets coming in via a VxLAN interface. A remote attacker could use this
  flaw to crash the system by sending a specially crafted packet to such an
  interface. (CVE-2014-3535, Important)

  * An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's
  system call auditing implementation. On a system with existing audit rules
  defined, a local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to leak kernel
  memory to user space or, potentially, crash the system. (CVE-2014-3917,
  Moderate)

  * An integer underflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Stream
  Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation processed certain
  COOKIE_ECHO packets. By sending a specially crafted SCTP packet, a remote
  attacker could use this flaw to prevent legitimate connections to a
  particular SCTP server socket to be made. (CVE-2014-4667, Moderate)

  Red Hat would like to thank Gopal Reddy Kodudula of Nokia Siemens Networks
  for reporting CVE-2014-4667. The security impact of the CVE-2014-0205 issue
  was discovered by Mateusz Guzik of Red Hat.

  This update also fixes several bugs. Documentation for these changes will
  be available shortly from the Technical Notes document linked to in the
  References section.

  All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
  rebooted for this update to take effect.
