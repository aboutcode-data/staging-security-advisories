  - CVE-2006-5750
summary: "An updated jbossas package that corrects a security vulnerability is now\navailable\
  \ for Red Hat Application Stack.\n\nThis update has been rated as having critical security\
  \ impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nJBoss Application Server is a J2EE certified\
  \ platform for developing and\ndeploying enterprise Java applications, Web applications, and\
  \ Portals.\n\nSymantec discovered a flaw in the DeploymentFileRepository class of the\nJBoss\
  \ Application Server. A remote attacker who is able to access the\nconsole manager could read\
  \ or write to files with the permissions of the\nJBoss user. This could potentially lead to\
  \ arbitrary code execution as the\njboss user. (CVE-2006-5750)\n\nFor the Red Hat Application\
  \ Stack, the jbossas service is not enabled by\ndefault. Once the jbossas service is enabled,\
  \ the console manager will\nbecome accessible on port 8080. Although port 8080 will be blocked\
  \ from\noutside access by the default Red Hat Enterprise Linux firewall rules,\nusers should\
  \ ensure that the console is not available publicly and is\nadequately protected by authentication\
  \ as explained in the JBoss\ndocumentation. A correct configuration of the JBoss Application\
  \ Server\nwould mitigate this vulnerability to only being exploitable by users who\nhave authorization\
  \ to use the console manager.\n\nAll users of Red Hat Application Stack are advised to upgrade\
  \ to these\nupdated packages, which resolve the directory traversal issue with a\nbackported\
  \ patch.\n\nThese updated packages also contain a change to the default jbossas\nconfiguration\
  \ file.  For users installing Red Hat Application Stack for the\nfirst time, all JBoss Application\
  \ Server network services, including the\nmanagement consoles, will be restricted by default\
  \ to localhost.  No change\nis made for users upgrading previously installed jbossas packages.\
  \  \n\nUsers who already have Red Hat Application Stack installed should check to\nmake sure\
  \ that they have correctly followed the security guidelines and\nthat the management consoles\
  \ are not accessible to unauthorized users.  \n\nRed Hat would like to thank Symantec for\
  \ reporting this issue."
