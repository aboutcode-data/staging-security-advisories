  - CVE-2009-1169
summary: |
  Updated seamonkey packages that fix two security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, and 4.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  SeaMonkey is an open source Web browser, email and newsgroup client, IRC
  chat client, and HTML editor.

  A memory corruption flaw was discovered in the way SeaMonkey handles XML
  files containing an XSLT transform. A remote attacker could use this flaw
  to crash SeaMonkey or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user
  running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2009-1169)

  A flaw was discovered in the way SeaMonkey handles certain XUL garbage
  collection events. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash SeaMonkey
  or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running SeaMonkey.
  (CVE-2009-1044)

  All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
  these issues. After installing the update, SeaMonkey must be restarted for
  the changes to take effect.
