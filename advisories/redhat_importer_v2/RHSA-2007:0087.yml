summary: |
  Updated ekiga packages that fix security issues are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Ekiga is a tool to communicate with video and audio over the Internet.

  Format string flaws were found in the way Ekiga processes certain messages.
  If a user is running Ekiga, a remote attacker who can connect to Ekiga
  could trigger this flaw and potentially execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user. (CVE-2007-0999, CVE-2007-1006)

  Users of Ekiga should upgrade to these updated packages which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue.
