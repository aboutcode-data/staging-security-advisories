  - CVE-2002-1160
summary: "Updated PAM packages are now available.  These packages correct a bug in\npam_xauth's\
  \ handling of authorization data for the root user.\n\n[Updated 12 March 2003]\nAdded packages\
  \ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES and Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux WS\n\nThe pam_xauth module\
  \ is used to forward xauth information from user to user\nin applications such as the su command.\n\
  \nAndreas Beck discovered that pam_xauth will forward authorization\ninformation from the\
  \ root account to unprivileged users.  This could be\nused by a local attacker to gain access\
  \ to an administrator's X session. \nTo exploit this vulnerability the attacker would have\
  \ to get the\nadministrator, as root, to use su to access the account belonging to the\nattacker.\
  \ \n\nUsers of pam_xauth are advised to upgrade to these errata packages which\ncontain a\
  \ patch which adds ACL (access control list) functionality to\npam_xauth and disallows root\
  \ forwarding by default. \n\nThanks to Andreas Beck for reporting this issue."
