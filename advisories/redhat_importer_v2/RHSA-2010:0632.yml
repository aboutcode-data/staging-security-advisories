  - CVE-2010-2792
summary: |
  An updated qspice-client package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) is a
  remote display protocol used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux for viewing
  virtualized guests running on the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM)
  hypervisor, or on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor.

  The qspice-client package provides the client side of the SPICE protocol.

  A race condition was found in the way the SPICE Mozilla Firefox plug-in and
  the SPICE client communicated. A local attacker could use this flaw to
  trick the plug-in and the SPICE client into communicating over an
  attacker-controlled socket, possibly gaining access to authentication
  details, or resulting in a man-in-the-middle attack on the SPICE
  connection. (CVE-2010-2792)

  Users of qspice-client should upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a backported patch to correct this issue.
