  - CVE-2015-5306
summary: |
  Updated openstack-ironic-discoverd packages that fix one security issue are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  OpenStack Bare Metal (ironic) is a tool used to provision bare metal
  (as opposed to virtual) machines. It leverages common technologies such
  as PXE boot and IPMI to cover a wide range of hardware. It also supports
  pluggable drivers to allow added, vendor-specific functionality.

  It was discovered that enabling debug mode in openstack-ironic-discoverd
  also enabled debug mode in the underlying Flask framework. If errors were
  encountered while Flask was in debug mode, a user experiencing an error
  might be able to access the debug console (effectively, a command shell).
  (CVE-2015-5306)

  Please note that this package is a Technology Preview and should not be
  used in production.

  All openstack-ironic-discoverd users are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages, which correct this issue.
