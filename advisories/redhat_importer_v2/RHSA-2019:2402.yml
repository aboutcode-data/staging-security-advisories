aliases:
  - CVE-2018-16864
  - CVE-2018-16865
summary: |
  An update for systemd is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Advanced Update Support, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Telco Extended Update Support, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Update Services for SAP Solutions.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The systemd packages contain systemd, a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with the SysV and LSB init scripts. It provides aggressive parallelism capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, and keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups. In addition, it supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can also work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit.

  Security Fix(es):

  * systemd: stack overflow when calling syslog from a command with long cmdline (CVE-2018-16864)

  * systemd: stack overflow when receiving many journald entries (CVE-2018-16865)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.
