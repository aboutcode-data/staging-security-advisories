  - CVE-2006-5170
summary: |
  Updated nss_ldap packages that fix a security flaw are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red Hat
  Security Response Team.

  nss_ldap is a set of C library extensions that allow X.500 and LDAP
  directory servers to be used as primary sources for aliases, ethers,
  groups, hosts, networks, protocols, users, RPCs, services, and shadow
  passwords.

  A flaw was found in the way nss_ldap handled a PasswordPolicyResponse
  control sent by an LDAP server. If an LDAP server responded to an
  authentication request with a PasswordPolicyResponse control, it was
  possible for an application using nss_ldap to improperly authenticate
  certain users. (CVE-2006-5170)

  This flaw was only exploitable within applications which did not properly
  process nss_ldap error messages. Only xscreensaver is currently known to
  exhibit this behavior.

  All users of nss_ldap should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch that resolves this issue.
