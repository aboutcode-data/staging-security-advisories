summary: |
  JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.2.1, which fixes two security issues
  and various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform is the open source implementation of the
  Java EE suite of services and Portal services running atop JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform. It comprises a set of offerings for enterprise
  customers who are looking for pre-configured profiles of JBoss Enterprise
  Middleware components that have been tested and certified together to
  provide an integrated experience.

  This release of JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.2.1 serves as a
  replacement for JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.2.0, and includes bug
  fixes. Refer to the JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.2.1 Release Notes
  for information on the most significant of these changes. The Release Notes
  will be available shortly from
  https://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/index.html

  The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

  It was found that RESTEasy was vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE)
  attacks. If a remote attacker submitted a request containing an external
  XML entity to a RESTEasy endpoint, the entity would be resolved, allowing
  the attacker to read files accessible to the user running the application
  server. This flaw affected DOM (Document Object Model) Document and JAXB
  (Java Architecture for XML Binding) input. (CVE-2012-0818)

  It was found that the Attribute Exchange (AX) extension of OpenID4Java was
  not checking to ensure attributes were signed. If AX was being used to
  receive information that an application only trusts the identity provider
  to assert, a remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct
  man-in-the-middle attacks and compromise the integrity of the information
  via a specially-crafted request. By default, only the JBoss Seam openid
  example application uses OpenID4Java. (CVE-2011-4314)

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up all applications deployed on
  JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform, along with all customized configuration
  files.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.2.0 as provided from the
  Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Enterprise Portal
  Platform 5.2.1.
