summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss Fuse and A-MQ 6.0.0 R1 P3 (Patch 3 on Rollup Patch 1), which
  addresses three security issues and contains several bug fixes, is now
  available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.0.0 is an integration platform based on Apache
  ServiceMix. Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.0.0, based on Apache ActiveMQ, is a
  standards compliant messaging system that is tailored for use in mission
  critical applications.

  This patch is an update to Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.0.0 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ
  6.0.0. It includes bug fixes, which are documented in the readme file
  included with the patch files.

  The following security issues are fixed with this release:

  It was found that XStream could deserialize arbitrary user-supplied XML
  content, representing objects of any type. A remote attacker able to pass
  XML to XStream could use this flaw to perform a variety of attacks,
  including remote code execution in the context of the server running the
  XStream application. (CVE-2013-7285)

  It was found that the Apache Camel XSLT component allowed XSL stylesheets
  to call external Java methods. A remote attacker able to submit messages to
  a Camel route could use this flaw to perform arbitrary remote code
  execution in the context of the Camel server process. (CVE-2014-0003)

  It was found that the Apache Camel XSLT component would resolve entities in
  XML messages when transforming them using an XSLT route. A remote attacker
  able to submit messages to an XSLT Camel route could use this flaw to read
  files accessible to the user running the application server and,
  potentially, perform other more advanced XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.
  (CVE-2014-0002)

  The CVE-2014-0003 and CVE-2014-0002 issues were discovered by David Jorm of
  the Red Hat Security Response Team.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.0.0 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.0.0 as
  provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this patch.
