summary: |
  Updated openssl packages that fix multiple security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Storage 2.1.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL),
  Transport Layer Security (TLS), and Datagram Transport Layer Security
  (DTLS) protocols, as well as a full-strength, general purpose cryptography
  library.

  A race condition was found in the way OpenSSL handled ServerHello messages
  with an included Supported EC Point Format extension. A malicious server
  could possibly use this flaw to cause a multi-threaded TLS/SSL client using
  OpenSSL to write into freed memory, causing the client to crash or execute
  arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-3509)

  It was discovered that the OBJ_obj2txt() function could fail to properly
  NUL-terminate its output. This could possibly cause an application using
  OpenSSL functions to format fields of X.509 certificates to disclose
  portions of its memory. (CVE-2014-3508)

  A flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled fragmented handshake packets.
  A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to force a TLS/SSL server
  using OpenSSL to use TLS 1.0, even if both the client and the server
  supported newer protocol versions. (CVE-2014-3511)

  Multiple flaws were discovered in the way OpenSSL handled DTLS packets.
  A remote attacker could use these flaws to cause a DTLS server or client
  using OpenSSL to crash or use excessive amounts of memory. (CVE-2014-3505,
  CVE-2014-3506, CVE-2014-3507)

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way OpenSSL performed a
  handshake when using the anonymous Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange. A
  malicious server could cause a DTLS client using OpenSSL to crash if that
  client had anonymous DH cipher suites enabled. (CVE-2014-3510)

  All OpenSSL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. For the update to take
  effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted or the
  system rebooted.
