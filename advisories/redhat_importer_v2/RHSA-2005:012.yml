  - CVE-2004-0971
  - CVE-2004-1189
summary: "Updated Kerberos (krb5) packages that correct buffer overflow and temporary\nfile\
  \ bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\nKerberos is a networked authentication\
  \ system that uses a trusted third\nparty (a KDC) to authenticate clients and servers to each\
  \ other.\n\nA heap based buffer overflow bug was found in the administration library of\n\
  Kerberos 1.3.5 and earlier.  This bug could allow an authenticated remote\nattacker to execute\
  \ arbitrary commands on a realm's master Kerberos KDC. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\
  \ project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-1189 to this issue.\n\nAdditionally\
  \ a temporary file bug was found in the Kerberos krb5-send-pr\nprogram.  It is possible that\
  \ an attacker could create a temporary file\nthat would allow an arbitrary file to be overwritten\
  \ which the victim has\nwrite access to.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n\
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0971 to this issue.\n\nAll users of krb5 should\
  \ upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported security patches to resolve\
  \ these issues."
