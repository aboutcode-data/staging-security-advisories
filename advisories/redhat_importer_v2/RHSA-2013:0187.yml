summary: |
  JBoss Operations Network 3.1.2, which fixes one security issue and several
  bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  JBoss Operations Network (JBoss ON) is a middleware management solution
  that provides a single point of control to deploy, manage, and monitor
  JBoss Enterprise Middleware, applications, and services.

  This JBoss ON 3.1.2 release serves as a replacement for JBoss ON 3.1.1, and
  includes several bug fixes. Refer to the JBoss ON 3.1.2 Release Notes for
  information on the most significant of these changes. The Release Notes
  will be available shortly from https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/

  The following security issue is also fixed with this release:

  A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in Google Web Toolkit (GWT), a
  core part of the JBoss ON web interface. If a remote attacker could trick a
  user, who was logged into the JBoss ON web interface, into visiting a
  specially-crafted URL, it could possibly lead to arbitrary web script
  execution in the context of the user's JBoss ON session. (CVE-2012-5920)

  Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss ON
  installation (including its databases, applications, configuration files,
  the JBoss ON server's file system directory, and so on).

  All users of JBoss Operations Network 3.1.1 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Operations Network 3.1.2.
