  - CVE-2012-3571
summary: |
  Updated dhcp packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol that allows
  individual devices on an IP network to get their own network configuration
  information, including an IP address, a subnet mask, and a broadcast
  address.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way the dhcpd daemon handled
  zero-length client identifiers. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  send a specially-crafted request to dhcpd, possibly causing it to enter an
  infinite loop and consume an excessive amount of CPU time. (CVE-2012-3571)

  Upstream acknowledges Markus Hietava of the Codenomicon CROSS project as
  the original reporter of this issue.

  Users of DHCP should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue. After installing this update, all
  DHCP servers will be restarted automatically.
