summary: |
  An updated sqlite package that fixes three security issues is now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  SQLite is a C library that implements an SQL database engine. A large
  subset of SQL92 is supported. A complete database is stored in a single
  disk file. The API is designed for convenience and ease of use.
  Applications that link against SQLite can enjoy the power and flexibility
  of an SQL database without the administrative hassles of supporting a
  separate database server.

  A flaw was found in the way SQLite handled dequoting of collation-sequence
  names. A local attacker could submit a specially crafted COLLATE statement
  that would crash the SQLite process, or have other unspecified impacts.
  (CVE-2015-3414)

  It was found that SQLite's sqlite3VdbeExec() function did not properly
  implement comparison operators. A local attacker could submit a specially
  crafted CHECK statement that would crash the SQLite process, or have other
  unspecified impacts. (CVE-2015-3415)

  It was found that SQLite's sqlite3VXPrintf() function did not properly
  handle precision and width values during floating-point conversions.
  A local attacker could submit a specially crafted SELECT statement that
  would crash the SQLite process, or have other unspecified impacts.
  (CVE-2015-3416)

  All sqlite users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains backported patches to correct these issues.
