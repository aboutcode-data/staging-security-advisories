  - CVE-2013-2219
summary: |
  Updated redhat-ds-base packages that fix one security issue and several
  bugs are now available for Red Hat Directory Server 8.2.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Red Hat Directory Server is an LDAPv3 compliant server. The base packages
  include the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server and
  command-line utilities for server administration.

  It was discovered that Red Hat Directory Server did not honor defined
  attribute access controls when evaluating search filter expressions. A
  remote attacker (with permission to query the Directory Server) could use
  this flaw to determine the values of restricted attributes via a series of
  search queries with filter conditions that used restricted attributes.
  (CVE-2013-2219)

  This issue was discovered by Ludwig Krispenz of Red Hat.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Prior to this update, the replication of the schema failed because of the
  attribute "unhashed#user#password," which had an invalid name. When this
  problem happened, the error logs recorded the message "Schema
  replication update failed: Invalid syntax." This update allows this
  attribute's name and the replication of the schema. (BZ#970934)

  * Prior to this update, under high load of incoming connections and due to
  a race condition, a connection which was not yet fully initialized could
  start being polled. This would lead to a crash. This update ensures that
  the connection is fully initialized before being in the polling set.
  (BZ#954051)

  * Prior to this update, if some requested attributes were skipped during a
  search (for example, because of an ACI), the returned attribute names and
  values could be shifted. This update removes attributes that are not
  authorized from the requested attributes set, so that the returned
  attributes/values are not shifted. (BZ#922773)

  * Prior to this update, when an attribute was configured to be encrypted,
  online import failed to store it in an encrypted way. This update allows
  encryption, on the consumer side, during an online import. (BZ#893178)

  * Prior to this update, updating the redhat-ds-base package resulted in the
  "/etc/dirsrv/slapd-[instance]/certmap.conf" file being overwritten with the
  default template. With this update, upgrading the redhat-ds-base package no
  longer causes "/etc/dirsrv/slapd-[instance]/certmap.conf" to be overwritten
  if the file already exists, preventing users from losing their custom
  changes. (BZ#919154)

  All users of Red Hat Directory Server 8.2 are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages, which fix these issues.
