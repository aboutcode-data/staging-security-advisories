summary: |
  Updated acroread packages that fix several security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  [Updated 23 Jan 2007]
  The previous acroread packages were missing dependencies on the new
  libraries which could prevent acroread from starting.  Replacement acroread
  packages have been added to this erratum to correct this issue.

  The Adobe Reader allows users to view and print documents in portable
  document format (PDF).

  A cross site scripting flaw was found in the way the Adobe Reader Plugin
  processes certain malformed URLs. A malicious web page could inject
  arbitrary javascript into the browser session which could possibly lead to
  a cross site scripting attack. (CVE-2007-0045)

  Two arbitrary code execution flaws were found in the way Adobe Reader
  processes malformed document files. It may be possible to execute arbitrary
  code on a victim's machine if the victim opens a malicious PDF file.
  (CVE-2006-5857, CVE-2007-0046)

  Please note that Adobe Reader 7.0.9 requires versions of several system
  libraries that were not shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.  This
  update contains additional packages that provide the required system
  library versions for Adobe Reader.  These additional packages are only
  required by Adobe Reader and do not replace or affect any other aspects of
  a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 system.

  All users of Adobe Reader are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain Adobe Reader version 7.0.9 and additional libraries to
  correct these issues.
