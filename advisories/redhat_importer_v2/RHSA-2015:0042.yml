  - CVE-2013-2099
summary: |
  Updated cloud-init packages that fix one security issue, several bugs, and
  add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Common for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The cloud-init packages provide a set of init scripts for cloud instances.
  Cloud instances need special scripts to run during initialization to
  retrieve and install ssh keys and to let the user run various scripts.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way Python's SSL module
  implementation performed matching of certain certificate names. A remote
  attacker able to obtain a valid certificate that contained multiple
  wildcard characters could use this flaw to issue a request to validate such
  a certificate, resulting in excessive consumption of CPU. (CVE-2013-2099)

  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security.

  The cloud-init packages have been upgraded to upstream version 0.7.5, which
  provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version.
  (BZ#1111709, BZ#1119334)

  All cloud-init users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which correct these issues and add these enhancements.
