summary: |
  An update for python-defusedxml and python-pysaml2 is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8.0 (Liberty).

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The defusedxml package contains several Python-only updates for security vulnerabilities in Python's XML libraries. Defusedxml functions and classes can be used instead of the originals to protect against entity-expansion and DTD-retrieval issues.

  PySAML2 is the python implementation of SAML Version 2, containing all the functionality for building a SAML2 service provider or an identity provider, to be used in a WSGI environment.

  Security Fix(es):

  * An XML entity expansion vulnerability was found in python-pysaml2. A remote attacker could send a crafted request which would cause denial of service through resource exhaustion. (CVE-2016-10149)
