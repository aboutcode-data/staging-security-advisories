summary: "Updated nss and nspr packages that fix several bugs and add various enhancements are\
  \ now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.\n\nNetwork Security Services (NSS) is a set\
  \ of libraries designed to support cross-platform development of security-enabled client and\
  \ server applications. Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) provides platform independence for\
  \ non-GUI operating system facilities. \n\nThe nss packages have been upgraded to upstream\
  \ version 3.18.0, and the nspr packages have been upgraded to upstream version 4.10.8. The\
  \ upgraded versions provide a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous versions.\
  \ Notably, these upgrades allow users to upgrade to Mozilla Firefox 38 Extended Support Release.\
  \ (BZ#1200905, BZ#1200921)\n\nUsers of nss, nss-softokn, nss-util, and nspr are advised to\
  \ upgrade to these updated packages, which fix these bugs and add these enhancements."
