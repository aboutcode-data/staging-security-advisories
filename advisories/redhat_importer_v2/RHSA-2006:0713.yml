  - CVE-2006-4980
summary: |
  Updated Python packages are now available to correct a security issue in
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language.

  A flaw was discovered in the way that the Python repr() function handled
  UTF-32/UCS-4 strings.  If an application written in Python used the repr()
  function on untrusted data, this could lead to a denial of service or
  possibly allow the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  Python application.  (CVE-2006-4980)

  In addition, this errata fixes a regression in the SimpleXMLRPCServer
  backport for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 that was introduced with RHSA-2005:109.

  Users of Python should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue.
