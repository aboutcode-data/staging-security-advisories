  - CVE-2011-0011
summary: |
  Updated qemu-kvm packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
  Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. qemu-kvm is the user-space component
  for running virtual machines using KVM. Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is
  a remote display system.

  A flaw was found in the way the VNC "password" option was handled. Clearing
  a password disabled VNC authentication, allowing a remote user able to
  connect to the virtual machines' VNC ports to open a VNC session without
  authentication. (CVE-2011-0011)

  All users of qemu-kvm should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to resolve this issue. After installing this
  update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all virtual machines
  have shut down, start them again for this update to take effect.
