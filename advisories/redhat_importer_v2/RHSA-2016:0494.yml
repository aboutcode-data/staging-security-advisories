  - CVE-2016-0774
summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix one security issue, several bugs, and add
  one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * It was found that the fix for CVE-2015-1805 incorrectly kept buffer
  offset and buffer length in sync on a failed atomic read, potentially
  resulting in a pipe buffer state corruption. A local, unprivileged user
  could use this flaw to crash the system or leak kernel memory to user
  space. (CVE-2016-0774, Moderate)

  The security impact of this issue was discovered by Red Hat.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * In the anon_vma structure, the degree counts number of child anon_vmas
  and of VMAs which points to this anon_vma. Failure to decrement the
  parent's degree in the unlink_anon_vma() function, when its list was empty,
  previously triggered a BUG_ON() assertion. The provided patch makes sure
  the anon_vma degree is always decremented when the VMA list is empty, thus
  fixing this bug. (BZ#1318364)

  * When running Internet Protocol Security (IPSEC) on external storage
  encrypted with LUKS under a substantial load on the system, data
  corruptions could previously occur. A set of upstream patches has been
  provided, and data corruption is no longer reported in this situation.
  (BZ#1298994)

  * Due to prematurely decremented calc_load_task, the calculated load
  average was off by up to the number of CPUs in the machine. As a
  consequence, job scheduling worked improperly causing a drop in the system
  performance. This update keeps the delta of the CPU going into NO_HZ idle
  separately, and folds the pending idle delta into the global active count
  while correctly aging the averages for the idle-duration when leaving NO_HZ
  mode. Now, job scheduling works correctly, ensuring balanced CPU load.
  (BZ#1300349)

  * Due to a regression in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 kernel, the
  cgroup OOM notifier accessed a cgroup-specific internal data structure
  without a proper locking protection, which led to a kernel panic. This
  update adjusts the cgroup OOM notifier to lock internal data properly,
  thus fixing the bug. (BZ#1302763)

  * GFS2 had a rare timing window that sometimes caused it to reference an
  uninitialized variable. Consequently, a kernel panic occurred. The code has
  been changed to reference the correct value during this timing window, and
  the kernel no longer panics. (BZ#1304332)

  * Due to a race condition whereby a cache operation could be submitted
  after a cache object was killed, the kernel occasionally crashed on systems
  running the cachefilesd service. The provided patch prevents the race
  condition by adding serialization in the code that makes the object
  unavailable. As a result, all subsequent operations targetted on the object
  are rejected and the kernel no longer crashes in this scenario.
  (BZ#1308471)

  This update also adds this enhancement:

  * The lpfc driver has been updated to version 11.0.0.4. (BZ#1297838)

  All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues and add this
  enhancement. The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.
