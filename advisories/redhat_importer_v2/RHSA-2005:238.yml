  - CVE-2005-0102
summary: "Updated evolution packages that fix various bugs are now available.\n\nThis update\
  \ has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat\nSecurity Response Team.\n\n\
  Evolution is the GNOME collection of personal information management (PIM)\ntools. Evolution\
  \ includes a mailer, calendar, contact manager, and\ncommunication facility.  The tools which\
  \ make up Evolution are tightly\nintegrated with one another and act as a seamless personal\
  \ information\nmanagement tool.\n\nA bug was found in Evolution's helper program camel-lock-helper.\
  \ This\nbug could allow a local attacker to gain root privileges if\ncamel-lock-helper has\
  \ been built to execute with elevated privileges. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures\
  \ project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2005-0102 to this issue. On Red Hat Enterprise\
  \ Linux,\ncamel-lock-helper is not built to execute with elevated privileges by\ndefault.\
  \ Please note however that if users have rebuilt Evolution from the\nsource RPM, as the root\
  \ user, camel-lock-helper may be given elevated\nprivileges.\n\nAdditionally, these updated\
  \ packages address the following issues:\n\n-- If evolution ran during a GNOME session, the\
  \ evolution-wombat process \n   did not exit when the user logged out of the desktop.\n\n\
  -- For folders marked for Offline Synchronization: if a user moved a\n   message from a Local\
  \ Folder to an IMAP folder while in\n   Offline mode, the message was not present in either\
  \ folder after\n   returning to Online mode.\n \n   This update fixes this problem. Email\
  \ messages that have been lost \n   this way may still be present in the following path: \n\
  \n   ~/evolution/&lt;NAME_OF_MAIL_STORE&gt;/ \\\n   &lt;path-to-folder-via-subfolder-directories&gt;/\
  \ \\\n   &lt;temporary-uid-of-message&gt;\n\nIf this bug has affected you it may be possible\
  \ to recover data by\nexamining the contents of this directory.\n\nAll users of evolution\
  \ should upgrade to these updated packages, which\nresolve these issues."
