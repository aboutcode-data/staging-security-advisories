summary: "Updated versions of cross-platform Stronghold 4 are available to fix a\nnumber of\
  \ vulnerabilities in OpenSSL and Apache.\n\nStronghold 4 contains various open source technologies\
  \ such as OpenSSL and\nApache. A number of issues have been found in versions of these projects:\n\
  \nResearchers discovered a timing attack on RSA keys that affects OpenSSL.  \nA local or remote\
  \ attacker could use this attack to obtain the server's\nprivate key by determining factors\
  \ using timing differences on (1) the\nnumber of extra reductions during Montgomery reduction\
  \ and (2) the use of\ndifferent integer multiplication algorithms (Karatsuba and normal).\n\
  Stronghold does not enable RSA blinding by default and is, therefore,\nvulnerable to this\
  \ attack.\n\nThe SSL and TLS components for OpenSSL allow remote attackers to perform an\n\
  unauthorized RSA private key operation via a modified Bleichenbacher\nattack. This attack\
  \ (also known as the Klima-Pokorny-Rosa attack) uses a\nlarge number of SSL or TLS connections,\
  \ using PKCS #1 v1.5 padding, and\ncauses OpenSSL to leak information regarding the relationship\
  \ between\nciphertext and the associated plaintext.\n\nVersions of Apache 1.3 before 1.3.25\
  \ do not filter terminal escape\nsequences from access logs, which could make it easier for\
  \ attackers to\ninsert those sequences into terminal emulators containing vulnerabilities\n\
  related to escape sequences.\n\nThese erratum packages contain a patch provided by the OpenSSL\
  \ group that\nenables RSA blinding by default, thereby protecting against the\nKlima-Pokorny-Rosa\
  \ attack, and a patch to filter escape sequences from\nApache access logs."
