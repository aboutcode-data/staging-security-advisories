summary: "Updated file packages are available to close a buffer overflow vulnerability.\n\n\
  [Updated 16 April 2003]\nAdded packages for Red Hat Linux on IBM iSeries and pSeries systems.\n\
  \nThe file command is used to identify a particular file according to the\ntype of data contained\
  \ in the file.\n\nThe file utility before version 3.41 contains a buffer overflow\nvulnerability\
  \ in the ELF parsing routines. This vulnerability may\nallow an attacker to create a carefully\
  \ crafted binary which can allow\narbitrary code to be run if a victim runs the 'file' command\
  \ on that\nbinary.\n\nThere are other ways that an attacker may be able to take advantage\
  \ of\nthis vulnerability in the file command:\n\n-- In Red Hat Linux 6.2 and 7.0, the rhs-printfilter\
  \ package makes use\nof the file command. This would allow an attacker who has the ability\n\
  to print to execute arbitrary commands (as the user 'lp') on the print\nserver by sending\
  \ a malicious file.\n\n-- On some Red Hat Linux distributions it may also be possible to\n\
  trigger this exploit by encouraging the victim to use the 'less'\ncommand on a malicious file\
  \ which is named so that it will be\nprocessed by the 'lesspipe.sh' script.\n\nAll users are\
  \ advised to update to these erratum packages, which contain a\nbackported patch to correct\
  \ this vulnerability.  \n\nRed Hat would like to thank iDefense for disclosing this issue\
  \ and\nzen-parse for discussion of some of the implications."
