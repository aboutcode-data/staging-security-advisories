summary: |
  Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.1 is now available for download from the Customer Portal.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Red Hat Single Sign-On is a standalone server, based on the Keycloak project, that provides authentication and standards-based single sign-on capabilities for web and mobile applications.

  This release of Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.1 serves as a replacement for Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.0, and includes several bug fixes and enhancements. For further information, refer to the Release Notes linked to in the References section.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was found that keycloak did not correctly check permissions when handling service account user deletion requests sent to the REST server. An attacker with service account authentication could use this flaw to bypass normal permissions and delete users in a separate realm. (CVE-2016-8629)

  * It was found that JBoss EAP 7 Header Cache was inefficient. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service attack. (CVE-2016-9589)

  * It was found that keycloak's implementation of HMAC verification for JWS tokens uses a method that runs in non-constant time, potentially leaving the application vulnerable to timing attacks. (CVE-2017-2585)

  Red Hat would like to thank Gabriel Lavoie (Halogen Software) for reporting CVE-2016-9589 and Richard Kettelerij (Mindloops) for reporting CVE-2017-2585.
