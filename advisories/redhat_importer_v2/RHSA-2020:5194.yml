  This update fixes the following bug among others:

  * Previously, the Image Registry Operator did not generate the `httpSecret` when it was empty. This caused the `httpSecret` to not be set correctly. Now, the Operator generates the `httpSecret` and uses it for all replicas when the configuration file is created. (BZ#1895856)
