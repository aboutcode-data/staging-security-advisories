  - CVE-2001-1175
summary: |
  New util-linux packages are available that fix a problem with /bin/login's
  PAM implementation. This could, in some non-default setups, cause users to
  receive credentials of other users. It is recommended that all users
  update to the fixed packages.

  2001-10-22: Packages are now available for Red Hat Linux 7.2. Notably,
  these packages also fix the problem noted in RHSA-2001:095-04 (vipw
  incorrectly setting permissions on some files) - this bug was accidentally
  reintroduced in Red Hat Linux 7.2.

  A problem existed in /bin/login's PAM implementation; it stored the value
  of a static pwent buffer across PAM calls; when used with some PAM modules
  in non-default configuration (such as pam_limits), it would overwrite the
  buffer, causing a user to get credentials of another user.

  Thanks go to Tarhon-Onu Victor <mituc@ac.tuiasi.ro> for bringing the
  problem to our attention, and to Olaf Kirch <okir@caldera.de> for providing
  the patch.
