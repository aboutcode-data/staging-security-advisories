  - CVE-2015-3209
summary: |
  Updated kvm packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
  Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems.

  A flaw was found in the way QEMU's AMD PCnet Ethernet emulation handled
  multi-TMD packets with a length above 4096 bytes. A privileged guest user
  in a guest with an AMD PCNet ethernet card enabled could potentially use
  this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the
  hosting QEMU process. (CVE-2015-3209)

  Red Hat would like to thank Matt Tait of Google's Project Zero security
  team for reporting this issue.

  All kvm users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. Note: The procedure in
  the Solution section must be performed before this update will take effect.
