  - CVE-2013-4296
  - CVE-2013-4311
summary: |
  Updated libvirt packages that fix two security issues and several bugs are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The libvirt library is a C API for managing and interacting with the
  virtualization capabilities of Linux and other operating systems. In
  addition, libvirt provides tools for remote management of virtualized
  systems.

  libvirt invokes the PolicyKit pkcheck utility to handle authorization. A
  race condition was found in the way libvirt used this utility, allowing a
  local user to bypass intended PolicyKit authorizations or execute arbitrary
  commands with root privileges. (CVE-2013-4311)

  Note: With this update, libvirt has been rebuilt to communicate with
  PolicyKit via a different API that is not vulnerable to the race condition.
  The polkit RHSA-2013:1270 advisory must also be installed to fix the
  CVE-2013-4311 issue.

  An invalid free flaw was found in libvirtd's
  remoteDispatchDomainMemoryStats function. An attacker able to establish a
  read-only connection to libvirtd could use this flaw to crash libvirtd.
  (CVE-2013-4296)

  The CVE-2013-4296 issue was discovered by Daniel P. Berrange of Red Hat.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Prior to this update, the libvirtd daemon leaked memory in the
  virCgroupMoveTask() function. A fix has been provided which prevents
  libvirtd from incorrect management of memory allocations. (BZ#984556)

  * Previously, the libvirtd daemon was accessing one byte before the array
  in the virCgroupGetValueStr() function. This bug has been fixed and
  libvirtd now stays within the array bounds. (BZ#984561)

  * When migrating, libvirtd leaked the migration URI (Uniform Resource
  Identifier) on destination. A patch has been provided to fix this bug and
  the migration URI is now freed correctly. (BZ#984578)

  * Updating a network interface using virDomainUpdateDeviceFlags API failed
  when a boot order was set for that interface. The update failed even if the
  boot order was set in the provided device XML. The
  virDomainUpdateDeviceFlags API has been fixed to correctly parse the boot
  order specification from the provided device XML and updating network
  interfaces with boot orders now works as expected. (BZ#1003934)

  Users of libvirt are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
  updated packages, libvirtd will be restarted automatically.
