  - CVE-2014-3514
summary: |
  Updated ror40-rubygem-activerecord packages that fix one security issue are
  now available for Red Hat Software Collections 1.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Ruby on Rails is a model-view-controller (MVC) framework for web
  application development. Active Record implements object-relational mapping
  for accessing database entries using objects.

  It was discovered that Active Record's create_with method failed to
  properly check attributes passed to it. A remote attacker could possibly
  use this flaw to bypass the strong parameter protection and modify
  arbitrary model attributes via mass assignment if an application using
  Active Record called create_with with untrusted values. (CVE-2014-3514)

  All ror40-rubygem-activerecord users are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
