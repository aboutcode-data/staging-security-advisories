  - CVE-2005-1704
summary: "An updated binutils package that fixes several bugs and minor security\nissues is\
  \ now available.\n\nThis update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat\n\
  Security Response Team.\n\nBinutils is a collection of utilities used for the creation of\
  \ executable\ncode. A number of bugs were found in various binutils tools.  \n\nIf a user\
  \ is tricked into processing a specially crafted executable with\nutilities such as readelf,\
  \ size, strings, objdump, or nm, it may allow the\nexecution of arbitrary code as the user.\
  \ The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\
  \ CAN-2005-1704 to\nthis issue.\n\nIn addition, the following bugs have been fixed:\n\n--\
  \ by default issue an error if IA-64 hint@pause instruction is\n   put into the B slot, add\
  \ assembler command line switch to\n   override this behaviour\n-- fix linker's --emit-relocs\
  \ with .gnu.warning.* section symbols\n-- fix gprof on 64-bit ppc binaries and libraries\n\
  -- fix gas mapping of register names to dwarf2 register numbers\n   in CFI directives\n\n\
  All users of binutils should upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains patches to resolve\
  \ these issues."
