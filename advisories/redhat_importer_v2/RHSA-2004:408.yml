aliases:
  - CVE-2004-0700
summary: |
  An updated mod_ssl package for Apache that fixes a format string
  vulnerability is now available.

  The mod_ssl module provides strong cryptography for the Apache Web
  server via the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security
  (TLS) protocols.

  A format string issue was discovered in mod_ssl for Apache 1.3 which can be
  triggered if mod_ssl is configured to allow a client to proxy to remote SSL
  sites.  In order to exploit this issue, a user who is authorized to use
  Apache as a proxy would have to attempt to connect to a carefully crafted
  hostname via SSL.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0700 to this issue.

  Users of mod_ssl should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
  backported patch to correct this issue.
