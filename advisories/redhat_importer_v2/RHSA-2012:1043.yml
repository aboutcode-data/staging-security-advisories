  - CVE-2012-2149
summary: |
  Updated libwpd packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  libwpd is a library for reading and converting Corel WordPerfect Office
  documents.

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libwpd processed certain
  Corel WordPerfect Office documents (.wpd files). An attacker could provide
  a specially-crafted .wpd file that, when opened in an application linked
  against libwpd, such as OpenOffice.org, would cause the application to
  crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  user running the application. (CVE-2012-2149)

  All libwpd users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. All running applications
  that are linked against libwpd must be restarted for this update to take
  effect.
