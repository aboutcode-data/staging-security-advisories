summary: |
  An update for git is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Extended Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Git is a distributed revision control system with a decentralized architecture. As opposed to centralized version control systems with a client-server model, Git ensures that each working copy of a Git repository is an exact copy with complete revision history. This not only allows the user to work on and contribute to projects without the need to have permission to push the changes to their official repositories, but also makes it possible for the user to work with no network connection.

  Security Fix(es):

  * git: On multi-user machines Git users might find themselves unexpectedly in a Git worktree (CVE-2022-24765)

  * git: Bypass of safe.directory protections (CVE-2022-29187)

  * git: exposure of sensitive information to a malicious actor (CVE-2022-39253)

  * git: git shell function that splits command arguments can lead to arbitrary heap writes. (CVE-2022-39260)

  * git: data exfiltration with maliciously crafted repository (CVE-2023-22490)

  * git: git apply: a path outside the working tree can be overwritten with crafted input (CVE-2023-23946)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.
